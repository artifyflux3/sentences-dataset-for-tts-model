He has received several awards for writing and teaching on this subject.

[ 1 ] Education [ edit ] Dunham received his BS from the University of Pittsburgh in 1969, his MS from Ohio State in 1970, and his PhD from the same institution in 1974.

[ 2 ] Writings [ edit ] Dunham  won the American Association of Publishers' award for writing  the Best Mathematics Book of 1994 for his book The Mathematical Universe .

[ 1 ] In his book Euler: The Master of Us All , he examines Leonhard Euler's impressive mathematical work.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] He received a Lester R. Ford Award in 2006 for his expository article Touring the Calculus , [ 5 ] and the Chauvenet Prize in 2022 for his article The Early (and Peculiar) History of the Möbius Function .

[ 6 ] In 2007, Dunham gave a lecture about  Euler's product-sum formula and its relationship to analytic number theory , as well as discussed Euler's evaluation of a non-trivial integral at the celebration of "Year of Euler" by the Euler Society .

[ 7 ] He published a chapter "Euler and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra" in the book The Genius of Euler published in 2007 to commemorate  the 300th birthday of Euler.
