( August 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A creation myth (or creation story) is a cultural, religious or traditional myth which attempts to describe the earliest beginnings of the present world. Creation myths are the most common form of myth, usually developing first in oral traditions , and are found throughout human culture. A creation myth is usually regarded by those who subscribe to it as conveying profound truths , though not necessarily in a historical or literal sense. They are commonly, though not always, considered cosmogonical myths , that is, they describe the ordering of the cosmos from a state of chaos or amorphousness.
