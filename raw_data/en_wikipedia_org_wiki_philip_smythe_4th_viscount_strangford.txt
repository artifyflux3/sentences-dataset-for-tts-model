[ 2 ] He succeeded to the viscountcy on 8 September 1724.

[ 1 ] Career [ edit ] Ecclesiastical [ edit ] He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin .

[ 3 ] King George II appointed him Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin in 1746 but the chapter successfully argued that the Crown was not the patron, and he was dispossessed.

[ 4 ] He was successively Prebendary of Killaspugmullane in Cork Cathedral ; [ 5 ] Precentor of Elphin (1746–52); [ 6 ] Dean of Derry (1752–69); [ 7 ] and Archdeacon of Derry [ 8 ] (1769–74).

[ 9 ] [ 2 ] [ 10 ] Political [ edit ] He sat in the Irish House of Lords until 1784, when he was excluded by Act of Parliament after being tried and convicted of corruption for soliciting a bribe of £200 from the applicant in a court case that was pending before the House.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The scandal was exacerbated by the fact that it came less than two years after the Irish Lords had regained final appellate jurisdiction from the British House of Lords .

[ 13 ] Family [ edit ] In 1741 Strangford married Mary, daughter of Anthony Jephson , MP for Mallow and his second wife Hannah Rogerson. They had six children: Mary-Anne (1745–1823) and Anne-Philippa (1749–1830), both unmarried; Robert, Philip, and Frances, who all died young; and finally Lionel (1753–1801), who also took holy orders before succeeding as 5th Viscount.
