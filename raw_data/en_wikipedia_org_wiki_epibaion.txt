Epibaion is a trace fossil imprint of the Ediacaran animals of the phylum Proarticulata , which became extinct in the Precambrian. Imprints often occurring in chains, that is interpreted as a feeding trace; some chains terminate in a body fossil, allowing their maker to be identified. Several specimens are known; E. waggoneris was produced by Yorgia waggoneri ; E. costatus by Dickinsonia costata , and E. axiferus , the type species, has as yet not been found with a trace-maker. It is proposed that the Australian fossil Phyllozoon is also a feeding trace of Proarticulata.
