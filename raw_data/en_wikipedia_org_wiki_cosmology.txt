The [Hubble eXtreme Deep Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_eXtreme_Deep_Field "Hubble eXtreme Deep Field") (XDF) was completed in September 2012 and shows the farthest [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxies "Galaxies") ever photographed at that time. Except for the few stars in the foreground (which are bright and easily recognizable because only they have [diffraction spikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_spikes "Diffraction spikes")), every speck of light in the composite photo is an individual galaxy, some of them as old as 13.2 billion years; the observable universe is estimated to contain more than 2 trillion galaxies.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-1)

**Cosmology** (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")_[κόσμος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient\_Greek "wikt:κόσμος") (cosmos)_'the universe, the world' and _[λογία](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%B1#Ancient\_Greek "wikt:λογία") (logia)_'study of') is a branch of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") dealing with the [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature "Nature") of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"), the [cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos "Cosmos"). The term _cosmology_ was first used in English in 1656 in [Thomas Blount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Blount_(lexicographer) "Thomas Blount (lexicographer)")'s _Glossographia_, with the meaning of "a speaking of the world".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-2) In 1731, [German philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_philosophy "German philosophy")[Christian Wolff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Wolff_(philosopher) "Christian Wolff (philosopher)") used the term cosmology in Latin (_cosmologia_) to denote a branch of metaphysics that deals with the general nature of the physical world.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-3)[Religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_cosmology "Religious cosmology") or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [mythological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology "Mythology"), [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion "Religion"), and [esoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism "Western esotericism") literature and traditions of [creation myths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony "Cosmogony") and [eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology "Eschatology"). In the science of [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), cosmology is concerned with the study of the [chronology of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe "Chronology of the universe").

[Physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology") is the study of the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe "Observable universe")'s origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and the [ultimate fate of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe "Ultimate fate of the universe"), including the [laws of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_science "Laws of science") that govern these areas.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-4) It is investigated by scientists, including [astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer") and [physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist"), as well as [philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), such as [metaphysicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), [philosophers of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_physics "Philosophy of physics"), and [philosophers of space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_space_and_time "Philosophy of space and time"). Because of this shared scope with [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory "Theory") in physical cosmology may include both [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and non-scientific propositions and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be [tested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis"). Physical cosmology is a sub-branch of astronomy that is concerned with the universe as a whole. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") Theory which attempts to bring together [observational astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_astronomy "Observational astronomy") and [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics");[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-NYT-20190225-6) more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter") and [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy"), known as the [Lambda-CDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM "Lambda-CDM") model.

[Theoretical astrophysicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#Theoretical_astrophysics "Astrophysics")[David N. Spergel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Spergel "David Spergel") has described cosmology as a "historical science" because "when we look out in space, we look back in time" due to the finite nature of the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-7)

[Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics") have played central roles in shaping our understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. [Physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology") was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"), followed almost instantaneously by [cosmic inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation "Cosmic inflation"), an [expansion of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space "Metric expansion of space") from which the universe is thought to have emerged [13.799 ± 0.021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe "Age of the universe")[billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000,000_(number) "1,000,000,000 (number)") years ago.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-Planck_2015-8)[Cosmogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony "Cosmogony") studies the origin of the universe, and [cosmography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmography "Cosmography") maps the features of the universe.

In [Diderot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Diderot "Denis Diderot")'s _[Encyclopédie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9die "Encyclopédie")_, cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-9)

Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius "Marcus Aurelius")'s observation that a man's place in that relationship: "He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-10)

Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as "[celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics")," the study of the [heavens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere"). Greek philosophers [Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos"), [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), and [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") proposed different cosmological theories. The [geocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric "Geocentric")[Ptolemaic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_system "Ptolemaic system") was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus"), and subsequently [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") and [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei"), proposed a [heliocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric "Heliocentric") system. This is one of the most famous examples of [epistemological rupture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemological_rupture "Epistemological rupture") in physical cosmology.

[Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s _[Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophiae\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_, published in 1687, was the first description of the [law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_universal_gravitation "Law of universal gravitation"). It provided a physical mechanism for [Kepler's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws "Kepler's laws") and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [Copernican principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle "Copernican principle")—that the bodies on Earth obey the same [physical laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law") as all celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.

Modern scientific cosmology is widely considered to have begun in 1917 with [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s publication of his final modification of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") in the paper "Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity"[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-11) (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")). General relativity prompted [cosmogonists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony "Cosmogony") such as [Willem de Sitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Sitter "Willem de Sitter"), [Karl Schwarzschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schwarzschild "Karl Schwarzschild"), and [Arthur Eddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington "Arthur Eddington") to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of [astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer") to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the universe was static and unchanging. In 1922, [Alexander Friedmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Friedmann "Alexander Friedmann") introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter.

In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax – the [Great Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy) "Great Debate (astronomy)") (1917 to 1922) – with early cosmologists such as [Heber Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Curtis "Heber Curtis") and [Ernst Öpik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_%C3%96pik "Ernst Öpik") determining that some [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula") seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-12) While Heber Curtis argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes, Mount Wilson astronomer [Harlow Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley "Harlow Shapley") championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way")[star system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system "Star system") only. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the [Great Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy) "Great Debate (astronomy)") on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. [National Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences "National Academy of Sciences") in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.") The debate was resolved when [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble") detected [Cepheid Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_Variables "Cepheid Variables") in the [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy "Andromeda Galaxy") in 1923 and 1924.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-14) Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way.

Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant "Cosmological constant"), introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an [expanding universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanding_universe "Expanding universe"), depending on its value. Thus the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") model was proposed by the [Belgian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium "Belgium") priest [Georges Lemaître](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre "Georges Lemaître") in 1927[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-15) which was subsequently corroborated by [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble")'s discovery of the [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift") in 1929[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-16) and later by the discovery of the [cosmic microwave background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation "Cosmic microwave background radiation") by [Arno Penzias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Penzias "Arno Penzias") and [Robert Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Woodrow_Wilson "Robert Woodrow Wilson") in 1964.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-17) These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [alternative cosmologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_cosmology "Non-standard cosmology").

Since around 1990, several dramatic advances in [observational cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_cosmology "Observational cosmology") have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the [COBE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Background_Explorer "Cosmic Background Explorer"),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-18)[WMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAP "WMAP")[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-19) and [Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_spacecraft "Planck spacecraft") satellites,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-20) large new galaxy [redshift surveys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift_survey "Redshift survey") including [2dfGRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2dF_Galaxy_Redshift_Survey "2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey")[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-21) and [SDSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey "Sloan Digital Sky Survey"),[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-22) and observations of distant [supernovae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernovae "Supernovae") and [gravitational lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lensing "Gravitational lensing"). These observations matched the predictions of the [cosmic inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation "Cosmic inflation") theory, a modified [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") theory, and the specific version known as the [Lambda-CDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM "Lambda-CDM") model. This has led many to refer to modern times as the "golden age of cosmology".[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-23)

In 2014, the BICEP2 collaboration claimed that they had detected the imprint of [gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave "Gravitational wave") in the [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background"). However, this result was later found to be spurious: the supposed evidence of gravitational waves was in fact due to interstellar dust.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-nature-20150130-25)

On 1 December 2014, at the _Planck 2014_ meeting in [Ferrara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrara,_Italy "Ferrara, Italy"), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"), astronomers reported that the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") is [13.8 billion years old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe "Age of the universe") and composed of 4.9% [atomic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), 26.6% [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter") and 68.5% [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-NYT-20141201-DO-26)

### Religious or mythological cosmology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cosmology&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Religious or mythological cosmology")]

[Religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_cosmology "Religious cosmology") or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [mythological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology "Mythology"), [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion "Religion"), and [esoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism "Western esotericism") literature and traditions of [creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth "Creation myth") and [eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology "Eschatology"). Creation myths are found in most religions, and are typically split into five different classifications, based on a system created by [Mircea Eliade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade "Mircea Eliade") and his colleague Charles Long.

*   Types of Creation Myths based on similar motifs: 
    *   [Creation _ex nihilo_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatio_ex_nihilo "Creatio ex nihilo") in which the creation is through the thought, word, dream or bodily secretions of a divine being.
    *   [Earth diver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_diver "Earth diver") creation in which a diver, usually a bird or amphibian sent by a creator, plunges to the seabed through a [primordial ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ocean "Cosmic ocean") to bring up sand or mud which develops into a terrestrial world.
    *   Emergence myths in which progenitors pass through a series of worlds and metamorphoses until reaching the present world.
    *   Creation by the dismemberment of a primordial being.
    *   Creation by the splitting or ordering of a primordial unity such as the cracking of a [cosmic egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_egg "World egg") or a bringing order from [chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(cosmogony) "Chaos (cosmogony)").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-lm3233-27)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Observable_universe_logarithmic_illustration.png/330px-Observable_universe_logarithmic_illustration.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Observable_universe_logarithmic_illustration.png)

Representation of the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe "Observable universe") on a [logarithmic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale "Logarithmic scale"). Distance from the Sun increases from center to edge. Planets and other celestial bodies were enlarged to appreciate their shapes.

Cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was found in religion.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-28) Some questions about the Universe are beyond the scope of scientific inquiry but may still be interrogated through appeals to other philosophical approaches like [dialectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic "Dialectic"). Some questions that are included in extra-scientific endeavors may include:[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-BICEP2-2014-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-30)

*   What is the origin of the universe? What is its first cause (if any)? Is its existence necessary? (see [monism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism "Monism"), [pantheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism "Pantheism"), [emanationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanationism "Emanationism") and [creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism "Creationism"))
*   What are the ultimate material components of the universe? (see [mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy) "Mechanism (philosophy)"), [dynamism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamism_(metaphysics) "Dynamism (metaphysics)"), [hylomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylomorphism "Hylomorphism"), [atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism"))
*   What is the ultimate reason (if any) for the existence of the universe? Does the cosmos have a purpose? (see [teleology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology "Teleology"))
*   Does the existence of consciousness have a role in the existence of reality? How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos? Does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths? (see [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"))

Charles Kahn, a historian of philosophy, attributed the origins of ancient Greek cosmology to [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology#cite_note-31)

[...] the Sun is equal to the Earth, but the circle on which it breathes and on which it's borne is twenty-seven times as big as the whole earth. [...] [The eclipse] is when the mouth from which comes the fire heat is closed. [...] [The Moon] is a circle nineteen times as big as the whole earth, all filled with fire, like that of the Sun".

Similarly, he made a mixture of the _Same,_ and then one of the _Different,_ in between their indivisible and their corporeal, divisible counterparts. And he took the three mixtures and mixed them together to make a uniform mixture, forcing the Different, which was hard to mix, into conformity with the Same. Now when he had mixed these two with Being, and from the three had made a single mixture, he redivided the whole mixture into as many parts as his task required, each part remaining a mixture of the Same, the Different and Being."
