It is not a list of sources that should contain stars that are distant but no separate stars within that source are separately known, such as unresolved stars in star clusters, galaxies, galaxy clusters.

Distances to stars may be determined through parallax measurements, use of standard references such as cepheid variables or Type Ia supernovas to the object in which the star resides, or redshift measurement.

Spectroscopic redshift measurement is preferred, while photometric redshift measurement is also used to identify candidate high redshift sources. The symbol z represents redshift Most distant stars [ edit ] This list is incomplete ; you can help by adding missing items .

( May 2025 ) Arcturus (Alpha Bootis) Solitary star 1891−1910 160 ly (18 mas ) (this was very inaccurate, true=37 ly) This number is wrong; originally announced in 1891, the figure was corrected in 1910 to 40 ly (60 mas).

From 1891 to 1910, it had been thought this was the star with the smallest known parallax, hence the most distant star whose distance was known.

Prior to 1891, Arcturus had previously been recorded of having a parallax of 127 mas.

[ 32 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Sun Solitary star 3rd century BC – 1609 380 Earth radii (very inaccurate, true=16000 Earth radii) Aristarchus of Samos made a measurement of the distance of the Sun from the Earth in relation to the distance of the Moon from the Earth.

The distance to the Moon was described in Earth radii (20, also inaccurate).

The diameter of the Earth had been calculated previously.

At the time, it was assumed that some of the planets were further away, but their distances could not be measured.

The order of the planets was conjecture until Kepler determined the distances from the Sun of the five known planets other than Earth.

It had been conjectured that the fixed stars were much farther away than the planets.
