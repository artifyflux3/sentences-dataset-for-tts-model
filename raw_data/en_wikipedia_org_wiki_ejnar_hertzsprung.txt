He is best remembered for his role in developing the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of stars.

Career [ edit ] Hertzsprung was born in Frederiksberg , Denmark, the son of Severin and Henriette. He studied chemical engineering at Copenhagen Polytechnic Institute , graduating in 1898. After spending two years working as a chemist in St. Petersburg, in 1901 he studied photochemistry at Leipzig University for a year.

[ 1 ] His father was an amateur astronomer, which led to Ejnar's interest in the subject. He began making astronomical observations in Frederiksberg in 1902, and within a few years had noticed that stars with similar spectral type could have widely different absolute magnitudes . In 1909, he took a position at the Göttingen Observatory under director Karl Schwarzschild .

[ 2 ] In 1911 Hertzsprung developed the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram , independently developed in 1913 by Henry Norris Russell .

In 1913 Hertzsprung determined the distances to several Cepheid variable stars by parallax , [ 3 ] and was thus able to calibrate the relationship, discovered by Henrietta Leavitt , between Cepheid period and luminosity . In this determination he made a mistake, possibly a slip of the pen, putting the stars 10 times too close. He used this relationship to estimate the distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud . From 1919 to 1946, Hertzsprung worked at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, from 1937 as director. Among his graduate students at Leiden was Gerard Kuiper .

Perhaps his greatest contribution to astronomy was the development of a classification system for stars to divide them by spectral type, stage in their development, and luminosity. He used the earlier classification system developed by Antonia Maury in his work.

[ 4 ] The so-called "Hertzsprung–Russell Diagram" has been used ever since as a classification system to explain stellar types and stellar evolution . He also discovered two asteroids , one of which is 1627 Ivar , an Amor asteroid .

[ 5 ] His wife Henrietta (1881–1956) was a daughter of the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn . Hertzsprung died in Roskilde in 1967. The asteroid 1693 Hertzsprung was named in his honour.
