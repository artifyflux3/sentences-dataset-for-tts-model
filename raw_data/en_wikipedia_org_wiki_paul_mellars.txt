Early life and academic career [ edit ] Paul Mellars was born in 1939 in the village of Swallownest near Sheffield . His father, Herbert Mellars, was a miner and a member of the Plymouth Brethren . From the village school, he progressed to Woodhouse, a County Council Grammar School founded in 1909 in the West Riding of Yorkshire , which his mother Elaine (née Batty) had also attended. (Woodhouse has subsequently been incorporated into the newly built Aston Academy in Swallownest.) [ 2 ] Mellars obtained his MA , PhD and ScD degrees at the University of Cambridge, where he was a student at Fitzwilliam College .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] He married his wife Anny in 1969, having first met in an archaeological field trip in the Dordogne in 1964.

[ 5 ] After his PhD, Mellars taught for ten years in the Archaeology Department at Sheffield University before returning to Cambridge in 1980, where he became a fellow of Corpus Christi College . He briefly served as acting master of the college in 2007, following the resignation of Sir Alan Wilson , but six months later lost the election to become the formal successor to Wilson to Oliver Rackham .

[ 6 ] He has held visiting positions at the Binghamton University and the Australian National University .

He served as president of the Prehistoric Society . He was also a trustee of the ACE Foundation .

Research [ edit ] Mellars' recent research concentrated on the behaviour and archaeology of Neanderthal populations in Europe, and their replacement by Homo sapiens 40,000 years ago. Mellars contributed to the three-part BBC mini-series "Dawn of Man – The Story of Human Evolution" (2000).

He also studied the way in which mesolithic hunter-gatherer populations in Britain adapted to climate changes following the last ice age . He carried out excavations on early Mesolithic sites at Oronsay in the Inner Hebrides in Scotland and published the results from work at Star Carr in North Yorkshire .

Honours [ edit ] Mellars was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (FSA) in 1977, [ 7 ] a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1990 and a member of the Academia Europaea in 1999. In 2004, he was appointed an Officier of the Ordre des Palmes académiques by the French Government.

[ 4 ] In 2006, he was awarded the Grahame Clark Medal by the British Academy.

[ 8 ] He was knighted in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to scholarship.
