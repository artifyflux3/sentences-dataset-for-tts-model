**Nature** is an inherent character or constitution,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-Merriam-Webster_2024_d901-1) particularly of the [ecosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosphere_(planetary) "Ecosphere (planetary)") or the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law "Scientific law"), elements and [phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon "Phenomenon") of the physical world, including [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life"). Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright [separate and even superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocentrism "Anthropocentrism") to nature.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-What_does_nature_mean-2)

During the advent of modern [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method") in the last several centuries, nature became the passive [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality"), organized and moved by divine laws.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-4) With the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution"), nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions ([Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau "Jean-Jacques Rousseau"), American [transcendentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism "Transcendentalism")) or a mere decorum for [divine providence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_providence "Divine providence") or human history ([Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegel "Hegel"), [Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx "Marx")). However, a [vitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalist "Vitalist") vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-What_does_nature_mean-2)

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to [geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology") and [wildlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife "Wildlife"). Nature can refer to the general realm of [living beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life"), and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"). It is often taken to mean the "[natural environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment "Natural environment")" or [wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness "Wilderness")—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") or a human [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind"). Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the [unnatural](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unnatural "wikt:unnatural") or the [supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural "Supernatural").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-What_does_nature_mean-2)

Etymology
---------

The word _nature_ is borrowed from the [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French "Old French")_nature_ and is derived from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") word _natura_, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "[birth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth "Birth")".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-etymonline-nature-5) In ancient philosophy, _natura_ is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word _[physis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physis "Physis")_ (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own accord.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-7) The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"), is one of several expansions of the original notion;[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-What_does_nature_mean-2) it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [pre-Socratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy "Pre-Socratic philosophy") philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for [Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus "Heraclitus")), and has steadily gained currency ever since.

_[The Blue Marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Blue\_Marble "The Blue Marble")_, which is a famous view of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), taken in 1972 by the crew of [Apollo 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_17 "Apollo 17")

Earth is the only [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") known to support [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life"), and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest [terrestrial planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet "Terrestrial planet") and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [temperate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate "Temperate") zones, and a wide [equatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator") tropical to [subtropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropical "Subtropical") region.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-8)[Precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation "Precipitation") varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [Northern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere "Northern Hemisphere").

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [outer surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology) "Crust (geology)") is divided into several gradually migrating [tectonic plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic_plate "Tectonic plate"). The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology) "Mantle (geology)") and an iron-filled core that generates a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"). This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

The [atmospheric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-9) which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-10) and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-12)

### Geology

Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_geology "Structural geology"), [physical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_property "Physical property"), dynamics, and [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Earth "History of the Earth") of [Earth materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_materials "Earth materials"), and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [academic discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline "Academic discipline"), and is also important for [mineral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining "Mining") and [hydrocarbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_geology "Petroleum geology") extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [natural hazards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_hazard "Natural hazard"), some [Geotechnical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotechnical_engineering "Geotechnical engineering") fields, and understanding [past climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoclimatology "Paleoclimatology") and environments.

#### Geological evolution

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Tectonic_plate_boundaries.png/330px-Tectonic_plate_boundaries.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tectonic_plate_boundaries.png)

Three types of geological [plate tectonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonic "Plate tectonic") boundaries

The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [deposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(geology) "Deposition (geology)") onto the surface or intrude into the [overlying rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_rock_(geology) "Country rock (geology)"). Deposition can occur when [sediments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment "Sediment") settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [lithify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithification "Lithification") into [sedimentary rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_rock "Sedimentary rock"), or when as [volcanic material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_rock "Volcanic rock") such as [volcanic ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash "Volcanic ash") or [lava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava "Lava") flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [intrusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion "Intrusion") such as [batholiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batholith "Batholith"), [laccoliths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laccolith "Laccolith"), [dikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dike_(geology) "Dike (geology)"), and [sills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sill_(geology) "Sill (geology)"), push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [deformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(mechanics) "Deformation (mechanics)") and/or [metamorphosed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphism "Metamorphism"). Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [horizontal extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(geology) "Extension (geology)"), or side-to-side ([strike-slip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike-slip "Strike-slip")) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [convergent boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_boundary "Convergent boundary"), [divergent boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_boundary "Divergent boundary"), and [transform boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transform_boundary "Transform boundary"), respectively, between [tectonic plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics").

### Historical perspective

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Pangea_animation_03.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pangea_animation_03.gif)

An animation showing the movement of the continents from the separation of [Pangaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea "Pangaea") until the present day

Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54 billion years ago from the [solar nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_nebula "Solar nebula"), along with the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") and other [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-13) The Moon formed roughly 20 million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and [volcanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano "Volcano") activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor"), most or all of which came from [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice") delivered by [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet"), [produced the oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_water_on_Earth "Origin of water on Earth") and other water sources.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-14) The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-15)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Hyperia.jpg/250px-Hyperia.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hyperia.jpg)

[Plankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton "Plankton") inhabit oceans, seas and lakes, and have existed in various forms for at least 2 billion years.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-Margulis1995-16)

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [supercontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent "Supercontinent"). Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [Rodinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodinia "Rodinia"), began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [Pannotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannotia "Pannotia") which broke apart about 540 million years ago, then finally [Pangaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea "Pangaea"), which broke apart about 180 million years ago.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-17)

During the [Neoproterozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoproterozoic "Neoproterozoic") era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier") and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the "[Snowball Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth "Snowball Earth")", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [Cambrian explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion "Cambrian explosion") in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540 million years ago.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-18)

Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable [mass extinctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event "Extinction event").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-19) The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the [non-avian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird "Bird")[dinosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur "Dinosaur") and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as [mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal "Mammal"). Over the past 66 million years, mammalian life diversified.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-20)

Several million years ago, a species of small African [ape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape "Ape") gained the ability to stand upright.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-Margulis1995-16) The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization "Civilization") allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the [Great Oxygenation Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event "Great Oxygenation Event"), produced by the proliferation of [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae "Algae") during the [Siderian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siderian "Siderian") period, required about 300 million years to culminate.

The present era is classified as part of a mass [extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event "Extinction event"), the [Holocene extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction "Holocene extinction") event, the fastest ever to have occurred.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-22) Some, such as [E. O. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson "E. O. Wilson") of [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University"), predict that human destruction of the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere") could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100 years.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-23) The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-26)

Atmosphere, climate, and weather
--------------------------------

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Top_of_Atmosphere.jpg/250px-Top_of_Atmosphere.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Top_of_Atmosphere.jpg)

[Blue light is scattered more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering "Rayleigh scattering") than other wavelengths by the gases in the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"), giving the Earth a blue [halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(optical_phenomenon) "Halo (optical phenomenon)") when seen from space.

The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the [ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#Ecosystems). The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen"), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor"), with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer "Ozone layer") plays an important role in depleting the amount of [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [lower part of the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"), and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-27)[Ocean currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current "Ocean current") are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [thermohaline circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation "Thermohaline circulation") which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [polar regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_region "Polar region") much colder.

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Lightnings_sequence_2_animation-wcag.gif/250px-Lightnings_sequence_2_animation-wcag.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lightnings_sequence_2_animation-wcag.gif)

[Lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning "Lightning")

Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [tornadoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado "Tornado") or [hurricanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane "Hurricane") and [cyclones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone "Cyclone"), can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [influence the climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_variability_and_change "Climate variability and change"), including ocean currents, surface [albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo "Albedo"), [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas "Greenhouse gas"), variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical and geological records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic [climate changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") in the past, including [ice ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age "Ice age").

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/A_tornado_near_Anadarko%2C_Oklahoma%2C_on_May_3%2C_1999.jpg/250px-A_tornado_near_Anadarko%2C_Oklahoma%2C_on_May_3%2C_1999.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_tornado_near_Anadarko,_Oklahoma,_on_May_3,_1999.jpg)

A tornado in central [Oklahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma "Oklahoma")

The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude"). A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [tropical climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate "Tropical climate") at the equator to the [polar climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_climate "Polar climate") in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")'s [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation "Axis of rotation") being [tilted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt "Axial tilt") relative to its [orbital plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy) "Orbital plane (astronomy)"). Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"). This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [Northern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere "Northern Hemisphere") and [Southern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere "Southern Hemisphere") Hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [chaotic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") that is readily modified by small changes to the [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment "Natural environment"), so accurate [weather forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology") is limited to only a few days.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-28) Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-29)

Water on Earth
--------------

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/44_-_Iguazu_-_D%C3%A9cembre_2007.jpg/500px-44_-_Iguazu_-_D%C3%A9cembre_2007.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:44_-_Iguazu_-_D%C3%A9cembre_2007.jpg)

The [Iguazu Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguazu_Falls "Iguazu Falls") on the border between [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil") and [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina")

Water is a [chemical substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance "Chemical substance") that is composed of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") and [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") (H 2 O) and is vital for all known forms of life.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-30) In typical usage, "water" refers only to its liquid [form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_matter "States of matter"), but it also has a solid state, [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice"), and a [gaseous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas") state, [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor"), or [steam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam "Steam"). Water covers 71% of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")'s surface.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-31) On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in [aquifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer "Aquifer") and 0.001% in the [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") as [vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor "Vapor"), clouds, and [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology) "Precipitation (meteorology)").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-33) Oceans hold 97% of surface water, [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier"), and polar [ice caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cap "Ice cap") 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

### Oceans

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Ocean_from_Leblon.jpg/250px-Ocean_from_Leblon.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ocean_from_Leblon.jpg)

A view of the Atlantic Ocean from [Leblon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leblon "Leblon"), Rio de Janeiro

An ocean is a major body of [saline water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater "Seawater"), and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [continuous body of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Ocean "World Ocean") that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep. Average oceanic [salinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity "Salinity") is around 35 [parts per thousand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_thousand "Parts per thousand") (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [World Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Ocean "World Ocean") or global ocean.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-UNAoO-35) This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography "Oceanography").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-36)

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [continents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent "Continent"), various [archipelagos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago "Archipelago"), and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean"), the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean"), the [Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean"), the [Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean "Southern Ocean"), and the [Arctic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean"). Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, [bays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay "Bay") and other names. There are also [salt lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_lake "Salt lake"), which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [Aral Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea "Aral Sea") and the [Great Salt Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Salt_Lake "Great Salt Lake").

### Lakes

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Lake_mapourika_NZ.jpeg/250px-Lake_mapourika_NZ.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lake_mapourika_NZ.jpeg)

[Lake Mapourika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mapourika "Lake Mapourika"), New Zealand

Main article: [Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake "Lake")

A lake (from Latin word _lacus_) is a [terrain feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain_feature "Terrain feature") (or [physical feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_feature "Physical feature")), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(geology) "Depression (geology)") (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-38) The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon) "Titan (moon)"), Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of [ethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethane "Ethane"), most likely mixed with [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane"). It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [rift zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_zone "Rift zone"), and areas with ongoing or recent [glaciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier"). Other lakes are found in [endorheic basins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorheic_basin "Endorheic basin") or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the [last ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Period "Last Glacial Period"). All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

#### Ponds

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Mill_Pond_Sunset.jpg/250px-Mill_Pond_Sunset.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mill_Pond_Sunset.jpg)

The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [Westborough, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westborough,_Massachusetts "Westborough, Massachusetts")

Main article: [Pond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond "Pond")

A **pond** is a [body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water "Body of water") of [standing water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_stagnation "Water stagnation"), either natural or human-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of human-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [water gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_garden "Water garden") designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [fish ponds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_pond "Fish pond") designed for commercial fish breeding, and [solar ponds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_pond "Solar pond") designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_(stream) "Current (stream)") speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [stream pools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_pool "Stream pool") and [tide pools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_pool "Tide pool").

### Rivers

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/View_from_Cairo_Tower_31march2007.jpg/250px-View_from_Cairo_Tower_31march2007.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:View_from_Cairo_Tower_31march2007.jpg)

The [Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile "Nile") river in [Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo "Cairo"), Egypt's capital city

A river is a natural [watercourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercourse "Watercourse"),[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-39) usually [freshwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater "Freshwater"), flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is _Burn_ in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-40) A river is part of the [hydrological cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrological_cycle "Hydrological cycle"). Water within a river is generally collected from [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology) "Precipitation (meteorology)") through [surface runoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff "Surface runoff"), [groundwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater "Groundwater") recharge, [springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrology) "Spring (hydrology)"), and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier")).

### Streams

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Hawaii_Creek.jpg/250px-Hawaii_Creek.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hawaii_Creek.jpg)

A rocky stream in [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii "Hawaii")

A stream is a flowing body of water with a [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_(stream) "Current (stream)"), confined within a [bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_bed "Stream bed") and [stream banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_bank "Stream bank"). In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [water cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle "Water cycle"), instruments in [groundwater recharge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater_recharge "Groundwater recharge"), and they serve as corridors for fish and [wildlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife "Wildlife") migration. The biological [habitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat "Habitat") in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [riparian zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian_zone "Riparian zone"). Given the status of the ongoing [Holocene extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction "Holocene extinction"), streams play an important [corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_corridor "Wildlife corridor") role in connecting [fragmented habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation "Habitat fragmentation") and thus in conserving [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity"). The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [hydrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology "Hydrology"), [fluvial geomorphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomorphology "Geomorphology"), [aquatic ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ecology "Aquatic ecology"), [fish biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater_fish "Freshwater fish"), [riparian ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian "Riparian"), and others.

Ecosystems
----------

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/View_of_loch_lomond.JPG/250px-View_of_loch_lomond.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:View_of_loch_lomond.JPG)

[Loch Lomond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Lomond "Loch Lomond") in Scotland forms a relatively isolated ecosystem. The fish community of this lake has remained unchanged over a very long period of time.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-41)

An aerial view of a [human ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_ecosystem "Human ecosystem"). Pictured is the city of Chicago.

Ecosystems are composed of a variety of [biotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotic_component "Biotic component") and [abiotic components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiotic_component "Abiotic component") that function in an interrelated way.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-42) The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are [soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil "Soil"), [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"), radiation from the [sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), water, and living organisms.

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/PenasBlancas%2C_part_of_the_Bosawas_Reserve%2C_Jinotega_Department%2C_Nicaragua.jpg/250px-PenasBlancas%2C_part_of_the_Bosawas_Reserve%2C_Jinotega_Department%2C_Nicaragua.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PenasBlancas,_part_of_the_Bosawas_Reserve,_Jinotega_Department,_Nicaragua.jpg)

Peñas Blancas, part of the [Bosawás Biosphere Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosaw%C3%A1s_Biosphere_Reserve "Bosawás Biosphere Reserve"). Located northeast of the city of [Jinotega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinotega "Jinotega") in Northeastern Nicaragua

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [living organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_organism "Living organism") interact with every other element in their local [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical) "Environment (biophysical)"). Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-Odum1971-43) Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [food chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain "Food chain"), and exchange energy and [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") between themselves as well as with their environment.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-44) The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature [dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy "Dichotomy") and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [biotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotope "Biotope").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-45)

A smaller unit of size is called a [microecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microecosystem "Microecosystem"). For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A _macroecosystem_ might involve a whole [ecoregion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoregion "Ecoregion"), with its [drainage basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin "Drainage basin").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-46)

### Wilderness

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Biogradska_suma.jpg/250px-Biogradska_suma.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Biogradska_suma.jpg)

[Old growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-growth_forest "Old-growth forest")[European Beech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Beech "European Beech") forest in [Biogradska Gora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogradska_Gora "Biogradska Gora") National Park, [Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro "Montenegro")

**Wilderness** is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [national forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:National_forests "Category:National forests"), [national parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park "National park"), and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected [parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks "Parks") are considered important for the survival of certain [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species"), ecological studies, [conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_conservation "Habitat conservation"), and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-Man_p155-157-47) and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural [ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem "Ecosystem") (the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere")). They may also preserve historic [genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics "Genetics") traits and that they provide [habitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat "Habitat") for wild [flora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(plants) "Flora (plants)") and [fauna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna_(animals) "Fauna (animals)") that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in [zoos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo "Zoo"), [arboretums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arboretum "Arboretum"), or [laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory "Laboratory").

Life
----

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Malards_in_Golden_Gate_Park.jpg/250px-Malards_in_Golden_Gate_Park.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Malards_in_Golden_Gate_Park.jpg)

Female mallard and ducklings – [reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction "Reproduction") is essential for continuing life.

Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism "Organism"), [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism"), [growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth "Cell growth"), [adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation "Adaptation"), response to [stimuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology) "Stimulus (physiology)"), and [reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction "Reproduction").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-48) Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism "Organism").

Present day organisms from [viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus "Virus") to humans possess a self-replicating informational molecule (genome), either [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") or [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA "RNA") (as in some viruses), and such an informational molecule is probably intrinsic to life. It is likely that the earliest forms of life were based on a self-replicating informational molecule ([genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome "Genome")), perhaps RNA[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-50) or a molecule more primitive than RNA or DNA. The specific [deoxyribonucleotide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribonucleotide "Deoxyribonucleotide")/[ribonucleotide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribonucleotide "Ribonucleotide") sequence in each currently extant individual organism contains sequence information that functions to promotes survival, [reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction "Reproduction"), and the capacity to acquire resources necessary for reproduction, and such sequences probably emerged early in the evolution of life. Survival functions present early in the evolution of life likely also included genomic sequences that promote the avoidance of damage to the self-replicating molecule and also the capability to [repair such damages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair "DNA repair") that do occur. Repair of some genome damages may have involved using information from another similar molecule by a process of [recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination "Genetic recombination") (a primitive form of [sexual interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction "Sexual reproduction")).[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-51)

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus "Fungus"), [protists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist "Protist"), [archaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea "Archaea"), and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [analogs of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life "Artificial life") may also be considered to be life.

The [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere") is the part of Earth's outer shell—including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere—within which life occurs, and which [biotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [geophysiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysiology "Geophysiology") point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere") (rocks), [hydrosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere "Hydrosphere") (water), and [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") (air). The entire Earth contains over 75 billion tons (150 _trillion_ pounds or about 6.8×10 13 kilograms) of [biomass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology) "Biomass (ecology)") (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-52)

Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-53) More than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date,[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-54) and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50 million.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-55)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-56)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-57) The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-58)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-59) The total number of species is in rapid decline.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-61)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-62)

### Evolution

[![Image 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Amazon_Manaus_forest.jpg/250px-Amazon_Manaus_forest.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amazon_Manaus_forest.jpg)

An area of the [Amazon Rainforest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Rainforest "Amazon Rainforest") shared between [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia "Colombia") and [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"). The [tropical rainforests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest "Tropical rainforest") of South America contain the largest [diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity") of species on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-63)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-64)

The [origin of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_life "Origin of life") on Earth is not well understood, but it is known to have occurred at least 3.5 billion years ago,[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-Origin1-65)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-Origin2-66)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-RavenJohnson2002-67) during the [hadean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean "Hadean") or [archean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean "Archean") eons on a [primordial Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Earth "Early Earth") that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-Line-68) These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution") by [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection "Natural selection") resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the [fossil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil "Fossil") record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-Line-68)

When basic forms of plant life developed the process of [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis "Photosynthesis") the sun's energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-69) The resultant [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer "Ozone layer"). The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the [development of yet more complex cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiotic_theory "Endosymbiotic theory") called [eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotes "Eukaryotes").[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-70) Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful [ultraviolet radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_radiation "Ultraviolet radiation"), life colonized the surface of Earth.

### Microbes

[![Image 22](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Yellow_mite_%28Tydeidae%29_Lorryia_formosa_2_edit.jpg/250px-Yellow_mite_%28Tydeidae%29_Lorryia_formosa_2_edit.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yellow_mite_(Tydeidae)_Lorryia_formosa_2_edit.jpg)

A microscopic mite [_Lorryia formosa_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite "Mite")

The first form of life to develop on the Earth were [unicellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicellular "Unicellular"), and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-71) Microorganisms or microbes are [microscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic "Microscopic"), and smaller than the human eye can see.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-72)[Microorganisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism "Microorganism") can be [single-celled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-celled "Single-celled"), such as [Bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria"), [Archaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea "Archaea"), many [Protista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist "Protist"), and a minority of [Fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus "Fungus").[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-73)

These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where there is liquid water, including in the Earth's interior.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-74) Their reproduction is both rapid and profuse. The combination of a high mutation rate and a [horizontal gene transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer "Horizontal gene transfer")[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-75) ability makes them highly adaptable, and able to survive in new and sometimes very harsh environments, including [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space").[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-76) They form an essential part of the planetary ecosystem. However, some microorganisms are [pathogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen "Pathogen") and can post health risk to other organisms.

[Viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus "Virus") are [infectious agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen "Pathogen"), but they are not autonomous [life forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_life_forms "Outline of life forms"), as it is the case for [viroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viroid "Viroid"), [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_(biology) "Satellite (biology)"), [DPIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defective_interfering_particle "Defective interfering particle") and [prions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion "Prion").[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-Solomon-77)

A selection of diverse [animal species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_species "Animal species")

Originally [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In [Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus "Carl Linnaeus")' system, these became the [kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology) "Kingdom (biology)")[Vegetabilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetabilia "Vegetabilia") (later [Plantae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant "Plant")) and [Animalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal "Animal"). Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus "Fungus") and several groups of [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alga "Alga") were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-78)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-79) and some classifications use the term _bacterial flora_ separately from _plant flora_.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional [floras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora "Flora"), which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include _fossil flora_, remnants of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [terrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain "Terrain").

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as _native flora_ or _agricultural and garden flora_. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for _weeds_. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [botanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany "Botany") as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as _domestic_, _farm animals_, _wild animals_, _pests_, etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote "Eukaryote") and usually [multicellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular "Multicellular"), which separates them from bacteria, [archaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea "Archaea"), and most [protists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist "Protist"). They are [heterotrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotroph "Heterotroph"), generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alga "Alga"). They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus "Fungus") by lacking [cell walls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_wall "Cell wall").

With a few exceptions—most notably the two [phyla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum "Phylum") consisting of [sponges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge "Sponge") and [placozoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placozoa "Placozoa")—animals have bodies that are differentiated into [tissues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_tissue "Biological tissue"). These include [muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle "Muscle"), which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system "Nervous system"), which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [digestive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion "Digestion") chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [collagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen "Collagen") and elastic [glycoproteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein "Glycoprotein"). This may be calcified to form structures like [shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton "Exoskeleton"), [bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone "Bone"), and [spicules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spicule_(sponge) "Spicule (sponge)"), a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Human interrelationship

[![Image 25](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Na_Pali_Coast_-_Kauai.jpg/250px-Na_Pali_Coast_-_Kauai.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Na_Pali_Coast_-_Kauai.jpg)

Despite their natural beauty, the secluded valleys along the [Na Pali Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na_Pali_Coast "Na Pali Coast") in Hawaii are heavily modified by introduced [invasive species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species "Invasive species") such as [She-oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-oak "She-oak").

### Human impact

Although [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans "Humans") comprise a minuscule proportion of the total living [biomass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology) "Biomass (ecology)") on Earth, the [human effect on nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment "Human impact on the environment") is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace. A 2020 study published in _[Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature\_(journal) "Nature (journal)")_ found that anthropogenic mass (human-made materials) outweighs all living biomass on earth, with [plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution "Plastic pollution") alone exceeding the mass of all land and marine animals combined.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-80) And according to a 2021 study published in _Frontiers in Forests and Global Change_, only about 3% of the planet's terrestrial surface is ecologically and [faunally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna "Fauna") intact, with a low human footprint and healthy populations of native animal species.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-81)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-82) Philip Cafaro, professor of philosophy at the School of Global Environmental Sustainability at [Colorado State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University "Colorado State University"), wrote in 2022 that "the cause of global biodiversity loss is clear: other species are being displaced by a rapidly growing human economy."[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-83)

The development of [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") by the human race has allowed the greater [exploitation of natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_natural_resources "Exploitation of natural resources") and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from [natural hazards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_hazards "Natural hazards"). In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization "Civilization") remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex [feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_loop "Feedback loop") between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-84) Human-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include [pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution "Pollution"), [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation "Deforestation"), and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction "Holocene extinction") of many plants and animals,[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-85) with roughly 1 million species threatened with extinction within decades.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-86) The [loss of biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss "Biodiversity loss") and ecosystem functions over the last half century have impacted the extent that nature can contribute to human quality of life,[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-87) and continued declines could pose a major threat to the existence of human civilization, unless a rapid course correction is made.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-88) The value of natural resources to society is often poorly reflected in [market prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure "Market failure"), because whilst there are extraction costs, natural resources themselves are typically available free of charge. This distorts market pricing of natural resources and at the same time leads to underinvestment in our natural assets. The annual global cost of public subsidies that damage nature is conservatively estimated at $4–6 trillion (million million). Institutional protections of these natural goods, such as the oceans and rainforests, are lacking. Governments have not prevented these economic [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externalities "Externalities").[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-89)[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-90)

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's [economic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system "Economic system").[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-91)[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-92) Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [Agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture#History "Agriculture") was first adopted around the [9th millennium BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9th_millennium_BCE "9th millennium BCE"). Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the [medicinal properties of vegetation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicinal_plant "Medicinal plant") for healing,[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-93) most modern human use of plants is through [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture"). The [clearance of large tracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_conversion "Land conversion") of land for [crop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop "Crop") growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of [forestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestation "Forestation") and [wetlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetlands "Wetlands"), resulting in the [loss of habitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_habitat "Loss of habitat") for many plant and animal species as well as increased [erosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion "Erosion").[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-94)

### Aesthetics and beauty

[![Image 26](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Cyclamen_coum_%28d.j.b.%29_02.jpg/250px-Cyclamen_coum_%28d.j.b.%29_02.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cyclamen_coum_(d.j.b.)_02.jpg)

Aesthetically pleasing flowers

Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics"). Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-95) Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [landscape art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_art "Landscape art") began in China during the [Tang Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Dynasty_art "Tang Dynasty art") (618–907). The tradition of representing nature _as it is_ became one of the aims of [Chinese painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_painting "Chinese painting") and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [Psalms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalms "Psalms") and the [Book of Job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job "Book of Job"), [wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness "Wilderness") portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [Romantic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_movement "Romantic movement"). [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "Kingdom of Great Britain") artists [John Constable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Constable "John Constable") and [J. M. W. Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner "J. M. W. Turner") turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [William Wordsworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wordsworth "William Wordsworth")'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-History-96) This artistic movement also coincided with the [Transcendentalist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism "Transcendentalism") in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [mimesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimesis "Mimesis"), the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_form "Substantial form") and more generally by [patterns in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_in_nature "Patterns in nature"). As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-97): 281

Matter and energy

[![Image 27](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Hydrogen_Density_Plots.png/250px-Hydrogen_Density_Plots.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hydrogen_Density_Plots.png)

The first few [hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom "Hydrogen atom")[electron orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital "Atomic orbital") shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density

The [natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science") view matter as obeying certain [laws of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law "Scientific law") which [scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientists "Scientists") seek to understand.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-COPL-98) Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe "Observable universe"). The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent [cold dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_dark_matter "Cold dark matter") and 68.3 percent [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy").[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-planck_overview-99) The exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists.

The behaviour of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [physical laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law"). These laws have been employed to produce [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology") models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [physical constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant "Physical constant")[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-100) that appear to be static across the observable universe.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-101) The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.

Beyond Earth

**[NGC 4414](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_4414 "NGC 4414")** is a spiral galaxy in the constellation [Coma Berenices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Berenices "Coma Berenices") about 56,000 [light-years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year") in diameter and approximately 60 million light-years from [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth").

Outer space, also simply called _space_, refers to the relatively empty regions of the [Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") outside the [atmospheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") of celestial bodies. _Outer_ space is used to distinguish it from [airspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace "Airspace") (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth") and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") is called [interplanetary space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_medium "Interplanetary medium"), which passes over into [interstellar space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium") at what is known as the [heliopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopause_(astronomy) "Heliopause (astronomy)").

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [organic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry "Organic chemistry")[molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") discovered to date by [microwave spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_spectroscopy "Rotational spectroscopy"), [blackbody radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background") left over from the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") and the origin of the universe, and [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray"), which include [ionized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion")[atomic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") and various [subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle "Subatomic particle"). There is also some gas, [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") and [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust "Dust"), and small [meteors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor "Meteor"). Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous crewed and uncrewed launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although Earth is the only body within the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars") possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-102) For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen. If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-103)

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)") and [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus"), appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon) "Europa (moon)"), the fourth-largest moon of [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter"), may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-104)

Astronomers have discovered extrasolar [Earth analogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_analog "Earth analog") – planets that lie in the [habitable zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone "Circumstellar habitable zone") of space surrounding a [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), and therefore could possibly host life. However the requirements for life are not completely known and astronomical observations provide limited information.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-105)

6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_ref-6)**An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) _The Greek Concept of Nature_, SUNY Press, and in Ducarme, Frédéric; Couvet, Denis (2020). ["What does 'nature' mean?"](https://doi.org/10.1057%2Fs41599-020-0390-y). _[Palgrave Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palgrave\_Communications "Palgrave Communications")_. **6** (14).

The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word _nature_ is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. _Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus_ (volume 2 of his _History of Greek Philosophy_), Cambridge UP, 1965.
7.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_ref-7)**The first known use of _physis_ was by [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer") in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι **φύσιν** αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its **nature**.) _[Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey "Odyssey")_ 10.302–303 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's _[Greek Lexicon](http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux)[Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20110305235638/http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux/) March 5, 2011, at the [Wayback Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback\_Machine "Wayback Machine")_.)

[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.
