73001278 [ 1 ] Added to NRHP December 4, 1973 The Andrew Dickson White House , commonly referred to as the A.D. White House, is a High Victorian Gothic academic building and former presidential mansion on the campus of Cornell University . It was designed by architects William Henry Miller and Charles Babcock .

[ 2 ] and currently houses the Cornell University Society for the Humanities.

Commissioned in 1871 by Andrew Dickson White , co-founder and first president of Cornell University, the house features elaborate stone carvings reflecting White's aesthetic preferences. White intended the house to serve as both a residence and a source of artistic inspiration for students.

[ 3 ] Upon his death, he bequeathed the house to the university for the use of future presidents. While no longer serving as a primary residence, the study on the southeast side remains available as a private office and retreat for university presidents.

In 1953, the building was repurposed as the University Art Museum , with its former carriage house converted into the Big Red Barn, a graduate student lounge.

[ 4 ] The house remained an art museum until 1973, when it was considered for demolition.

Henry Guerlac , then director of the Society for the Humanities, advocated for its preservation, leading to its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

[ 1 ] The house’s library, now known as the Guerlac Room, was named in his honor.

[ 3 ] Following the opening of the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, the White House transitioned to housing offices for the Society for the Humanities.
