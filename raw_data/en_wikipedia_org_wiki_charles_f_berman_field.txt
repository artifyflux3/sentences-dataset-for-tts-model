[ 1 ] The grass playing surface is a mix of 30 percent rye and 70 percent Kentucky bluegrass, which was chosen for its "adaptability to close mowing." [ 1 ] Constructed in 2000, the 1,000 seat stadium is named in honor of former Cornell soccer player Charles F. Berman who was captain of the 1948 Cornell soccer team and a member of the Quill and Dagger society. Berman perished in an airplane crash in Jamaica en route to Colombia on January 21, 1960.
