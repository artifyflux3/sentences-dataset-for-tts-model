The annual celebrations start at 1:00 pm on 28 October and continue for 35 hours.

[ 1 ] Background [ edit ] The holiday commemorates the events of 29 October 1923, when Mustafa Kemal Atatürk declared that Turkey was henceforth a republic.

[ 2 ] Turkey had de facto been a republic since 23 April 1920, the date of the establishment of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey ( Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisi ), but the official confirmation of this fact came three-and-a-half years later.

[ 3 ] On 29 October 1923, the status of the nation as a republic was declared and its official name was proclaimed to be Türkiye Cumhuriyeti ("the Republic of Turkey").

[ 3 ] After that, a vote was held in the Grand National Assembly, and Atatürk was elected as the first President of the Republic of Turkey , [ 2 ] [ 4 ] keeping his position until his death.

Customs [ edit ] Republic Day is a national holiday marked by patriotic displays. Similar to other autumn events, Republic Day celebrations often take place outdoors. According to Law No. 2429 of 1981, Republic Day is a national holiday, so all public institution are closed on that day.

[ 5 ] It is also observed by Northern Cyprus .

[ 6 ] Decorations ( e.g.

, streamers, balloons, and clothing) are generally colored red and white, the colors of the Turkish flag .

Anıtkabir is visited by more than a hundred thousand people every year.

[ 7 ] Parades are often held in the morning, while concerts, and fireworks displays occur in the evening after dark at such places as parks, fairgrounds, or town squares.

[ 8 ] Republic Day fireworks are often accompanied by patriotic songs such as the 10th Anniversary March.

[ 9 ] Istanbul has the largest fireworks display in the country.

[ citation needed ] It generally holds displays over the Bosporus.

[ 10 ] Other major displays are in Ankara in Ulus ; and in İzmir over the Gulf of İzmir and Gündoğdu Square .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The 2023 Republic Centennial featured among others the return of the yearly parade in Ankara and a fleet review of Turkish Navy assets in Istanbul.

[ 13 ] Tenth year speech [ edit ] The tenth year speech was the speech given by the President of the Republic of Turkey , Mustafa Kemal Atatürk , at the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the republic's establishment.

[ 14 ] This was a speech that not only gives an account of the Turkish War of Independence , in other words, tells about whom, why and how the national struggle was waged, [ 15 ] but also contains important information about what should be done and what will be done in the phase of this struggle after the establishment of the Republic.
