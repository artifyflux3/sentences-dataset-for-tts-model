A point p and a line l of the Fano plane are complements if and only if p does not lie on l .

In the mathematical discipline of order theory , a complemented lattice is a bounded lattice (with least element 0 and greatest element 1), in which every element a has a complement , i.e. an element b satisfying a ∨ b = 1 and a ∧ b = 0.
Complements need not be unique.

A relatively complemented lattice is a lattice such that every interval [ c , d ], viewed as a bounded lattice in its own right, is a complemented lattice.

An orthocomplementation on a complemented lattice is an involution that is order-reversing and maps each element to a complement. An orthocomplemented lattice satisfying a weak form of the modular law is called an orthomodular lattice .

In bounded distributive lattices , complements are unique. Every complemented distributive lattice has a unique orthocomplementation and is in fact a Boolean algebra .

Definition and basic properties [ edit ] A complemented lattice is a bounded lattice (with least element 0 and greatest element 1), in which every element a has a complement , i.e. an element b such that a ∨ b = 1     and a ∧ b = 0.

In general an element may have more than one complement. However, in a (bounded) distributive lattice every element will have at most one complement.

[ 1 ] A lattice in which every element has exactly one complement is called a uniquely complemented lattice [ 2 ] A lattice with the property that every interval (viewed as a sublattice) is complemented is called a relatively complemented lattice . In other words, a relatively complemented lattice is characterized by the property that for every element a in an interval [ c , d ] there is an element b such that a ∨ b = d and a ∧ b = c .

Such an element b is called a complement of a relative to the interval.

A distributive lattice is complemented if and only if it is bounded and relatively complemented.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The lattice of subspaces of a vector space provide an example of a complemented lattice that is not, in general, distributive.

( August 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) An orthocomplementation on a bounded lattice is a function that maps each element a to an "orthocomplement" a ⊥ in such a way that the following axioms are satisfied: [ 5 ] Complement law a ⊥ ∨ a = 1 and a ⊥ ∧ a = 0.

Involution law a ⊥⊥ = a .

Order-reversing if a ≤ b then b ⊥ ≤ a ⊥ .

An orthocomplemented lattice or ortholattice is a bounded lattice equipped with an orthocomplementation. The lattice of subspaces of an inner product space , and the orthogonal complement operation, provides an example of an orthocomplemented lattice that is not, in general, distributive.

[ 6 ] Some complemented lattices In the pentagon lattice N 5 , the node on the right-hand side has two complements.

The diamond lattice M 3 admits no orthocomplementation.

The lattice M 4 admits 3 orthocomplementations.

The hexagon lattice admits a unique orthocomplementation, but it is not uniquely complemented.

Boolean algebras are a special case of orthocomplemented lattices, which in turn are a special case of complemented lattices (with extra structure). The ortholattices are most often used in quantum logic , where the closed subspaces of a separable Hilbert space represent quantum propositions and behave as an orthocomplemented lattice.

Orthocomplemented lattices, like Boolean algebras, satisfy de Morgan's laws : ( a ∨ b ) ⊥ = a ⊥ ∧ b ⊥ ( a ∧ b ) ⊥ = a ⊥ ∨ b ⊥ .

Orthomodular lattices [ edit ] A lattice is called modular if for all elements a , b and c the implication if a ≤ c , then a ∨ ( b ∧ c ) = ( a ∨ b ) ∧ c holds. This is weaker than distributivity ; e.g. the above-shown lattice M 3 is modular, but not distributive.

A natural further weakening of this condition for orthocomplemented lattices, necessary for applications in quantum logic, is to require it only in the special case b = a ⊥ . An orthomodular lattice is therefore defined as an orthocomplemented lattice such that for any two elements the implication if a ≤ c , then a ∨ ( a ⊥ ∧ c ) = c holds.

Lattices of this form are of crucial importance for the study of quantum logic , since they are part of the axiomisation of the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics .

Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann observed that the propositional calculus in quantum logic is "formally indistinguishable from the calculus of linear subspaces [of a Hilbert space] with respect to set products , linear sums and orthogonal complements" corresponding to the roles of and , or and not in Boolean lattices. This remark has spurred interest in the closed subspaces of a Hilbert space, which form an orthomodular lattice.
