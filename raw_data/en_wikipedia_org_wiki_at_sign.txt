The **at sign** (**@**) is a typographical symbol used as an [accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting "Accounting") and [invoice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invoice "Invoice") abbreviation meaning "at a rate of" (e.g. 7 [widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_(economics) "Widget (economics)") @ [£](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3 "£")2 per widget = £14),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-1) and now seen more widely in [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email "Email") addresses and [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media "Social media") platform [handles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing) "User (computing)"). In English, it is normally read aloud as "at", and is also commonly called the **at symbol**, **commercial at**, or **address sign**. Most languages have their own name for the symbol.

Although not included on the [keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout "Keyboard layout") of the earliest commercially successful [typewriters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter"), it was on at least one 1889 model[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-2) and the very successful [Underwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwood_Typewriter_Company "Underwood Typewriter Company") models from the "Underwood No. 5" in 1900 onward. It started to be used in email addresses in the 1970s, and is now routinely included on most types of [computer keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard "Computer keyboard").

@ symbol used as the initial "a" for the "amin" (amen) formula in the Bulgarian of the Manasses Chronicle, c. 1345.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-3)

The [Aragonese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragonese_people "Aragonese people") @ symbol used in the 1448 _"taula de Ariza"_ registry to denote a wheat shipment from [Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Castile "Crown of Castile") to the [Kingdom of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aragon "Kingdom of Aragon").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-4)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/1674_liten.jpg/250px-1674_liten.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1674_liten.jpg)

@ used to signify French "_à_" ("at") from a 1674 protocol from a [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden") court (_[Arboga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arboga "Arboga") rådhusrätt och magistrat_)

The earliest yet discovered symbol in this shape is found in a [Bulgarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language "Bulgarian language") translation of a [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") chronicle written by [Constantinos Manasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_Manasses "Constantine Manasses") in 1345. Held today in the Vatican Apostolic Library, it features the @ symbol in place of the capital letter [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha "Alpha") "Α" as an [initial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial "Initial") in the word Amen; however, the reason behind it being used in this context is still unknown. The evolution of the symbol as used today is not recorded.

It has long been used in [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language "Catalan language"), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language") and [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language") as an abbreviation of _[arroba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arroba "Arroba")_, a unit of weight equivalent to 25 pounds, and derived from the [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") expression of "the quarter" (الربع pronounced _ar-rubʿ_).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-5) A symbol resembling an @ is found in the Spanish "Taula de Ariza", a registry to denote a wheat shipment from Castile to Aragon, in 1448.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-Willan-2000-6) The historian Giorgio Stabile claims to have traced the @ symbol to the 16th century, in a mercantile document sent by [Florentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence") Francesco Lapi from [Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville "Seville") to [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome") on May 4, 1536.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-Willan-2000-6) The document is about commerce with [Pizarro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizarro "Pizarro"), in particular the price of an @ of wine in [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru"). Currently, the word _arroba_ means both the at-symbol and a unit of weight. In [Venetian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_language "Venetian language"), the symbol was interpreted to mean [amphora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphora "Amphora") (_anfora_), a unit of weight and volume based upon the capacity of the standard amphora jar since the 6th century. It could also mean “adi” (standard Italian “addì”, i. e. ‘on the day of’) as used on a health pass in Northern Italy in 1667.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-7)

The name of the symbol arises from its original use in showing quantities and their price per unit– for example, "10 widgets @ £1.50 each". The precise origin of the symbol is uncertain.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-8)

The absence of a single English word for the symbol has prompted some writers to use the [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language")_arobase_,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-9) to coin new words such as _ampersat_[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-10) and _asperand_,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-Kiss-2010-11) or the (visual) onomatopoeia _[strudel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strudel "Strudel")_,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-12) but none of these have achieved wide use.

In contemporary English usage, @ is a commercial symbol, meaning _at_ and _at the rate of_ or _at the price of_. It has rarely been used in financial ledgers, and is not used in standard [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-13)

In 2012, "@" was registered as a [trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark "Trademark") with the German Patent and Trade Mark Office.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-14) A cancellation request was filed in 2013, and the cancellation was ultimately confirmed by the German Federal Patent Court in 2017.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-15)

A common contemporary use of @ is in [email addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address "Email address") (using the [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP "SMTP") system), as in `jdoe@example.com` (the user `jdoe` located _at_ the domain `example.com`). [Ray Tomlinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Tomlinson "Ray Tomlinson") of [BBN Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies "BBN Technologies") is credited for having introduced this usage in 1971.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-Kiss-2010-11)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-16) This idea of the symbol representing _located at_ in the form `user@host` is also seen in other tools and protocols; for example, the [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell "Unix shell") command `ssh jdoe@example.net` tries to establish an [ssh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh "Ssh") connection to the computer with the [hostname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname "Hostname")`example.net` using the username `jdoe`.

On web pages, organizations often obscure the email addresses of their members or employees by omitting the @. This practice, known as [address munging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_munging "Address munging"), attempts to make the email addresses less vulnerable to spam programs that scan the internet for them.

On many social media platforms and forums, [usernames or handles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing) "User (computing)") prefixed with an @ (in the form `@johndoe`) are interpreted as [mentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mention_(blogging) "Mention (blogging)") of that user and may be treated specially.

On online forums without [threaded discussions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_discussion "Threaded discussion"), @ is commonly used to denote a reply; for instance: `@Jane` to respond to a comment Jane made earlier. Similarly, in some cases, @ is used for "attention" in email messages originally sent to someone else. For example, if an email was sent from Catherine to Steve, but in the body of the email, Catherine wants to make Keirsten aware of something, Catherine will start the line `@Keirsten` to signal to Keirsten that the following sentence concerns her.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] This also helps with mobile email users who might not see bold or color in email.

In [microblogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging "Microblogging") (such as on [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter"), [GNU social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_social "GNU social")- and [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub "ActivityPub")-based microblogs), an @ before the user name is used to send publicly readable replies (e.g. `@otheruser: Message text here`). The blog and client system interpret these as links to the user in question. When included as part of a person's or company's contact details, an @ symbol followed by a name is normally understood to refer to a Twitter handle. A similar use of the @ symbol was added to Facebook on September 15, 2009.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-17) In [Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat "Internet Relay Chat") (IRC), it is shown before users' nicknames to denote they have operator status on a channel.

In [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English") the @ can be used to add information about a sporting event. Where opposing sports teams have their names separated by a "v" (for [versus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/versus "wikt:versus")), the [away team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_(sports) "Road (sports)") can be written first – and the normal "v" replaced with @ to convey at which team's home field the game will be played.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-18)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_] This usage is not followed in [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English"), since conventionally the home team is written first.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

@ is used in various [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") and other [computer languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language "Computer language"), although there is not a consistent theme to its usage. For example:

*   In [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript "ActionScript"), @ is used in XML parsing and traversal as a string prefix to identify attributes in contrast to child elements.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-19)
*   In [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language) "Ada (programming language)") 2022, @ is the _target name_ symbol, an abbreviation of the [LHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sides_of_an_equation "Sides of an equation") of an assignment; it is used to avoid repetition of potentially long names in assignment statements.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-20) For example: `A_Very_Long_Variable_Name := A_Very_Long_Variable_Name + 1;` is shortened to `A_Very_Long_Variable_Name := @ + 1;`, increasing readability.
*   In [ALGOL 68](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68 "ALGOL 68"), the @ symbol is _brief form_ of the **at**[keyword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_(computer_programming) "Keyword (computer programming)"); it is used to change the lower bound of an array. For example: `arrayx[@88]` refers to an array starting at index 88.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-21)
*   In Dyalog [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)"), @ is used as a functional way to modify or replace data **at** specific locations in an array.
*   In the [ASP.NET MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_MVC "ASP.NET MVC")[Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_ASP.NET_Razor_view_engine "Microsoft ASP.NET Razor view engine") template markup syntax, the @ character denotes the start of code statement blocks or the start of text content.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-23)
*   In [Assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language "Assembly language"), @ is sometimes used as a [dereference operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereference_operator "Dereference operator").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-24)
*   In [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS "CSS"), @ is used in special statements outside of a CSS block.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-25)
*   In [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)"), it denotes "verbatim strings", where no characters are escaped and two double-quote characters represent a single double-quote.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-26) As a prefix it also allows keywords to be used as [identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier_(computer_programming) "Identifier (computer programming)"),[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-27) a form of [stropping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stropping_(syntax) "Stropping (syntax)").
*   In [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language) "D (programming language)"), it denotes function attributes: like: `@safe`, `@nogc`, user defined `@('from_user')` which can be evaluated at compile time (with `__traits`) or `@property` to declare properties, which are functions that can be syntactically treated as if they were fields or variables.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-28)
*   In [DIGITAL Command Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language "DIGITAL Command Language"), the @ character was the command used to execute a command procedure. To run the command procedure VMSINSTAL.COM, one would type `@VMSINSTAL` at the command prompt.
*   In the [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") (DNS), @ is used to represent the `$ORIGIN`, typically the "root" of the domain without a prefixed sub-domain. (Ex: wikipedia.org vs. www.wikipedia.org)
*   In [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language) "Forth (programming language)"), it is used to fetch values from the address on the top of the stack. The operator is pronounced as "fetch".
*   In [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell "Haskell"), it is used in so-called _as-patterns_. This notation can be used to give aliases to [patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching "Pattern matching"), making them more readable.
*   in [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML"), it can be encoded as `&commat;`[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-29)
*   In [J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language) "J (programming language)"), denotes [function composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition").
*   In [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)"), it has been used to denote [annotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation "Java annotation"), a kind of metadata, since version 5.0.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-30)
*   In [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language) "Julia (programming language)"), it denotes the invocation of a macro.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-31)
*   In [LiveCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveCode "LiveCode"), it is prefixed to a parameter to indicate that the parameter is [passed by reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_by_reference "Pass by reference").
*   In an [LXDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXDE "LXDE") autostart file (as used, for example, on the [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi "Raspberry Pi") computer), @ is prefixed to a command to indicate that the command should be automatically re-executed if it crashes.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-32)
*   In a [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile "Makefile"), @ specifies to not output the command before it is executed.
*   In [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language) "ML (programming language)"), it denotes list concatenation.
*   In [modal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic "Modal logic"), specifically when representing [possible worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world "Possible world"), @ is sometimes used as a logical symbol to denote the actual world (the world we are "at").
*   In [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C "Objective-C"), @ is prefixed to language-specific keywords such as @implementation and to form string literals.
*   In InterSystems [ObjectScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cach%C3%A9_ObjectScript "Caché ObjectScript"), @ is the indirection operator, enabling dynamic runtime substitution of part or all of a command line, a command, or a command argument.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-33)
*   In [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal (programming language)"), @ is the "address of" operator (it tells the location at which a variable is found).
*   In [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl"), @ prefixes [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(programming) "Variable (programming)") which contain [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure "Array data structure")`@array`, including array [slices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_slicing#1987:_Perl "Array slicing")`@array[2..5,7,9]` and [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Associative_arrays "Hash table") slices `@hash{'foo', 'bar', 'baz'}` or `@hash{qw(foo bar baz)}`. This use is known as a _[sigil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil\_(computer\_programming) "Sigil (computer programming)")_.
*   In [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "PHP"), it is used just before an [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(programming) "Expression (programming)") to make the [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing) "Interpreter (computing)") suppress errors that would be generated from that expression.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-34)
*   In [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)") 2.4 and up, it is used to [decorate a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics#Decorators "Python syntax and semantics") (wrap the function in another one at creation time). In Python 3.5 and up, it is also used as an [overloadable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overload_(programming) "Overload (programming)")[matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication "Matrix multiplication") operator.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-35)
*   In [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) "R (programming language)") and [S-PLUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-PLUS "S-PLUS"), it is used to extract slots from S4 objects.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-36)
*   In [Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_Razor "ASP.NET Razor"), it is used for [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)") code blocks.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-37)
*   In [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language) "Ruby (programming language)"), it functions as a sigil: `@` prefixes [instance variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_variable "Instance variable"), and `@@` prefixes [class variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_variable "Class variable").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-38)
*   In [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language) "Rust (programming language)"), it is used to bind values matched by a pattern to a variable.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-39)
*   In [Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language) "Scala (programming language)"), it is used to denote annotations (as in Java), and also to bind names to subpatterns in pattern-matching expressions.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-40)
*   In [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language) "Swift (programming language)"), `@` prefixes "annotations" that can be applied to classes or members. Annotations tell the compiler to apply special semantics to the declaration like keywords, without adding keywords to the language.
*   In [T-SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-SQL "T-SQL"), `@` prefixes variables and `@@` prefixes "niladic" system functions.
*   In several [xBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBase "XBase")-type programming languages, like [DBASE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBASE "DBASE"), [FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro "FoxPro")/[Visual FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro "Visual FoxPro") and [Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language) "Clipper (programming language)"), it is used to denote position on the screen. For example: `@1,1 SAY "HELLO"` to show the word "HELLO" in line 1, column 1. 
    *   In FoxPro/Visual FoxPro, it is also used to indicate explicit [pass by reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_by_reference "Pass by reference") of variables when calling [procedures or functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine "Subroutine") (but it is not an [address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address "Memory address")[operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(programming) "Operator (programming)")).[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-41)

*   In a Windows [Batch file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file "Batch file"), an `@` at the start of a line suppresses the [echoing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(command) "Echo (command)") of that command. In other words, is the same as `ECHO OFF` applied to the current line only. Normally a Windows command is executed and takes effect from the next line onward, but `@` is a rare example of a command that takes effect immediately. It is most commonly used in the form `@echo off` which not only switches off echoing but prevents the command line itself from being echoed.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-42)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-43)
*   In [Windows PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell "Windows PowerShell"), @ is used as array operator for array and hash table literals and for enclosing here-string literals.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-44)

### Gender neutrality in Spanish

In [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language"), where many words end in "-o" when in the masculine [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender") and end "-a" in the feminine, @ is sometimes used as a [gender-neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_pronoun "Gender-neutral pronoun") substitute for the default "o" ending.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-45) For example, the word _amigos_ traditionally represents not only male friends, but also a mixed group, or where the genders are not known. The proponents of gender-inclusive language would replace it with _amig@s_ in these latter two cases, and use _amigos_ only when the group referred to is all-male and _amigas_ only when the group is all female. The [Real Academia Española](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Academia_Espa%C3%B1ola "Real Academia Española") disapproves of this usage.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#cite_note-46)

In many languages other than English, although most typewriters included the symbol, the use of @ was less common before email became widespread in the mid-1990s.

*   In [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language"), it is called _[arroba](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/arroba#Portuguese "wikt:arroba")_ (from the Arabic _ar-roub_, ‏[اَلرُّبْع](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%B9#Arabic "wikt:ربع")‎). The word _[arroba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arroba "Arroba")_ is also used for a weight measure in Portuguese. One arroba is equivalent to 32 old Portuguese pounds, approximately 14.7 kg (32 lb), and both the weight and the symbol are called _arroba_. In Brazil, [cattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle "Cattle") are still priced by the _arroba_– now rounded to 15 kg (33 lb). This naming is because the at sign was used to represent this measure.
*   In [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language "Romanian language"), it is most commonly called _at_, but also colloquially called _[coadă](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coad%C4%83 "wikt:coadă") de [maimuță](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maimu%C8%9B%C4%83 "wikt:maimuță")_ ("monkey tail") or _a-rond_. The latter is commonly used, and it comes from the word _round_ (from its shape), but that is nothing like the mathematical symbol _A-rond_ (rounded A). Others call it _aron_, or _la_ (Romanian word for 'at').

*   In [Spanish-speaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language") countries, it is called _[arroba](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/arroba#Spanish "wikt:arroba")_ (from the Arabic _ar-roub_, which denotes a pre-metric unit of weight).

*   In [Swiss German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_German "Swiss German"), it is commonly called _Affenschwanz_ ('monkey-tail').

*   In [Tagalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog_language "Tagalog language"), the word _[at](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/at#Tagalog "wikt:at")_ means 'and', so the symbol is used like an ampersand in colloquial writing such as text messages (e.g. _magluto @ kumain_, 'cook and eat').
