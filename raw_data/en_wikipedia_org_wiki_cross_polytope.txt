A 2-dimensional cross-polytope is a square, a 3-dimensional cross-polytope is a regular octahedron , and a 4-dimensional cross-polytope is a 16-cell . Its facets are simplexes of the previous dimension, while the cross-polytope's vertex figure is another cross-polytope from the previous dimension.

The vertices of a cross-polytope can be chosen as the unit vectors pointing along each co-ordinate axis – i.e. all the permutations of (±1, 0, 0, ..., 0) . The cross-polytope is the convex hull of its vertices. 
The n -dimensional cross-polytope can also be defined as the closed unit ball (or, according to some authors, its boundary) in the ℓ 1 -norm on R n , those points x = ( x 1 , x 2 ..., x n ) satisfying | x 1 | + | x 2 | + ⋯ ⋯ + | x n | ≤ ≤ 1.

{\displaystyle |x_{1}|+|x_{2}|+\cdots +|x_{n}|\leq 1.} An n -orthoplex can be constructed as a bipyramid with an ( n −1)-orthoplex base.

The cross-polytope is the dual polytope of the hypercube . The vertex-edge graph of an n -dimensional cross-polytope is the Turán graph T (2 n , n ) (also known as a cocktail party graph [ 4 ] ).

Low-dimensional examples [ edit ] In 1 dimension the cross-polytope is a line segment , which can be chosen as the interval [−1, +1].

In 2 dimensions the cross-polytope is a square . If the vertices are chosen as {(±1, 0), (0, ±1)}, the square's sides are at right angles to the axes; in this orientation a square is often called a diamond .

In 3 dimensions the cross-polytope is a regular octahedron —one of the five convex regular polyhedra known as the Platonic solids .

The 4-dimensional cross-polytope also goes by the name hexadecachoron or 16-cell . It is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes . These 4-polytopes were first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century. The vertices of the 4-dimensional hypercube, or tesseract , can be divided into two sets of eight, the convex hull of each set forming a cross-polytope. Moreover, the polytope known as the 24-cell can be constructed by symmetrically arranging three cross-polytopes.

[ 5 ] n dimensions [ edit ] The cross-polytope family is one of three regular polytope families, labeled by Coxeter as β n , the other two being the hypercube family, labeled as γ n , and the simplex family, labeled as α n . A fourth family, the infinite tessellations of hypercubes , he labeled as δ n .

[ 6 ] The n -dimensional cross-polytope has 2 n vertices, and 2 n facets (( n − 1)-dimensional components) all of which are ( n − 1)- simplices . The vertex figures are all ( n − 1)-cross-polytopes. The Schläfli symbol of the cross-polytope is {3,3,...,3,4}.

The dihedral angle of the n -dimensional cross-polytope is δ δ n = arccos ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 − − n n ) {\displaystyle \delta _{n}=\arccos \left({\frac {2-n}{n}}\right)} . This gives: δ 2 = arccos(0/2) = 90°, δ 3 = arccos(−1/3) = 109.47°, δ 4 = arccos(−2/4) = 120°, δ 5 = arccos(−3/5) = 126.87°, ... δ ∞ = arccos(−1) = 180°.

The hypervolume of the n -dimensional cross-polytope is 2 n n !

.

{\displaystyle {\frac {2^{n}}{n!}}.} For each pair of non-opposite vertices, there is an edge joining them. More generally, each set of k + 1 orthogonal vertices corresponds to a distinct k -dimensional component which contains them. The number of k -dimensional components (vertices, edges, faces, ..., facets) in an n -dimensional cross-polytope is thus given by (see binomial coefficient ): 2 k + 1 ( n k + 1 ) {\displaystyle 2^{k+1}{n \choose {k+1}}} [ 7 ] The extended f-vector for an n -orthoplex can be computed by ( 1 ,2) n , like the coefficients of polynomial products . For example a 16-cell is ( 1 ,2) 4 = ( 1 ,4,4) 2 = ( 1 ,8,24,32,16).

There are many possible orthographic projections that can show the cross-polytopes as 2-dimensional graphs.

Petrie polygon projections map the points into a regular 2 n -gon or lower order regular polygons. A second projection takes the 2( n −1)-gon petrie polygon of the lower dimension, seen as a bipyramid , projected down the axis, with 2 vertices mapped into the center.

Kusner's conjecture states that this set of 2 d points is the largest possible equidistant set for this distance.

[ 8 ] Generalized orthoplex [ edit ] Regular complex polytopes can be defined in complex Hilbert space called generalized orthoplexes (or cross polytopes), β p n = 2 {3} 2 {3}...

2 {4} p , or ..

. Real solutions exist with p = 2, i.e. β 2 n = β n = 2 {3} 2 {3}...

2 {4} 2 = {3,3,..,4}. For p > 2, they exist in C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {\mathbb {C} } ^{n}} . A p -generalized n -orthoplex has pn vertices.

Generalized orthoplexes have regular simplexes (real) as facets .

[ 9 ] Generalized orthoplexes make complete multipartite graphs , β p 2 make K p , p for complete bipartite graph , β p 3 make K p , p , p for complete tripartite graphs. β p n creates K p n . An orthogonal projection can be defined that maps all the vertices equally-spaced on a circle, with all pairs of vertices connected, except multiples of n . The regular polygon perimeter in these orthogonal projections is called a petrie polygon .
