[ 1 ] Species are classified into one of nine Red List Categories: extinct , extinct in the wild , critically endangered , endangered , vulnerable , near threatened , least concern , data deficient , and not evaluated .

[ 2 ] The IUCN defined an animal with the conservation status of lower risk is one with populations levels high enough to ensure its survival.

[ 3 ] Animals with this status did not qualify as being threatened or extinct. However, natural disasters or certain human activities would cause them to change to either of these classifications.

[ 4 ] When it was in use, this classification was sub-divided into three types: Conservation dependent - where cessation of current conservation measures may result in it being classified at a higher risk level.

Near threatened - may become vulnerable to endangerment in the near future but not meeting the criteria.

Least concern - where neither of the two above apply.
