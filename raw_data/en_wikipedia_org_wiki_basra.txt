It is the capital of the eponymous Basra Governorate , as well as the third largest city in Iraq overall, behind Baghdad and Mosul . Located near the Iran–Iraq border at the north-easternmost extent of the Arabian Peninsula , the city is situated along the banks of the Shatt al-Arab that empties into the Persian Gulf . It is consistently one of the hottest cities in Iraq, with summer temperatures regularly exceeding 50 °C (122 °F).

Built in 636 as a military camp , Basra played an important role as a regional hub of knowledge, trade and commerce during the Islamic Golden Age and is home to the first mosque built outside the Arabian Peninsula . It was a center of the slave trade in Mesopotamia, until the Zanj rebellion in 871 . Historically, Basra is one of the ports from which the fictional Sinbad the Sailor embarked on his journeys. It has experienced numerous ruling shifts. In 1258, the city was sacked by the Mongols. Basra came under Portuguese control in 1526 and later fell under the control of the Ottomans as part of the Basra Eyalet , one of the provinces comprising Ottoman Iraq .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] During World War I , British forces captured Basra in 1917. It was incorporated into Mandatory Iraq, under the framework Mandate for Mesopotamia after 1921, which later became the independent Kingdom of Iraq in 1932.

Since Iraq's independence, the wars Iraq has fought have made Basra an active battlefield due to its strategic location. During the Iran–Iraq War , the city was heavily shelled and besieged by Iranian forces. As a result of the war, half of the city's population fled. It suffered extensive damage again during the Gulf War due to coalition attacks. In 1991 and 1999 , Basra was the site of two uprisings against Saddam Hussein . On April 6, 2003, the city was occupied by the United Kingdom and United States-led coalition , becoming the first city to be captured during the invasion of Iraq , enduring further devastation. During the war , it fell under the control of Shia factions such as Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army , who were later removed in 2008 . Additionally, Basra was targeted by bombings in 2011 and 2012 , and was impacted by the Islamist insurgency and the war with Islamic State from 2013 to 2017.

With its strategic location and abundant oil reserves, Basra has become one of the major industrial cities in the region. As the country’s only coastal region, along with its adjoining governorate, Basra serves as a crucial transport hub. After the Iraq war ended, Basra experienced a period of prosperity and development, with numerous reconstruction projects funded by foreign investments, including the Grand Faw Port , which have gained global attention. Today, the majority of its population consists of Arab Shia Muslims, with a large Sunni minority.

Etymology [ edit ] View of Basra in c.

1695 , by Dutch cartographer Isaak de Graaf The city has had many names throughout history, Basrah being the most common. In Arabic, the word baṣrah means "the overwatcher", which may have been an allusion to the city's origin as an Arab military base against the Sassanids . Others have argued that the name is derived from the Aramaic word basratha , meaning "place of huts, settlement".

[ 5 ] History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of Basra Ashar Creek and bazaar, c. 1915 Foundation by the Rashidun Caliphate (632–661) [ edit ] The ‘Ashshār creek in Basrah Town The city was founded at the beginning of the Islamic era in 636 and began as a garrison encampment for Arab tribesmen constituting the armies of the Rashidun Caliph Umar .

[ 6 ] A tell a few kilometers south of the present city still marks the original site which was a military site.

[ 7 ] While defeating the forces of the Sassanid Empire there, the Muslim commander Utbah ibn Ghazwan erected his camp on the site of an old Persian military settlement called Vaheštābād Ardašīr , which was destroyed by the Arabs.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] While the name Al-Basrah in Arabic can mean "the overwatch", other sources claim that the name actually originates from the Persian word Bas-rāh or Bassorāh, meaning "where many ways come together".

[ 10 ] In 639, Umar established this encampment as a city with five districts, and appointed Abu Musa al-Ash'ari as its first governor.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The city was built in a circular plan according to the Partho-Sasanian architecture .

[ 13 ] Abu Musa led the conquest of Khuzestan from 639 to 642, and was ordered by Umar to aid Uthman ibn Abi al-As , then fighting Persia from a new, more easterly miṣr at Tawwaj .

[ 14 ] In 650, the Rashidun Caliph Uthman reorganised the Persian frontier, installed ʿAbdullah ibn Amir as Basra's governor, and put the military's southern wing under Basra's control.

[ 15 ] Ibn Amir led his forces to their final victory over Yazdegerd III , the Sassanid King of Kings .

[ 16 ] In 656, Uthman was murdered and Ali was appointed Caliph.

[ 17 ] Ali first installed Uthman ibn Hanif as Basra's governor, who was followed by ʿAbdullah ibn ʿAbbas.

[ 17 ] These men held the city for Ali until the latter's death in 661.

[ 17 ] Basra's infrastructure was planned.

[ 18 ] Why Basra was chosen as a site for the new city remains unclear.

[ 18 ] The original site lay 15km from the Shatt al-Arab and thus lacked access to maritime trade and, more importantly, to fresh water.

[ 18 ] Additionally, neither historical texts nor archaeological finds indicate that there was much of an agricultural hinterland in the area before Basra was founded.

[ 18 ] Indeed, in an anecdote related by al-Baladhuri , al-Ahnaf ibn Qays pleaded to the caliph Umar that, whereas other Muslim settlers were established in well-watered areas with extensive farmland, the people of Basra had only "reedy salt marsh which never dries up and where pasture never grows, bounded on the east by brackish water and on the west by waterless desert. We have no cultivation or stock farming to provide us with our livelihood or food, which comes to us as through the throat of an ostrich ." [ 19 ] Nevertheless, Basra overcame these natural disadvantages and rapidly grew into the second-largest city in Iraq, if not the entire Islamic world. Its role as a military encampment meant that the soldiers had to be fed, and since those soldiers were receiving government salaries, they had money to spend.

[ 20 ] Thus, both the government and private entrepreneurs invested heavily in developing a vast agricultural infrastructure in the Basra region.

[ 20 ] These investments were made with the expectation of a profitable return, indicating the value of the Basra food market.

[ 20 ] Although African Zanj slaves from the Indian Ocean slave trade were put to work on these construction projects, most of the labor was done by free men working for wages.

[ 21 ] Governors sometimes directly supervised these projects, but usually they simply assigned the land while most of the financing was done by private investors.

[ 19 ] The result of these investments was a massive irrigation system covering some 57,000 hectares between the Shatt al-Arab and the now-dry western channel of the Tigris.

[ 22 ] This system was first reported in 962, when just 8,000 hectares of it remained in use, for the cultivation of date palms , while the rest had become desert.

[ 22 ] This system consists of a regular pattern of two-meter-high ridges in straight lines, separated by old canal beds.

[ 22 ] The ridges are extremely saline, with salt deposits up to 20 centimeters thick, and are completely barren.

[ 22 ] The former canal beds are less salty and can support a small population of salt-resistant plants.

[ 22 ] Contemporary authors recorded how the Zanj slaves were put to work clearing the fields of salty topsoil and putting them into piles; the result was the ridges that remain today.

[ 23 ] This represents an enormous amount of work: H.S. Nelson calculated that 45 million tons of earth were moved in total, and with his extremely high estimate of one man moving two tons of soil per day, this would have taken a decade of strenuous work by 25,000 men.

[ 19 ] Ultimately, Basra's irrigation canals were unsustainable, because they were built at too little of a slope for the water flow to carry salt deposits away.

[ 23 ] This required the clearing of salty topsoil by the Zanj slaves in order to keep the fields from becoming too saline to grow crops.

[ 23 ] After Basra was sacked in by Zanj rebels in the late 800s and then by the Qarmatians in the early 900s, there was no financial incentive to invest in restoring the irrigation system, and the infrastructure was almost completely abandoned.

[ 23 ] Finally, in the late 900s, the city of Basra was entirely relocated, with the old site being abandoned and a new one developing on the banks of the Shatt al-Arab, where it has remained ever since.

[ 19 ] Umayyad Caliphate: 661–750 [ edit ] The Sufyanids held Basra until Yazid I 's death in 683.

[ 24 ] The Sufyanids' first governor was Umayyad ʿAbdullah, a renowned military leader, commanding fealty and financial demands from Karballah, but poor governor.

[ 25 ] In 664, Mu'awiya I replaced him with Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan , often called "ibn Abihi" ("son of his own father"), who became infamous for his draconian rules regarding public order.

[ 26 ] On Ziyad's death in 673, his son ʿUbayd Allah ibn Ziyad became governor. In 680, Yazid I ordered ʿUbayd Allah to keep order in Kufa as a reaction to Husayn ibn Ali 's popularity as the grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad .

[ 27 ] 'Ubayd Allah took over the control of Kufa .

[ 27 ] Husayn sent his cousin as an ambassador to the people of Kufa, but ʿUbaydullah executed Husayn cousin Muslim ibn Aqil amid fears of an uprising.

[ 27 ] ʿUbayd Allah amassed an army of thousands of soldiers and fought Husayn's army of approximately 70 in a place called Karbala near Kufa.

[ 28 ] ʿUbayd Allah's army was victorious; Husayn and his followers were killed and their heads were sent to Yazid as proof.

[ 28 ] Ibn al-Harith spent his year in office trying to put down Nafi' ibn al-Azraq's Kharijite uprising in Khuzestan . In 685, Ibn al-Zubayr, requiring a practical ruler, appointed Umar ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Ma'mar [ 29 ] Finally, Ibn al-Zubayr appointed his own brother Mus'ab. In 686, the revolutionary al-Mukhtar led an insurrection at Kufa, and put an end to ʿUbaydullah ibn Ziyad near Mosul . In 687, Musʿab defeated al-Mukhtar with the help of Kufans who Mukhtar exiled.

[ 30 ] Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan reconquered Basra in 691, and Basra remained loyal to his governor al-Hajjaj during Ibn Ashʿath's mutiny (699–702). However, Basra did support the rebellion of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab against Yazid II during the 720s.

Abbasid Caliphate and its Golden Age: 750–1258 [ edit ] In the late 740s, Basra fell to as-Saffah of the Abbasid Caliphate .  During the time of the Abbasids, Basra became an intellectual center and home to the elite Basra School of Grammar , the rival and sister school of the Kufa School of Grammar .  Several outstanding intellectuals of the age were Basrans; Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham , the Arab literary giant al-Jahiz , and the Sufi mystic Rabia Basri . The Zanj Rebellion by the agricultural slaves of the lowlands affected the area. In 871, the Zanj sacked Basra.

[ 31 ] In 923, the Qarmatians , an extremist Muslim sect, invaded and devastated Basra.

[ 31 ] From 945 to 1055, the Iranian Buyid dynasty ruled Baghdad and most of Iraq. Abu al Qasim al-Baridis, who still controlled Basra and Wasit , were defeated and their lands taken by the Buyids in 947.

Adud al-Dawla and his sons Diya' al-Dawla and Samsam al-Dawla were the Buyid rulers of Basra during the 970s, 980s and 990s.  Sanad al-Dawla al-Habashi ( c.

921 –977), the brother of the Emir of Iraq Izz al-Dawla , was governor of Basra and built a library of 15,000 books.

Basra designed by the Portuguese at the end of the 16th century, according to the representation of the "Lyvro de plantaforma of the fortresses of India" codex of São julião da Barra The Oghuz Turk Tughril Beg was the leader of the Seljuks, who expelled the Shiite Buyid dynasty. He was the first Seljuk ruler to style himself Sultan and Protector of the Abbasid Caliphate.

The Great Friday Mosque was constructed in Basra. In 1122, Imad ad-Din Zengi received Basra as a fief.

[ 32 ] In 1126, Zengi suppressed a revolt and in 1129, Dabis looted the Basra state treasury.
A 1200 map "on the eve of the Mongol invasions" shows the Abbasid Caliphate as ruling lower Iraq and, presumably, Basra.

The Assassin Rashid-ad-Din-Sinan was born in Basra on or between 1131 and 1135.

Mongol rule and thereafter: 1258–1500s [ edit ] Further information: Safavid occupation of Basra In 1258, the Mongols under Hulegu Khan sacked Baghdad and ended Abbasid rule. By some accounts, Basra capitulated to the Mongols to avoid a massacre. The Mamluk Bahri dynasty map (1250–1382) shows Basra as being under their area of control, and the Mongol Dominions map (1300–1405) shows Basra as being under Mongol control. In 1290 [ 33 ] fighting erupted at the Persian Gulf port of Basra among the Genoese , between the Guelph and the Ghibelline factions.

Ibn Battuta visited Basra in the 14th century, noting it "was renowned throughout the whole world, spacious in area and elegant in its courts, remarkable for its numerous fruit-gardens and its choice fruits, since it is the meeting place of the two seas, the salt and the fresh." [ 34 ] Ibn Battuta also noted that Basra consisted of three-quarters: the Hudayl quarter, the Banu Haram quarter, and the Iranian quarter ( mahallat al-Ajam ).

[ 35 ] Fred Donner adds: "If the first two reveal that Basra was still predominantly an Arab town, the existence of an Iranian quarter clearly reveals the legacy of long centuries of intimate contact between Basra and the Iranian plateau." [ 35 ] The Arab Al-Mughamis tribe established control over Basra in the early fifteenth century, however, they quickly fell under influence of the Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu , successively.

[ 36 ] [ a ] The Al-Mughamis' control of Basra had become nominal by 1436; de facto control of Basra from 1436 to 1508 was in the hands of the Moshasha .

[ 36 ] [ b ] In the latter year, during the reign of King ( Shah ) Ismail I ( r.

1501–1524), the first Safavid ruler, Basra and the Moshasha became part of the Safavid Empire.

[ 39 ] [ c ] This was the first time Basra had come under Safavid suzerainty. In 1524, following Ismail I's death, the local ruling dynasty of Basra, the Al-Mughamis, resumed effective control over the city.

[ 36 ] Twelve years later, in 1536, during the Ottoman–Safavid War of 1532–1555 , the Bedouin ruler of Basra, Rashid ibn Mughamis, acknowledged Suleiman the Magnificent as his suzerain who in turn confirmed him as governor of Basra.

[ 39 ] The Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire exercised a great deal of independence, and they even often raised their own troops.

[ 39 ] Though Basra had submitted to the Ottomans, the Ottoman hold over Basra was tenuous at the time.

[ 38 ] This changed a decade later; in 1546, following a tribal struggle involving the Moshasha and the local ruler of Zakiya (near Basra), the Ottomans sent a force to Basra. This resulted in tighter (but still, nominal) Ottoman control over Basra.

In 1523, the Portuguese under the command of António Tenreiro crossed from Aleppo to Basra.

Nuno da Cunha took Basra in 1529.

[ 42 ] In 1550, the local Kingdom of Basra and tribal rulers trusted the Portuguese against the Ottomans, from then on the Portuguese threatened to invoke an invasion and conquest of Basra several times. From 1595 the Portuguese acted as military protectors of Basra, [ 43 ] and in 1624 the Portuguese assisted the Ottoman Pasha of Basra in repelling a Persian invasion. The Portuguese were granted a share of the customs revenue and freedom from tolls. From about 1625 until 1668, Basra and the Delta marshlands were in the hands of local chieftains independent of the Ottoman administration at Baghdad.

Ottoman and British rule [ edit ] See also: Basra Eyalet and Basra Vilayet Iraqi girls, c. 1917 Basra was, for a long time, a flourishing commercial and cultural center. It was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1668. It was fought over by Turks and Persians and was the scene of repeated attempts at resistance. From 1697 to 1701, Basra was once again under Safavid control .

[ 44 ] The Zand dynasty under Karim Khan Zand briefly occupied Basra after a long siege in 1775–9. The Zands attempted at introducing Usuli form of Shiism on a basically Akhbari Shia Basrans. The shortness of the Zand rule rendered this untenable.

In 1911, the Encyclopaedia Britannica reported "about 4000 Jews and perhaps 6000 Christians" [ 45 ] living in Basra Vilayet, but no Turks other than Ottoman officials. In 1884 the Ottomans responded to local pressure from the Shi'as of the south by detaching the southern districts of the Baghdad vilayet and creating a new vilayet of Basra .

During World War I , British forces captured Basra from the Ottomans, occupying the city on 22 November 1914. British officials and engineers (including Sir George Buchanan ) subsequently modernized Basra's harbor, which due to the increased commercial activity in the area became one of the most important ports in the Persian Gulf, developing new mercantile links with India and East Asia .

[ 48 ] The University of Basrah was founded in 1964. By 1977, the population had risen to a peak population of some 1.5 million.

[ 46 ] The population declined during the Iran–Iraq War , being under 900,000 in the late 1980s, possibly reaching a low point of just over 400,000 during the worst of the war.

[ 46 ] The city was repeatedly shelled by Iran and was the site of many fierce battles, such as Operation Ramadan (1982) and the Siege of Basra (1987).

[ 46 ] The airstrikes resulted in missiles landing in the al-Jumhuriya neighborhood of Basra, killed 11 Iraqi civilians and wounding 59.

[ 46 ] General Anthony Zinni , then commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, acknowledged that it was possible that "a missile may have been errant." [ 46 ] While such casualty numbers pale in comparison to later events, the bombing occurred one day after Arab foreign ministers, meeting in Egypt, refused to condemn four days of air strikes against Iraq in December 1998.

[ 46 ] This was described by Iraqi information minister Human Abdel-Khaliq [ d ] as giving U.S.-led forces "an Arab green card" to continue their involvement in the conflict.

[ 49 ] A second revolt in 1999 led to mass executions by the Iraqi government in and around Basra. Subsequently, the Iraqi government deliberately neglected the city, and much commerce was diverted to Umm Qasr .

[ 36 ] ^ The Moshasha were a tribal confederation of radical Shi'ites found mainly on the edges of the marshes alongside the Safavid province of Arabestan (present-day Khuzestan ). They often acted as Safavid proxies and were led by a Safavid governor. They participated in campaigns against the Arabs of southern Iraq and Basra. Matthee notes that even though they were nominal Safavid subjects, they had a broad scope of autonomy, and their territory served as a buffer between the Ottomans and the Iranians.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] ^ according to Floor (2008), a certain Shaykh Afrasiyab (the local ruler of Basra, not to be mistaken with the later Afrasiyab of Basra) came to Shiraz in 1504 to pledge his allegiance to Ismail I.

[ 40 ] Ismail I in turn confirmed him in his possessions and position as governor ( vali ) of Basra.

[ 40 ] Thus, Floor's stance differs slightly.

^ His proper name and position description appears to be in error, in that he appears to have held a more junior role at the time. Humam Abd al-Khaliq Abd al-Ghafur was Iraqi Information Minister between 1997 and 2001. The Iraqi Information Minister between 1991 and 1996 was Hamid Yusuf Hammadi.

These air strikes, by British and USAF warplanes and U.S. cruise missiles, were said to be in response to a release of a report by UN weapons inspectors stating that, as of 1998, the government of Iraq was obstructing their inspection work. Following the four days of bombing in December, the Iraqi government commenced challenging the "no fly zones" unilaterally imposed on the country by the United States, following the 1991 Persian Gulf war. During the month of January 1999, there were more than 100 incursions by Iraqi aircraft and 20 instances of Iraqi surface-to-air missiles being filed. The January bombing of Basra occurred in the context of retaliatory attacks by the United States.
