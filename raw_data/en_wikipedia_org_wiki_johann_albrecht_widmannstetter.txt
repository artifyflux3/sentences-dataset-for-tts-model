Life [ edit ] Widmannstetter was born in Nellingen / Blaubeuren near Ulm . He studied law, theology and oriental languages in Tübingen . After 1527, he continued his studies in Italy , in Turin , Naples and Rome , focusing on the languages of Syriac and Arabic . In 1533, Widmannstetter became secretary to Pope Clement VII . In the same year, he delivered a series of lectures in Rome, outlining Nicolaus Copernicus ' theory to the pope and the cardinals, with which both were impressed.

Pope Clement VII died in 1534, and was succeeded by Pope Paul III ; Widmannstetter continued as his secretary.

After 1535, Widmannstetter was secretary of Cardinal Nikolaus von Schönberg . Impressed by Widmannstetter's lessons on Copernicus' ideas, the Cardinal wrote a letter to Copernicus in 1536, urging him to publish (which he would do only in 1543, shortly before his death).

The rest of Widmanstetter's career was focussed on orientalism , to which he contributed a great deal, collecting hundreds of manuscripts in Hebrew , Arabic and Syriac . Widmannstetter is considered to be a founder of European orientalism. He died in Regensburg , and his personal library was acquired by Albert V, Duke of Bavaria .
