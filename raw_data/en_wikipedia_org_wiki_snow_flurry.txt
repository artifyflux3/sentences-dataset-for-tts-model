The US National Weather Service defines snow flurries as intermittent light snow that produces no measurable precipitation (trace amounts).

[ 1 ] In contrast, bursts of snowfall that do result in measurable snow accumulation are called snow showers .

[ 2 ] Environment Canada uses a different definition for flurries, approximately equivalent to 'snow shower'.
