( May 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , a quasisymmetric homeomorphism between metric spaces is a map that generalizes bi-Lipschitz maps. While bi-Lipschitz maps shrink or expand the diameter of a set by no more than a multiplicative factor, quasisymmetric maps satisfy the weaker geometric property that they preserve the relative sizes of sets: if two sets A and B have diameters t and are no more than distance t apart, then the ratio of their sizes changes by no more than a multiplicative constant. These maps are also related to quasiconformal maps, since in many circumstances they are in fact equivalent.

[ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] Let ( X , d X ) and ( Y , d Y ) be two metric spaces . A homeomorphism f : X → Y is said to be η-quasisymmetric if there is an increasing function η : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) such that for any triple x , y , z of distinct points in X , we have d Y ( f ( x ) , f ( y ) ) d Y ( f ( x ) , f ( z ) ) ≤ ≤ η η ( d X ( x , y ) d X ( x , z ) ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {d_{Y}(f(x),f(y))}{d_{Y}(f(x),f(z))}}\leq \eta \left({\frac {d_{X}(x,y)}{d_{X}(x,z)}}\right).} Basic properties [ edit ] Inverses are quasisymmetric If f : X → Y is an invertible η -quasisymmetric map as above, then its inverse map is η η ′ {\displaystyle \eta '} -quasisymmetric, where η η ′ ( t ) = 1 / η η − − 1 ( 1 / t ) .

{\textstyle \eta '(t)=1/\eta ^{-1}(1/t).} Quasisymmetric maps preserve relative sizes of sets If A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} are subsets of X {\displaystyle X} and A {\displaystyle A} is a subset of B {\displaystyle B} , then η η − − 1 ( diam ⁡ ⁡ B diam ⁡ ⁡ A ) 2 ≤ ≤ diam ⁡ ⁡ f ( B ) diam ⁡ ⁡ f ( A ) ≤ ≤ 2 η η ( diam ⁡ ⁡ B diam ⁡ ⁡ A ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\eta ^{-1}({\frac {\operatorname {diam} B}{\operatorname {diam} A}})}{2}}\leq {\frac {\operatorname {diam} f(B)}{\operatorname {diam} f(A)}}\leq 2\eta \left({\frac {\operatorname {diam} B}{\operatorname {diam} A}}\right).} Examples [ edit ] Weakly quasisymmetric maps [ edit ] A map f:X→Y is said to be H-weakly-quasisymmetric for some H > 0 {\displaystyle H>0} if for all triples of distinct points x , y , z {\displaystyle x,y,z} in X {\displaystyle X} , then | f ( x ) − − f ( y ) | ≤ ≤ H | f ( x ) − − f ( z ) | whenever | x − − y | ≤ ≤ | x − − z | {\displaystyle |f(x)-f(y)|\leq H|f(x)-f(z)|\;\;\;{\text{ whenever }}\;\;\;|x-y|\leq |x-z|} Not all weakly quasisymmetric maps are quasisymmetric. However, if X {\displaystyle X} is connected and X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are doubling , then all weakly quasisymmetric maps are quasisymmetric. The appeal of this result is that proving weak-quasisymmetry is much easier than proving quasisymmetry directly, and in many natural settings the two notions are equivalent.

δ-monotone maps [ edit ] A monotone map f : H → H on a Hilbert space H is δ-monotone if for all x and y in H , ⟨ ⟨ f ( x ) − − f ( y ) , x − − y ⟩ ⟩ ≥ ≥ δ δ | f ( x ) − − f ( y ) | ⋅ ⋅ | x − − y | .

{\displaystyle \langle f(x)-f(y),x-y\rangle \geq \delta |f(x)-f(y)|\cdot |x-y|.} To grasp what this condition means geometrically, suppose f (0) = 0 and consider the above estimate when y = 0. Then it implies that the angle between the vector x and its image f ( x ) stays between 0 and arccos δ < π /2.

These maps are quasisymmetric, although they are a much narrower subclass of quasisymmetric maps. For example, while a general quasisymmetric map in the complex plane could map the real line to a set of Hausdorff dimension strictly greater than one, a δ -monotone will always map the real line to a rotated graph of a Lipschitz function L :ℝ → ℝ.

[ 2 ] Doubling measures [ edit ] The real line [ edit ] Quasisymmetric homeomorphisms of the real line to itself can be characterized in terms of their derivatives.

[ 3 ] An increasing homeomorphism f :ℝ → ℝ is quasisymmetric if and only if there is a constant C > 0 and  a doubling measure μ on the real line such that f ( x ) = C + ∫ ∫ 0 x d μ μ ( t ) .

{\displaystyle f(x)=C+\int _{0}^{x}\,d\mu (t).} Euclidean space [ edit ] An analogous result holds in Euclidean space. Suppose C = 0 and we rewrite the above equation for f as f ( x ) = 1 2 ∫ ∫ R ( x − − t | x − − t | + t | t | ) d μ μ ( t ) .

{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{2}}\int _{\mathbb {R} }\left({\frac {x-t}{|x-t|}}+{\frac {t}{|t|}}\right)d\mu (t).} Writing it this way, we can attempt to define a map using this same integral, but instead integrate (what is now a vector valued integrand) over ℝ n : if μ is a doubling measure on ℝ n and ∫ ∫ | x | > 1 1 | x | d μ μ ( x ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \int _{|x|>1}{\frac {1}{|x|}}\,d\mu (x)<\infty } then the map f ( x ) = 1 2 ∫ ∫ R n ( x − − y | x − − y | + y | y | ) d μ μ ( y ) {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{2}}\int _{\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\left({\frac {x-y}{|x-y|}}+{\frac {y}{|y|}}\right)\,d\mu (y)} is quasisymmetric (in fact, it is δ -monotone for some δ depending on the measure μ ).

[ 4 ] Quasisymmetry and quasiconformality in Euclidean space [ edit ] Let Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } and Ω Ω ′ {\displaystyle \Omega '} be open subsets of ℝ n . If f : Ω → Ω´ is η -quasisymmetric, then it is also K - quasiconformal , where K > 0 {\displaystyle K>0} is a constant depending on η η {\displaystyle \eta } .

Conversely, if f : Ω → Ω´ is K -quasiconformal and B ( x , 2 r ) {\displaystyle B(x,2r)} is contained in Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } , then f {\displaystyle f} is η -quasisymmetric on B ( x , 2 r ) {\displaystyle B(x,2r)} , where η η {\displaystyle \eta } depends only on K {\displaystyle K} .

Quasi-Möbius maps [ edit ] A related but weaker condition is the notion of quasi-Möbius maps where instead of the ratio only the cross-ratio is considered: [ 5 ] Definition [ edit ] Let ( X , d X ) and ( Y , d Y ) be two metric spaces and let η : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) be an increasing function. An η -quasi-Möbius homeomorphism f : X → Y is a homeomorphism for which for every quadruple x , y , z , t of distinct points in X , we have d Y ( f ( x ) , f ( z ) ) d Y ( f ( y ) , f ( t ) ) d Y ( f ( x ) , f ( y ) ) d Y ( f ( z ) , f ( t ) ) ≤ ≤ η η ( d X ( x , z ) d X ( y , t ) d X ( x , y ) d X ( z , t ) ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {d_{Y}(f(x),f(z))d_{Y}(f(y),f(t))}{d_{Y}(f(x),f(y))d_{Y}(f(z),f(t))}}\leq \eta \left({\frac {d_{X}(x,z)d_{X}(y,t)}{d_{X}(x,y)d_{X}(z,t)}}\right).} See also [ edit ] Douady–Earle extension References [ edit ] ^ Heinonen, Juha (2001).
