[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The society aims to introduce university students to the world of wine through regular tastings during the academic term, and other activities and events.  Membership is open to the public.

A number of past members have entered the international wine trade.

[ 4 ] In January 2013 the Society marked the 350th anniversary of the day diarist Samuel Pepys "drank a sort of French wine called Ho Bryan , that hath a good and most particular taste that I never met with."  Pepys graduated from Magdalene College in 1654.

[ 5 ] Members of Cambridge University Blind Wine Tasting Society (CUBWTS) participate in the annual Varsity blind wine tasting match , sponsored by Pol Roger , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] and other blind wine tasting competitions.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The history of these competitions were described in detail in the 2013 book "Reds, Whites & Varsity Blues:  60 years of the Oxford & Cambridge Blind Wine-Tasting Competition".
