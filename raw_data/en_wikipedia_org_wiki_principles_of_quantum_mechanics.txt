Kinematics of Spin Spin Dynamics Return of Orbital Degrees of Freedom Addition of Angular Momenta A Simple Example The General Problem Irreducible Tensor Operators Explanation of Some "Accidental" Degeneracies Variational and WKB Methods The Variational Method The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin Method Time-Independent Perturbation Theory The Formalism Some Examples Degenerate Perturbation Theory Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory The Problem First-Order Perturbation Theory Higher Orders in Perturbation Theory A General Discussion of Electromagnetic Interactions Interaction of Atoms with Electromagnetic Radiation Scattering Theory Introduction Recapitulation of One-Dimensional Scattering and Overview The Born Approximation (Time-Dependent Description) Born Again (The Time-Independent Approximation) The Partial Wave Expansion Two-Particle Scattering The Dirac Equation The Free-Particle Dirac Equation Electromagnetic Interaction of the Dirac Particle More on Relativistic Quantum Mechanics Path Integrals – II Derivation of the Path Integral Imaginary Time Formalism Spin and Fermion Path Integrals Summary Appendix Matrix Inversion Gaussian Integrals Complex Numbers The i ε ε {\displaystyle i\varepsilon } Prescription Reviews [ edit ] Physics Bulletin said about the book, "No matter how gently one introduces students to the concept of Dirac’s bras and kets, many are turned off. Shankar attacks the problem head-on in the first chapter, and in a very informal style suggests that there is nothing to be frightened of".

[ 5 ] American Scientist called it "An excellent text … The postulates of quantum mechanics and the mathematical underpinnings are discussed in a clear, succinct manner".
