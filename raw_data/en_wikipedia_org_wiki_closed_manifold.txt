In mathematics , a closed manifold is a manifold without boundary that is compact .
In comparison, an open manifold is a manifold without boundary that has only non-compact components.

Examples [ edit ] The only connected one-dimensional example is a circle . 
The sphere , torus , and the Klein bottle are all closed two-dimensional manifolds. The real projective space RP n is a closed n -dimensional manifold. The complex projective space CP n is a closed 2 n -dimensional manifold.

[ 1 ] A line is not closed because it is not compact. 
A closed disk is a compact two-dimensional manifold, but it is not closed because it has a boundary.

Properties [ edit ] Every closed manifold is a Euclidean neighborhood retract and thus has finitely generated homology groups.

[ 2 ] If M {\displaystyle M} is a closed connected n-manifold, the n-th homology group H n ( M ; Z ) {\displaystyle H_{n}(M;\mathbb {Z} )} is Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } or 0 depending on whether M {\displaystyle M} is orientable or not.

[ 3 ] Moreover, the torsion subgroup of the (n-1)-th homology group H n − − 1 ( M ; Z ) {\displaystyle H_{n-1}(M;\mathbb {Z} )} is 0 or Z 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{2}} depending on whether M {\displaystyle M} is orientable or not. This follows from an application of the universal coefficient theorem .

[ 4 ] Let R {\displaystyle R} be a commutative ring. For R {\displaystyle R} -orientable M {\displaystyle M} with
fundamental class [ M ] ∈ ∈ H n ( M ; R ) {\displaystyle [M]\in H_{n}(M;R)} , the map D : H k ( M ; R ) → → H n − − k ( M ; R ) {\displaystyle D:H^{k}(M;R)\to H_{n-k}(M;R)} defined by D ( α α ) = [ M ] ∩ ∩ α α {\displaystyle D(\alpha )=[M]\cap \alpha } is an isomorphism for all k. This is the Poincaré duality .

[ 5 ] In particular, every closed manifold is Z 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{2}} -orientable. So there is always an isomorphism H k ( M ; Z 2 ) ≅ ≅ H n − − k ( M ; Z 2 ) {\displaystyle H^{k}(M;\mathbb {Z} _{2})\cong H_{n-k}(M;\mathbb {Z} _{2})} .

Open manifolds [ edit ] For a connected manifold, "open" is equivalent to "without boundary and non-compact", but for a disconnected manifold, open is stronger. For instance, the disjoint union of a circle and a line is non-compact since a line is non-compact, but this is not an open manifold since the circle (one of its components) is compact.

Abuse of language [ edit ] Most books generally define a manifold as a space that is, locally, homeomorphic to Euclidean space (along with some other technical conditions), thus by this definition a manifold does not include its boundary when it is embedded in a larger space.  However, this definition doesn’t cover some basic objects such as a closed disk , so authors sometimes define a manifold with boundary and abusively say manifold without reference to the boundary. But normally, a compact manifold (compact with respect to its underlying topology) can synonymously be used for closed manifold if the usual definition for manifold is used.

The notion of a closed manifold is unrelated to that of a closed set .  A line is a closed subset of the plane, and it is a manifold,  but not a closed manifold.

Use in physics [ edit ] The notion of a " closed universe " can refer to the universe being a closed manifold but more likely refers to the universe being a manifold of constant positive Ricci curvature .
