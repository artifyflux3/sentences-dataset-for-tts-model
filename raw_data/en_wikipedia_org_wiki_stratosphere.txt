This image shows the temperature trend in the lower stratosphere as measured by a series of satellite-based instruments between January 1979 and December 2005. The lower stratosphere is centred around 18 kilometres above Earth's surface. The stratosphere image is dominated by blues and greens, which indicates a cooling over time.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-1)

Diagram showing the five primary layers of the Earth's atmosphere: [exosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere "Exosphere"), [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere"), [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere"), stratosphere, and [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"). The layers are not to scale.

The **stratosphere** (;[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-2) from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")[στρωτός](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%83%CF%84%CF%81%CF%89%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:στρωτός")_(\_strōtós\_)_'layer, stratum' and _-[sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere")_) is the second-lowest [layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_stratification "Atmospheric stratification") of the [atmosphere of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth"), located above the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere") and below the [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-4) The stratosphere is composed of [stratified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_and_unstable_stratification "Stable and unstable stratification")[temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") zones, with the warmer layers of [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air "Air") located higher (closer to [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space")) and the cooler layers lower (closer to the [planetary surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_surface "Planetary surface") of the Earth). The increase of temperature with [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude") is a result of the absorption of the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun")'s [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") (UV) radiation by the [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer "Ozone layer"), where [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone "Ozone") is [exothermically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic "Exothermic")[photolyzed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodissociation "Photodissociation") into [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") in [a cyclical fashion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone-oxygen_cycle "Ozone-oxygen cycle").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-ucarOverview-5) This [temperature inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology) "Inversion (meteorology)") is in contrast to the troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and between the troposphere and stratosphere is the [tropopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause "Tropopause") border that demarcates the beginning of the temperature inversion.

Near the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator"), the lower edge of the stratosphere is as high as 20 km (66,000 ft; 12 mi), at mid-latitudes around 10 km (33,000 ft; 6.2 mi), and at the [poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_pole "Geographical pole") about 7 km (23,000 ft; 4.3 mi).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-ucarOverview-5) Temperatures range from an average of −51°C (−60°F; 220 K) near the tropopause to an average of −15°C (5.0°F; 260 K) near the mesosphere.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-nwsJetStream-6) Stratospheric temperatures also vary within the stratosphere as the [seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season") change, reaching particularly low temperatures in the [polar night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_night "Polar night") (winter).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-nasaOzoneWatch-7)[Winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind "Wind") in the stratosphere can far exceed those in the troposphere, reaching near 60 m/s (220 km/h; 130 mph) in the Southern [polar vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex "Polar vortex").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-nasaOzoneWatch-7)

In 1902, [Léon Teisserenc de Bort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Teisserenc_de_Bort "Léon Teisserenc de Bort") from France and [Richard Assmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Assmann "Richard Assmann") from Germany, in separate but coordinated publications and following years of observations, published the discovery of an isothermal layer at around 11–14 km (6.8-8.7 mi), which is the base of the lower stratosphere. This was based on temperature profiles from mostly unmanned and a few manned instrumented balloons.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-8)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Layersofozone_1.jpeg_1240x510_q85_subsampling-2.jpg/250px-Layersofozone_1.jpeg_1240x510_q85_subsampling-2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Layersofozone_1.jpeg_1240x510_q85_subsampling-2.jpg)

The ozone layer in the stratosphere blocks harmful UV radiation from reaching the surface of the Earth. A gamma-ray burst would deplete the ozone layer, allowing UV radiation through.

The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician and [geophysicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysicist "Geophysicist")[Sydney Chapman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Chapman_(mathematician) "Sydney Chapman (mathematician)") in 1930, and is known as the Chapman cycle or [ozone–oxygen cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone%E2%80%93oxygen_cycle "Ozone–oxygen cycle").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-9) Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the [UV-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV-C "UV-C") region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is [photolyzed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodissociation "Photodissociation") much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. [Ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone "Ozone") (O 3) photolysis produces O and O 2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O 3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heat the stratosphere, resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude _(see [temperature inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature\_inversion "Temperature inversion"))_; the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 [K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin") (−3[°C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%B0C "°C") or 26.6[°F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%B0F "°F")).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-10)

This vertical [stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_stratification "Atmospheric stratification"), with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection "Convection") and associated [turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence") in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic [eruption columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruption_column "Eruption column") and [overshooting tops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshooting_top "Overshooting top") in severe [supercell thunderstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell "Supercell"), may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall, the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the planet's surface outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the [tropopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause "Tropopause"), the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze-dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the [stratopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratopause "Stratopause"), above which the temperature decreases with height.

### Formation and destruction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stratosphere&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Formation and destruction")]

Sydney Chapman gave a correct description of the source of stratospheric ozone and its ability to generate heat within the stratosphere;[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] he also wrote that ozone may be destroyed by reacting with atomic oxygen, making two molecules of molecular oxygen. We now know that there are additional ozone loss mechanisms and that these mechanisms are catalytic, meaning that a small amount of the catalyst can destroy a great number of ozone molecules. The first is due to the reaction of [hydroxyl radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical "Hydroxyl radical") (•OH) with ozone. •OH is formed by the reaction of electrically excited oxygen atoms produced by ozone photolysis, with water vapor. While the stratosphere is dry, additional water vapour is produced in situ by the photochemical oxidation of [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane") (CH 4). The HO 2 radical produced by the reaction of OH with O 3 is recycled to OH by reaction with oxygen atoms or ozone. In addition, solar proton events can significantly affect ozone levels via [radiolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolysis "Radiolysis") with the subsequent formation of OH. [Nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide "Nitrous oxide") (N 2 O) is produced by biological activity at the surface and is oxidized to NO in the stratosphere; the so-called NO x radical cycles also deplete stratospheric ozone. Finally, [chlorofluorocarbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon "Chlorofluorocarbon") molecules are photolyzed in the stratosphere releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone giving ClO and O 2. The chlorine atoms are recycled when ClO reacts with O in the upper stratosphere, or when ClO reacts with itself in the chemistry of the Antarctic ozone hole.

Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for their work describing the formation and decomposition of stratospheric ozone.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-11)

[![Image 5: A generic Boeing 737-800 cruising at 32,000 feet. Below it is a pack of clouds. Above it is a vivid, ambient blue sky.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Boeing_737_view_1.jpg/330px-Boeing_737_view_1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boeing_737_view_1.jpg)

Aircraft typically cruise at the stratosphere to avoid [turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence") rampant in the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"). The blue beam in this image is the [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer "Ozone layer"), beaming further to the [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere"). The [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone "Ozone") heats the stratosphere, making conditions stable. The stratosphere is also the altitude limit of jets and [weather balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_balloon "Weather balloon"), as air is roughly a thousand times thinner there than at the troposphere.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-12)

Commercial [airliners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner "Airliner") typically cruise at altitudes of 9–12 km (30,000–39,000 ft) which is in the lower reaches of the stratosphere in temperate latitudes.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-13) This optimizes [fuel efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency "Fuel efficiency"), mostly due to the low temperatures encountered near the tropopause and low air density, reducing [parasitic drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_drag "Parasitic drag") on the [airframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airframe "Airframe"). Stated another way, it allows the airliner to fly faster while maintaining lift equal to the weight of the plane. (The fuel consumption depends on the drag, which is related to the lift by the [lift-to-drag ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift-to-drag_ratio "Lift-to-drag ratio").) It also allows the airplane to stay above the [turbulent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence") weather of the troposphere.

The [Concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde "Concorde") aircraft cruised at [Mach 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number "Mach number") at about 60,000 ft (18 km), and the [SR-71](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SR-71 "SR-71") cruised at Mach 3 at 85,000 ft (26 km), all within the stratosphere.

Because the temperature in the tropopause and lower stratosphere is largely constant with increasing altitude, very little convection and its resultant turbulence occurs there. Most turbulence at this altitude is caused by variations in the [jet stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream "Jet stream") and other local wind shears, although areas of significant convective activity ([thunderstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm "Thunderstorm")) in the troposphere below may produce turbulence as a result of [convective overshoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_overshoot "Convective overshoot").

On October 24, 2014, [Alan Eustace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Eustace "Alan Eustace") became the record holder for reaching the altitude record for a manned balloon at 135,890 ft (41,419 m).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-14) Eustace also broke the world records for vertical speed skydiving, reached with a peak velocity of 1,321 km/h (822 mph) and total freefall distance of 123,414 ft (37,617 m) – lasting four minutes and 27 seconds.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-15)

Circulation and mixing
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stratosphere&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Circulation and mixing")]

The stratosphere is a region of intense interactions among radiative, [dynamical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical "Dynamical"), and chemical processes, in which the horizontal mixing of gaseous components proceeds much more rapidly than does vertical mixing. The overall circulation of the stratosphere is termed as [Brewer-Dobson circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewer-Dobson_circulation "Brewer-Dobson circulation"), which is a single-celled circulation, spanning from the tropics up to the poles, consisting of the tropical upwelling of air from the tropical troposphere and the extra-tropical downwelling of air. Stratospheric circulation is a predominantly wave-driven circulation in that the tropical upwelling is induced by the wave force by the westward propagating [Rossby waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossby_waves "Rossby waves"), in a phenomenon called Rossby-wave pumping.

An interesting feature of stratospheric circulation is the [quasi-biennial oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-biennial_oscillation "Quasi-biennial oscillation") (QBO) in the tropical latitudes, which is driven by [gravity waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_wave "Gravity wave") that are convectively generated in the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"). The QBO induces a [secondary circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_circulation "Secondary circulation") that is important for the global stratospheric transport of tracers, such as [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone "Ozone")[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-16) or [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor").

Another large-scale feature that significantly influences stratospheric circulation is the breaking planetary waves[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-17) resulting in intense quasi-horizontal mixing in the midlatitudes. This breaking is much more pronounced in the winter hemisphere where this region is called the surf zone. This breaking is caused due to a highly non-linear interaction between the vertically propagating planetary waves and the isolated high [potential vorticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_vorticity "Potential vorticity") region known as the [polar vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex "Polar vortex"). The resultant breaking causes large-scale mixing of air and other trace gases throughout the midlatitude surf zone. The timescale of this rapid mixing is much smaller than the much slower timescales of upwelling in the tropics and downwelling in the extratropics.

During northern hemispheric winters, [sudden stratospheric warmings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_stratospheric_warmings "Sudden stratospheric warmings"), caused by the absorption of [Rossby waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossby_wave "Rossby wave") in the stratosphere, can be observed in approximately half of the winters when easterly winds develop in the stratosphere. These events often precede unusual winter weather [[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-18) and may even be responsible for the cold European winters of the 1960s.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-19)

Stratospheric warming of the polar vortex results in its weakening.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-20) When the vortex is strong, it keeps the cold, high-pressure air masses _contained_ in the [Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic "Arctic"); when the vortex weakens, air masses move equatorward, and results in rapid changes of weather in the mid latitudes.

Upper-atmospheric lightning
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stratosphere&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Upper-atmospheric lightning")]

Lightning extending above the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere") into the stratosphere as [blue jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_jet "Blue jet") and reaching into the [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere") as red [sprite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(lightning) "Sprite (lightning)")

Upper-atmospheric lightning is a family of short-lived electrical breakdown phenomena that occur well above the altitudes of normal [lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") and storm clouds. Upper-atmospheric lightning is believed to be electrically induced forms of luminous [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)"). Lightning extending above the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere") into the stratosphere is referred to as [blue jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_jet "Blue jet"), and that reaching into the [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere") as red [sprite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(lightning) "Sprite (lightning)").

[Bacterial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria") life survives in the stratosphere, making it a part of the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-DasSarmaDasSarma2018-21) In 2001, dust was collected at a height of 41 kilometres in a high-altitude balloon experiment and was found to contain bacterial material when examined later in the laboratory.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere#cite_note-Woolfson2013-22)
