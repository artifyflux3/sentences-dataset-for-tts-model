[ 1 ] Etymology [ edit ] Bhedābheda ( Devanagari : भेदाभेद ) is a Sanskrit word meaning "difference and non-difference ".

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The principal author of Bhedabheda is Bhāskara who was either Shankara's contemporary or lived shortly after Shankara.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Bhedabheda, is a Hindu philosophical tradition, primarily developed in the 7th Century CE, with key contributions from Bhāskara and Nimbarka. This school states that the individual soul (jiva) and the ultimate reality (Brahman) are simultaneously distinct and non-distinct.

[ 1 ] Philosophy [ edit ] There are multiple ways that the difference and non-difference is interpreted in Bhedābheda traditions.

Bhaskara and Nimbarka mark two ends on the spectrum in this tradition. Bhaskara believes that the non-difference aspect is more real because he believes that Brahman is in its natural state without difference. Nimbarka believes that Brahman's essential nature includes equally real states of difference and non-difference.

[ 5 ] Argument against Advaita Interpretations [ edit ] The philosopher Vijñānabhikṣu took the Bhedabheda philosophy to be superior to other interpretations as it could make sense of seeming contradictions in the Vedas. He points out that Advaita interpretations fall short because they only prioritize statements that suggest the identical nature of Brahman and the soul. However, these interpretations subordinate statements that point to the difference between Brahman and the soul, resorting to interpreting them as figurative. In order to make sense of the Vedas' statements as consistent, Vijñānabhikṣu argues that difference and non-difference can also mean separation and non-separation, rather than identity and negation of identity. The meaning of bheda and abheda , then, determined according to the context, solves the problem of taking some statements from the Vedas as untrue or merely figurative.

[ 6 ] Influence [ edit ] Bhedābheda ideas had an enormous influence on the devotional ( bhakti ) schools of India's medieval period. Among medieval Bhedābheda thinkers are: Nimbārka (dates proposed by scholars range from 7th century – 15th century), who founded the Svābhābika Dvaitādvaita school.

[ 7 ] Bhāskara (8th and 9th centuries), who founded the Aupādhika Bhedābheda school.

[ 2 ] Chaitanya (1485–1533), the founder of Gaudiya Vaishnavism based in the eastern Indian State of West Bengal , and the theological founder of Achintya Bheda Abhedavedanta [ 8 ] Guru Nanak (1439-1569), the founder of Sikhism based in north india.

Ramanujacharya , founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta and Sri Vaishnavism .

Other major names are Rāmānuja 's teacher Yādavaprakāśa , [ 2 ] and Vijñānabhikṣu (16th century).
