"**Space**" is a song by British recording artist M.I.A. from her third studio album, _[Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya\_(M.I.A.\_album) "Maya (M.I.A. album)")_ (2010). The track was written and produced by Maya "M.I.A." Arulpragasam and [Christopher "Rusko" Mercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusko_(musician) "Rusko (musician)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(M.I.A._song)#cite_note-1) The song was released on 12 January 2010 as a music video only, and has been known under alternative titles "**There's Space for Ol Dat I See**"[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(M.I.A._song)#cite_note-2) and "**Space Odyssey**".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(M.I.A._song)#cite_note-3) The track was a [protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_song "Protest song") to an article by _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_York\_Times "The New York Times")_ calling [Sri Lanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka "Sri Lanka") the number one vacation destination of 2010,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(M.I.A._song)#cite_note-4) which M.I.A. found questionable and inaccurate towards the country's [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War "Sri Lankan Civil War").

Although "Space" was the first song that M.I.A. teased from the forthcoming album, it was never released as an official single. The track did, however, chart upon the release of _Maya_. The song charted at number 67 on the [Canadian Digital Songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Digital_Songs "Canadian Digital Songs") chart and number 9 on the [Dance/Electronic Digital Songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance/Electronic_Digital_Songs "Dance/Electronic Digital Songs") chart.

Composition
-----------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_(M.I.A._song)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Composition")]

According to former _[Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los\_Angeles\_Times "Los Angeles Times")_ writer [Ann Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Powers "Ann Powers"), "Space" is a "[chill-out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill-out_music "Chill-out music") room seduction".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(M.I.A._song)#cite_note-5)

Music video
-----------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_(M.I.A._song)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Music video")]

The video for the song was uploaded only on [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter")'s Twitvid on 12 January 2010, and filmed the night before for $100.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(M.I.A._song)#cite_note-6) It pictures green-lit M.I.A. against a black background, moving in a series of [astral projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_projection "Astral projection").
