Not to be confused with Romanianization .

Mandarin Chinese , like many languages, can be romanized in a number of ways; above: Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters meaning Chinese, and romanization systems Hanyu Pinyin , Gwoyeu Romatzyh , Wade-Giles and Yale for those characters.

In linguistics , romanization or romanisation is the conversion of text from a different writing system to the Roman (Latin) script , or a system for doing so. Methods of romanization include transliteration , for representing written text, and transcription , for representing the spoken word, and combinations of both. Transcription methods can be subdivided into phonemic transcription , which records the phonemes or units of semantic meaning in speech, and more strict phonetic transcription , which records speech sounds with precision.

Methods [ edit ] There are many consistent or standardized romanization systems. They can be classified by their characteristics. A particular system's characteristics may make it better-suited for various, sometimes contradictory applications, including document retrieval, linguistic analysis, easy readability, faithful representation of pronunciation.

Source, or donor language – A system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language, or a series of languages, or for any language in a particular writing system. A language-specific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation, while the general one may be better for cataloguing international texts.

Target, or receiver language – Most systems are intended for an audience that speaks or reads a particular language. (So-called international romanization systems for Cyrillic text are based on central-European alphabets like the Czech and Croatian alphabet .) Simplicity – Since the basic Latin alphabet has a smaller number of letters than many other writing systems, digraphs , diacritics , or special characters must be used to represent them all in Latin script. This affects the ease of creation, digital storage and transmission, reproduction, and reading of the romanized text.

Reversibility – Whether or not the original can be restored from the converted text. Some reversible systems allow for an irreversible simplified version.

Transliteration [ edit ] Main article: Transliteration If the romanization attempts to transliterate the original script, the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of characters in the source language into the target script, with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader's language. For example, the Nihon-shiki romanization of Japanese allows the informed reader to reconstruct the original Japanese kana syllables with 100% accuracy, but requires additional knowledge for correct pronunciation.

Transcription [ edit ] Main article: Transcription (linguistics) Phonemic [ edit ] See also: Phonemic orthography Most romanizations are intended to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the source language reasonably accurately. Such romanizations follow the principle of phonemic transcription and attempt to render the significant sounds ( phonemes ) of the original as faithfully as possible in the target language. The popular Hepburn Romanization of Japanese is an example of a transcriptive romanization designed for English speakers.

Phonetic [ edit ] See also: Phonetic transcription A phonetic conversion goes one step further and attempts to depict all phones in the source language, sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions not found in the target script. In practice such a representation almost never tries to represent every possible allophone—especially those that occur naturally due to coarticulation effects—and instead limits itself to the most significant allophonic distinctions. The International Phonetic Alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription.

Compromise [ edit ] For most language pairs, building a usable romanization involves a trade-off between the two extremes. Pure transcriptions are generally not possible, as the source language usually contains sounds and distinctions not found in the target language, but which must be shown for the romanized form to be comprehensible. Furthermore, due to diachronic and synchronic variance no written language represents any spoken language with perfect accuracy and the vocal interpretation of a script may vary by a great degree among languages. In modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language, written foreign language, written native language, spoken (read) native language. Reducing the number of those processes, i.e. removing one or both steps of writing, usually leads to more accurate oral articulations. In general, outside a limited audience of scholars, romanizations tend to lean more towards transcription. As an example, consider the Japanese martial art 柔術: the Nihon-shiki romanization zyûzyutu may allow someone who knows Japanese to reconstruct the kana syllables じゅうじゅつ , but most native English speakers, or rather readers, would find it easier to guess the pronunciation from the Hepburn version, jūjutsu .

ISO 259-2 (1994): Simplified transliteration.

ISO/DIS 259-3: Phonemic transcription.

ALA-LC [ 12 ] Indic (Brahmic) scripts [ edit ] See also: Devanagari transliteration , Romanization of Bengali , and Romanisation of Malayalam The Brahmic family of abugidas is used for languages of the Indian subcontinent and south-east Asia. There is a long tradition in the west to study Sanskrit and other Indic texts in Latin transliteration. Various transliteration conventions have been used for Indic scripts since the time of Sir William Jones.

[ 13 ] ISO 15919 (2001): A standard transliteration convention was codified in the ISO 15919 standard. It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic consonants and vowels to the Latin script. The Devanagari-specific portion is very similar to the academic standard, IAST : "International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration", and to the United States Library of Congress standard, ALA-LC , [ 14 ] although there are a few differences The National Library at Kolkata romanization , intended for the romanization of all Indic scripts , is an extension of IAST Harvard-Kyoto : Uses upper and lower case and doubling of letters, to avoid the use of diacritics, and to restrict the range to 7-bit ASCII.

ITRANS : a transliteration scheme into 7-bit ASCII created by Avinash Chopde that used to be prevalent on Usenet .

ISCII (1988) Devanagari–nastaʿlīq (Hindustani) [ edit ] Hindustani is an Indo-Aryan language with extreme digraphia and diglossia resulting from the Hindi–Urdu controversy starting in the 1800s. Technically, Hindustani itself is recognized by neither the language community nor any governments. Two standardized registers , Standard Hindi and Standard Urdu , are recognized as official languages in India and Pakistan. However, in practice the situation is, In Pakistan: Standard (Saaf or Khaalis) Urdu is the "high" variety, whereas Hindustani is the "low" variety used by the masses (called Urdu, written in nastaʿlīq script ).

In India, both Standard (Shuddh) Hindi and Standard (Saaf or Khaalis) Urdu are the "H" varieties (written in devanagari and nastaʿlīq respectively), whereas Hindustani is the "L" variety used by the masses and written in either devanagari or nastaʿlīq (and called 'Hindi' or 'Urdu' respectively).

The digraphia renders any work in either script largely inaccessible to users of the other script, though otherwise Hindustani is a perfectly mutually intelligible language, essentially meaning that any kind of text-based open source collaboration is impossible among devanagari and nastaʿlīq readers.

Initiated in 2011, the Hamari Boli Initiative [ 15 ] is a full-scale open-source language planning initiative aimed at Hindustani script, style, status & lexical reform and modernization. One of primary stated objectives of Hamari Boli is to relieve Hindustani of the crippling devanagari–nastaʿlīq digraphia by way of romanization.

[ 16 ] Chinese [ edit ] Main article: Romanization of Chinese Romanization of the Sinitic languages , particularly Mandarin , has proved a very difficult problem, although the issue is further complicated by political considerations. Because of this, many romanization tables contain Chinese characters plus one or more romanizations or Zhuyin .

Mandarin [ edit ] ALA-LC : Used to be similar to Wade–Giles, [ 17 ] but converted to Hanyu Pinyin in 2000 [ 18 ] EFEO . Developed by École française d'Extrême-Orient in the 19th century, used mainly in France.

Lessing-Othmer : Used mainly in Germany.

Postal romanization (1906): Early standard for international addresses Wade–Giles (1892): Transliteration. Very popular from the 19th century until recently and continues to be used by some Western academics.

Yale (1942): Created by the U.S. for battlefield communication and used in the influential Yale textbooks.

Legge romanization : Created by James Legge , a Scottish missionary.

Mainland China [ edit ] Hanyu Pinyin (1958): In mainland China , Hanyu Pinyin has been used officially to romanize Mandarin for decades, primarily as a linguistic tool for teaching the standardized language. The system is also used in other Chinese-speaking areas such as Singapore and parts of Taiwan , and has been adopted by much of the international community as a standard for writing Chinese words and names in the Latin script. The value of Hanyu Pinyin in education in China lies in the fact that China, like any other populated area with comparable area and population, has numerous distinct dialects , though there is just one common written language and one common standardized spoken form. (These comments apply to romanization in general) ISO 7098 (1991): Based on Hanyu Pinyin.

The only existing romanisation system is YYPY (Yi Yu Pin Yin), which represents tone with letters attached to the end of syllables, as Nuosu forbids codas. It does not use diacritics, and as such due to the large phonemic inventory of Nuosu, it requires frequent use of digraphs, including for monophthong vowels.

Tibetan [ edit ] The Tibetan script has two official romanization systems: Tibetan Pinyin (for Lhasa Tibetan ) and Roman Dzongkha (for Dzongkha ).

Cyrillic [ edit ] In English language library catalogues, bibliographies, and most academic publications, the Library of Congress transliteration method is used worldwide.

In linguistics, scientific transliteration is used for both Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets . This applies to Old Church Slavonic , as well as modern Slavic languages that use these alphabets.

All this has resulted in great reduplication of names. E.g. the name of the Russian composer Tchaikovsky may also be written as Tchaykovsky , Tchajkovskij , Tchaikowski , Tschaikowski , Czajkowski , Čajkovskij , Čajkovski , Chajkovskij , Çaykovski , Chaykovsky , Chaykovskiy , Chaikovski , Tshaikovski , Tšaikovski , Tsjajkovskij etc. Systems include: BGN/PCGN (1947): Transliteration system (United States Board on Geographic Names & Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use).
