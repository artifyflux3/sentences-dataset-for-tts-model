A pseudoscalar, when multiplied by an ordinary vector , becomes a pseudovector (or axial vector ); a similar construction creates the pseudotensor .
A pseudoscalar also results from any scalar product between a pseudovector and an ordinary vector. The prototypical example of a pseudoscalar is the scalar triple product , which can be written as the scalar product between one of the vectors in the triple product and the cross product between the two other vectors, where the latter is a pseudovector.

In physics [ edit ] In physics , a pseudoscalar denotes a physical quantity analogous to a scalar . Both are physical quantities which assume a single value which is invariant under proper rotations . However, under the parity transformation , pseudoscalars flip their signs while scalars do not. As reflections through a plane are the combination of a rotation with the parity transformation, pseudoscalars also change signs under reflections.

Motivation [ edit ] One of the most powerful ideas in physics is that physical laws do not change when one changes the coordinate system used to describe these laws. That a pseudoscalar reverses its sign when the coordinate axes are inverted suggests that it is not the best object to describe a physical quantity. In 3D-space, quantities described by a pseudovector are antisymmetric tensors of order 2, which are invariant under inversion. The pseudovector may be a simpler representation of that quantity, but suffers from the change of sign under inversion. Similarly, in 3D-space, the Hodge dual of a scalar is equal to a constant times the 3-dimensional Levi-Civita pseudotensor (or "permutation" pseudotensor); whereas the Hodge dual of a pseudoscalar is an antisymmetric (pure) tensor of order three.  The Levi-Civita pseudotensor is a completely antisymmetric pseudotensor of order 3. Since the dual of the pseudoscalar is the product of two "pseudo-quantities", the resulting tensor is a true tensor, and does not change sign upon an inversion of axes. The situation is similar to the situation for pseudovectors and antisymmetric tensors of order 2. The dual of a pseudovector is an antisymmetric tensor of order 2 (and vice versa). The tensor is an invariant physical quantity under a coordinate inversion, while the pseudovector is not invariant.

The situation can be extended to any dimension. Generally in an n -dimensional space the Hodge dual of an order r tensor will be an antisymmetric pseudotensor of order ( n − r ) and vice versa. In particular, in the four-dimensional spacetime of special relativity , a pseudoscalar is the dual of a fourth-order tensor and is proportional to the four-dimensional Levi-Civita pseudotensor .

Examples [ edit ] The stream function ψ ψ ( x , y ) {\displaystyle \psi (x,y)} for a two-dimensional, incompressible fluid flow v ( x , y ) = ⟨ ⟨ ∂ ∂ y ψ ψ , − − ∂ ∂ x ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,y)=\langle \partial _{y}\psi ,-\partial _{x}\psi \rangle } .

Magnetic charge is a pseudoscalar as it is mathematically defined, regardless of whether it exists physically.

Magnetic flux is the result of a dot product between a vector (the surface normal ) and pseudovector (the magnetic field ).

[ citation needed ] Helicity is the projection (dot product) of a spin pseudovector onto the direction of momentum (a true vector).

Pseudoscalar particles, i.e. particles with spin 0 and odd parity, that is, a particle with no intrinsic spin with wave function that changes sign under parity inversion . Examples are pseudoscalar mesons .

In geometric algebra [ edit ] See also: Pseudoscalar (Clifford algebra) A pseudoscalar in a geometric algebra is a highest- grade element of the algebra.  For example, in two dimensions there are two orthogonal basis vectors, e 1 {\displaystyle e_{1}} , e 2 {\displaystyle e_{2}} and the associated highest-grade basis element is e 1 e 2 = e 12 .

{\displaystyle e_{1}e_{2}=e_{12}.} So a pseudoscalar is a multiple of e 12 {\displaystyle e_{12}} .  The element e 12 {\displaystyle e_{12}} squares to −1 and commutes with all even elements – behaving therefore like the imaginary scalar i {\displaystyle i} in the complex numbers . It is these scalar-like properties which give rise to its name.

In this setting, a pseudoscalar changes sign under a parity inversion, since if ( e 1 , e 2 ) ↦ ↦ ( u 1 , u 2 ) {\displaystyle (e_{1},e_{2})\mapsto (u_{1},u_{2})} is a change of basis representing an orthogonal transformation , then e 1 e 2 ↦ ↦ u 1 u 2 = ± ± e 1 e 2 , {\displaystyle e_{1}e_{2}\mapsto u_{1}u_{2}=\pm e_{1}e_{2},} where the sign depends on the determinant of the transformation. Pseudoscalars in geometric algebra thus correspond to the pseudoscalars in physics.
