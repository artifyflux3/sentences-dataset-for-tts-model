**Herbert George Wells** (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946) was an English writer, prolific in many genres. He wrote more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories. His non-fiction output included works of social commentary, politics, history, popular science, satire, biography, and autobiography. Wells is most known today for his groundbreaking [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") novels; he has been called the "father of science fiction".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-2)

In addition to his fame as a writer, he was prominent in his lifetime as a forward-looking, even prophetic [social critic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_critic "Social critic") who devoted his literary talents to the development of a [progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism "Progressivism") vision on a global scale. As a [futurist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist "Futurist"), he wrote a number of [utopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia "Utopia") works[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Davis-2003-3) and foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Handwerk-2016-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-visionary-5) His science fiction imagined [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel "Time travel"), [alien invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_invasion "Alien invasion"), [invisibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisibility "Invisibility"), and [biological engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_in_fiction#Genetics_themes "Genetics in fiction") before these subjects were common in the genre.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Handwerk-2016-4)[Brian Aldiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Aldiss "Brian Aldiss") referred to Wells as the "[Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare") of science fiction", while [Charles Fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fort "Charles Fort") called him a "wild talent".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-wagar-6): 7 [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-7)

Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption per work– dubbed "Wells's law"– leading [Joseph Conrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad "Joseph Conrad") to hail him in 1898 with "O Realist of the Fantastic!".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-8) His most notable science fiction works include _[The Time Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Time\_Machine "The Time Machine")_ (1895), which was his first novella, _[The Island of Doctor Moreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Island\_of\_Doctor\_Moreau "The Island of Doctor Moreau")_ (1896), _[The Invisible Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Invisible\_Man "The Invisible Man")_ (1897), _[The War of the Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_War\_of\_the\_Worlds "The War of the Worlds")_ (1898), the military science fiction _[The War in the Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_War\_in\_the\_Air "The War in the Air")_ (1907), and the [dystopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia "Dystopia")_[When the Sleeper Wakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When\_the\_Sleeper\_Wakes "When the Sleeper Wakes")_ (1910). Novels of social realism such as _[Kipps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kipps "Kipps")_ (1905) and _[The History of Mr Polly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_History\_of\_Mr\_Polly "The History of Mr Polly")_ (1910), which describe lower-middle-class English life, led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to [Charles Dickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens "Charles Dickens"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-brome-9): 99  but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in _[Tono-Bungay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tono-Bungay "Tono-Bungay")_ (1909), a diagnosis of [English society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_society "English society") as a whole. Wells was nominated for the [Nobel Prize in Literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature "Nobel Prize in Literature") four times.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Nobel_nominations-10)

Wells's earliest specialised training was in [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a [Darwinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism "Darwinism") context.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-11) He was also an outspoken [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist "Socialist") from a young age, often (but not always, as at the beginning of the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War")) sympathising with [pacifist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifist "Pacifist") views.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-13) In his later years, he wrote less fiction and more works expounding his political and social views, sometimes giving his profession as that of journalist.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-brome-9) Wells was a [diabetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic "Diabetic") and co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association ([Diabetes UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_UK "Diabetes UK")) in 1934.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-14)

Young Wells, "Bertie" as he was known, c. 1870s

Herbert George Wells was born at Atlas House, 162 High Street in [Bromley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromley "Bromley"), Kent,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-wheen-15) on 21 September 1866.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-ODNB-16) Called "Bertie" by his family, he was the fourth and last child of [Joseph Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wells_(cricketer) "Joseph Wells (cricketer)"), a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional [cricketer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket "Cricket") and Sarah Neal, a former [domestic servant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_worker "Domestic worker"). An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper in part because the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meagre income, but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing [professional cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_and_professional_cricketers "Amateur and professional cricketers") for the [Kent county team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_County_Cricket_Club "Kent County Cricket Club").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Smith-17)

A defining incident of young Wells's life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-ODNB-16) To pass the time he began to read books from the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a [private school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school "Private school") founded in 1849, following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, and the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing [copperplate handwriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copperplate_script "Copperplate script") and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, fractured his femur. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-18)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Uppark-Sfront-01.jpg/330px-Uppark-Sfront-01.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Uppark-Sfront-01.jpg)

Wells spent the winter of 1887–88 convalescing at [Uppark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppark "Uppark") in Sussex, where his mother, Sarah, was the housekeeper.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Pevsner-19)

No longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as [apprentices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship "Apprenticeship") in various occupations.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-20) From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a [draper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draper "Draper") at Hyde's Drapery Emporium in [Southsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southsea "Southsea").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-GHW1925-21) His experiences at Hyde's, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-wheen-15) later inspired his novels _[The Wheels of Chance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Wheels\_of\_Chance "The Wheels of Chance")_, _[The History of Mr Polly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_History\_of\_Mr\_Polly "The History of Mr Polly")_, and _[Kipps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kipps "Kipps")_, which portray the life of a draper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of society's distribution of wealth.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-batchelor-22): 2

Wells's parents had a turbulent marriage, owing primarily to his mother being a [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism "Protestantism") and his father being a [freethinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought "Freethought"). When his mother returned to work as a lady's maid (at [Uppark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppark "Uppark"), a [country house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_country_house "English country house") in [West Sussex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Sussex "West Sussex")), one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children. Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they remained faithful to each other and never divorced. As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant. However, Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself, reading many classic works, including [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")'s _[Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic\_(Plato) "Republic (Plato)")_, [Thomas More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More "Thomas More")'s _[Utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia\_(More\_book) "Utopia (More book)")_, and the works of [Daniel Defoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Defoe "Daniel Defoe").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-McFarland-23) When he became the first doyen of science fiction as a distinct genre of fiction, Wells referenced [Mary Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley "Mary Shelley")'s _[Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein "Frankenstein")_ in relation to his works, writing, "they belong to a class of writing which includes the story of _Frankenstein_."[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-24)

Commemorative plaque in [Midhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midhurst "Midhurst"), West Sussex, marking where Wells lodged while a teacher at [Midhurst Grammar School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midhurst_Grammar_School "Midhurst Grammar School") between 1883 and 1884

In October 1879, Wells's mother arranged through a distant relative, Arthur Williams, for him to join the [National School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_school_(England_and_Wales) "National school (England and Wales)") at [Wookey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wookey "Wookey") in Somerset as a pupil–teacher, a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-GHW1925-21) In December that year, however, Williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and Wells was returned to Uppark. After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby [Midhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midhurst "Midhurst") and an even shorter stay as a boarder at [Midhurst Grammar School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midhurst_Grammar_School "Midhurst Grammar School"), he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde's. In 1883, Wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship, taking an opportunity offered by Midhurst Grammar School again to become a pupil–teacher; his proficiency in Latin and science during his earlier short stay had been remembered.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Smith-17)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-GHW1925-21)

The years he spent in Southsea had been the most miserable of his life to that point, but his good fortune in securing a position at Midhurst Grammar School meant that Wells could continue his self-education in earnest.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Smith-17) The following year, Wells won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science (later the [Royal College of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Science "Royal College of Science") in [South Kensington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Kensington "South Kensington"), which became part of [Imperial College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London "Imperial College London")) in London, studying [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") under [Thomas Henry Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley "Thomas Henry Huxley").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-batchelor-22): 164  As an alumnus, he later helped to set up the Royal College of Science Association, of which he became the first president in 1909. Wells studied in his new school until 1887, with a weekly allowance of 21 [shillings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling "Shilling") (a [guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_(British_coin) "Guinea (British coin)")) thanks to his scholarship. This ought to have been a comfortable sum of money (at the time many [working class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class "Working class") families had "round about a pound a week" as their entire household income),[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-25) yet in his _Experiment in Autobiography_ Wells speaks of constantly being hungry, and indeed photographs of him at the time show a youth who is very thin and malnourished.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-26)

He soon entered the debating society of the school. These years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society. At first approaching the subject through Plato's _Republic_, he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed [Fabian Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Society "Fabian Society") and free lectures delivered at [Kelmscott House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelmscott_House "Kelmscott House"), the home of [William Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris "William Morris"). He was also among the founders of _The Science School Journal_, a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society, as well as trying his hand at fiction; a precursor to his novel _[The Time Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Time\_Machine "The Time Machine")_ was published in the journal under the title "[The Chronic Argonauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronic_Argonauts "The Chronic Argonauts")". The school year 1886–87 was the last year of his studies.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-batchelor-22): 164

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/H._G._Wells%2C_c.1890.jpg/250px-H._G._Wells%2C_c.1890.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H._G._Wells,_c.1890.jpg)

Wells studying in London c. 1890

During 1888, Wells stayed in [Stoke-on-Trent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent "Stoke-on-Trent"), living in [Basford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basford,_Staffordshire "Basford, Staffordshire"). The unique environment of [The Potteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Potteries "The Potteries") was certainly an inspiration. He wrote in a letter to a friend from the area that "the district made an immense impression on me". The inspiration for some of his descriptions in _The War of the Worlds_ is thought to have come from his short time spent here, seeing the iron foundry furnaces burn over the city, shooting huge red light into the skies. His stay in The Potteries also resulted in the macabre short story "[The Cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cone "The Cone")" (1895, contemporaneous with his famous _The Time Machine_), set in the north of the city.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-hammond-27): 90

After teaching for some time—he was briefly on the staff of [Holt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holt,_Wrexham_County_Borough "Holt, Wrexham County Borough") Academy in Wales[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-28)—Wells found it necessary to supplement his knowledge relating to educational principles and methodology and entered the College of Preceptors ([College of Teachers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Teachers "College of Teachers")). He later received his Licentiate and Fellowship [FCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Teachers "College of Teachers") diplomas from the college. It was not until 1890 that Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in [zoology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology "Zoology") from the [University of London External Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_London_External_System "University of London External System"). In 1889–90, he managed to find a post as a teacher at Henley House School in London, where he taught [A. A. Milne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._A._Milne "A. A. Milne") (whose father ran the school).[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-30) His first published work was a _Text-Book of Biology_ in two volumes (1893).[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-31)

Upon leaving the [Normal School of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Science "Royal College of Science"), Wells was left without a source of income. His aunt Mary—his father's sister-in-law—invited him to stay with her for a while, which solved his immediate problem of accommodation. During his stay at his aunt's, he grew increasingly interested in her daughter, Isabel, whom he later courted and married. To earn money, he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as _[The Pall Mall Gazette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Pall\_Mall\_Gazette "The Pall Mall Gazette")_, later collecting these in _[Select Conversations with an Uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select\_Conversations\_with\_an\_Uncle "Select Conversations with an Uncle")_ (1895) and _[Certain Personal Matters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certain\_Personal\_Matters "Certain Personal Matters")_ (1897). So prolific did Wells become at this mode of journalism that many of his early pieces remain unidentified. According to David C. Smith,

> Most of Wells's occasional pieces have not been collected, and many have not even been identified as his. Wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so. ... As a result, many of his early pieces are unknown. It is obvious that many early Wells items have been lost.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-32)

His success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write book-length work, and he published his first novel, _[The Time Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Time\_Machine "The Time Machine")_, in 1895.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-33)

In 1891, Wells [married his cousin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage "Cousin marriage") Isabel Mary Wells (1865–1931; from 1902 Isabel Mary Smith).[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-35) The couple agreed to separate in 1894, when he had fallen in love with one of his students, [Amy Catherine Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Wells "Catherine Wells") (1872–1927; later known as Jane), with whom he moved to [Woking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woking "Woking"), Surrey, in May 1895. They lived in a rented house, 'Lynton' (now No. 141), Maybury Road, in the town centre for just under 18 months and married at St Pancras register office in October 1895.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-WIW-WBC-36)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-batchelor-22): 165  His short period in Woking was perhaps the most creative and productive of his whole writing career; while there, he planned and wrote _[The War of the Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_War\_of\_the\_Worlds "The War of the Worlds")_ and _[The Time Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Time\_Machine "The Time Machine")_, completed _[The Island of Doctor Moreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Island\_of\_Doctor\_Moreau "The Island of Doctor Moreau")_, wrote and published _[The Wonderful Visit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Wonderful\_Visit "The Wonderful Visit")_ and _[The Wheels of Chance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Wheels\_of\_Chance "The Wheels of Chance")_, and began writing two other early books, _[When the Sleeper Wakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When\_the\_Sleeper\_Wakes "When the Sleeper Wakes")_ and _[Love and Mr Lewisham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love\_and\_Mr\_Lewisham "Love and Mr Lewisham")_.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-WIW-WBC-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-GoogleRiddle-37)

Wells's second wife, Amy Catherine "Jane" Wells

In late summer 1896, Wells and Jane moved to a larger house in [Worcester Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_Park "Worcester Park"), near [Kingston upon Thames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_upon_Thames "Kingston upon Thames"), for two years; this lasted until his poor health took them to Sandgate, near [Folkestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folkestone "Folkestone"), where he constructed a large family home, [Spade House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spade_House "Spade House"), in 1901. He had two sons with Jane: [George Philip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._P._Wells "G. P. Wells") (known as "Gip"; 1901–1985) and Frank Richard (1903–1982)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-wagar-6): 295  (grandfather of film director [Simon Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Wells "Simon Wells")). Jane died on 6 October 1927, in [Dunmow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dunmow "Great Dunmow"), at the age of 55, which left Wells devastated. She was cremated at [Golders Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golders_Green "Golders Green"), with friends of the couple present including [George Bernard Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw "George Bernard Shaw").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-hammond-27): 64

Wells had multiple love [affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affair "Affair").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-38)[Dorothy Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Richardson "Dorothy Richardson") was a friend with whom he had a brief affair which led to a pregnancy and miscarriage, in 1907. Wells's wife had been a schoolmate of Richardson.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-39) In December 1909, he had a daughter, Anna-Jane, with the writer [Amber Reeves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Reeves "Amber Reeves"),[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-40) whose parents, [William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pember_Reeves "William Pember Reeves") and [Maud Pember Reeves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maud_Pember_Reeves "Maud Pember Reeves"), he had met through the [Fabian Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Society "Fabian Society"). Amber had married the barrister [G. R. Blanco White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._R._Blanco_White "G. R. Blanco White") in July of that year, as co-arranged by Wells. After [Beatrice Webb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Webb "Beatrice Webb") voiced disapproval of Wells's "sordid intrigue" with Amber, he responded by lampooning Beatrice Webb and her husband Sidney Webb in his 1911 novel _The New Machiavelli_ as 'Altiora and Oscar Bailey', a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. Between 1910 and 1913, novelist [Elizabeth von Arnim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_von_Arnim "Elizabeth von Arnim") was one of his mistresses.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-41) In 1914, he had a son, [Anthony West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_West_(author) "Anthony West (author)") (1914–1987), by the novelist and [feminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism "Feminism")[Rebecca West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_West "Rebecca West"), 26 years his junior.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-42) In 1920–21, and intermittently until his death, he had a love affair with the American [birth control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control "Birth control") activist [Margaret Sanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger "Margaret Sanger").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-43)

Between 1924 and 1933, he partnered with the 22-year-younger Dutch adventurer and writer [Odette Keun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odette_Keun "Odette Keun"), with whom he lived in _Lou Pidou_, a house they built together in [Grasse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasse "Grasse"), France. Wells dedicated his longest book to her (_[The World of William Clissold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_World\_of\_William\_Clissold "The World of William Clissold")_, 1926).[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-44) When visiting [Maxim Gorky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Gorky "Maxim Gorky") in Russia 1920, he had slept with Gorky's mistress [Moura Budberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moura_Budberg "Moura Budberg"),[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-45) then still Countess Benckendorf and 27 years his junior. In 1933, when she left Gorky and emigrated to London, their relationship renewed and she cared for him through his final illness. Wells repeatedly asked her to marry him, but Budberg strongly rejected his proposals.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-46)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-47)

In _Experiment in Autobiography_ (1934), Wells wrote: "I was never a great amorist, though I have loved several people very deeply".[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-48)[David Lodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lodge_(author) "David Lodge (author)")'s novel _A Man of Parts_ (2011)– a 'narrative based on factual sources' (author's note)– gives a convincing and generally sympathetic account of Wells's relations with the women mentioned above, and others.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-49)

One of the ways that Wells expressed himself was through his drawings and sketches. One common location for these was the endpapers and title pages of his own diaries, and they covered a wide variety of topics, from political commentary to his feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romantic interests. During his marriage to Amy Catherine, whom he nicknamed Jane, he drew a considerable number of pictures, many of them being overt comments on their marriage. During this period, he called these pictures "picshuas".[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-50) These picshuas have been the topic of study by Wells scholars for many years, and in 2006, a book was published on the subject.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-51)

Statue of a [tripod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod_(The_War_of_the_Worlds) "Tripod (The War of the Worlds)") from _[The War of the Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_War\_of\_the\_Worlds "The War of the Worlds")_ in [Woking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woking "Woking"). The book is a seminal depiction of a conflict between humankind and an [extraterrestrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrials_in_fiction "Extraterrestrials in fiction") race.

Some of his early novels, called "[scientific romances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_romance "Scientific romance")", invented several themes now classic in science fiction in such works as _[The Time Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Time\_Machine "The Time Machine")_, _[The Island of Doctor Moreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Island\_of\_Doctor\_Moreau "The Island of Doctor Moreau")_, _[The Invisible Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Invisible\_Man "The Invisible Man")_, _[The War of the Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_War\_of\_the\_Worlds "The War of the Worlds")_, _[When the Sleeper Wakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sleeper\_Awakes "The Sleeper Awakes")_, and _[The First Men in the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_First\_Men\_in\_the\_Moon "The First Men in the Moon")_. He also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim, including _[Kipps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kipps "Kipps")_ and a critique of English culture during the [Edwardian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwardian_period "Edwardian period"), _[Tono-Bungay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tono-Bungay "Tono-Bungay")_. Wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas, including, "The Flowering of the Strange Orchid", which helped bring the full impact of [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin")'s revolutionary botanical ideas to a wider public, and was followed by many later successes such as "[The Country of the Blind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Country_of_the_Blind "The Country of the Blind")" (1904).[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-52)

Writer [James E. Gunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Gunn_(writer) "James E. Gunn (writer)") contended that one of Wells's major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach, referring to it as his "new system of ideas".[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-53) Gunn opined that an author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as "the plausible impossible" and "[suspension of disbelief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief "Suspension of disbelief")". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-54) The term "[time machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_machine "Time machine")", coined by Wells, is almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-McFarland-23) He explained that while writing _The Time Machine_, he realized that "the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the [Time Traveller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel "Time travel") were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts."[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-55) In "Wells's Law", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Therefore, as justifications for the impossible, he employed scientific ideas and theories. Wells's best-known statement of the "law" appears in his introduction to a collection of his works published in 1934:

> As soon as the magic trick has been done the whole business of the fantasy writer is to keep everything else human and real. Touches of prosaic detail are imperative and a rigorous adherence to the hypothesis. Any extra fantasy outside the cardinal assumption immediately gives a touch of irresponsible silliness to the invention.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Bhelkar_2009_p._19-56)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Wells_1934_p._viii-57)

[Dr. Griffin / The Invisible Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_(The_Invisible_Man) "Griffin (The Invisible Man)") is a brilliant research scientist who discovers a method of invisibility, but finds himself unable to reverse the process. An enthusiast of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic character in [horror fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction "Horror fiction").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-58)_The Island of Doctor Moreau_ sees a shipwrecked man left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, a [mad scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_scientist "Mad scientist") who creates [human-like hybrid beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93animal_hybrid "Human–animal hybrid") from animals via vivisection.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-59) The earliest depiction of [uplift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_(science_fiction) "Uplift (science fiction)"), the novel deals with a number of philosophical themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and [human interference with nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_in_fiction#Genetics_themes "Genetics in fiction").[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-60) In _The First Men in the Moon_ Wells used the idea of radio communication between [astronomical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object"), a plot point inspired by [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla "Nikola Tesla")'s claim that he had received radio signals from Mars.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-61) In addition to science fiction, Wells produced work dealing with mythological beings like an angel in _[The Wonderful Visit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Wonderful\_Visit "The Wonderful Visit")_ (1895) and a mermaid in _[The Sea Lady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sea\_Lady "The Sea Lady")_ (1902).[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-62)

Though _Tono-Bungay_ is not a science-fiction novel, radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it. Radioactive decay plays a much larger role in _[The World Set Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_World\_Set\_Free "The World Set Free")_ (1914), a book dedicated to [Frederick Soddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Soddy "Frederick Soddy") who would receive a Nobel for proving the existence of radioactive [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Chain_reactor-63) This book contains what is surely Wells's biggest prophetic "hit", with the first description of a [nuclear weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon") (which he termed "atomic bombs").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Chain_reactor-63)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Nuclear-64) Scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of [radium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium "Radium") releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years. The _rate_ of release is too slow to have practical utility, but the _total amount_ released is huge. Wells's novel revolves around an (unspecified) invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay, producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosives—but which "continue to explode" for days on end. "Nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century, than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible... [but] they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands".[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Nuclear-64) In 1932, the physicist and conceiver of [nuclear chain reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_chain_reaction "Nuclear chain reaction")[Leó Szilárd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le%C3%B3_Szil%C3%A1rd "Leó Szilárd") read _The World Set Free_ (the same year Sir [James Chadwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chadwick "James Chadwick") discovered the [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron")), a book which he wrote in his memoirs had made "a very great impression on me".[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-65) In 1934, Szilárd took his ideas for a chain reaction to the [British War Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_War_Office "British War Office") and later the [Admiralty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_(United_Kingdom) "Admiralty (United Kingdom)"), assigning his patent to the Admiralty to keep the news from reaching the notice of the wider scientific community. He wrote, "Knowing what this [a chain reaction] would mean—and I knew it because I had read H.G. Wells—I did not want this patent to become public."[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Chain_reactor-63)

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/H_G_Wells_crater_5163_med.jpg/250px-H_G_Wells_crater_5163_med.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H_G_Wells_crater_5163_med.jpg)

The [H.G. Wells crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells_(crater) "H. G. Wells (crater)"), located on the [far side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon "Far side of the Moon"), was named after the author of _[The First Men in the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_First\_Men\_in\_the\_Moon "The First Men in the Moon")_ (1901) in 1970.

Wells also wrote non-fiction. His first non-fiction [bestseller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bestseller "Bestseller") was _[Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life and Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticipations "Anticipations")_ (1901). When originally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled "An Experiment in Prophecy", and is considered his most explicitly [futuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future "Future") work. It offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able, rather than the traditional upper classes, as leaders. Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of populations from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German [militarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarism "Militarism"), and the existence of a European Union) and its misses (he did not expect successful [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft "Aircraft") before 1950, and averred that "my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea").[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-66)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-67)

His bestselling two-volume work, _[The Outline of History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Outline\_of\_History "The Outline of History")_ (1920), began a new era of popularised world history. It received a mixed critical response from professional historians.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-68) However, it was very popular amongst the general population and made Wells a rich man. Many other authors followed with "Outlines" of their own in other subjects. He reprised his _Outline_ in 1922 with a much shorter popular work, _[A Short History of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Short\_History\_of\_the\_World\_(H.\_G.\_Wells) "A Short History of the World (H. G. Wells)")_, a history book praised by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"),[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-69) and two long efforts, _[The Science of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Science\_of\_Life "The Science of Life")_ (1930)—written with his son [G. P. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._P._Wells "G. P. Wells") and evolutionary biologist [Julian Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Huxley "Julian Huxley"), and _[The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Work,\_Wealth\_and\_Happiness\_of\_Mankind "The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind")_ (1931).[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-70)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-71) The "Outlines" became sufficiently common for [James Thurber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Thurber "James Thurber") to parody the trend in his humorous essay, "An Outline of Scientists"—indeed, Wells's _Outline of History_ remains in print with a new 2005 edition, while _A Short History of the World_ has been re-edited (2006).[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-72)

H.G. Wells c. 1918

From quite early in Wells's career, he sought a better way to organise society and wrote a number of [Utopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia "Utopia") novels.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Davis-2003-3) The first of these was _[A Modern Utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Modern\_Utopia "A Modern Utopia")_ (1905), which shows a worldwide utopia with "no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all";[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-73) two travellers from our world fall into its [alternate history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history "Alternate history"). The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realise a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a [comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet") causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (_[In the Days of the Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In\_the\_Days\_of\_the\_Comet "In the Days of the Comet")_ (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in _[The Shape of Things to Come](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Shape\_of\_Things\_to\_Come "The Shape of Things to Come")_ (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 [Alexander Korda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Korda "Alexander Korda") film, _[Things to Come](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things\_to\_Come "Things to Come")_). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending [World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of [fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism") dictators in _The Autocracy of Mr Parham_ (1930) and _The Holy Terror_ (1939). _[Men Like Gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men\_Like\_Gods "Men Like Gods")_ (1923) is also a utopian novel. Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the literary critic [Malcolm Cowley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Cowley "Malcolm Cowley") stated: "by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer".[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-74)

Wells contemplates the ideas of [nature and nurture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_and_nurture "Nature and nurture") and questions humanity in books such as _The First Men in the Moon_, where nature is completely suppressed by nurture, and _The Island of Doctor Moreau_, where the strong presence of nature represents a threat to a civilized society. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a [dystopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia "Dystopia") novel, _When the Sleeper Wakes_ (1899, rewritten as _The Sleeper Awakes_, 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-75)_The Island of Doctor Moreau_ is even darker. The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like [Gulliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels "Gulliver's Travels") on his return from the [Houyhnhnms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houyhnhnm "Houyhnhnm"), he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Moreau-76)

Wells also wrote the preface for the first edition of [W. N. P. Barbellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._N._P._Barbellion "W. N. P. Barbellion")'s diaries, _The Journal of a Disappointed Man_, published in 1919. Since "Barbellion" was the real author's [pen name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_name "Pen name"), many reviewers believed Wells to have been the true author of the _Journal_; Wells always denied this, despite being full of praise for the diaries.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-77)

In 1927, a Canadian teacher and writer [Florence Deeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Deeks "Florence Deeks") unsuccessfully sued Wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust, claiming that much of _The Outline of History_ had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript,[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-78)_The Web of the World's Romance_, which had spent nearly nine months in the hands of Wells's Canadian publisher, Macmillan Canada.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-79) However, it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in Toronto in the safekeeping of Macmillan, and that Wells did not even know it existed, let alone seen it.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-80) The court found no proof of copying, and decided the similarities were due to the fact that the books had similar nature and both writers had access to the same sources.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-81) The case went on appeal from the Canadian courts to the [Judicial Committee of the Privy Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council "Judicial Committee of the Privy Council"), at that time the highest court of appeal for the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"), which dismissed the appeal in [Deeks v Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deeks_v_Wells "Deeks v Wells").[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-82) In 2000, [A. B. McKillop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._B._McKillop "A. B. McKillop"), a professor of history at Carleton University, produced a book on the case, _The Spinster & The Prophet: Florence Deeks, H.G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past_.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-83) According to McKillop, the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author, and he paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-84) In 2004, Denis N. Magnusson, professor emeritus of the Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Ontario, published an article on _Deeks v. Wells_. This re-examines the case in relation to McKillop's book. While having some sympathy for Deeks, he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with [sexism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism "Sexism") from her lawyers, she received a fair trial, adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e., 2004).[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-85)

In 1933, Wells predicted in _The Shape of Things to Come_ that the world war he feared would begin in January 1940,[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-86) a prediction which ultimately came true four months early, in September 1939, with the outbreak of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-wagar-6): 209  In 1936, before the [Royal Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Institution "Royal Institution"), Wells called for the compilation of a constantly growing and changing World [Encyclopaedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia "Encyclopaedia"), to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being. He also presented on his conception of a world encyclopedia at the [World Congress of Universal Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Congress_of_Universal_Documentation "World Congress of Universal Documentation") in Paris in 1937.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-87)

In 1938, he published a collection of essays on the future organisation of knowledge and education, _[World Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World\_Brain "World Brain")_, including the essay "The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia".[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-88)

Prior to 1933, Wells's books were widely read in Germany and Austria, and most of his science fiction works had been translated shortly after publication.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Partington-89) By 1933, he had attracted the attention of German officials because of his criticism of the political situation in Germany, and on 10 May 1933, Wells's books were [burned by the Nazi youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_book-burning_incidents#Jewish,_anti-Nazi_and_%22degenerate%22_books_(by_the_Nazis) "List of book-burning incidents") in Berlin's [Opernplatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebelplatz "Bebelplatz"), and his works were banned from libraries and book stores.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Partington-89) Wells, as president of [PEN International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEN_International "PEN International") (Poets, Essayists, Novelists), angered the [Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism") by overseeing the expulsion of the German PEN club from the international body in 1934 following the German PEN's refusal to admit non-[Aryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_race "Aryan race") writers to its membership. At a PEN conference in [Ragusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik "Dubrovnik"), Wells refused to yield to Nazi sympathisers who demanded that the exiled author [Ernst Toller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Toller "Ernst Toller") be prevented from speaking.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Partington-89) Near the end of World War II, [Allied forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") discovered that the [SS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel "Schutzstaffel") had compiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion of Britain in the abandoned [Operation Sea Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion "Operation Sea Lion"), with Wells included in the alphabetical list of "[The Black Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_(list) "The Black Book (list)")".[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-90)

Title page of Wells's _The War That Will End War_ (1914)

Seeking a more structured way to play war games, Wells wrote _[Floor Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor\_Games "Floor Games")_ (1911) followed by _[Little Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little\_Wars "Little Wars")_ (1913), which set out rules for fighting battles with [toy soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_soldier "Toy soldier") (miniatures).[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-toy_soldiers-91) A [pacifist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacificism "Pacificism") prior to the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War"), Wells stated "how much better is this amiable miniature [war] than the real thing".[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-toy_soldiers-91) According to Wells, the idea of the game developed from a visit by his friend [Jerome K. Jerome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_K._Jerome "Jerome K. Jerome"). After dinner, Jerome began shooting down toy soldiers with a toy cannon and Wells joined in to compete.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-toy_soldiers-91)

During August 1914, immediately after the outbreak of the First World War, Wells published a number of articles in London newspapers that subsequently appeared as a book entitled _The War That Will End War_.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-wagar-6): 147 [[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-92) He coined the expression with the idealistic belief that the result of the war would make a future conflict impossible.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-93) Wells blamed the [Central Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers "Central Powers") for the coming of the war and argued that only the defeat of German [militarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarism "Militarism") could bring about an end to war.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Russell-94) Wells used the shorter form of the phrase, "[the war to end war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_war_to_end_war "The war to end war")", in _In the Fourth Year_ (1918), in which he noted that the phrase "got into circulation" in the second half of 1914.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-95) In fact, it had become one of the most common [catchphrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase "Catchphrase") of the war.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Russell-94)

In 1918, Wells worked for the British [War Propaganda Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Propaganda_Bureau "War Propaganda Bureau"), also called Wellington House.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Wartime-96) Wells was also one of fifty-three leading British authors — a number that included [Rudyard Kipling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling "Rudyard Kipling"), [Thomas Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy "Thomas Hardy") and Sir [Arthur Conan Doyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle "Arthur Conan Doyle") — who signed their names to the "Authors' Declaration." This manifesto declared that the German invasion of Belgium had been a brutal crime, and that Britain "could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war".[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Wartime-96)

Wells (left) pictured with Soviet physiologist [Ivan Pavlov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov "Ivan Pavlov")

Wells visited Russia three times: 1914, 1920 and 1934. After his visits to [Petrograd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg "Saint Petersburg") and [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow"), in January 1914, he came back to England, "a staunch Russophile". His views were recorded in a newspaper article, "Russia and England: A Study on Contrasts", published in _[The Daily News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Daily\_News\_(UK) "The Daily News (UK)")_ on 1 February 1941, and in his novel _[Joan and Peter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan\_and\_Peter "Joan and Peter")_ (1918).[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-97) During his second visit, he saw his old friend [Maxim Gorky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Gorky "Maxim Gorky") and with Gorky's help, met [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin"). In his book _[Russia in the Shadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\_in\_the\_Shadows "Russia in the Shadows")_, Wells portrayed Russia as recovering from a total social collapse, "the completest that has ever happened to any modern social organisation".[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-98) On 23 July 1934, after visiting U.S. President [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt"), Wells went to the Soviet Union and interviewed [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") for three hours for the _[New Statesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Statesman "New Statesman")_ magazine, which was extremely rare at that time. He told Stalin how he had seen 'the happy faces of healthy people' in contrast with his previous visit to Moscow in 1920.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-99) However, he also criticised the lawlessness, class discrimination, state violence, and absence of [free expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech "Freedom of speech"). Stalin enjoyed the conversation and replied accordingly. As the chairman of the London-based [PEN International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEN_International "PEN International"), which protected the rights of authors to write without being intimidated, Wells hoped by his trip to USSR, he could win Stalin over by force of argument. Before he left, he realised that no reform was to happen in the near future.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-100)[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-101)

H.G. Wells in 1943

Wells's greatest literary output occurred before the First World War, which was lamented by younger authors whom he had influenced. In this connection, [George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell "George Orwell") described Wells as "too sane to understand the modern world", and "since 1920 he has squandered his talents in slaying [paper dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_tiger "Paper tiger")."[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-102)[G. K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton "G. K. Chesterton") quipped: "Mr Wells is a born storyteller who has sold his birthright for a pot of message".[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-103)

Wells had [diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus "Diabetes mellitus"),[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-104) and was a co-founder in 1934 of The Diabetic Association (now [Diabetes UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_UK "Diabetes UK"), the leading charity for people with diabetes in the UK).[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-105)

On 28 October 1940, on the radio station [KTSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTSA "KTSA") in [San Antonio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio "San Antonio"), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas"), Wells took part in a radio interview with [Orson Welles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles "Orson Welles"), who two years previously had performed a famous [radio adaptation of _The War of the Worlds_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(1938_radio_drama) "The War of the Worlds (1938 radio drama)"). During the interview, by Charles C Shaw, a KTSA radio host, Wells admitted his surprise at the sensation that resulted from the broadcast but acknowledged his debt to Welles for increasing sales of one of his "more obscure" titles.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-106)

You _damned_ fools."[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-108) Wells's body was cremated at [Golders Green Crematorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golders_Green_Crematorium "Golders Green Crematorium") on 16 August 1946; his ashes were subsequently scattered into the [English Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel "English Channel") at [Old Harry Rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Harry_Rocks "Old Harry Rocks"), the most eastern point of the [Jurassic Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Coast "Jurassic Coast") and about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) from [Swanage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanage "Swanage") in [Dorset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset "Dorset").[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-109)

A [futurist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist "Futurist") and "visionary", Wells foresaw the advent of [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft "Aircraft"), [tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank "Tank"), [space travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight"), [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon"), [satellite television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television "Satellite television"), and something resembling the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-visionary-5) Asserting that "Wells's visions of the future remain unsurpassed", [John Higgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Higgs "John Higgs"), author of _Stranger Than We Can Imagine: Making Sense of the Twentieth Century_, states that in the late 19th century Wells "saw the coming century clearer than anyone else. He anticipated wars in the air, the sexual revolution, motorised transport causing the growth of suburbs and a proto-Wikipedia he called the "[world brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Brain "World Brain")". In his novel _The World Set Free_, he imagined an "atomic bomb" of terrifying power that would be dropped from aeroplanes. This was an extraordinary insight for an author writing in 1913, and it made a deep impression on Winston Churchill."[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Higgs-111)

> Many readers have hailed H.G. Wells and George Orwell as special kinds of writers, ones endowed with remarkable prescriptive and prophetic powers. Wells was the twentieth-century prototype of this literary vatic figure: he invented the role, explored its possibilities, especially through new forms of prose and new ways to publish, and defined its boundaries. His impact on his culture was profound; as George Orwell wrote, "The minds of all of us, and therefore the physical world, would be perceptibly different if Wells had never existed."

— _The Author as Cultural Hero: H.G. Wells and George Orwell_.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-112)

In 2011, Wells was among a group of science fiction writers featured in the _[Prophets of Science Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophets\_of\_Science\_Fiction "Prophets of Science Fiction")_ series, a show produced and hosted by film director Sir [Ridley Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott "Ridley Scott"), which depicts how predictions influenced the development of scientific advancements by inspiring many readers to assist in transforming those futuristic visions into everyday reality.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-113) In a 2013 review of _The Time Machine_ for the _New Yorker_ magazine, [Brad Leithauser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Leithauser "Brad Leithauser") writes, "At the base of Wells's great visionary exploit is this rational, ultimately scientific attempt to tease out the potential future consequences of present conditions—not as they might arise in a few years, or even decades, but millennia hence, epochs hence. He is world literature's Great Extrapolator. Like no other fiction writer before him, he embraced "[deep time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_time "Deep time")".[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-114)

[Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") avidly read Wells. An October 1906 Churchill speech was partly inspired by Wells's ideas of a supportive state as a "Utopia". Two days earlier, Churchill had written to Wells: "I owe you a great debt."[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Churchill-115)[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-116)

[Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") was an avid reader of Wells's books; after they first met in 1902, they kept in touch until Wells died in 1946.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Churchill-115) As a junior minister, Churchill borrowed lines from Wells for one of his most famous early landmark speeches in 1906; as Prime Minister, the phrase "[the gathering storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_World_War_(book_series) "The Second World War (book series)")"—used by Churchill to describe the rise of Nazi Germany—had been written by Wells in _The War of the Worlds_, which depicts an attack on Britain by Martians.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Churchill-115) Wells's extensive writings on equality and human rights, most notably his most influential work, _The Rights of Man_ (1940), laid the groundwork for the 1948 [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights "Universal Declaration of Human Rights"), which was adopted by the United Nations shortly after his death.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-119)

His efforts regarding the [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations "League of Nations"), on which he collaborated on the project with [Leonard Woolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Woolf "Leonard Woolf") with the booklets _The Idea of a League of Nations_, _Prolegomena to the Study of World Organization_, and _The Way of the League of Nations_, became a disappointment as the organization turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent the Second World War, which itself occurred towards the very end of his life and only increased the pessimistic side of his nature.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-120) In his last book _[Mind at the End of Its Tether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind\_at\_the\_End\_of\_Its\_Tether "Mind at the End of Its Tether")_ (1945), he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea. He referred to the era between the two World Wars as "The Age of Frustration".[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-121)

Wells was initially an opponent of [Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism "Anti-Zionism"). In _[In the Days of the Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In\_the\_Days\_of\_the\_Comet "In the Days of the Comet")_, Jews are described as parasites on European society. However, Wells later became a strong supporter of the establishment of a Jewish state in response to the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust "Holocaust").[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-122)

He was a member of [The Other Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Club "The Other Club"), a London dining club.

Wells's views on God and religion changed over his lifetime. Early in his life, he distanced himself from Christianity, and later from [theism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theism "Theism"); finally, late in life, he was essentially atheistic. [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner "Martin Gardner") summarises this progression:

> [The younger Wells]... did not object to using the word "God" provided it did not imply anything resembling human personality. In his middle years Wells went through a phase of defending the concept of a "finite God," similar to the god of such [process theologians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_theologian "Process theologian") as [Samuel Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alexander "Samuel Alexander"), [Edgar Brightman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Brightman "Edgar Brightman"), and [Charles Hartshorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hartshorne "Charles Hartshorne"). (He even wrote a book about it called _[God the Invisible King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God\_the\_Invisible\_King "God the Invisible King")_.) Later Wells decided he was really an atheist.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-123)

In _God the Invisible King_ (1917), Wells wrote that his idea of God did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world:

> This book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer. [Which] is a profound belief in a personal and intimate God.... Putting the leading idea of this book very roughly, these two antagonistic typical conceptions of God may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as God-as-Nature or the Creator, and of the other as God-as-Christ or the Redeemer. One is the great Outward God; the other is the Inmost God. The first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the God of Spinoza. It is a conception of God tending to pantheism, to an idea of a comprehensive God as ruling with justice rather than affection, to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness. The second idea, which is contradictory to this idea of an absolute God, is the God of the human heart. The writer suggested that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced Christianity, was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of God into one focus.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-124)

Later in the work, he aligns himself with a "renascent or modern religion... neither atheist nor Buddhist nor Mohammedan nor Christian... [that] he has found growing up in himself".[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-125)

Of [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"), he said: "it is not now true for me.... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother... but if systemically I called myself a Christian I feel that to most men I should imply too much and so tell a lie". Of other world religions, he writes: "All these religions are true for me as [Canterbury Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Cathedral "Canterbury Cathedral") is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.... They do not work for me".[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-126) In _[The Fate of Homo Sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Fate\_of\_Homo\_Sapiens "The Fate of Homo Sapiens")_ (1939), Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating "there is no creed, no way of living left in the world at all, that really meets the needs of the time.... When we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide."[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-127)

Wells's opposition to organised religion reached a fever pitch in 1943 with publication of his book _[Crux Ansata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux\_Ansata "Crux Ansata")_, subtitled "An Indictment of the Roman Catholic Church" in which he attacked [Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism "Catholicism"), [Pope Pius XII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XII "Pope Pius XII") and called for the bombing of the city of [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome").[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-128)

H.G. Wells as depicted in Gernsback's _[Science Wonder Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science\_Wonder\_Stories "Science Wonder Stories")_ in 1929

The science fiction historian [John Clute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clute "John Clute") describes Wells as "the most important writer the genre has yet seen", and notes his work has been central to both British and American science fiction.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-jc-129) Science fiction author and critic [Algis Budrys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algis_Budrys "Algis Budrys") said Wells "remains the outstanding expositor of both the hope, and the despair, which are embodied in the technology and which are the major facts of life in our world".[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-budrys196809-130) He was nominated for the [Nobel Prize in Literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature "Nobel Prize in Literature") in 1921, 1932, 1935, and 1946.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Nobel_nominations-10) Wells so influenced real exploration of space that impact craters on Mars [and the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells_(crater) "H. G. Wells (crater)") were named after him:[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Sagan-131)

> Wells's genius was his ability to create a stream of brand new, wholly original stories out of thin air. Originality was Wells's calling card. In a six-year stretch from 1895 to 1901, he produced a stream of what he called "scientific romance" novels, which included _[The Time Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Time\_Machine "The Time Machine")_, _[The Island of Doctor Moreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Island\_of\_Doctor\_Moreau "The Island of Doctor Moreau")_, _[The Invisible Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Invisible\_Man "The Invisible Man")_, _[The War of the Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_War\_of\_the\_Worlds "The War of the Worlds")_ and _[The First Men in the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_First\_Men\_in\_the\_Moon "The First Men in the Moon")_. This was a dazzling display of new thought, endlessly copied since. A book like _The War of the Worlds_ inspired every one of the thousands of alien invasion stories that followed. It burned its way into the psyche of mankind and changed us all forever.

Magazine reprint of Wells's 1910 [dystopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopian "Dystopian") science fiction _[When the Sleeper Wakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When\_the\_Sleeper\_Wakes "When the Sleeper Wakes")_

In the United Kingdom, Wells's work was a key model for the British "scientific romance", and other writers in that mode, such as [Olaf Stapledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Stapledon "Olaf Stapledon"),[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-132)[J. D. Beresford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Beresford "J. D. Beresford"),[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-rb-133)[S. Fowler Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Fowler_Wright "S. Fowler Wright"),[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-134) and [Naomi Mitchison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Mitchison "Naomi Mitchison"),[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-135) all drew on Wells's example. Wells was also an important influence on British science fiction of the period after the Second World War, with [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke "Arthur C. Clarke")[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-136) and [Brian Aldiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Aldiss "Brian Aldiss")[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-137) expressing strong admiration for Wells's work. A self-declared fan of Wells, [John Wyndham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wyndham "John Wyndham"), author of _[The Day of the Triffids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Day\_of\_the\_Triffids "The Day of the Triffids")_ and _[The Midwich Cuckoos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Midwich\_Cuckoos "The Midwich Cuckoos")_, echoes Wells's obsession with catastrophe and its aftermath.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-138) His early work (pre 1920) made Wells the literary hero of [dystopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopian "Dystopian") novelist [George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell "George Orwell").[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-139) Among contemporary British science fiction writers, [Stephen Baxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baxter_(author) "Stephen Baxter (author)"), [Christopher Priest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Priest_(novelist) "Christopher Priest (novelist)") and [Adam Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Roberts_(British_writer) "Adam Roberts (British writer)") have all acknowledged Wells's influence on their writing; all three are vice-presidents of the [H. G. Wells Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells_Society "H. G. Wells Society"). He also had a strong influence on British scientist [J. B. S. Haldane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane "J. B. S. Haldane"), who wrote _[Daedalus; or, Science and the Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalus;\_or,\_Science\_and\_the\_Future "Daedalus; or, Science and the Future")_ (1924), "The Last Judgement" and "On Being the Right Size" from the essay collection _Possible Worlds_ (1927), and _Biological Possibilities for the Human Species in the Next Ten Thousand Years_ (1963), which are speculations about the future of human evolution and life on other planets. Haldane gave several lectures about these topics which in turn influenced other science fiction writers.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-140)[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-141)

Wells's works were reprinted in American science fiction magazines as late as the 1950s.

In the United States, [Hugo Gernsback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Gernsback "Hugo Gernsback") reprinted most of Wells's work in the pulp magazine _[Amazing Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing\_Stories "Amazing Stories")_, regarding Wells's work as "texts of central importance to the self-conscious new genre".[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-jc-129) Later American writers such as [Ray Bradbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury "Ray Bradbury"),[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-142)[Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov "Isaac Asimov"),[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-143)[Frank Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert "Frank Herbert"),[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-144)[Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan "Carl Sagan"),[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Sagan-131) and [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin "Ursula K. Le Guin")[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-jh2-145) all recalled being influenced by Wells.

[Sinclair Lewis's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Lewis%27s "Sinclair Lewis's") early novels were strongly influenced by Wells's realistic social novels, such as _[The History of Mr Polly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_History\_of\_Mr\_Polly "The History of Mr Polly")_; Lewis also named his first son Wells after the author.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-146) Lewis nominated H.G. Wells for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Nobel_nominations-10)

In an interview with _[The Paris Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Paris\_Review "The Paris Review")_, [Vladimir Nabokov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Nabokov "Vladimir Nabokov") described Wells as his favourite writer when he was a boy and "a great artist".[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Nabokov-147) He went on to cite _The Passionate Friends_, _[Ann Veronica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann\_Veronica "Ann Veronica")_, _The Time Machine_, and _[The Country of the Blind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Country\_of\_the\_Blind "The Country of the Blind")_ as superior to anything else written by Wells's British contemporaries. Nabokov said: "His sociological cogitations can be safely ignored, of course, but his romances and fantasies are superb."[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Nabokov-147)

[![Image 23](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Herbert_George_Wells_Postal_stationery_envelope_Russia_2016_No_286.jpg/250px-Herbert_George_Wells_Postal_stationery_envelope_Russia_2016_No_286.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Herbert_George_Wells_Postal_stationery_envelope_Russia_2016_No_286.jpg)

2016 illustrated postal envelope with an image from _The War of the Worlds_, [Russian Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Post "Russian Post"), commemorating the 150th anniversary of the author's birth

[Jorge Luis Borges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges "Jorge Luis Borges") wrote many short pieces on Wells in which he demonstrates a deep familiarity with much of Wells's work.[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-148) While Borges wrote several critical reviews, including a mostly negative review of Wells's film _Things to Come_,[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-149) he regularly treated Wells as a canonical figure of fantastic literature. Late in his life, Borges included _The Invisible Man_ and _The Time Machine_ in his _Prologue to a Personal Library_,[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-150) a curated list of 100 great works of literature that he undertook at the behest of the Argentine publishing house [Emecé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emec%C3%A9_Editores "Emecé Editores"). Wells also inspired writers of continental European speculative fiction such as [Karel Čapek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_%C4%8Capek "Karel Čapek"),[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-jh2-145)[Mikhail Bulgakov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bulgakov "Mikhail Bulgakov")[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-151) and [Yevgeny Zamyatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Zamyatin "Yevgeny Zamyatin").[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-jh2-145)

In 2021, Wells was one of six British writers commemorated on a [series of UK postage stamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_commemorative_stamps_2020%E2%80%932029#2021 "Great Britain commemorative stamps 2020–2029") issued by [Royal Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail "Royal Mail") to celebrate British science fiction.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Commemorate-152) Six classic science fiction novels were depicted, one from each author, with _The Time Machine_ chosen to represent Wells.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-Commemorate-152)

*   The superhuman protagonist of [J. D. Beresford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Beresford "J. D. Beresford")'s 1911 novel, _[The Hampdenshire Wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Hampdenshire\_Wonder "The Hampdenshire Wonder")_, Victor Stott, was based on Wells.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-rb-133)
*   In [M. P. Shiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._P._Shiel "M. P. Shiel")'s short story "The Primate of the Rose" (1928), there is an unpleasant womaniser named E.P. Crooks, who was written as a parody of Wells.[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-arm-153) Wells had attacked Shiel's _Prince Zaleski_ when it was published in 1895, and this was Shiel's response.[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-arm-153) Wells praised Shiel's _[The Purple Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Purple\_Cloud "The Purple Cloud")_ (1901); in turn Shiel expressed admiration for Wells, referring to him at a speech to the [Horsham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsham "Horsham")[Rotary Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club "Rotary Club") in 1933 as "my friend Mr. Wells".[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-arm-153)

Lewis")'s novel _[That Hideous Strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That\_Hideous\_Strength "That Hideous Strength")_ (1945), the character Jules is a caricature of Wells,[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-154) and much of Lewis's science fiction was written both under the influence of Wells and as an antithesis to his work (or, as he put it, an "exorcism"[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-155) of the influence it had on him).
*   In [Brian Aldiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Aldiss "Brian Aldiss")'s novella _The Saliva Tree_ (1966), Wells has a small off-screen guest role.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-156)
*   In [Saul Bellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bellow "Saul Bellow")'s novel _[Mr. Sammler's Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr.\_Sammler%27s\_Planet "Mr. Sammler's Planet")_ (1970), Wells is one of several historical figures the protagonist met when he was a young man.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-157)
*   In _[The Dancers at the End of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Dancers\_at\_the\_End\_of\_Time "The Dancers at the End of Time")_ by Michael Moorcock (1976) Wells has an important part.
*   In _[The Map of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Map\_of\_Time "The Map of Time")_ (2008) by Spanish author [Félix J. Palma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_J._Palma "Félix J. Palma"); Wells is one of several historical characters.[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-158)
*   Wells is one of the two Georges in [Paul Levinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Levinson "Paul Levinson")'s 2013 time-travel novelette, "Ian, George, and George", published in _[Analog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog\_Science\_Fiction\_and\_Fact "Analog Science Fiction and Fact")_ magazine.[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells#cite_note-159)
*   [David Lodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lodge_(author) "David Lodge (author)")'s novel _A Man of Parts_ (2011) is a literary retelling of the life of Wells.
*   H. G. Wells is a member of a fellowship of vampire hunters set in the year 1888 in the novel _Modern Marvels– Viktoriana_ (2013) written by [Wayne Reinagel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Reinagel "Wayne Reinagel"). The fellowship includes [Mary Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley "Mary Shelley"), [Edgar Allan Poe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe "Edgar Allan Poe"), [Jules Verne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne "Jules Verne"), [Bram Stoker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker "Bram Stoker"), [Arthur Conan Doyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle "Arthur Conan Doyle"), [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla "Nikola Tesla"), [Harry Houdini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Houdini "Harry Houdini") and [H.
