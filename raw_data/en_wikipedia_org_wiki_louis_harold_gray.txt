[ 4 ] Louis Harold Gray FRS (10 November 1905 – 9 July 1965) was an English physicist who worked mainly on the effects of radiation on biological systems. He was one of the earliest contributors of the field of radiobiology .

[ 6 ] Amongst many other achievements, he defined a unit of radiation dosage ( absorbed dose ) which was later named after him as an SI unit, the gray .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Early life [ edit ] Gray was born as an only child on 10 November 1905 to parents Harry and Amy Gray. His father worked at a post office.

[ 9 ] Career [ edit ] 1933 - Hospital physicist at Mount Vernon Hospital , London 1936 - Developed the Bragg –Gray equation, the basis for the cavity ionization method of measuring gamma-ray energy absorption by materials [ 10 ] [ 11 ] 1937 - Built an early neutron generator at Mount Vernon Hospital [ 12 ] 1938 - Studied biological effects of neutrons using the generator 1940 - Developed concept of RBE ( Relative Biological Effectiveness ) of doses of neutrons 1952 - Initiated research into cells in hypoxic tumors and hyperbaric oxygen 1953 - Oliver Scott established the British Empire Cancer Campaign Research Unit in Radiobiology [ 13 ] at Mount Vernon Hospital with Hal Gray as director which in 1970 became  the Cancer Research Campaign's Gray Laboratory and then (in 2001) the Gray Cancer Institute.

1953 - 1960 - Under Gray's direction, Jack W. Boag developed pulse radiolysis [ 14 ] 1962 - Ed Hart, of Argonne National Laboratory, and Jack Boag [ 15 ] discovered the hydrated electron using pulse radiolysis at the Gray Laboratory - This discovery initiated a new direction of research that is still very active today and is vital for understanding the effects of radiation on biological tissue, for instance in cancer treatment .
