A non sequitur ( English: / n ɒ n ˈ s ɛ k w ɪ t ər / non SEK -wit-ər , Classical Latin : [noːn ˈsɛkᶣɪtʊr] ; "[it] does not follow") is a conversational literary device , often used for comedic purposes. It is something said that, because of its apparent lack of meaning relative to what preceded it, [ 1 ] seems absurd to the point of being humorous or confusing. This use of the term is distinct from the non sequitur in logic, where it is a fallacy .

[ 2 ] Etymology [ edit ] The expression is Latin for "[it] does not follow".

[ 3 ] It comes from the words non meaning "not" and the verb sequi meaning "to follow".

[ 4 ] Usage [ edit ] A non sequitur can denote an abrupt, illogical, or unexpected turn in plot or dialogue by including a relatively inappropriate change in manner. A non sequitur joke sincerely has no explanation, but it reflects the idiosyncrasies, mental frames and alternative world of the particular comic persona .

[ 5 ] Comic artist Gary Larson 's The Far Side cartoons are known for what Larson calls "absurd, almost non sequitur animal" characters, such as talking cows, to create a bizarre effect. He gives the example of a strip where "two cows in a field gaze toward burning Chicago, saying 'It seems that agent 6373 had accomplished her mission.'"

Along with a rhythmic pattern, these jokes, however absurd they may be, build dual frames of reference, if not alternative worlds entirely reflecting the idiosyncrasies of the individual stand-up artist.
