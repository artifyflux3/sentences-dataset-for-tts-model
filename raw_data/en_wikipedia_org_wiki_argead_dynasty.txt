[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] They were the founders and the ruling dynasty of the kingdom of Macedon from about 700 to 310 BC.

[ 4 ] Their tradition, as described in ancient Greek historiography , traced their origins to Argos , of Peloponnese in Southern Greece, hence the name Argeads or Argives .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 1 ] Initially rulers of the tribe of the same name, [ 7 ] by the time of Philip II they had expanded their reign further, to include under the rule of Macedonia all Upper Macedonian states. The family's most celebrated members were Philip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great , under whose leadership the kingdom of Macedonia gradually gained predominance throughout Greece, defeated the Achaemenid Empire and expanded as far as Egypt and India . The mythical founder of the Argead dynasty is King Caranus .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] The Argeads claimed descent from Heracles through his great-great-grandson Temenus , also king of Argos .

Origin [ edit ] Triobol of Argos (top), and a bronze coin of King Amyntas II of Macedon (bottom). The early Argead kings often copied the wolf of Argos' coins on their own coinage to highlight their supposed ancestry from this city.

[ 10 ] The words Argead and Argive derive (via Latin Argīvus ) [ 11 ] from the Greek Ἀργεῖος ( Argeios meaning "of or from Argos "), [ 12 ] which is first attested to in Homer where it was also used as a collective designation for the Greeks ( "Ἀργείων Δαναῶν" , Argive Danaans ).

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] The Argead dynasty claimed descent from the Temenids of Argos, in the Peloponnese , whose legendary ancestor was Temenus , the great-great-grandson of Heracles .

[ 1 ] In the excavations of the royal palace at Aegae , Manolis Andronikos discovered in the "tholos" room (according to some scholars "tholos" was the throne room) a Greek inscription relating to that belief.

[ 15 ] This is testified by Herodotus , in The Histories , where he mentions that three brothers of the lineage of Temenus, Gauanes , Aeropus and Perdiccas , fled from Argos to the Illyrians and then to Upper Macedonia , to a town called Lebaea , where they served the king. The latter asked them to leave his territory, believing in an omen that something great would happen to Perdiccas. The boys went to another part of Macedonia , near the garden of Midas , above which mount Bermio stands. There they made their abode and slowly formed their own kingdom.

[ 16 ] Herodotus also relates the incident of the participation of Alexander I of Macedon in the Olympic Games in 504 or 500 BC where the participation of the Macedonian king was contested by participants on the grounds that he was not Greek. The Hellanodikai , however, after examining his Argead claim confirmed that the Macedonian kings were Greeks and allowed him to participate.

[ 17 ] The route of the Argeads from Argos , Peloponnese , to Macedonia according to Herodotus .

Another theory supported by the Greek historian Miltiades Hatzopoulos, following the opinion of the ancient author Appian , is that the Argead dynasty actually came from Argos Orestikon .

They also added Mygdonia in their territory through the expulsion of the Edoni , Eordians , and Almopians .

[ 20 ] History [ edit ] Succession disputes [ edit ] The death of the king almost invariably triggered dynastic disputes and often a war of succession between members of the Argead family, leading to political and economic instability.

[ 21 ] These included: Six-year Macedonian interregnum (399–393 BCE), after the death of king Archelaus , between Orestes , Aeropus II , Amyntas II and Pausanias [ 22 ] Macedonian war of succession (393–392 BCE), after the death of king Pausanias , between Amyntas III and Argaeus II [ 23 ] Macedonian war of succession (369–368 BCE), after the death of king Amyntas III , between Ptolemy of Aloros and Alexander II of Macedon [ citation needed ] Macedonian war of succession (360–359 BCE), after the death of king Perdiccas III , between Philip II (who deposed Amyntas IV ), Argeus (supported by Athens ), Pausanias (supported by Thrace ) and Archelaus (supported by the Chalcidian League ) [ 21 ] Wars of the Diadochi (323–277 BCE), after the death of king Alexander the Great , between his Diadochi ("Successors") Additionally, long-established monarchs could still face a rebellion by a relative when the former's kingship was perceived to be weak. An example was Philip's rebellion against his older brother, king Perdiccas II , in the prelude to the Peloponnesian War (433–431 BCE).

Family tree [ edit ] Modern historians disagree on a number of details concerning the genealogy of the Argead dynasty.

Robin Lane Fox , for example, refutes Nicholas Hammond's claim that Ptolemy of Aloros was Amyntas II's son, arguing that Ptolemy was neither his son nor an Argead.

[ 24 ] Consequently, the charts below do not account for every chronological, genealogical, and dynastic complexity. Instead, they represent one common reconstruction of the Argeads advanced by historians such as Hammond, Elizabeth Carney , and Joseph Roisman.

Thus the kings were of largely Dorian Greek stock (see PHILIP (1)); they presumably spoke a form of Dorian Greek and their cultural tradition had Greek features." ^ Cosmopoulos 1992 , p. 30.

^ According to Pausanias ( Description of Greece 9.40.8–9 ), Caranus set up a trophy after the Argive fashion for a victory against Cisseus: "The Macedonians say that Caranus, king of Macedonia, overcame in battle Cisseus, a chieftain in a bordering country. For his victory Caranus set up a trophy after the Argive fashion, but it is said to have been upset by a lion from Olympus, which then vanished. Caranus, they assert, realized that it was a mistaken policy to incur the undying hatred of the non-Greeks dwelling around, and so, they say, the rule was adopted that no king of Macedonia, neither Caranus himself nor any of his successors, should set up trophies, if they were ever to gain the good-will of their neighbors. This story is confirmed by the fact that Alexander set up no trophies, neither for his victory over Dareius nor for those he won in India." ^ Hoover 2011 , p. 161; Hoover 2016 , p. 295.
