Sellars received his B.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan , where he taught for over 40 years. He is the father of Wilfrid Sellars .

In his 1969 book Reflections on American Philosophy From Within he described his views on materialism as evolutionary materialism, an extension to his 1922 groundbreaking book Evolutionary Naturalism .

He helped draft the Humanist Manifesto in 1933 and also signed the Humanist Manifesto II in 1973.

[ 1 ] Sellars was a supporter of socialism , saying that socialism was a democratic conception of economic organisation which "will give the maximum possible at any one time of justice and liberty".
