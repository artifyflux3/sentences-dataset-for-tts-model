A closed geodesic is pictured in red.

In mathematics, particularly in differential geometry , a Zoll surface , named after Otto Zoll , is a surface homeomorphic to the 2-sphere , equipped with a Riemannian metric all of whose geodesics are closed and of equal length.  While the usual unit-sphere metric on S 2 obviously has this property, it also has an infinite-dimensional family of geometrically distinct deformations that are still Zoll surfaces.  In particular, most Zoll surfaces do not have constant curvature .

Zoll, a student of David Hilbert , discovered the first non-trivial examples.

See also [ edit ] Funk transform : The original motivation for studying the Funk transform was to describe Zoll metrics on the sphere.
