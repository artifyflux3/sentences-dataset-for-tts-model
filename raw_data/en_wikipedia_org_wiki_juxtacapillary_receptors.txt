[ 1 ] Although their functional role is unclear, J-receptors respond to events such as pulmonary edema , pulmonary emboli , pneumonia , congestive heart failure and barotrauma , which cause a decrease in oxygenation and thus lead to an increase in respiration.

[ 2 ] They may be also stimulated by hyperinflation of the lung as well as intravenous or intracardiac administration of chemicals such as capsaicin.

[ 3 ] The stimulation of the J-receptors causes a reflex increase in breathing rate , and is also thought to be involved in the  sensation of dyspnea , the subjective sensation of difficulty breathing.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The reflex response that is produced is apnea followed by rapid breathing, bradycardia , and hypotension (pulmonary chemoreflex). The physiologic role of this reflex is uncertain, but it probably occurs in pathologic states such as pulmonary congestion or embolization.

[ 3 ] These receptors were discovered by Autar Paintal .

[ 6 ] Because these receptors have been found in the walls of bronchi, the larynx, and the nose, they appear to be part of a widespread population of nociceptors found in most tissue. For this reason, they are now usually referred to as pulmonary C-fiber receptors .
