LIGO Scientific Collaboration Formation 1997 [ 2 ] Membership 1659 scientists [ 1 ] LSC Spokesperson Stephen Fairhurst Award(s) Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics (2016) Gruber Prize in Cosmology (2016) Bruno Rossi Prize (2017) Albert Einstein Medal (2017) Princess of Asturias Award (2017) Website www.ligo.org The LIGO Scientific Collaboration ( LSC ) is a scientific collaboration of international physics institutes and research groups dedicated to the search for gravitational waves . It complements the LIGO Laboratory , an organization based at the California Institute of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology which constructed and now operates the LIGO observatories. The LSC contributes to developing detector technologies, assists with collecting and validating data from the LIGO and GEO600 detectors, and is responsible for analyzing the data and publishing scientific results. The LSC is led by a Spokesperson, which as of 2025 [update] is Stephen Fairhurst of Cardiff University.

History [ edit ] The LSC was established in 1997 as part of a reorganization of the LIGO Project under the leadership of Barry Barish .

[ 3 ] Its mission is to ensure equal scientific opportunity for individual participants and institutions by organizing research, publications, and all other scientific activities, and it includes scientists from both LIGO Laboratory and collaborating institutions. Barish appointed Rainer Weiss as the first spokesperson. Subsequent spokespersons have been elected by members of the LSC.

LSC members have access to the US-based Advanced LIGO detectors in Hanford, Washington and in Livingston, Louisiana , as well as the GEO600 detector in Sarstedt , Germany. Under an agreement with the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO), LSC members also have access to data from the Virgo detector in Pisa , Italy. While the LSC and the Virgo Collaboration are separate organizations, they cooperate closely and are referred to collectively as "LVC".

[ 4 ] In 2019, the Japanese KAGRA collaboration signed an agreement to collaborate with the LSC and Virgo [ 5 ] and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collective is called "LVK".

On 11 February 2016, the LIGO and Virgo collaborations [ a ] announced that they succeeded in making the first direct gravitational wave observation on 14 September 2015.
