He invented the concept of stochastic integral and stochastic differential equation , and is known as the founder of so-called Itô calculus . He also pioneered the world connections between stochastic calculus and differential geometry, known as stochastic differential geometry . He was invited for the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm in 1962.

[ 1 ] So much were  Itô's results useful to financial mathematics that he was sometimes called "the most famous Japanese in Wall Street".

[ 2 ] Itô was a member of the faculty at University of Kyoto for most of his career and eventually became the director of their Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences .  But he also spent multi-year stints at several foreign institutions, the longest of which took place at Cornell University .

Overview [ edit ] Itô (right) with Issei Shiraishi in 1935. Shiraishi later became a mathematician.

Itô pioneered the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic differential equations , now known as Itô calculus . Its basic concept is the Itô integral , and among the most important results is a change of variable formula known as Itô's lemma (also known as the Itô formula). 
Itô also made contributions to the study of diffusion processes on manifolds , known as stochastic differential geometry .

Itô calculus is a method used in the mathematical study of random events and is applied in various fields, and is perhaps best known for its use in mathematical finance . In particular, the Itô's lemma's best known application is in the derivation of the Black–Scholes equation for option values.

[ 2 ] Itô's methods are also used in other fields, including biology and physics.

[ 2 ] His results have been applied to population models , white noise , chemical reactions , and quantum physics , in addition to uses in various mathematical subjects such as differential geometry , partial differential equations , complex analysis , and harmonic analysis and potential theory .

[ 3 ] Fellow mathematician Daniel W. Stroock noted that "People all over realized that what Ito had done explained things that were unexplainable before." [ 4 ] Economist Robert C. Merton stated that Itô's work had provided him "a very useful tool" in his own prize-winning work.

[ 4 ] Although the standard Hepburn romanization of his name is Kiyoshi Itō , he used the spelling Kiyosi Itô ( Kunrei-shiki romanization ). The alternative spellings Itoh and Ito are also sometimes seen in the Western world .

Itô was married with three daughters.

[ 4 ] Biography [ edit ] Kiyosi Itô (right) with Seizō Itō in 1937. Seizō is Kiyosi's brother. Seizō later became a mathematician.

Itô was born on 7 September 1915 in a farming area located west of Nagoya, Japan , [ 4 ] that being the town of Hokusei-cho in Mie Prefecture .

[ 5 ] He excelled in his studies as a youth.

[ 4 ] Admitted to the Imperial University of Tokyo , he studied mathematics and became interested in the underdeveloped field of probability theory , graduating from there in 1938, [ 5 ] with his degree in mathematics being granted by the university's Faculty of Science .

[ 6 ] Itô at the Cabinet Statistics Bureau in 1940 From 1939 to 1943 he worked as a Statistical Officer with the Statistics Bureau of the Cabinet Secretariat , [ 6 ] There he was given rein by management to continue his research.

[ 5 ] His breakthrough paper, "On Stochastic Processes", appeared in 1942.

[ 7 ] In 1943, he was appointed an assistant professor at Nagoya Imperial University , [ 5 ] where he benefited from discussions with the mathematicians Kōsaku Yosida and Shizuo Kakutani .

[ 8 ] From investigations done during this period he published a series of articles in which he defined the stochastic integral and laid the foundations of the Itō calculus . 
Meanwhile, he received his Doctor of Science degree from the Imperial University of Tokyo in 1945.

[ 6 ] These works were published despite the difficulties of life in Japan during World War II , including problems accessing libraries and especially the loss of contact with Western mathematicians and the lack of awareness of results from them.

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] For instance, the only other Japanese mathematician actively interested in  Itô's work during the war, Gisiro Maruyama , read a mimeographed copy of a paper while in a military camp.

[ 8 ] Scholarly activity during the Occupation of Japan had its difficulties; in one case, paper shortages were such that a lengthy Itô article could not be published in a Japanese journal and he had to arrange for an American journal to publish it instead.

[ 8 ] Ito later referred to his time at Nagoya as having been during "the dark age of World War II and its aftermath." [ 8 ] Itô, 1954 After this period he continued to develop his ideas on stochastic analysis with many important papers on the topic.
In 1952, he became a professor at the University of Kyoto .

[ 2 ] His most well-known text, Probability Theory , appeared in 1953.

[ 7 ] Itô  remained affiliated with Kyoto until his retirement in 1979.

[ 5 ] However, beginning in the 1950s, Itô spent long periods of time away from Japan.

[ 4 ] He was at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1954 to 1956 while on a Fulbright fellowship ; [ 6 ] while there he worked closely with William Feller and Henry McKean who were at nearby Princeton University .

[ 8 ] He was a professor at Stanford University from 1961 to 1964 and a professor at Aarhus University from 1966 to 1969.

[ 6 ] Then in 1969 Itô arrived at Cornell University , where he was a professor of mathematics for six years until 1975.

[ 7 ] This was his longest stint outside Japan.

[ 6 ] Among the courses he taught at Cornell was one in Higher Calculus.

[ 9 ] Itô wrote not only in Japanese but also in Chinese , German , French and English .

[ 4 ] However, his ability to converse in foreign languages was a different matter, and by his own admission his accent made him largely incomprehensible to Americans.

[ 4 ] When Itô left Cornell and returned to the University of Kyoto, he served as director of their Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences .

[ 2 ] After his retirement, he became professor emeritus at Kyoto University.

[ 2 ] He also had a post-retirement position as a professor at the private Gakushuin University for several years, [ 6 ] a common practice among higher-ranking Japanese academics.

[ 5 ] Itô c. 1991 Itô  was recipient of the Wolf Prize and the Kyoto Prize .

[ 4 ] He was a member of the Japan Academy , [ 6 ] and also a foreign member of the Académie des sciences in France and the National Academy of Sciences in the United States.

[ 4 ] In his later years, Itô struggled with poor health.

[ 5 ] Itô was awarded the inaugural Gauss Prize in 2006 by the International Mathematical Union for his lifetime achievements.

[ 2 ] As he due to his health was unable to travel to Madrid , his youngest daughter, Junko Ito , received the Gauss Prize from King Juan Carlos I on his behalf.

[ 10 ] Later, IMU President Sir John Macleod Ball personally presented the medal to Itô at a special ceremony held in Kyoto.

[ 11 ] In October 2008, Itô was honored with Japan's Order of Culture , and an awards ceremony for the Order of Culture was held at the Imperial Palace.

[ 12 ] Itô died on November 10, 2008, in Kyoto, Japan , at age 93, of respiratory failure .
