M.P., 1994, vol. 50, No. 415 [ 6 ] Gdańsk [ a ] ( Kashubian : Gduńsk [ b ] ; German : Danzig [ c ] ) is a city on the Baltic coast of northern Poland , and the capital of the Pomeranian Voivodeship .

[ 9 ] With a population of 486,492, [ 10 ] it is Poland's sixth-largest city and its major seaport .

[ 11 ] Gdańsk lies at the mouth of the Motława River and is situated at the southern edge of Gdańsk Bay , close to the city of Gdynia and the resort town of Sopot ; these form a metropolitan area called the Tricity ( Trójmiasto ), with a population of approximately 1.5 million.

[ 12 ] The city has a complex history, having had periods of Polish, German and self rule. An important shipbuilding and trade port since the Middle Ages , between 1361 and 1500 it was a member of the Hanseatic League , which influenced its economic, demographic and urban landscape . It served as Poland's principal seaport and was its largest city from the 15th to the early 18th century. With the Partitions of Poland , the city was annexed by Prussia in 1793, and became a part of the German Empire in 1871 . In 1807–1814 and 1920–1939 it was a free city. On 1 September 1939 it was the scene of a military clash at Westerplatte , one of the first which initiated World War II . The contemporary city was shaped by extensive border changes , expulsions and new settlement after 1945. In the 1980s, Gdańsk was the birthplace of the Polish Solidarity movement, which helped precipitate the collapse of the Eastern Bloc , the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact .

Gdańsk is home to the University of Gdańsk , Gdańsk University of Technology , the National Museum , the Gdańsk Shakespeare Theatre , the Museum of the Second World War , the Polish Baltic Philharmonic , the Polish Space Agency and the European Solidarity Centre . Among Gdańsk's most notable historical landmarks are the Town Hall , the Green Gate , Artus Court , Neptune's Fountain , and St. Mary's Church , one of the largest brick churches in the world. The city is served by Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport , the country's third busiest airport and the most important international airport in northern Poland.

Gdańsk is among the most visited cities in Poland, having received 3.4 million tourists according to data collected in 2019.

[ 13 ] The city also hosts St. Dominic's Fair , which dates back to 1260, [ 14 ] and is regarded as one of the biggest trade and cultural events in Europe.

[ 15 ] In a 2019 quality of life ranking, Gdańsk achieved the highest placement among all Polish cities.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Its historic city centre has been listed as one of Poland's national monuments .

[ 19 ] Names [ edit ] Origin [ edit ] The name of the city was most likely derived from Gdania , a river presently known as Motława on which the city is situated.

[ 20 ] Other linguists also argue that the name stems from the Proto-Slavic adjective / prefix gъd- , which meant ' wet ' or ' moist ' with the addition of the morpheme ń / ni and the suffix -sk .

[ 21 ] History [ edit ] A manuscript fragment featuring gydda n yzc The name of the settlement was recorded after St. Adalbert's death in 997 CE as urbs Gyddanyzc and it was later written as Kdanzk in 1148, Gdanzc in 1188, Danceke [ 22 ] in 1228, Gdańsk in 1236, [ d ] Danzc in 1263, Danczk in 1311, [ e ] Danczik in 1399, [ f ] Danczig in 1414, and Gdąnsk in 1656.

[ 23 ] In Polish documents, the form Gdańsk was always used. The Germanised form Danzig developed later, simplifying the consonant clusters to something easier for German speakers to pronounce.

[ 24 ] The cluster "gd" became "d" ( Danzc from 1263), [ 25 ] the combination "ns" became "nts" ( Danczk from 1311), [ 25 ] and finally an epenthetical "i" broke up the final cluster ( Danczik from 1399).

[ 25 ] In Polish, the modern name of the city is pronounced [ɡdaj̃sk] ⓘ . In English (where the diacritic over the "n" is frequently omitted) the usual pronunciation is / ɡ ə ˈ d æ n s k / or / ɡ ə ˈ d ɑː n s k / . The Germanised name, Danzig , is usually pronounced [ˈdantsɪç] ⓘ , or alternatively [ˈdantsɪk] ⓘ in more Southern German-speaking areas. The city's Latin name may be given as either Gedania , Gedanum , or Dantiscum .

[ 26 ] The variety of Latin and German names typically reflects the difficulty of pronunciation of the original Polish city's name, all German- and Latin/Romance-speaking populations always encounter in trying to pronounce the difficult and complex Polish/ Lechitic words.

Ceremonial names [ edit ] In the Kashubian language the city is called Gduńsk .

[ 8 ] On special occasions, the city is also referred to as "The Royal Polish City of Gdańsk" (Polish: Królewskie Polskie Miasto Gdańsk ; Latin: Regia Civitas Polonica Gedanensis ; Kashubian: Królewsczi Pòlsczi Gard Gduńsk ).

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Although some Kashubians may also use the name "Our Capital City Gduńsk" ( Nasz Stoleczny Gard Gduńsk ) or "Our [regional] Capital City Gduńsk" ( Stoleczny Kaszëbsczi Gard Gduńsk ), the cultural and historical connections between the city and the region of Kashubia are debatable and use of such names raises controversy among Kashubians.

[ 30 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Gdańsk For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Gdańsk .

Prehistory and early history [ edit ] The oldest evidence found for the existence of a settlement on the lands of what is now Gdańsk comes from the Bronze Age (which is estimated to be from 2500–1700 BC). The settlement that is now known as Gdańsk began in the 9th century, being mostly an agriculture and fishing -dependent village.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] In the beginning of the 10th century, it began becoming an important centre for trade (especially between the Pomeranians ) until its annexation in c.

975 by Mieszko I .

[ 33 ] Gdańsk Crane , the world's largest medieval port crane, situated over the river Motława [ 34 ] The first written record thought to refer to Gdańsk is the vita of Saint Adalbert . Written in 999, it describes how in 997 Saint Adalbert of Prague baptised the inhabitants of urbs Gyddannyzc , "which separated the great realm of the duke [i.e., Bolesław the Brave of Poland] from the sea." [ 35 ] No further written sources exist for the 10th and 11th centuries.

[ 35 ] Based on the date in Adalbert's vita , the city celebrated its millennial anniversary in 1997.

[ 36 ] Archaeological evidence for the origins of the town was retrieved mostly after World War II had laid 90 percent of the city centre in ruins, enabling excavations.

[ 37 ] The oldest seventeen settlement levels were dated to between 980 and 1308.

[ 36 ] Mieszko I of Poland erected a stronghold on the site in the 980s, thereby connecting the Polish state ruled by the Piast dynasty with the trade routes of the Baltic Sea .

[ 38 ] Traces of buildings and housing from the 10th century have been found in archaeological excavations of the city.

[ 39 ] Polish Pomerania [ edit ] Excavated remains of 12th-century buildings in Gdańsk The site was ruled as a duchy of Poland by the Samborides . It consisted of a settlement at the modern Long Market, settlements of craftsmen along the Old Ditch, German merchant settlements around St Nicholas' Church and the old Piast stronghold.

[ 40 ] In 1215, the ducal stronghold became the centre of a Pomerelian splinter duchy . At that time the area of the later city included various villages.

In 1224/25, merchants from Lübeck were invited as hospites (immigrants with specific privileges) but were soon (in 1238) forced to leave by Świętopełk II of the Samborides during a war between Świętopełk and the Teutonic Order , during which Lübeck supported the latter. Migration of merchants to the town resumed in 1257.

[ 41 ] Significant German influence did not reappear until the 14th century, after the takeover of the city by the Teutonic Order.

[ 42 ] At the latest in 1263, Pomerelian duke Świętopełk II granted city rights under Lübeck law to the emerging market settlement.

[ 43 ] It was an autonomy charter similar to that of Lübeck, which was also the primary origin of many settlers.

[ 40 ] In a document of 1271 the Pomerelian duke Mestwin II addressed the Lübeck merchants settled in the city as his loyal citizens from Germany.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] In 1300, the town had an estimated population of 2,000. While overall the town was far from an important trade centre at that time, it had some relevance in Eastern European trade. Low on funds, the Samborides lent the settlement to Brandenburg, although they planned to take the city back and give it to Poland. Poland threatened to intervene, and the Brandenburgians left the town. Subsequently, the city was taken by Danish princes in 1301.

[ 46 ] Teutonic Order [ edit ] Main article: Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gdańsk) Monument to defenders of Polish Gdańsk also commemorates the victims of the 1308 massacre carried out by the Teutonic Order.

In 1308, the town was taken by Brandenburg and the Teutonic Knights restored order. Subsequently, the Order took over control of the town. Primary sources record a massacre carried out by the Teutonic Order against the local population, [ 47 ] of 10,000 people, but the exact number killed is subject to dispute in modern scholarship.

[ 48 ] Multiple authors accept the number given in the original sources, [ 49 ] while others consider 10,000 to have been a medieval exaggeration, although scholarly consensus is that a massacre of some magnitude did take place.

[ 48 ] The events were used by the Polish crown to condemn the Teutonic Order in a subsequent papal lawsuit.

[ 48 ] [ 50 ] The knights colonized the area, replacing local Kashubians and Poles with German settlers.

[ 49 ] In 1308, they founded Osiek Hakelwerk near the town, initially as a Lechitic fishing settlement.

[ 47 ] In 1340, the Teutonic Order constructed a large fortress, which became the seat of the knights' Komtur .

[ 51 ] In 1346 they changed the Town Law of the city, which then consisted only of the Rechtstadt , to Kulm law .

[ 52 ] In 1358, Danzig joined the Hanseatic League , and became an active member in 1361.

[ 53 ] It maintained relations with the trade centres Bruges , Novgorod , Lisboa , and Sevilla .

[ 53 ] Around 1377, the Old Town was equipped with city rights as well.

[ 54 ] In 1380, the New Town was founded as the third, independent settlement.

[ 47 ] After a series of Polish-Teutonic Wars , in the Treaty of Kalisz (1343) the Order had to acknowledge that it would hold Pomerelia as a fief from the Polish Crown . Although it left the legal basis of the Order's possession of the province in some doubt, the city thrived as a result of increased exports of grain (especially wheat), timber, potash , tar, and other goods of forestry from Prussia and Poland via the Vistula River trading routes , although after its capture, the Teutonic Order tried to actively reduce the economic significance of the town. While under the control of the Teutonic Order German migration increased. The Order's religious networks helped to develop Danzig's literary culture.

[ 55 ] A new war broke out in 1409, culminating in the Battle of Grunwald (1410), and the city came under the control of the Kingdom of Poland . A year later, with the First Peace of Thorn , it returned to the Teutonic Order.

[ 56 ] In July 2025, Polish archaeology firm ArcheoScan reported finding the remains of a medieval knight, buried under a shuttered ice cream parlor in Gdańsk. The skeletal remains are believed to be those of an adult male who lived around the 13th or 14th century. The grave was part of a cemetery containing at least 300 burials and was attached to the oldest known church in the city [ 57 ] .

Kingdom of Poland [ edit ] Apotheosis of Gdańsk by Izaak van den Blocke. The Vistula -borne trade of goods in Poland was the main source of prosperity during the city's Golden Age.

In 1440, the city participated in the foundation of the Prussian Confederation , an organisation opposed to the rule of the Teutonic Order. The organisation in its complaint of 1453 mentioned repeated cases in which the Teutonic Order imprisoned or murdered local patricians and mayors without a court verdict.

[ 58 ] On the request of the organisation King Casimir IV of Poland reincorporated the territory to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454.

[ 59 ] This led to the Thirteen Years' War between Poland and the State of the Teutonic Order (1454–1466). Starting in 1454, the city was authorized by the King to mint Polish coins.

[ 60 ] The local mayor pledged allegiance to the King during the incorporation in March 1454 in Kraków , [ 61 ] and the city again solemnly pledged allegiance to the King in June 1454 in Elbląg , recognizing the prior Teutonic annexation and rule as unlawful.

[ 62 ] On 25 May 1457 the city gained its rights as an autonomous city.

[ 63 ] On 15 May 1457, Casimir IV of Poland granted the town the Great Privilege, after he had been invited by the town's council and had already stayed in town for five weeks.

[ 64 ] With the Great Privilege, the town was granted full autonomy and protection by the King of Poland.

[ 65 ] The privilege removed tariffs and taxes on trade within Poland, Lithuania, and Ruthenia (present day Belarus and Ukraine ), and conferred on the town independent jurisdiction, legislation and administration of her territory, as well as the right to mint her own coin.

[ 64 ] Furthermore, the privilege united Old Town, Osiek, and Main Town, and legalised the demolition of New Town, which had sided with the Teutonic Order.

[ 64 ] By 1457, New Town was demolished completely, no buildings remained.

[ 47 ] Gaining free and privileged access to Polish markets, the seaport prospered while simultaneously trading with the other Hanseatic cities. After the Second Peace of Thorn (1466) between Poland and the Teutonic Order the warfare ended permanently; Gdańsk became part of the Polish province of Royal Prussia , and later also of the Greater Poland Province . The city was visited by Nicolaus Copernicus in 1504 and 1526, and Narratio Prima , the first printed abstract of his heliocentric theory , was published there in 1540.

[ 66 ] After the Union of Lublin between Poland and Lithuania in 1569 the city continued to enjoy a large degree of internal autonomy (cf.

Danzig law ). Being the largest and one of the most influential cities of Poland, it enjoyed voting rights during the royal election period in Poland.

In the 1560s and 1570s, a large Mennonite community started growing in the city, gaining significant popularity.

[ 67 ] In the 1575 election to the Polish throne, Danzig supported Maximilian II in his struggle against Stephen Báthory . It was the latter who eventually became monarch but the city, encouraged by the secret support of Denmark and Emperor Maximilian , shut its gates against Stephen. After the Siege of Danzig , lasting six months, the city's army of 5,000 mercenaries was utterly defeated in a field battle on 16 December 1577. However, since Stephen's armies were unable to take the city by force, a compromise was reached: Stephen Báthory confirmed the city's special status and her Danzig law privileges granted by earlier Polish kings . The city recognised him as ruler of Poland and paid the enormous sum of 200,000 guldens in gold as payoff ("apology").

[ 68 ] During the Polish–Swedish War of 1626–1629 , in 1627, the naval Battle of Oliwa was fought near the city, and it is one of the greatest victories in the history of the Polish Navy . During the Swedish invasion of Poland of 1655–1660, commonly known as the Deluge , the city was unsuccessfully besieged by Sweden . In 1660, the war was ended with the Treaty of Oliwa , signed in the present-day district of Oliwa .

[ 69 ] In 1677, a Polish-Swedish alliance was signed in the city.

[ 70 ] Around 1640, Johannes Hevelius established his astronomical observatory in the Old Town . Polish King John III Sobieski regularly visited Hevelius numerous times.

[ 71 ] Beside a majority of German-speakers, [ 72 ] whose elites sometimes distinguished their German dialect as Pomerelian , [ 73 ] the city was home to a large number of Polish-speaking Poles, Jewish Poles, Latvian-speaking Kursenieki , Flemings , and Dutch . In addition, a number of Scots took refuge or migrated to and received citizenship in the city, with first Scots arriving in 1380, [ 74 ] and a French Huguenot commune was founded in 1686.

[ 75 ] During the Protestant Reformation , most German-speaking inhabitants adopted Lutheranism . Due to the special status of the city and significance within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth , the city inhabitants largely became bi-cultural sharing both Polish and German culture and were strongly attached to the traditions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

[ 76 ] Old Town in the 1770s with the Saint James church on the left and Saint Bartholomew church on the right The city suffered a last great plague and a slow economic decline due to the wars of the 18th century. After peace was restored in 1721, Danzig experienced steady economic recovery. As a stronghold of Stanisław Leszczyński 's supporters during the War of the Polish Succession , it was taken by the Russians after the Siege of Danzig in 1734.  In the 1740s and 1750s Danzig was restored and Danzig port was again the most significant grain exporting ports in the Baltic region .

[ 77 ] The Danzig Research Society , which became defunct in 1936, was founded in 1743.

[ 78 ] Map of Gdańsk (1792) In 1772, the First Partition of Poland took place and Prussia annexed almost all of the former Royal Prussia, which became the Province of West Prussia . However, Gdańsk remained a part of Poland as an exclave separated from the rest of the country. The Prussian king cut off Danzig with a military controlled barrier, also blocking shipping links to foreign ports, on the pretense that a cattle plague may otherwise break out.

[ 79 ] Danzig declined in its economic significance. However, by the end of the 18th century, Gdańsk was still one of the most economically integrated cities in Poland. It was well-connected and traded actively with German cities , while other Polish cities became less well-integrated towards the end of the century, mostly due to greater risks for long-distance trade , given the number of violent conflicts along the trade routes.

[ 80 ] Prussia and Germany [ edit ] Danzig was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1793, [ 81 ] in the Second Partition of Poland . Both the Polish and the German-speaking population largely opposed the Prussian annexation and wanted the city to remain part of Poland.

[ 82 ] The mayor of the city stepped down from his office due to the annexation.

[ 83 ] The notable city councilor Jan (Johann) Uphagen, historian and art collector, also resigned as a sign of protest against the annexation. His house exemplifies Baroque in Poland and is now a museum, known as Uphagen's House .

[ 84 ] An attempted student uprising against Prussia led by Gottfried Benjamin Bartholdi was crushed quickly by the authorities in 1797.

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] During the Napoleonic Wars , in 1807, the city was besieged and captured by a coalition of French , Polish , Italian , Saxon , and Baden forces. Afterwards, it was a free city from 1807 to 1814, when it was captured by combined Prussian-Russian forces.

1900, showing prewar roof of the Krantor crane (also known as Gdańsk Crane ) In 1815, after France's defeat in the Napoleonic Wars , it again became part of Prussia and became the capital of Regierungsbezirk Danzig within the province of West Prussia . Beginning in the 1820s, the Wisłoujście Fortress served as a prison, mainly for Polish political prisoners, including resistance members , protesters, insurgents of the November and January uprisings and refugees from the Russian Partition of Poland fleeing conscription into the Russian Army, [ 88 ] and insurgents of the November Uprising were also imprisoned in Biskupia Górka ( Bischofsberg ).

[ 89 ] In May–June 1832 and November 1833, more than 1,000 Polish insurgents departed partitioned Poland through the city's port, boarding ships bound for France , the United Kingdom and the United States (see Great Emigration ).

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] The population in 1843 was 62,000 inhabitants.

[ 92 ] The city's longest serving mayor was Robert von Blumenthal, who held office from 1841, through the revolutions of 1848 , until 1863. With the unification of Germany in 1871 under Prussian hegemony , the city became part of the German Empire and remained so until 1919, after Germany's defeat in World War I .

[ 81 ] Starting from the 1850s, long-established Danzig families often felt marginalized by the new town elite originating from mainland Germany. This situation caused the Polish to allege that the Danzig people were oppressed by German rule and for this reason allegedly failed to articulate their natural desire for strong ties with Poland.

[ 93 ] Free City of Danzig and World War II [ edit ] Main article: Free City of Danzig An aerial view of the historic city centre around 1920 When Poland regained its independence after World War I with access to the sea as promised by the Allies on the basis of Woodrow Wilson 's " Fourteen Points ", the Poles hoped the city's harbour would also become part of Poland.

[ 94 ] However, in the end – since Germans formed a majority in the city, with Poles being a minority [ 95 ] – the city was not placed under Polish sovereignty.

Instead, in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , it became the Free City of Danzig , an independent state under the auspices of the League of Nations with its external affairs largely under Polish control.

[ 96 ] Poland's rights also included free use of the harbour, a Polish post office, a Polish garrison in Westerplatte district, and a customs union with Poland.

[ 96 ] The Free City had its own constitution, national anthem , parliament , and government. It issued its own stamps and currency, the latter being called the Danzig gulden .

[ 94 ] With the growth of Nazism among Germans, anti-Polish sentiment became far more common among local Germans; public Polish-language schools were heavily restricted, [ 96 ] causing its Polish inhabitants to found their own private schools.

[ 97 ] In the 1930s, the local branch of the Nazi Party under Albert Forster , a Schutzstaffel member, capitalized on the sentiments of the city's German population to win the next elections to the city's legislature, triggering a wave of repression.

[ 97 ] The Danzig city government implemented various discriminatory policies against Poles, including expelling Polish students from the technical university, [ 98 ] forcibly Germanizing dozens of Polish surnames, [ 98 ] removing landmarks that reminded of Polish rule such as the Artus Court [ 99 ] and Neptune's Fountain from the heritage list, prohibiting employment of Poles by German companies, and banning the use of Polish in public places.

[ 100 ] Attacks and discrimination also came from the citizens of Danzig themselves, who often attacked Polish schools and the youth that attended them [ 97 ] and were disallowed from entering various businesses owned by Germans.

[ 100 ] Polish railwaymen were also subjects of beatings.

[ 101 ] Many ethnic Poles were tracked by the Gestapo and, in Operation Tannenberg , arrested and moved to camps such as Stutthof [ 102 ] or executed in the Piaśnica forest .

[ 103 ] Nazi Germany officially demanded the return of Danzig to Germany along with a German-controlled highway through the area of the Polish Corridor , pursuing a far more aggressive policy in this matter than it had regarding the Sudetenland with Czechoslovakia in 1938.

[ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ] With Poland's refusal, German–Polish relations deteriorated, ultimately concluding with the beginning of the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939.

[ 109 ] Some of the earliest combat of World War II occurred in Danzig. At 04:45 a.m. on 1 September, the Battle of Westerplatte began with the SMS Schleswig-Holstein firing the war's first shots on a Polish military depot there, whilst a small group of men defended the Polish post office in the city for several hours. The defenders were later executed.

[ 109 ] The German battleship SMS Schleswig-Holstein firing at the Polish Military Transit Depot in Westerplatte during the Battle of Westerplatte in September 1939 Within one year of a 1937 pogrom , more than half of the city's Jewish community had left, [ 110 ] and organized emigration of Jews away from Danzig began after the Kristallnacht riots in 1938.

[ 111 ] In 1939, regular transports to Mandatory Palestine began. The numbers of the local Jewish commnity quickly thinned, with only 600 Jews remaining in Danzig by 1941.

[ 110 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ] Many of the Jews who remained were transported to the small, single-building Danzig Ghetto .

[ 114 ] During the war, Germany operated a prison in the city, [ 115 ] an Einsatzgruppen -operated penal camp, [ 116 ] a camp for Romani people , [ 117 ] two subcamps of the Stalag XX-B prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs, [ 118 ] and several subcamps of the Stutthof concentration camp within the present-day city limits.

[ 119 ] In 1945, as the Red Army neared the area, thousands of civilians fled the city during Operation Hannibal aboard ships such as Wilhelm Gustloff .

[ 120 ] It endured heavy Allied and Soviet air raids during the war. Danzig was captured by Polish [ 121 ] and Soviet troops in March 1945. The city was heavily damaged as a result.

[ 122 ] Soviet soldiers committed large-scale rape and looting , especially of the industrial areas.

[ 122 ] [ 123 ] [ 124 ] In line with the decisions made by the Allies at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, the city became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the fall of communism in Poland in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The remaining German residents of the city who had survived the war fled or were expelled to postwar Germany. The city was repopulated by ethnic Poles ; up to 18% of them had been deported by the Soviets in two major waves from pre-war eastern Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union .

[ 125 ] Post-World War II (1945–1989) [ edit ] In 1946, the communists executed 17-year-old Danuta Siedzikówna and 42-year-old Feliks Selmanowicz , known Polish resistance members, in a local prison.

[ 126 ] [ 127 ] The port of Gdańsk was one of the three Polish ports through which Greeks and Macedonians , refugees of the Greek Civil War , reached Poland.

[ 128 ] In 1949, four transports of Greek and Macedonian refugees arrived at the port of Gdańsk, from where they were transported to new homes in Poland.

[ 128 ] The Gdańsk Shipyard strike in 1980 Parts of the historic old city of Gdańsk, which had suffered large-scale destruction during the war, were rebuilt during the 1950s and 1960s. The reconstruction sought to dilute the "German character" of the city, and set it back to how it supposedly looked like before the annexation to Prussia in 1793.

[ 129 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ] Nineteenth-century transformations were ignored as "ideologically malignant" by post-war administrations, or regarded as "Prussian barbarism" worthy of demolition, [ 132 ] [ 133 ] while Flemish/Dutch, Italian and French influences were emphasized in order to "neutralize" the German influx on the general outlook of the city.

[ 134 ] Boosted by heavy investment in the development of its port and shipyards fuelled by Soviet ambitions in the Baltic region , Gdańsk became the major shipping and industrial centre of the People's Republic of Poland . In December 1970, Gdańsk was the location of anti-regime demonstrations , which led to the downfall of Poland's communist leader Władysław Gomułka . During the demonstrations in Gdańsk and Gdynia, military and police forces opened fire on the demonstrators, causing several dozen deaths. Ten years later, in August 1980, Gdańsk Shipyard was the birthplace of the Solidarity trade union and political movement.

[ 135 ] In September 1981, to deter Solidarity, Soviet Union launched Exercise Zapad-81 , the largest military exercise in history, during which amphibious landings were conducted near Gdańsk. Around the same time, Solidarity's first national congress was hosted in the Hala Olivia , located in Gdańsk. Its opposition to the Communist regime led to the end of communist rule in 1989, and sparked a series of protests that overthrew the communist regimes of the former Eastern Bloc .

[ 136 ] Contemporary history (1990–present) [ edit ] Solidarity's leader, Lech Wałęsa , became President of Poland in 1990. In 2014 the European Solidarity Centre , a museum and library devoted to the history of the movement, opened in Gdańsk.

[ 136 ] On 9 July 2001, the city experienced a flood , with 200 million zł being estimated in damage, 4 people being killed, and 304 being evacuated. As a result, the city has since built more than fifty reservoirs, the number of which is rising.

[ 139 ] UEFA Euro 2012 in Gdańsk In January 2019, the Mayor of Gdańsk, Paweł Adamowicz , was assassinated by a man who had just been released from prison for violent crimes. After stabbing the mayor in the abdomen near the heart, the man claimed that the mayor's political party had been responsible for imprisoning him. Though Adamowicz underwent a multi-hour surgery, he died the next day.

[ 140 ] [ 141 ] In October 2019, the city of Gdańsk was awarded the Princess of Asturias Award in the Concord category as a recognition of the fact that "the past and present in Gdańsk are sensitive to solidarity, the defense of freedom and human rights, as well as to the preservation of peace".

[ 142 ] In a 2023 Report on the Quality of Life in European Cities compiled by the European Commission , Gdańsk was named as the fourth best city to live in Europe alongside Leipzig , Stockholm and Geneva .

[ 143 ] Geography [ edit ] Gdańsk is divided into two main parts, known as the Górny Taras and Dolny Taras in Polish; the low-lying Dolny Taras (Lower Terrace) is found on the Baltic coast, covering parts of the Vistula Fens , whereas the Górny Taras (Upper Terrace) is characterized by uneven highlands and is part of the Kashubian Lake District . The city is also found at the mouth of the Motława and Vistula rivers, which has significantly influenced its geography and shaped its economy.

Large numbers of Ukrainians were forced to move from south-eastern Poland under a 1947 Polish government operation aimed at dispersing, and therefore assimilating, those Ukrainians who had not been expelled eastward already, throughout the newly acquired territories. Belarusians living around the area around Białystok were also pressured into relocating to the formerly German areas for the same reasons. This scattering of members of non-Polish ethnic groups throughout the country was an attempt by the Polish authorities to dissolve the unique ethnic identity of groups like the Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Lemkos , and broke the proximity and communication necessary for strong communities to form.
