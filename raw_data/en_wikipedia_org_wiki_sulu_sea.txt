[ 2 ] Borneo is found to the southwest and Visayas to the northeast.

The Sulu Sea contains a number of islands. The Cuyo Islands [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and the Cagayan Islands are part of the province of Palawan whereas Mapun [ 5 ] and the Turtle Islands are part of the province of Tawi-Tawi .

[ 6 ] Sulu Sea is also where the Tubbataha Reef National Marine Park , one of the World Heritage Sites is located.

[ 7 ] Panay Gulf is an extension of the Sulu Sea.  Straits out of the Sulu Sea include the Iloilo Strait , the Guimaras Strait , and the Basilan Strait .

Geography [ edit ] The sea's surface area is 260,000 square kilometers (100,000 sq mi).

[ 8 ] The Pacific Ocean flows into Sulu Sea in northern Mindanao and between Sangihe talaud Archipelago, North Sulawesi.

[ 9 ] Extent [ edit ] The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the Sulu Sea as being one of the waters of the East Indian Archipelago . The IHO defines its limits as follows: [ 10 ] It extends about 490 miles (790 km) from north to south and 375 miles (604 km) from east to west. Waves can stretch across 25 kilometers (16 mi) to 35 kilometers (22 mi).

[ 11 ] The sea is 4,400 meters (14,400 ft) deep but on its southern end Sulu Archipelago raises the sea floor to 100 meters (330 ft).

[ 8 ] On the Northwest.

From Tanjong Sempang Mangayau , the North point of Borneo , along the Eastern limit of South China Sea to Cape Calavite, the Northwest point of Mindoro .
