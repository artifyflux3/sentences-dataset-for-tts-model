Stellar engulfment is the process in which a star at the end of its main sequence phase of its life expands into a red giant star and engulfs some or all of the planets or brown dwarfs orbiting around it. The majority of planetary systems (around 61%) including the Solar System will experience at least one stellar engulfment event on the onset of Helium fusion and near the first dredge-up .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] While engulfment of planets can leave behind traces, particularly with Lithium , it is quickly diluted. The same is the case for brown dwarfs.

[ 3 ] Red giant Sun and Earth.

On around five billion years from now, the Sun will evolve out of the main sequence branch and into red giant . Its expansion will cause it to  engulfed much of the inner planets of the Solar System including Mercury , Venus and possibly Earth .
