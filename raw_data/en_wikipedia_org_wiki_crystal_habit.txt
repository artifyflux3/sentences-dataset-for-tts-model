Smoky quartz with spessartine on top of feldspar matrix, featuring different crystal habits (shapes) In mineralogy , crystal habit is the characteristic external shape of an individual crystal or aggregate of crystals. The habit of a crystal is dependent on its crystallographic form and growth conditions, which generally creates irregularities due to limited space in the crystallizing medium (commonly in rocks ).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Crystal forms [ edit ] Recognizing the habit can aid in mineral identification and description, as the crystal habit is an external representation of the internal ordered atomic arrangement .

[ 1 ] Most natural crystals, however, do not display ideal habits and are commonly malformed. Hence, it is also important to describe the quality of the shape of a mineral specimen: Euhedral : a crystal that is completely bounded by its characteristic faces, well-formed. Synonymous terms: idiomorphic, automorphic; Subhedral : a crystal partially bounded by its characteristic faces and partially by irregular surfaces. Synonymous terms: hypidiomorphic, hypautomorphic; Anhedral : a crystal that lacks any of its characteristic faces, completely malformed. Synonymous terms: allotriomorphic, xenomorphic.

Altering factors [ edit ] Goethite replacing pyrite cubes Factors influencing habit include: a combination of two or more crystal forms; trace impurities present during growth; crystal twinning and growth conditions (i.e., heat, pressure, space); and specific growth tendencies such as growth striations . Minerals belonging to the same crystal system do not necessarily exhibit the same habit. Some habits of a mineral are unique to its variety and locality: For example, while most sapphires form elongate barrel-shaped crystals, those found in Montana form stout tabular crystals. Ordinarily, the latter habit is seen only in ruby . Sapphire and ruby are both varieties of the same mineral: corundum .

Some minerals may replace other existing minerals while preserving the original's habit, i.e.

pseudomorphous replacement . A classic example is tiger's eye quartz, crocidolite asbestos replaced by silica . While quartz typically forms prismatic (elongate, prism-like) crystals, in tiger's eye the original fibrous habit of crocidolite is preserved.
