Find sources: "Mittag-Leffler distribution" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( October 2013 ) The Mittag-Leffler distributions are two families of probability distributions on the half-line [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle [0,\infty )} . They are parametrized by a real α α ∈ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \alpha \in (0,1]} or α α ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \alpha \in [0,1]} . Both are defined with the Mittag-Leffler function , named after Gösta Mittag-Leffler .

[ 1 ] The Mittag-Leffler function [ edit ] For any complex α α {\displaystyle \alpha } whose real part is positive, the series E α α ( z ) := ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ z n Γ Γ ( 1 + α α n ) {\displaystyle E_{\alpha }(z):=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {z^{n}}{\Gamma (1+\alpha n)}}} defines an entire function. For α α = 0 {\displaystyle \alpha =0} , the series converges only on a disc of radius one, but it can be analytically extended to C ∖ ∖ { 1 } {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} \setminus \{1\}} .

First family of Mittag-Leffler distributions [ edit ] The first family of Mittag-Leffler distributions is defined by a relation between the Mittag-Leffler function and their cumulative distribution functions .

For all α α ∈ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \alpha \in (0,1]} , the function E α α {\displaystyle E_{\alpha }} is increasing on the real line, converges to 0 {\displaystyle 0} in − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } , and E α α ( 0 ) = 1 {\displaystyle E_{\alpha }(0)=1} . Hence, the function x ↦ ↦ 1 − − E α α ( − − x α α ) {\displaystyle x\mapsto 1-E_{\alpha }(-x^{\alpha })} is the cumulative distribution function of a probability measure on the non-negative real numbers. The distribution thus defined, and any of its multiples, is called a Mittag-Leffler distribution of order α α {\displaystyle \alpha } .

All these probability distributions are absolutely continuous . Since E 1 {\displaystyle E_{1}} is the exponential function, the Mittag-Leffler distribution of order 1 {\displaystyle 1} is an exponential distribution . However, for α α ∈ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle \alpha \in (0,1)} , the Mittag-Leffler distributions are heavy-tailed , with E α α ( − − x α α ) ∼ ∼ x − − α α Γ Γ ( 1 − − α α ) , x → → ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle E_{\alpha }(-x^{\alpha })\sim {\frac {x^{-\alpha }}{\Gamma (1-\alpha )}},\quad x\to \infty .} Their Laplace transform is given by: E ( e − − λ λ X α α ) = 1 1 + λ λ α α , {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} (e^{-\lambda X_{\alpha }})={\frac {1}{1+\lambda ^{\alpha }}},} which implies that, for α α ∈ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle \alpha \in (0,1)} , the expectation is infinite. In addition, these distributions are geometric stable distributions . Parameter estimation procedures  can be found here.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Second family of Mittag-Leffler distributions [ edit ] The second family of Mittag-Leffler distributions is defined by a relation between the Mittag-Leffler function and their moment-generating functions .

For all α α ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \alpha \in [0,1]} , a random variable X α α {\displaystyle X_{\alpha }} is said to follow a Mittag-Leffler distribution of order α α {\displaystyle \alpha } if, for some constant C > 0 {\displaystyle C>0} , E ( e z X α α ) = E α α ( C z ) , {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} (e^{zX_{\alpha }})=E_{\alpha }(Cz),} where the convergence stands for all z {\displaystyle z} in the complex plane if α α ∈ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \alpha \in (0,1]} , and all z {\displaystyle z} in a disc of radius 1 / C {\displaystyle 1/C} if α α = 0 {\displaystyle \alpha =0} .

A Mittag-Leffler distribution of order 0 {\displaystyle 0} is an exponential distribution. A Mittag-Leffler distribution of order 1 / 2 {\displaystyle 1/2} is the distribution of the absolute value of a normal distribution random variable. A Mittag-Leffler distribution of order 1 {\displaystyle 1} is a degenerate distribution . In opposition to the first family of Mittag-Leffler distribution, these distributions are not heavy-tailed.

These distributions are commonly found in relation with the local time of Markov processes.
