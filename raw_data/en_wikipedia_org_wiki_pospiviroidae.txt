[ 2 ] Their secondary structure is key to their biological activity . The classification of this family is based on differences in the conserved central region sequence.

[ 3 ] Pospiviroidae replication occurs in an asymmetric fashion via host cell RNA polymerase , RNase , and RNA ligase . Its hosts are plants , specifically dicotyledons and some monocotyledons . The severity of the infection can vary from no effect to devastating and widespread damage to a population. This can also depend on the virus-host combination.

[ 4 ] Genome [ edit ] Members of the family Pospiviroidae have circular ssRNA of 246–375 nt. They assume rod-like or quasi-rod-like conformations containing a central conserved region (CCR) and a terminal conserved hairpin (TCH) or a terminal conserved region (TCR). The genome of viroids does not encode any proteins.

[ 5 ] Replication [ edit ] This section may be too technical for most readers to understand .

Please help improve it to make it understandable to non-experts , without removing the technical details.

( August 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Its replication is nuclear and mediated by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II, which is redirected to use RNA templates through an asymmetric RNA–RNA rolling-circle mechanism. (+) polarity circRNA molecules (by convention the most abundant strand in vivo ) are repeatedly transcribed into oligomeric complementary (−) RNAs. Such intermediates serve as templates for generating oligomeric (+) RNAs that are cleaved by a host enzyme of the RNase III class. The termini of the resulting linear monomers are ligated by the host DNA ligase 1 to generate the mature circular viroid RNA.
