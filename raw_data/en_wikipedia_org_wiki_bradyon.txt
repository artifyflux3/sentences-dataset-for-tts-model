According to special relativity , the velocity of a massive particle is always less than the speed of light .

[ 1 ] When highlighting relativistic speeds, the synonyms bradyon (from Greek : βραδύς , bradys , "slow"), tardyon [ 2 ] or ittyon [ 3 ] are sometimes used to contrast with luxon (which moves at light speed) and hypothetical tachyon (which moves faster than light ).

See also [ edit ] Look up bradyon , tardyon , or ittyon in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

Just as ordinary particles ('tardyons') can never be accelerated to the speed of light, so tachyons can never be slowed down to the speed of light.
