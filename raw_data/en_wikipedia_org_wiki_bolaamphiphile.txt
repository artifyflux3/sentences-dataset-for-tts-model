Compared to single-headed amphiphiles , the introduction of a second head-group generally induces a higher solubility in water, an increase in the critical micelle concentration (CMC), and a decrease in aggregation number . The aggregate morphologies of bolaamphiphiles include spheres, cylinders, disks, and vesicles. Bolaamphiphiles are also known to form helical structures that can form monolayer microtubular self-assemblies.
