He was an astrologer , a reviver of Neoplatonism in touch with the major academics of his day, and the first translator of Plato 's complete extant works into Latin .

[ 2 ] His Florentine Academy , an attempt to revive Plato's Academy , influenced the direction and tenor of the Italian Renaissance and the development of European philosophy .

Early life [ edit ] Ficino was born at Figline Valdarno . His father, Diotifeci d'Agnolo, was a physician under the patronage of Cosimo de' Medici , who took the young man into his household and became the lifelong patron of Marsilio, who was made tutor to his grandson, Lorenzo de' Medici .

Giovanni Pico della Mirandola , the Italian humanist philosopher and scholar, was another of his students.

[ 3 ] Career and thought [ edit ] Platonic Academy [ edit ] During the sessions at Florence of the Council of Ferrara-Florence in 1438–1445, during the failed attempts to heal the schism of the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Catholic) churches , Cosimo de' Medici and his intellectual circle had made acquaintance with the Neoplatonic philosopher George Gemistos Plethon , whose discourses upon Plato and the Alexandrian mystics so fascinated the humanists of Florence that they named him the second Plato. In 1459 John Argyropoulos was lecturing on Greek language and literature at Florence, and Ficino became his pupil.

When Cosimo decided to refound Plato's Academy at Florence, he chose Ficino as its head. In 1462, Cosimo supplied Ficino with Greek manuscripts of Plato's work, whereupon Ficino started translating the entire corpus into Latin [ 5 ] (draft translation of the dialogues finished 1468–69; [ 6 ] published 1484). Ficino also produced a translation of a collection of Hellenistic Greek documents found by Leonardo da Pistoia later called Hermetica , [ 7 ] and the writings of many of the Neoplatonists, including Porphyry , Iamblichus , and Plotinus .

Among his many students were Niccolo Valori [ 8 ] [ 9 ] and Francesco Cattani da Diacceto . The latter was considered by Ficino to be his successor as the head of the Florentine Platonic Academy.

[ 10 ] Diacceto's student, Giovanni di Bardo Corsi , produced a short biography of Ficino in 1506.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In 1474 Ficino completed his treatise on the immortality of the soul, Theologia Platonica de immortalitate animae [ 4 ] (Platonic Theology) and De Christiana Religione (On the Christian Religion), a history of religions and defense of Christianity.

[ 15 ] In the rush of enthusiasm for every rediscovery from Antiquity, he exhibited some interest in the arts of astrology (despite denigrating it in relation to divine revelation), which landed him in trouble with the Catholic Church . In 1489 he was accused of heresy before Pope Innocent VIII [ 4 ] and was acquitted.

Writing in 1492 Ficino proclaimed: "This century, like a golden age , has restored to light the liberal arts , which were almost extinct: grammar , poetry, rhetoric , painting, sculpture, architecture, music ... this century appears to have perfected astrology ." — Marcilio Ficino, A letter to a friend (1492) Ficino's letters, extending over the years 1474–1494, survive and have been published.

[ 4 ] He wrote De amore (Of Love) in 1484.

De vita libri tres (Three books on life), or De triplici vita [ 16 ] (The Book of Life), published in 1489, provides a great deal of medical and astrological advice for maintaining health and vigor, as well as espousing the Neoplatonist view of the world's ensoulment and its integration with the human soul: There will be some men or other, superstitious and blind, who see life plain in even the lowest animals and the meanest plants, but do not see life in the heavens or the world ... Now if those little men grant life to the smallest particles of the world, what folly! what envy! neither to know that the Whole, in which 'we live and move and have our being,' is itself alive, nor to wish this to be so.

[ 17 ] One metaphor for this integrated "aliveness" is Ficino's astrology. In the Book of Life , he details the interlinks between behavior and consequence. It talks about a list of things that hold sway over a man's destiny. Regardless, in his later extensive commentary on Plotinus's Ennead III, he actively and systematically repudiated the Neoplatonic account of the soul, the hypostasis Soul's unity, as well as the transmigration of the soul, the soul's eternity as opposed to mere imperishability, and the notion that the soul was created by intermediaries and not by God directly. Instead he preferred to interpret all of these more pagan Neoplatonic points, as Stephen Gersh comments in his Analytic Study of the same work, as moral allegories―in keeping with his general tendency towards concordance between Platonism and Christianity.

[ 18 ] Medical works [ edit ] Probably due to early influences from his father, Diotifeci, who was a doctor to Cosimo de' Medici, Ficino published Latin and Italian treatises on medical subjects such as Consiglio contro la pestilenza (Recommendations for the treatment of the plague) and De vita libri tres (Three books on life). His medical works exerted considerable influence on Renaissance physicians such as Paracelsus , with whom he shared the perception on the unity of the microcosmos and macrocosmos , and their interactions, through somatic and psychological manifestations, with the aim to investigate their signatures to cure diseases. Those works, which were very popular at the time, dealt with astrological and alchemical concepts. Thus Ficino came under the suspicion of heresy; especially after the publication of the third book in 1489, which contained specific instructions on healthful living in a world of demons and other spirits.

[ 19 ] Platonic love [ edit ] Notably, Ficino coined the term Platonic love , which first appeared in his letter to Alamanno Donati in 1476. In 1492, Ficino published Epistulae (Epistles), which contained Platonic love letters, written in Latin, to his academic colleague and life-long friend, Giovanni Cavalcanti , concerning the nature of Platonic love. Because of this, some have alleged Ficino was a homosexual, but this finds little basis in his letters or his general works and philosophy.

[ 20 ] In his commentary on the Republic , too, he specifically denies to his readers that the homosexual references made in Plato's dialogue were anything more than to bemuse the audience, "spoken merely to relieve the feeling of heaviness".

[ 21 ] Regardless, Ficino's letters to Cavalcanti resulted in the popularization of the term Platonic love in Western Europe.

Ficino died on 1 October 1499 at Careggi . In 1521 his memory was honored with a bust sculpted by Andrea Ferrucci , which is located in the south side of the nave in the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore .
