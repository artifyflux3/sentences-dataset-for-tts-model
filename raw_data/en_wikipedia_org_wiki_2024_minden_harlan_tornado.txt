The tornado resulted in one fatality and three injuries and tracked 40.91 miles (65.84 km), reaching a peak width of 1,900 yd (1,700 m). The tornado was the longest tracked tornado of a larger outbreak that occurred in late April and tied for the largest tornado of the outbreak, tying with the Elkhorn–Blair tornado . The tornado was the second costliest of the outbreak, inflicting $112 million in damage.

The tornado touched down east of McClelland , staying at EF0 strength for the first few miles before abruptly intensifying to mid-range EF2 intensity south of Minden, while a tornado emergency for the community and surrounding area before the tornado struck the town at high-end EF3 strength. Several residential homes received major to complete destruction from the tornado. Many businesses in town were severely damaged or flattened with estimated wind speeds of 160 mph (260 km/h). Northeast of town, the tornado inflicted more severe damage to farmsteads and a church was destroyed.

The tornado became then rain-wrapped as it missed Defiance before dissipating north of the town after being on the ground for 1 hour and 4 minutes.

Meteorological synopsis [ edit ] A cluster of thunderstorms developed in the Permian Basin of Texas in the early overnight hours into April 26, [ 2 ] becoming and maintaining severe characteristics as they tracked northeast into the Red River Valley.

[ 3 ] This cluster eventually organized into a quasi-linear convective system over southern Oklahoma, potentially producing at least one tornado.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) received three reports of tornadoes from Oklahoma during the early morning hours of April 26; seven weak tornadoes were later confirmed in the state.

[ 6 ] More significant severe weather was expected to occur later on in the day. The event was first forecasted to occur on April 20, when a 15% risk area was issued across much of the south-central United States by the Storm Prediction Center for April 26.

[ 7 ] By April 23, the 15% area had been expanded tremendously, covering areas from the eastern Great Plains into the mid-Mississippi Valley.

[ 8 ] On April 24, the 15% risk area transitioned into slight risk area that covered the same area with all severe weather hazards expected.

[ 9 ] With an enhanced risk of severe weather in place, the Storm Prediction issued a tornado watch for eastern Oklahoma on the morning of April 26.

[ 10 ] Several hours later, on the afternoon of April 26, another tornado watch was implemented for northeastern Nebraska, which included the possibility for "a couple of intense tornadoes." [ 11 ] At 3:41 p.m.

CDT , a tornado emergency was issued for West Elkhorn as a large and destructive tornado moved through the area. Some homes were completely leveled and many more structures suffered significant damage.

[ 12 ] Minden Supercell [ edit ] Supercells moving through eastern Nebraska and western Iowa on April 26, with the supercell north of Nebraska City being the Minden supercell.

[ 6 ] The tornado crossed the interstate before striking the community of Pacific City at high-end EF0 intensity. Trees along I-35 were snapped and a home northwest of Pacific City lost large portions of its roof at mid-range EF1 strength.

[ 13 ] The tornado then trek through forested areas, snapping several hardwood trees with wind speeds up to 100 mph (160 km/h). Eventually the tornado dissipated over the Pony Creek Park, the tornado was on the ground for five minutes and traveled 2.7 mi (4.3 km), with a peak width of 80 yd (73 m).
