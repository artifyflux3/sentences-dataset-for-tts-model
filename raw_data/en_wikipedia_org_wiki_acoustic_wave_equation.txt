Find sources: "Acoustic wave equation" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( February 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In physics , the acoustic wave equation is a second-order partial differential equation that governs the propagation of acoustic waves through a material medium resp. a standing wavefield .  The equation describes the evolution of acoustic pressure p or particle velocity u as a function of position x and time t . A simplified (scalar) form of the equation describes acoustic waves in only one spatial dimension, while a more general form describes waves in three dimensions.

For lossy media, more intricate models need to be applied in order to take into account frequency-dependent attenuation and phase speed. Such models include acoustic wave equations that incorporate fractional derivative terms, see also the acoustic attenuation article or the survey paper.

[ 1 ] Definition in one dimension [ edit ] The wave equation describing a standing wave field in one dimension (position x {\displaystyle x} ) is p x x − − 1 c 2 p t t = 0 , {\displaystyle p_{xx}-{\frac {1}{c^{2}}}p_{tt}=0,} where p {\displaystyle p} is the acoustic pressure (the local deviation from the ambient pressure) and c {\displaystyle c} the speed of sound , using subscript notation for the partial derivatives.

[ 2 ] Derivation [ edit ] See also: Euler equations (fluid dynamics) § Euler equations Start with the ideal gas law P = ρ ρ R specific T , {\displaystyle P=\rho R_{\text{specific}}T,} where T {\displaystyle T} the absolute temperature of the gas and specific gas constant R specific {\displaystyle R_{\text{specific}}} .
Then, assuming the process is adiabatic , pressure P ( ρ ρ ) {\displaystyle P(\rho )} can be considered a function of density ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } .

Derivation of the acoustic wave equation The conservation of mass and conservation of momentum can be written as a closed system of two equations [ 3 ] ρ ρ t + ( ρ ρ u ) x = 0 , ( ρ ρ u ) t + ( ρ ρ u 2 + P ( ρ ρ ) ) x = 0.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\rho _{t}+(\rho u)_{x}&=0,\\(\rho u)_{t}+(\rho u^{2}+P(\rho ))_{x}&=0.\end{aligned}}} This coupled system of two nonlinear conservation laws can be written in vector form as: q t + f ( q ) x = 0 , {\displaystyle q_{t}+f(q)_{x}=0,} with q = [ ρ ρ ρ ρ u ] = [ q ( 1 ) q ( 2 ) ] , f ( q ) = [ ρ ρ u ρ ρ u 2 + P ( ρ ρ ) ] = [ q ( 2 ) q ( 2 ) 2 / q ( 1 ) + P ( q ( 1 ) ) ] .

{\displaystyle q={\begin{bmatrix}\rho \\\rho u\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}q_{(1)}\\q_{(2)}\end{bmatrix}},\quad f(q)={\begin{bmatrix}\rho u\\\rho u^{2}+P(\rho )\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}q_{(2)}\\q_{(2)}^{2}/q_{(1)}+P(q_{(1)})\end{bmatrix}}.} To linearize this equation, let [ 4 ] q ( x , t ) = q 0 + q ~ ~ ( x , t ) , {\displaystyle q(x,t)=q_{0}+{\tilde {q}}(x,t),} where q 0 = ( ρ ρ 0 , ρ ρ 0 u 0 ) {\displaystyle q_{0}=(\rho _{0},\rho _{0}u_{0})} is the (constant) background state and q ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {q}}} is a sufficiently small perturbation, i.e., any powers or products of q ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {q}}} can be discarded. Hence, the taylor expansion of f ( q ) {\displaystyle f(q)} gives: f ( q 0 + q ~ ~ ) ≈ ≈ f ( q 0 ) + f ′ ( q 0 ) q ~ ~ {\displaystyle f(q_{0}+{\tilde {q}})\approx f(q_{0})+f'(q_{0}){\tilde {q}}} where f ′ ( q ) = [ ∂ ∂ f ( 1 ) / ∂ ∂ q ( 1 ) ∂ ∂ f ( 1 ) / ∂ ∂ q ( 2 ) ∂ ∂ f ( 2 ) / ∂ ∂ q ( 1 ) ∂ ∂ f ( 2 ) / ∂ ∂ q ( 2 ) ] = [ 0 1 − − u 2 + P ′ ( ρ ρ ) 2 u ] .

{\displaystyle f'(q)={\begin{bmatrix}\partial f_{(1)}/\partial q_{(1)}&\partial f_{(1)}/\partial q_{(2)}\\\partial f_{(2)}/\partial q_{(1)}&\partial f_{(2)}/\partial q_{(2)}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\-u^{2}+P'(\rho )&2u\end{bmatrix}}.} This results in the linearized equation q ~ ~ t + f ′ ( q 0 ) q ~ ~ x = 0 ⇔ ⇔ ρ ρ ~ ~ t + ( ρ ρ u ~ ~ ) x = 0 ( ρ ρ u ~ ~ ) t + ( − − u 0 2 + P ′ ( ρ ρ 0 ) ) ρ ρ ~ ~ x + 2 u 0 ( ρ ρ u ~ ~ ) x = 0 {\displaystyle {\tilde {q}}_{t}+f'(q_{0}){\tilde {q}}_{x}=0\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad {\begin{aligned}{\tilde {\rho }}_{t}+({\widetilde {\rho u}})_{x}&=0\\({\widetilde {\rho u}})_{t}+(-u_{0}^{2}+P'(\rho _{0})){\tilde {\rho }}_{x}+2u_{0}({\widetilde {\rho u}})_{x}&=0\end{aligned}}} Likewise, small perturbations of the components of q {\displaystyle q} can be rewritten as: ρ ρ u = ( ρ ρ 0 + ρ ρ ~ ~ ) ( u 0 + u ~ ~ ) = ρ ρ 0 u 0 + ρ ρ ~ ~ u 0 + ρ ρ 0 u ~ ~ + ρ ρ ~ ~ u ~ ~ {\displaystyle \rho u=(\rho _{0}+{\tilde {\rho }})(u_{0}+{\tilde {u}})=\rho _{0}u_{0}+{\tilde {\rho }}u_{0}+\rho _{0}{\tilde {u}}+{\tilde {\rho }}{\tilde {u}}} such that ρ ρ u ~ ~ ≈ ≈ ρ ρ ~ ~ u 0 + ρ ρ 0 u ~ ~ , {\displaystyle {\widetilde {\rho u}}\approx {\tilde {\rho }}u_{0}+\rho _{0}{\tilde {u}},} and pressure perturbations relate to density perturbations as: p = p 0 + p ~ ~ = P ( ρ ρ 0 + ρ ρ ~ ~ ) = P ( ρ ρ 0 ) + P ′ ( ρ ρ 0 ) ρ ρ ~ ~ + … … {\displaystyle p=p_{0}+{\tilde {p}}=P(\rho _{0}+{\tilde {\rho }})=P(\rho _{0})+P'(\rho _{0}){\tilde {\rho }}+\dots } such that: p 0 = P ( ρ ρ 0 ) , p ~ ~ ≈ ≈ P ′ ( ρ ρ 0 ) ρ ρ ~ ~ , {\displaystyle p_{0}=P(\rho _{0}),\quad {\tilde {p}}\approx P'(\rho _{0}){\tilde {\rho }},} where P ′ ( ρ ρ 0 ) {\displaystyle P'(\rho _{0})} is a constant, resulting in the alternative form of the linear acoustics equations: p ~ ~ t + u 0 p ~ ~ x + K 0 u ~ ~ x = 0 , ρ ρ 0 u ~ ~ t + p ~ ~ x + ρ ρ 0 u 0 u ~ ~ x = 0.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\tilde {p}}_{t}+u_{0}{\tilde {p}}_{x}+K_{0}{\tilde {u}}_{x}&=0,\\\rho _{0}{\tilde {u}}_{t}+{\tilde {p}}_{x}+\rho _{0}u_{0}{\tilde {u}}_{x}&=0.\end{aligned}}} where K 0 = ρ ρ 0 P ′ ( ρ ρ 0 ) {\displaystyle K_{0}=\rho _{0}P'(\rho _{0})} is the bulk modulus of compressibility. After dropping the tilde for convenience, the linear first order system can be written as: [ p u ] t + [ u 0 K 0 1 / ρ ρ 0 u 0 ] [ p u ] x = 0.

{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}p\\u\end{bmatrix}}_{t}+{\begin{bmatrix}u_{0}&K_{0}\\1/\rho _{0}&u_{0}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}p\\u\end{bmatrix}}_{x}=0.} While, in general, a non-zero background velocity is possible (e.g. when studying the sound propagation in a constant-strength wind), it will be assumed that u 0 = 0 {\displaystyle u_{0}=0} . Then the linear system reduces to the second-order wave equation: p t t = − − K 0 u x t = − − K 0 u t x = K 0 ( 1 ρ ρ 0 p x ) x = c 0 2 p x x , {\displaystyle p_{tt}=-K_{0}u_{xt}=-K_{0}u_{tx}=K_{0}\left({\frac {1}{\rho _{0}}}p_{x}\right)_{x}=c_{0}^{2}p_{xx},} with c 0 = K 0 / ρ ρ 0 {\displaystyle c_{0}={\sqrt {K_{0}/\rho _{0}}}} the speed of sound .

Hence, the acoustic equation can be derived from a system of first-order advection equations that follow directly from physics, i.e., the first integrals : q t + A q x = 0 , {\displaystyle q_{t}+Aq_{x}=0,} with q = [ p u ] , A = [ 0 K 0 1 / ρ ρ 0 0 ] .

{\displaystyle q={\begin{bmatrix}p\\u\end{bmatrix}},\quad A={\begin{bmatrix}0&K_{0}\\1/\rho _{0}&0\end{bmatrix}}.} Conversely, given the second-order equation p t t = c 0 2 p x x {\displaystyle p_{tt}=c_{0}^{2}p_{xx}} a first-order system can be derived: q t + A ^ ^ q x = 0 , {\displaystyle q_{t}+{\hat {A}}q_{x}=0,} with q = [ p t − − p x ] , A ^ ^ = [ 0 c 0 2 1 0 ] , {\displaystyle q={\begin{bmatrix}p_{t}\\-p_{x}\end{bmatrix}},\quad {\hat {A}}={\begin{bmatrix}0&c_{0}^{2}\\1&0\end{bmatrix}},} where matrix A {\displaystyle A} and A ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}} are similar .

[ 5 ] Solution [ edit ] Provided that the speed c {\displaystyle c} is a constant, not dependent on frequency (the dispersionless case), then the most general solution is p = f ( c t − − x ) + g ( c t + x ) {\displaystyle p=f(ct-x)+g(ct+x)} where f {\displaystyle f} and g {\displaystyle g} are any two twice-differentiable functions. This may be pictured as the superposition of two waveforms of arbitrary profile, one ( f {\displaystyle f} ) traveling up the x-axis and the other ( g {\displaystyle g} ) down the x-axis at the speed c {\displaystyle c} . The particular case of a sinusoidal wave traveling in one direction is obtained by choosing either f {\displaystyle f} or g {\displaystyle g} to be a sinusoid, and the other to be zero, giving p = p 0 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( ω ω t ∓ ∓ k x ) {\displaystyle p=p_{0}\sin(\omega t\mp kx)} .

where ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is the angular frequency of the wave and k {\displaystyle k} is its wave number .

In three dimensions [ edit ] Equation [ edit ] Feynman [ 6 ] provides a derivation of the wave equation for sound in three dimensions as ∇ ∇ 2 p − − 1 c 2 ∂ ∂ 2 p ∂ ∂ t 2 = 0 , {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}p-{1 \over c^{2}}{\partial ^{2}p \over \partial t^{2}}=0,} where ∇ ∇ 2 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}} is the Laplace operator , p {\displaystyle p} is the acoustic pressure (the local deviation from the ambient pressure), and c {\displaystyle c} is the speed of sound .

A similar looking wave equation but for the vector field particle velocity is given by ∇ ∇ 2 u − − 1 c 2 ∂ ∂ 2 u ∂ ∂ t 2 = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} \;-{1 \over c^{2}}{\partial ^{2}\mathbf {u} \; \over \partial t^{2}}=0} .

In some situations, it is more convenient to solve the wave equation for an abstract scalar field velocity potential which has the form ∇ ∇ 2 Φ Φ − − 1 c 2 ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ t 2 = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\Phi -{1 \over c^{2}}{\partial ^{2}\Phi  \over \partial t^{2}}=0} and then derive the physical quantities particle velocity and acoustic pressure by the equations (or definition, in the case of particle velocity): u = ∇ ∇ Φ Φ {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\nabla \Phi \;} , p = − − ρ ρ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ t Φ Φ {\displaystyle p=-\rho {\partial  \over \partial t}\Phi } .

Solution [ edit ] The following solutions are obtained by separation of variables in different coordinate systems. They are phasor solutions, that is they have an implicit time-dependence factor of e i ω ω t {\displaystyle e^{i\omega t}} where ω ω = 2 π π f {\displaystyle \omega =2\pi f} is the angular frequency . The explicit time dependence is given by p ( r , t , k ) = Real ⁡ ⁡ [ p ( r , k ) e i ω ω t ] {\displaystyle p(r,t,k)=\operatorname {Real} \left[p(r,k)e^{i\omega t}\right]} Here k = ω ω / c {\displaystyle k=\omega /c\ } is the wave number .

Cartesian coordinates [ edit ] p ( r , k ) = A e ± ± i k r {\displaystyle p(r,k)=Ae^{\pm ikr}} .

Cylindrical coordinates [ edit ] p ( r , k ) = A H 0 ( 1 ) ( k r ) + B H 0 ( 2 ) ( k r ) {\displaystyle p(r,k)=AH_{0}^{(1)}(kr)+\ BH_{0}^{(2)}(kr)} .

where the asymptotic approximations to the Hankel functions , when k r → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle kr\rightarrow \infty } , are H 0 ( 1 ) ( k r ) ≃ ≃ 2 π π k r e i ( k r − − π π / 4 ) {\displaystyle H_{0}^{(1)}(kr)\simeq {\sqrt {\frac {2}{\pi kr}}}e^{i(kr-\pi /4)}} H 0 ( 2 ) ( k r ) ≃ ≃ 2 π π k r e − − i ( k r − − π π / 4 ) {\displaystyle H_{0}^{(2)}(kr)\simeq {\sqrt {\frac {2}{\pi kr}}}e^{-i(kr-\pi /4)}} .

Spherical coordinates [ edit ] p ( r , k ) = A r e ± ± i k r {\displaystyle p(r,k)={\frac {A}{r}}e^{\pm ikr}} .

Depending on the chosen Fourier convention, one of these represents an outward travelling wave and the other a nonphysical inward travelling wave.  The inward travelling solution wave is only nonphysical because of the singularity that occurs at r=0; inward travelling waves do exist.
