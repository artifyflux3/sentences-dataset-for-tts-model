The **asterisk** ( *****), from [Late Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Latin "Late Latin")_asteriscus_, from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek")·ºÄœÉœÑŒµœÅŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøœÇ, _asteriskos_, "little star",[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-2) is a [typographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography") symbol. It is so called because it resembles a conventional image of a [heraldic star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(heraldry) "Star (heraldry)").

[Computer scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientists "Computer scientists") and [mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") often vocalize it as **star** (as, for example, in _the [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*\_search\_algorithm "A* search algorithm")_ or _[C*-algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C*-algebra "C*-algebra")_). An asterisk is usually five- or six-pointed in [print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing "Printing") and six- or eight-pointed when handwritten, though more complex forms exist. Its most common use is to call out a [footnote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footnote "Footnote"). It is also often used to censor offensive words.

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), the asterisk is commonly used as a [wildcard character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character "Wildcard character"), or to denote [pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming) "Pointer (computer programming)"), repetition, or [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication").

[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-r151-3)

The asterisk was already in use as a symbol in [ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age "Ice age")[cave paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting "Cave painting").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-4) There is also a two-thousand-year-old character used by [Aristarchus of Samothrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samothrace "Aristarchus of Samothrace") called the _asteriskos_, [‚Äª](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%BB "‚Äª"), which he used when proofreading Homeric poetry to mark lines that were duplicated.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-5)[Origen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen "Origen") is known to have also used the asteriskos to mark missing [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") lines from his [Hexapla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapla "Hexapla").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-6) The asterisk evolved in shape over time, but its meaning as a symbol used to correct defects remained.

In the Middle Ages, the asterisk was used to emphasize a particular part of text, often linking those parts of the text to a marginal comment.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-7) However, an asterisk was not always used.

One hypothesis to the origin of the asterisk is that it stems from the 5000-year-old [Sumerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language "Sumerian language") character [dingir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingir "Dingir"), íÄ≠,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-8) though this hypothesis seems to only be based on visual appearance.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-9)

When toning down [expletives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity "Profanity"), asterisks are often used to replace letters. For example, the word "badword" might become "ba***rd", "b*****d", "b******" or even "*******".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-10) Vowels tend to be censored with an asterisk more than consonants, but the intelligibility of censored profanities with multiple syllables such as "b*dw*rd" and "b*****d" or "ba****d", or uncommon ones is higher if put in context with surrounding text.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-11)

When a document containing [classified information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information "Classified information") is published, the document may be ["sanitized"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitization_(classified_information) "Sanitization (classified information)") ([redacted](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/redact "wikt:redact")) by replacing the classified information with asterisks. For example, the [Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee_Russia_report "Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report").

### Competitive sports and games

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asterisk&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Competitive sports and games")]

In colloquial usage, an asterisk attached to a sporting [record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record "World record") indicates that it is somehow tainted. This is because results that have been considered dubious or set aside are recorded in the record books with an asterisk rendering to a footnote explaining the reason or reasons for concern.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-12)

The usage of the term in sports arose during the 1961 baseball season in which [Roger Maris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Maris "Roger Maris") of the [New York Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees "New York Yankees") was threatening to break [Babe Ruth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth "Babe Ruth")'s 34-year-old single-season [home run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run "Home run") record. Ruth had amassed 60 home runs in a season with only 154 games, but Maris was playing the first season in the American League's newly expanded 162-game season. Baseball Commissioner [Ford C. Frick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_C._Frick "Ford C. Frick"), a friend of Ruth's during the legendary slugger's lifetime, held a press conference to announce his "ruling" that should Maris take longer than 154 games both records would be acknowledged by Major League Baseball, but that some "distinctive mark" [his term][[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Salon-13) be placed next to Maris', which should be listed alongside Ruth's achievement in the "record books". The asterisk as such a mark was suggested at that time by [New York Daily News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News "New York Daily News") sportswriter [Dick Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Young_(sportswriter) "Dick Young (sportswriter)"), not Frick.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Salon-13) The reality, however, was that MLB actually had no direct control over any record books until many years later, and it all was merely a suggestion on Frick's part. Within a few years the controversy died down and all prominent baseball record keepers listed Maris as the single-season record holder for as long as he held the record.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Salon-13)

Nevertheless, the stigma of holding a tainted record remained with Maris for many years, and the concept of a real or figurative asterisk denoting less-than-accepted "official" records has become widely used in sports and other competitive endeavors. A 2001 [TV movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_movie "TV movie") about Maris's record-breaking season was called _[61*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61* "61*")_ (pronounced _sixty-one asterisk_) in reference to the controversy.

Uproar over the integrity of baseball records and whether or not qualifications should be added to them arose again in the late 1990s, when a [steroid-fueled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_era "Steroid era") power explosion led to the shattering of Maris' record. Even though it was obvious - and later admitted[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-14) - by [Mark McGwire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_McGwire "Mark McGwire") that he was heavily on steroids when he hit 70 home runs in 1998, ruling authorities did nothing - to the annoyance of many fans and sportswriters. Three years later self-confessed steroid-user [Barry Bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Bonds "Barry Bonds") pushed that record out to 73, and fans once again began to call for an asterisk in the sport's record books.

Fans were especially critical and clamored louder for baseball to act during the 2007 season, as Bonds approached and later broke [Hank Aaron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron "Hank Aaron")'s career home run record of 755.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-15)

The [Houston Astros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros "Houston Astros")' 2017 World Series win was marred after an investigation by MLB revealed the team's involvement in a [sign-stealing scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros_sign_stealing_scandal "Houston Astros sign stealing scandal") during that season. Fans, appalled by what they perceived to be overly lenient discipline against the Astros players, nicknamed the team the "Houston Asterisks".[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-16)

In recent years, the asterisk has come into use on baseball scorecards to denote a "great defensive play."[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-17)

#### Usage in anti-doping campaigns

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asterisk&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Usage in anti-doping campaigns")]

*   By the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the association of baseball and its records with doping had become so notorious that the term "asterisk" had become firmly associated with [doping in sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport "Doping in sport"). In February 2011 the [United States Olympic Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_Committee "United States Olympic Committee") and the [Ad Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Council "Ad Council") launched an [anti-steroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_performance-enhancing_drugs_in_sport#Anti-doping_organizations_and_legislation "Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport") campaign called "Play Asterisk Free"[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-18) aimed at teens. The campaign, whose logo uses a [heavy asterisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_asterisk "Heavy asterisk") (‚ú±), first launched in 2008 under the name "Don't Be An Asterisk".[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-19)

*   In [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket "Cricket"), it signifies a total number of runs scored by a batsman without losing their wicket; e.g. "107*" means "107 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out "Not out")".
*   Where only the scores of the two batsmen that are currently in are being shown, an asterisk following a batsman's score indicates that he is due to face the next ball to be delivered.
*   When written before a player's name on a scorecard, it indicates the [captain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket) "Captain (cricket)") of the team.
*   It is also used on television when giving a career statistic during a match. For example, "47*" in a number of matches column means that the current game is the player's 47th.

During the first decades of the 21st century, the term _asterisk_ to denote a tainted accomplishment[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] caught on in other sports first in North America and then, due in part to North American sports' widespread media exposure, around the world.

*   In [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression"), the asterisk is used to denote zero or more repetitions of a pattern; this use is also known as the _[Kleene star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene\_star "Kleene star")_ or _Kleene closure_ after [Stephen Kleene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Kleene "Stephen Kleene").
*   In [Unified Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language "Unified Modeling Language"), the asterisk is used to denote zero to many classes.
*   In some [command line interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interface "Command line interface"), such as the [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell "Unix shell") and [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft")'s [CMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMD_(Windows) "CMD (Windows)"), the asterisk is the _[wildcard character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard\_character "Wildcard character")_ (or wildcard symbol) and stands for any [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)") of [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)"). A common use of the wildcard is in searching for files on a computer. For instance, if a user wished to find a document called `Document¬†1`, search terms such as `Doc*` and `D*ment*` would return this file. Due to being a wildcard, they could also return files like `Document 2` and (only the latter) `Dark Knight Monument.jpg`. `Document*` would in fact return any file that begins with `Document`, and `D*ment*` any file that began with D and had 'ment' somewhere in its name.
*   In some [graphical user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface"), an asterisk is pre- or affixed to the current working document name shown in a window's title bar to indicate that unsaved changes exist.
*   In many computing and [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") applications, an asterisk is displayed in place of the characters of sensitive or confidential visible information, such as a password.
*   In [Commodore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_International "Commodore International") (and related) [file systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system "File system"), an asterisk appearing next to a filename in a directory listing denotes an improperly closed file, commonly called a "splat file".
*   In travel industry [Global Distribution Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_reservations_system "Computer reservations system"), the asterisk is the display command to retrieve all or part of a [Passenger Name Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_Name_Record "Passenger Name Record").
*   In [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML")[web forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_form "Web form"), a (usually red) asterisk can be used to denote required fields.
*   [Chat room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chat_room "Chat room") etiquette calls on one asterisk to correct a misspelled word or typo that has already been submitted. For example, one could post `lck`, then follow it with `*luck` or `luck*` (the placement of the * on the left or right is a matter of personal style) to correct the word's spelling, or if it's someone else that notices the mistake, they might also use `*luck` or `luck*`.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-:0-20) This also applies to typos that result in a different word from the intended one but are correctly spelled.
*   In [comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics "Comics"), enclosing a word or phrase between two asterisks is used to denote an action the subject is "performing", e.g. `*cough*`.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-21)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_]
*   In [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown") and other markup languages, surrounding a set of characters or words in one asterisk italicizes, two asterisks bolds, and three asterisks both italicizes and bolds.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-22) See the table below for examples of all three uses of the asterisk in Markdown, including how it translates to HTML and how it renders.

| Markdown | `Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.` | `I just love **bold text**.` | `This text is ***really important***.` |
| --- |
| HTML | `Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.` | `I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.` | `This text is <em><strong>really important</strong></em>.` |
| Rendered Output | Italicized text is the _cat's meow_. | I just love **bold text**. | This text is _**really important**_. |

#### Adding machines and printing calculators

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asterisk&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Adding machines and printing calculators")]

*   Some models of [adding machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adding_machine "Adding machine") and [printing calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator "Calculator") use the asterisk to denote the _total_, or the terminal sum or difference of an addition or subtraction sequence, respectively. The symbol is sometimes given on the printout to indicate this total.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

#### Programming languages

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asterisk&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Programming languages")]

Many [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") and [calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator "Calculator") use the asterisk as a symbol for [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"). It also has a number of special meanings in specific languages, for instance:

*   In some languages such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)"), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++"), and [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language) "Go (programming language)"), the asterisk is used to [dereference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereference "Dereference") or declare a [pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming) "Pointer (computer programming)") variable.
*   In [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp "Common Lisp"), the names of [global variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_variable "Global variable") are conventionally set off with asterisks, `*LIKE-THIS*`.
*   In [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language) "Ada (programming language)"), [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran "Fortran"), [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl"), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"), [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language) "Ruby (programming language)"), some dialects of [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_programming_language "Pascal programming language"), and many others, a double asterisk is used to signify [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation"): `5**3` is 5 3 = 125.
*   In [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl"), the asterisk is used to refer to the _[typeglob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeglob "Typeglob")_ of all variables with a given name.
*   In [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language) "Ruby (programming language)") and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"), the asterisk has two specific uses. First, the unary * operator applied to a list object inside a function call will expand that list into the positional arguments of the function call. Second, a parameter preceded by * in the parameter list in a function definition will result in any extra positional parameters being aggregated into a [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") (Python) or [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type "Array data type") (Ruby), and likewise a parameter preceded by **  will result in any extra [keyword parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_parameter "Named parameter") being aggregated into a [dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array "Associative array") (Python) or [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array "Associative array") (Ruby):

def function1(a, b, c, d):
    print(a, b, c, d)
    
def function2(first, *args):
    # args will be a tuple
    # the name 'args' is convention: it may be any parameter name
    print(args)
    
def function3(first, **kwargs):
    # kwargs will be a dict
    # the name 'kwargs' is convention: it may be any parameter name
    print(kwargs)

function1(1, 2, 3, 4) # prints 1 2 3 4
function1(*[1, 2, 3, 4]) # prints 1 2 3 4
function1(**{"a": 5, "b": 6, "c": 7, "d": 8}) # prints 5 6 7 8

function2(1, 2, 3, 4) # prints (2, 3, 4), 1 is not part of args
function2(99) # prints (), unfilled *parameter will be ()

function3(0, e=3, f=9) # prints {'e': 3, 'f': 9}, 0 is not part of kwargs
function3(0) # prints {}, unfilled **parameter will be {}

*   In [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)"), the asterisk represents the [exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function "Exponential function") and [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation") functions, with `*X` representing e X, and `Y*X` representing Y X.
*   In IBM [Job Control Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Control_Language "Job Control Language"), the asterisk has various functions, including in-stream data in the DD statement, the default print stream as `SYSOUT=*`, and as a self-reference in place of a procedure step name to refer to the same procedure step where it appears.
*   In [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language) "Haskell (programming language)"), the asterisk represents the set of well-formed, fully applied types; that is, a 0-ary _kind_ of types.

In the [B programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language) "B (programming language)") and languages that borrow syntax from it, such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)"), [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "PHP"), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform) "Java (software platform)"), or [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)"), comments in the [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") (for information to people, ignored by the [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler")) are marked by an asterisk combined with the slash:

 /* This section displays message if user input was not valid
 (comment ignored by compiler) */

[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS "CSS") also uses this comment format:

body {
 /* This ought to make the text more readable for far-sighted people */
 font-size: 24pt;
}

Some [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal (programming language)")-like programming languages, such as [Object Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal "Object Pascal"), [Modula-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2 "Modula-2"), [Modula-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-3 "Modula-3"), and [Oberon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(programming_language) "Oberon (programming language)"), and other languages such as [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language) "ML (programming language)"), [Wolfram Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Language "Wolfram Language") ([Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematica "Mathematica")), [AppleScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript "AppleScript"), [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml "OCaml"), [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML "Standard ML"), and [Maple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_(software) "Maple (software)"), use an asterisk combined with a parenthesis:

 (* Do not change this variable - it is used later
 (comment ignored by compiler) *)

Each computing language has its own way of handling comments; `/* ... */` and similar notations are not universal.

#### History of information technology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asterisk&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: History of information technology")]

The asterisk was a supported symbol on the IBM 026 [Keypunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keypunch "Keypunch") (introduced in 1949 and used to create [punch cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_card "Punch card") with data for early computer systems).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-23) It was also included in the [FIELDATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIELDATA "FIELDATA") character encoding[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-24) and the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") standard.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-27)

*   In the [A-Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Level_General_Certificate_of_Education "Advanced Level General Certificate of Education") examinations in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") and the [PSLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School_Leaving_Examination "Primary School Leaving Examination") in [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore "Singapore"), A* ("_A_-star") is a special top grade that is distinguished from grade A.
*   In the [Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Diploma_of_Secondary_Education "Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education") (HKDSE) examination in [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong "Hong Kong"), 5** (5-star-star) and 5* (5-star) are two special top grades that are distinguished from Level 5. Level 5** is the highest level a candidate can attain in HKDSE.

In [fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics "Fluid mechanics") an asterisk in superscript is sometimes used to mean a property at sonic speed.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-28)

*   Certain categories of character types in [role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game "Role-playing game") are called **splats**, and the game supplements describing them are called **[splatbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatbook "Splatbook")**. This usage originated with the shorthand "*book" for this type of supplement to various [World of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Darkness "World of Darkness") games, such as _Clanbook: Ventrue_ (for _[Vampire: The Masquerade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:\_The\_Masquerade "Vampire: The Masquerade")_) or _Tribebook: Black Furies_ (for _[Werewolf: The Apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf:\_The\_Apocalypse "Werewolf: The Apocalypse")_), and this usage has spread to other games with similar character-type supplements. For example, _[Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons\_%26\_Dragons "Dungeons & Dragons")_ Third Edition has had several lines of splatbooks: the "X & Y" series including _Sword & Fist_ and _Tome & Blood_ prior to the "3.5" revision, the "Complete X" series including _Complete Warrior_ and _Complete Divine_, and the "Races of X" series including _Races of Stone_ and _Races of the Wild_.
*   In [Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering "Magic: The Gathering"), an asterisk is used on a creature's power and/or toughness when it's a variable amount.
*   In many [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon "Multi-user dungeon") and [MOOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO "MOO"), as well as "male", "female", and other more esoteric genders, there is a gender called "splat", which uses an asterisk to replace the letters that differ in standard English gender pronouns. For example, _h*_ is used rather than _him_ or _her_. Also, asterisks are used to signify doing an action, for example, "*_action_*".
*   [Game show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show "Game show") producer [Mark Goodson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Goodson "Mark Goodson") used a six-pointed asterisk as his trademark. It is featured prominently on many set pieces from _[The Price Is Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Price\_Is\_Right\_(U.S.\_game\_show) "The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)")._
*   [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble "Scrabble") players put an asterisk after a word to indicate that an illegal play was made.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-29)

*   In human genetics, [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/*_(haplogroup) "* (haplogroup)") is used to denote that someone is a member of a [haplogroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup "Haplogroup") and not any of its subclades (see [* (haplogroup)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/*_(haplogroup) "* (haplogroup)")).

In [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), an asterisk may be used for a range of purposes depending on what is being discussed. The symbol is used to indicate reconstructed words of [proto-languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-languages "Proto-languages") (for which there are no records). For modern languages, it may be placed before posited problematic word forms, phrases or sentences to flag that they are hypothetical, ungrammatical, unpronounceable, etc.

Historical linguist [August Schleicher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Schleicher "August Schleicher") is cited as first using the asterisk for linguistic purposes, specifically for [unattested forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unattested_form "Unattested form") that are [linguistic reconstructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction "Linguistic reconstruction").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Golla-30): 208

Using the asterisk for descriptive and not just historical purposes arose in the 20th century.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Graffi-31): 334  By analogy with its use in historical linguistics, the asterisk was variously prepended to "hypothetical" or "unattested" elements in modern language.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Graffi-31): 332  Its usage also expanded to include "non-existent" or "impossible" forms. [Leonard Bloomfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Bloomfield "Leonard Bloomfield") (1933) uses the asterisk with forms such as _*cran,_ impossible to occur in isolation: _cran-_ only occurs within the compound _cranberry_.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Bloomfield-32): 160 [[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Graffi-31): 331  Such usage for a "non-existent form" was also found in French, German and Italian works in the middle of the 20th century.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Graffi-31): 332‚Äì34

Asterisk usage in linguistics later came to include not just impossible forms, but "[ungrammatical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungrammatical "Ungrammatical") sentences", those that are "ill formed for the native speaker".[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Graffi-31): 332  The expansion of asterisk usage to entire sentences is often credited to [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky"), but Chomsky in 1968 already describes this usage as "conventional".[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Graffi-31): 330  Linguist Fred Householder claims some credit,[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Householder-33): 365 [[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Graffi-31): 331  but Giorgio Graffi argues that using an asterisk for this purpose predates his works.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Graffi-31): 336 [[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-34)

The meaning of the asterisk usage in specific linguistic works may go unelucidated so can be unclear.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Householder-33): 369 [[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-35) Linguistics sometimes uses double asterisks (`**`), another symbol such as the [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark"), or both symbols (e.g. `?*`) to indicate degrees of unacceptability.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Householder-33): 369

#### Historical linguistics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asterisk&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Historical linguistics")]

In [historical linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics "Historical linguistics"), the asterisk marks words or phrases that are not directly recorded in texts or other media, and that are therefore [reconstructed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction "Linguistic reconstruction") on the basis of other linguistic material by the [comparative method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_method "Comparative method").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-36)

In the following example, the [Proto-Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic "Proto-Germanic") word *_ainlif_ is a reconstructed form.

*   *_ainlif_ ‚Üí _[endleofan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/endleofan#Old\_English "wikt:endleofan")_ ‚Üí _eleven_

A double asterisk (`**`) sometimes indicates an intermediary or proximate reconstructed form (e.g. a single asterisk for reconstructed [thirteenth century Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Mandarin "Old Mandarin") and a double asterisk for reconstructions of older [Ancient Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Chinese "Old Chinese")[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Cheng-37): 5  or a double asterisk for proto-[Popolocan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popolocan_languages "Popolocan languages") and a single asterisk for intermediary forms[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Veerman-38): 322 ).

In other cases, the double asterisk denotes a form that would be expected according to a rule, but is not actually found. That is, it indicates a reconstructed form that is not found or used, and in place of which _another_ form is found in actual usage:

*   For the plural, **_kubar_ would be expected, but separate masculine plural _akƒÅbir_ ‚Äè[ÿ£ŸÉÿßÿ®ÿ±](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B1#Arabic "wikt:ÿ£ŸÉÿßÿ®ÿ±")‚Äé and feminine plural _kubrayƒÅt_ ‚Äè[ŸÉÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿßÿ™](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA#Arabic "wikt:ŸÉÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿßÿ™")‚Äé are found as irregular forms.

In most areas of linguistics, but especially in [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax"), an asterisk in front of a word or phrase indicates that the word or phrase is not used because it is [ungrammatical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungrammatical "Ungrammatical").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Graffi-31): 332

*   wake her up / *wake up her

An asterisk before a parenthesis indicates that the lack of the word or phrase inside is ungrammatical, while an asterisk after the opening bracket of the parenthesis indicates that the existence of the word or phrase inside is ungrammatical‚Äîe.g., the following indicates "go the station" would be ungrammatical:

*   go *(to) the station

Use of an asterisk to denote forms or sentences that are ungrammatical is often complemented by the use of the [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark") (`?`) to indicate a word, phrase or sentence that is avoided, questionable or strange, but not necessarily outright ungrammatical.[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-42)

Other sources go further and use several symbols (e.g. the asterisk, question mark, and [degree symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol "Degree symbol")`¬∞`) to indicate gradations or a continuum of acceptability.[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-44)

Since a word marked with an asterisk could mean either "unattested" or "impossible", it is important in some contexts to distinguish these meanings. In general, authors retain asterisks for "unattested", and prefix `x`, `**`, `‚Ä†`, or `?` for the latter meaning.[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-46) An alternative is to append the asterisk (or another symbol, possibly to differentiate between even more cases) at the end.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In [optimality theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimality_theory "Optimality theory"), asterisks are used as "violation marks" in tableau cells to denote a violation of a constraint by an output form.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-47)

#### Phonetic transcription

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asterisk&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Phonetic transcription")]

In phonetic transcription using the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet") and similar systems, an asterisk was historically used to denote that the word it preceded was a proper noun.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-48)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-49) See this example from W. Perrett's 1921 transcription of Gottfried Keller's _Das F√§hnlein der sieben Aufrechten_:[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-50)

Ààk…ëin…ô ÀàreÀêd…ô, virt Ààni√ßts daÀàraÀëus! z…ëÀêkt…ô*ÀàheÀêdig…ôr Ààkurts.(_\_¬ªKeine Rede, wird nichts daraus!¬´sagte Hediger kurz.\__)
This convention is no longer usual.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-51)

The asterisk has many uses in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"). The following list highlights some common uses and is not exhaustive.

stand-alone
*   An arbitrary point in some set. Seen, for example, when computing [Riemann sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sums "Riemann sums") or when contracting a simply connected group to the singleton set ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \{\ast \}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1b8b8fb50770dae834a5efc1767b082ce6e6b411).

as a [unary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operator "Unary operator"), denoted in [prefix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_notation "Prefix notation")
*   The [Hodge star operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_star_operator "Hodge star operator") on vector spaces ![Image 6: {\displaystyle *:A^{k}\rightarrow A^{n-k}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d94ce5548905defe6cb95e2f9f77edfb4047410d).

as a unary operator, written as a [subscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscript "Subscript")as a unary operator, written as a [superscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscript "Superscript")as a [binary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operator "Binary operator"), in [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation "Infix notation")
The asterisk is used in all branches of mathematics to designate a correspondence between two quantities denoted by the same letter ‚Äì one with the asterisk and one without.

#### Mathematical typography

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asterisk&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Mathematical typography")]

In fine mathematical typography, the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") character U+2217‚àóASTERISK OPERATOR (in HTML, &lowast;; not to be confused with U+204E‚ÅéLOW ASTERISK) is available. This character also appeared in the position of the regular asterisk in the [PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript "PostScript") symbol character set in the _Symbol_ font included with Windows and Macintosh operating systems and with many printers.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] It should be used for a large asterisk that lines up with the other mathematical operators, sitting on the math centerline rather than on the text baseline.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-53)

*   In [musical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_symbols "List of musical symbols") the sign [![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Music-pedalup.svg/20px-Music-pedalup.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Music-pedalup.svg) (U+1D1AFùÜØMUSICAL SYMBOL PEDAL UP MARK) indicates when the [sustain pedal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustain_pedal "Sustain pedal") of the piano should be lifted.
*   In [liturgical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgical_music "Liturgical music"), an asterisk is often used to denote a deliberate pause.

*   In the Geneva Bible and the King James Bible, an asterisk is used to indicate a marginal comment or scripture reference.
*   In the [Leeser Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_English_Bible_translations#Isaac_Leeser_translation "Jewish English Bible translations"), an asterisk is used to mark off the seven subdivisions of the weekly Torah portion. It is also used to mark the few verses to be repeated by the reader of the Haftara.
*   In American printings of the _[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Common\_Prayer "Book of Common Prayer")_, an asterisk is used to divide a verse of a Psalm in two portions for responsive reading. British printings use a spaced colon (": ") for the same purpose.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-54)
*   In [pointed psalms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_chant "Anglican chant"), an asterisk is used to denote a break or breath.

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Star_of_life2.svg/250px-Star_of_life2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Star_of_life2.svg)

The Star of Life may represent [emergency medical services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services "Emergency medical services")

A [Star of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_Life "Star of Life"), a six-bar asterisk overlaid with the [Rod of Asclepius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_of_Asclepius "Rod of Asclepius") (the symbol of health), may be used as an alternative to cross or crescent symbols on ambulances.

### Statistical results

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asterisk&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Statistical results")]

In many scientific publications, the asterisk is employed as a shorthand to denote the [statistical significance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance "Statistical significance") of results when testing [hypotheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis"). When the likelihood that a result occurred by chance alone is below a certain level, one or more asterisks are displayed. Popular significance levels are <0.05 (*), <0.01 (**), and <0.001 (***).

Further information: [E.161](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.161 "E.161")

On a [tone dialling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling "Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling") telephone keypad, the asterisk (called _star_) is one of the two special keys (the other is the ['square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewdata#Keypad_symbols:_the_sextile_and_the_square "Viewdata") key‚Äì almost invariably replaced by the [number sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign "Number sign")# (called 'pound sign' (US), 'hash' (other countries), or 'hex'), and is found to the left of the zero[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-p-55)). They are used to navigate menus in systems such as [voice mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_mail "Voice mail"), or in [vertical service codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_service_code "Vertical service code"). Its [codepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codepoint "Codepoint") in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") is U+2217‚àó[ASTERISK OPERATOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%88%97 "‚àó") (&lowast;) as a valid alternative usage.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-56)

*   The asterisk is used to call out a [footnote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footnote "Footnote"), especially when there is only one on the page. Less commonly, multiple asterisks are used to denote different footnotes on a page (i.e., *, **, ***).[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-57)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Rogers,_184-58) Typically, an asterisk is positioned after a word or phrase and preceding its accompanying footnote. Other characters are also used for this purpose, such as [dagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_(typography) "Dagger (typography)") (‚Ä†, ‚Ä°) or superscript letters and numbers (as in Wikipedia). In marketing and advertising, asterisks or other symbols are used to refer readers discreetly to terms or conditions for a certain statement, the "[small print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_print "Small print")".
*   In English-language typography the asterisk is placed after all other punctuation marks (for example, commas, colons, or periods) except for the dash.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-59)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-60)

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Section_break_02_by_Pengo.jpg/250px-Section_break_02_by_Pengo.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Section_break_02_by_Pengo.jpg)

Asterisks used to illustrate a [section break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_break "Section break") in _[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s\_Adventures\_in\_Wonderland "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland")_

*   Three spaced asterisks centered on a page is called a [dinkus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus "Dinkus") and may represent a jump to a different scene, thought, or [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(typography) "Section (typography)").
*   A group of three asterisks arranged in a triangular formation is called an [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(typography) "Asterism (typography)"). It may be used instead of a name on a title page.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Rogers,_184-58)
*   One or more asterisks may be used as censorship over all or part of a word.
*   Asterisks are sometimes used as an alternative to [typographical bullets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography) "Bullet (typography)") to indicate items of a list.
*   Asterisks can be used in textual media to represent *[emphasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphasis_(typography) "Emphasis (typography)")* when [bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold_text "Bold text") or [italic text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_text "Italic text") is not available (e.g., [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter"), [text messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging "Text messaging")).
*   Asterisks may denote conversational [repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_analysis#Repair "Conversation analysis"), or corrections to misspelling or misstatements in previous electronic messages, particularly when replacement or retraction of a previous writing is not possible, such as with "immediate delivery" messages or "instant messages" that can not be edited. Usually this takes the form of a message consisting solely of the corrected text, with an asterisk placed before (or after) the correction. For example, one might send a message reading "*morning" or "morning*" to correct the misspelling in the message "I had a good mroning".[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-:0-20)[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
*   Bounding asterisks as "a kind of self-describing stage direction", as linguist [Ben Zimmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Zimmer "Ben Zimmer") has put it. For example, in "_Another gas station robbery *sigh*_", the writer uses *sigh* to express disappointment (but does not necessarily literally sigh).[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-61)
*   Bounding asterisks can also represent an action in online situations where they aren't shown.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-62)

The [gender star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_star "Gender star") (German: _Genderstern_, or [diminutive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive")_Gendersternchen_; lit.'gender asterisk') is a nonstandard typographic style used by some authors in [gender-neutral language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language "Gender-neutral language") in [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-63)

It is formed by placing an asterisk after the [stem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem "Word stem") and appending the feminine plural suffix "_-innen"._ For example, _Fahrer_ ([male] driver, singular & plural) becomes _Fahrer*innen_ (drivers). The gender star makes it possible to refer to all [genders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender "Gender") while also including [non-binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary "Non-binary") people.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-64)

In speech, the gender star is sometimes signalled by a [glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop "Glottal stop").[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-65)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-66)

Alternatives to the gender star include [Binnen-I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binnen-I "Binnen-I") (with medial capital _I_), the [gender gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_gap_(linguistics) "Gender gap (linguistics)") (where an [underscore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore "Underscore") takes the place of the asterisk) or using inherently gender neutral terms, such as 'people' instead of 'man' or 'woman'.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-67)

The gender star was named the German Anglicism of the Year in 2018 by the [Leibniz-Institut f√ºr Deutsche Sprache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz-Institut_f%C3%BCr_Deutsche_Sprache "Leibniz-Institut f√ºr Deutsche Sprache").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-68)

The [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") standard has a variety of asterisk-like characters, compared in the table below. (Characters will display differently in different browsers and fonts.) The reason there are so many is chiefly because of the controversial[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] decision to include in Unicode the entire [Zapf Dingbats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapf_Dingbats "Zapf Dingbats") symbol font.

However, Householder (who was not a generative grammarian) was simply following a practice which had already been introduced by others, and which was so automatic as to be adopted almost unconsciously."_[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#cite_note-Graffi-31): 336
