Historically, Aberdeen was within the historic county of Aberdeenshire , but is now separate from the council area of Aberdeenshire . Aberdeen City Council is one of Scotland's 32 local authorities [ 3 ] (commonly referred to as councils ). Aberdeen has a population of 
198,590 (2020) for the main urban area and 
220,690 (2020) for the wider settlement including outlying localities, [ 4 ] making it the United Kingdom's 39th most populous built-up area . Aberdeen has a long, sandy coastline and features an oceanic climate , with cool summers and mild, rainy winters.

[ 5 ] Aberdeen received royal burgh status from David I of Scotland (1124–1153), [ 6 ] which transformed the city economically. The traditional industries of fishing, paper-making, shipbuilding, and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and Aberdeen's seaport. Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world, [ 7 ] and the seaport is the largest in the north-east part of Scotland.

[ 8 ] A university town , the city is known for the University of Aberdeen , founded in 1495 as the fifth oldest university in the English-speaking world and located in Old Aberdeen .

During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries, Aberdeen's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite , which may sparkle like silver because of its high mica content.

[ 9 ] Since the discovery of North Sea oil in 1969, Aberdeen has been known as the offshore oil capital of Europe.

[ 10 ] Based upon the discovery of prehistoric villages around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don , the area around Aberdeen is thought to have been settled for at least 6,000 years.

[ 11 ] Toponymy [ edit ] Main article: Etymology of Aberdeen The name given to Aberdeen translates as 'mouth of the river Don', and is recorded as Aberdon in 1172 and Aberden in c.

1180 . The first element of the name is the Pictish word aber 'river mouth'. The second element is from the Celtic river goddess Devona .

[ 12 ] Aberdeen is usually described as within the historical Pictish territory and became Gaelic-speaking at some time in the medieval period. Old Aberdeen is the approximate location of Aberdon, the first settlement of Aberdeen; this literally means "the mouth of the Don". The Celtic word aber means "river mouth", as in modern Welsh ( Aberystwyth , Aberdare , Aberbeeg etc.).

[ 13 ] The Scottish Gaelic name is Obar Dheathain (variation: Obairreadhain ; * obar presumably being a loan from the earlier Pictish; the Gaelic term is inbhir ), and in Latin , the Romans referred to the river as Devana .

Medieval (or Ecclesiastical ) Latin has it as Aberdonia .

[ 14 ] The local Doric pronunciation, [ˌeːbərˈdin] ⓘ or [ˈeːbərdin] ⓘ (with a long ay sound), is frequently rendered Aiberdeen or Aiberdein .

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Aberdeen Early origins [ edit ] View of Aberdeen by William Mosman, 1756 The Aberdeen area has seen human settlement for at least 8,000 years.

[ 11 ] The city began as two separate burghs : Old Aberdeen at the mouth of the river Don ; and New Aberdeen, a fishing and trading settlement, where the Denburn waterway entered the river Dee estuary.

[ 15 ] The earliest charter was granted by William the Lion in 1179 and confirmed the corporate rights granted by David I .

[ 16 ] In 1214, Aberdeen Burgesses were granted a Royal Charter by Alexander II of Scotland giving them the sole right to form a Guild. This body exercised power in the composition of the local council, and the affairs of the town. The Burgesses of the Guild were an integral part of the council for more than 700 years and played a considerable role in the growth and development of Aberdeen.

[ 17 ] In 1319, the Great Charter of Robert the Bruce transformed Aberdeen into a property-owning and financially independent community. Granted with it was the nearby Forest of Stocket, whose income formed the basis for the city's Common Good Fund which still benefits Aberdonians.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Wars of Scottish Independence [ edit ] Main article: Wars of Scottish Independence During the Wars of Scottish Independence , Aberdeen was under English rule, so Robert the Bruce laid siege to Aberdeen Castle before destroying it in 1308, followed by executing the English garrison. The city was burned by Edward III of England in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770.

[ 20 ] Aberdeen's medieval council registers survive from 1398 onwards and are exceptional for their quantity and continuity among surviving Scottish burgh records. The earliest eight volumes, from 1398 to 1511, have been included in the UNESCO UK Memory of the World Register , and have been edited in a digital edition.

[ 21 ] During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms of 1644 to 1647 the city was plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked by Royalist troops after the Battle of Aberdeen [ 22 ] and two years later it was stormed by a Royalist force under the command of the George Gordon, 2nd Marquis of Huntly .

[ 23 ] An outbreak of bubonic plague over 1687 and 1688 killed 8.5% of the population, adding to the economic and demographic damage caused by war.

[ 24 ] In the 18th century, a new Town Hall was built and the first social services appeared with the Aberdeen Infirmary at Woolmanhill in 1739 [ 25 ] and the Aberdeen Lunatic Asylum in 1800.

[ 26 ] Post-Napoleonic depression [ edit ] The expensive infrastructure works led to the city becoming bankrupt in 1817 during the Post-Napoleonic depression , an economic downturn immediately after the Napoleonic Wars ; but the city's prosperity later recovered. The increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the construction of the present harbour including Victoria Dock and the South Breakwater, and the extension of the North Pier.

Gas street lighting arrived in 1824 and an enhanced water supply appeared in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewer system replaced open sewers in 1865.

[ 19 ] The city absorbed the neighbouring burghs of Old Aberdeen and Woodside plus the Torry area on the south bank of the Dee in 1891.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Second World War [ edit ] Over the course of World War II Aberdeen was attacked 32 times by the German Luftwaffe . One of the most devastating attacks was on Wednesday 21 April 1943 when 29 Luftwaffe Dornier 217s flying from Stavanger , Norway attacked the city between the hours of 22:17 and 23:04.

[ 29 ] A total of 98 civilians and 27 servicemen were killed, along with 12,000 houses damaged, after a mixture of 127 Incendiary, High Explosive and Cluster bombs were dropped on the city in one night.

[ 30 ] Two books written in 2018 and 2022 using bombing records held in London identified that unexploded bombs from the 1943 raid were found in the 1950s and 1980s making the bombs dropped 129 in total. Damage from the raid can still be seen in some parts of Aberdeen.

[ citation needed ] Coat of arms and motto [ edit ] The arms and banner of the city show three silver towers on red. This motif dates from at least the time of Robert the Bruce and represents the buildings that stood on the three hills of medieval Aberdeen: Aberdeen Castle on Castle Hill (today's Castlegate ); the city gate on Port Hill; and a church on St Catherine's Hill (now levelled).

[ 31 ] "Bon Accord" is the motto of the city and is French for "Good Agreement". Legend tells that its use dates from a password used by Robert the Bruce during the 14th century Wars of Scottish Independence , when he and his men laid siege to the English-held Aberdeen Castle before destroying it in 1308.

[ 18 ] It is still widely present in the city, throughout street names, business names and the city's Bon Accord shopping mall.

[ 32 ] The shield in the coat of arms is supported by two leopards . A local magazine is called the "Leopard" and, when Union Bridge was widened in the 20th century, small statues of the creature in a sitting position were cast and placed on top of the railing posts (known locally as Kelly's Cats). The city's toast is "Happy to meet, sorry to part, happy to meet again".

[ 33 ] Recent history [ edit ] In 2012, HSBC named Aberdeen as a leading business hub and one of eight 'super cities' spearheading the UK's economy, marking it as the only city in Scotland so designated.

[ 34 ] In 2018, Aberdeen was found to be the best city in the UK to start a business in a study released by card payment firm Paymentsense.

[ 35 ] Politics and government [ edit ] Main articles: Politics of Aberdeen and Coat of arms of Aberdeen Marischal College , main offices of Aberdeen City Council Aberdeen City is one of 32 council areas of Scotland , administered by Aberdeen City Council . The council meets at Aberdeen Town House and has its main offices in the adjoining Marischal College . The civic head and chair of the council is the Lord Provost . The council area is also divided into 30 community council areas , 29 of which had community councils operating as at August 2024.

[ 36 ] The first burgh of Aberdeen, covering just the New Aberdeen area near the mouth of the Dee, was created by David I (reigned 1124–1153).

[ 6 ] [ 37 ] Neighbouring Old Aberdeen to the north was subsequently made a separate burgh in 1489.

[ 38 ] The burgh of Aberdeen was governed by a corporation, also known as the town council. As Aberdeen grew, the council's powers were inadequate to cater for the needs of the growing urban area. A separate police commission was established in 1795 with powers to levy taxes and provide infrastructure ('police' in this context being its older meaning of civic government rather than law enforcement). The first police commission was short-lived, but it was resurrected in 1818 after the town council went bankrupt in 1817. From 1818 until 1871 there was a dual system of local government, with the town council and police commission having different roles in Aberdeen's administration. The police commission was eventually abolished in 1871 and its functions absorbed by the town council.

[ 39 ] Aberdeen Town House , the administrative HQ of Aberdeen City Council In 1891 the city boundaries were significantly enlarged, absorbing the neighbouring burghs of Old Aberdeen and Woodside, plus the Torry area on the south bank of the Dee. The act of parliament which expanded the burgh also confirmed that Aberdeen was entitled to be called a city; it had commonly been described as a city prior to that, but (like most Scottish cities) without official recognition.

[ 28 ] [ 40 ] Following the absorption of Torry in 1891, the city boundaries straddled the counties of Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire . Aberdeen was made a county of itself in 1899.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] In 1975 the burgh was replaced by the larger City of Aberdeen district within the Grampian region.

[ 43 ] Further local government reforms in 1996 replaced the districts and regions created in 1975 with council areas; the pre-1996 City of Aberdeen district became the Aberdeen City council area.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] In the Scottish Parliament , the city is represented by three constituencies with different boundaries: Aberdeen Central and Aberdeen Donside are wholly within the Aberdeen City council area.

Aberdeen South and North Kincardine includes the North Kincardine ward of Aberdeenshire Council . A further seven MSPs are elected as part of the North East Scotland electoral region. In the European Parliament the city was represented by six MEPs as part of the all-inclusive Scotland constituency.

[ 46 ] Aberdeen is represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom by two constituencies , Aberdeen North and Aberdeen South , which are wholly within the Aberdeen City council area.

[ 47 ] Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Aberdeen Aberdeen beach, situated along the coastline of Aberdeen on the North Sea Location and area [ edit ] Being situated between two river mouths, the city has little natural exposure of bedrock. The small amount of geophysics done, and occasional building-related exposures, combined with small exposures in the banks of the River Don, suggest that it is actually sited on an inlier of Devonian "Old Red" sandstones and silts. The outskirts of the city spread beyond the (inferred) limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic/ igneous complexes formed during the Dalradian period (approximately 480–600 million years ago) with sporadic areas of igneous Diorite granites to be found, such as that at the Rubislaw quarry which was used to build much of the Victorian parts of the city.

[ 48 ] The city extends to 186 km 2 (72 sq mi), [ 2 ] and includes the former burghs of Old Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, Woodside and the Torry area to the south of River Dee . In 2022, this gave the city a population density of 1,208 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,130/sq mi).

[ 2 ] The city is built on many hills, with the original beginnings of the city growing from Castle Hill, St. Catherine's Hill and Windmill Hill.

[ 49 ] When compared to mainland Europe, Aberdeen is further north than almost all of Denmark and plenty of southern Sweden, being just south of Gothenburg in terms of latitude.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] Climate [ edit ] Sunshine across Aberdeen during August Aberdeen features an oceanic climate ( Köppen Cfb ), with far milder winter temperatures than one might expect for its northern location. However, statistically speaking, it is still the coldest city in the UK. During the winter, especially throughout December, the length of the day is very short, averaging 6 hours and 41 minutes between sunrise and sunset at the winter solstice.

[ 52 ] As winter progresses, the length of the day grows fairly quickly, to 8 hours and 20 minutes by the end of January. Around summer solstice, the days will be around 18 hours long, having 17 hours and 55 minutes between sunrise and sunset.

[ 52 ] During this time of the year marginal nautical twilight lasts the entire night. Temperatures at this time of year hover around 17.0 °C (62.6 °F) during the day in most of the urban area, though nearer 16.0 °C (60.8 °F) directly on the coast, and around 18.0 to 19.0 °C (64.4 to 66.2 °F) in the westernmost suburbs.

[ 53 ] Two weather stations collect climate data for the area, Aberdeen/Dyce Airport , and Craibstone. Both are about 4 + 1 ⁄ 2 miles (7 km) to the northwest of the city centre, and given that they are in close proximity to each other, exhibit very similar climatic regimes. Dyce tends to have marginally warmer daytime temperatures year-round owing to its slightly lower elevation, though it is more susceptible to harsh frosts. The coldest temperature to occur in recent years was −16.8 °C (1.8 °F) during December 2010, [ 54 ] while the following winter, Dyce set a new February high-temperature station record on 28 February 2012 of 17.2 °C (63.0 °F), [ 55 ] and a new March high temperature record of 21.6 °C (70.9 °F) on 25 March 2012.

[ 56 ] The average temperature of the sea ranges from 6.6 °C (43.9 °F) in March to 13.8 °C (56.8 °F) in August.

Aberdeen's largest denominations are the Church of Scotland (through the Presbytery of Aberdeen ) and the Roman Catholic Church , both with numerous churches across the city, with the Scottish Episcopal Church having the third-largest number. The census in 2022 showed that Aberdeen has the highest proportion of non-religious residents of any city in Scotland, with 58% of citizens claiming to have no religion.

[ 78 ] In the Middle Ages , the Kirk of St Nicholas was the only burgh kirk and one of Scotland's largest parish churches. Like a number of other Scottish kirks, it was subdivided after the Reformation , in this case into the East and West churches. At that time, the city also was home to houses of the Carmelites (Whitefriars) [ 79 ] and Franciscans (Greyfriars). The latter survives in modified form as the chapel of Marischal College.

[ 80 ] St Machar's Cathedral was built twenty years after David I (1124–1153) transferred the pre-Reformation diocese from Mortlach in Banffshire to Old Aberdeen in 1137. Except the episcopate of William Elphinstone (1484–1511), building progressed slowly.

Gavin Dunbar , who followed him in 1518, completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept. It is now a congregation of the Church of Scotland . Aberdeen has two other cathedrals: St. Mary's Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Gothic style , erected in 1859. In addition, St. Andrew's Cathedral serves the Scottish Episcopal Church . It was constructed in 1817 as Archibald Simpson 's first commission and contains a memorial to the consecration of the first bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America , which took place nearby. In 1804, St Peter's Church , the first permanent Roman Catholic church in the city after the Reformation was built.

[ 81 ] Numerous other Protestant denominations have a presence in Aberdeen.

The Salvation Army citadel on the Castlegate dominates the view of the east end of Union Street. In addition, there is a Unitarian church, established in 1833 and located in Skene Terrace.

Christadelphians have been present in Aberdeen since at least 1844. Over the years, they have rented space to meet at a number of locations and currently meet in the Inchgarth Community Centre in Garthdee.

[ 82 ] There is also a Quaker meetinghouse on Crown Street, the only purpose built Friends meeting house in Scotland that is still in use today. In addition, there are a number of Baptist congregations in the city, and Evangelical congregations have been appearing in significant numbers since the late 2000s. The city also has two meeting houses of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

[ 83 ] There are also four mosques in Aberdeen which serve the Islamic community in the city.

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] There is an Orthodox Jewish Synagogue established in 1945. There is also a Thai Buddhist temple located in the Hazelhead area of the city. There are no formal Hindu buildings, although there is a fortnightly Hindu religious gathering on the first and third Sunday afternoons at Queens Cross Parish church hall.

[ 86 ] The University of Aberdeen has a small Baháʼí society.

Economy [ edit ] Main articles: Economy of Aberdeen and Petroleum industry in Aberdeen Ships off the coast of Aberdeen in the North Sea , supporting the production of North Sea oil and gas Traditionally, Aberdeen was home to fishing, textile mills, shipbuilding and paper-making. These industries have been largely replaced. High technology developments in the electronics design and development industry, research in agriculture and fishing and the oil industry , which have been largely responsible for Aberdeen's economic growth, are now major parts of Aberdeen's economy.

[ 87 ] Until the 1970s, most of Aberdeen's leading industries dated from the 18th century; mainly these were textiles, foundry work, shipbuilding and paper-making, the oldest industry in the city, with paper having been first made there in 1694. Paper-making has reduced in importance since the closures of Donside Paper Mill in 2001 and the Davidson Mill in 2005 leaving the Stoneywood Paper Mill with a workforce of approximately 500. Textile production ended in 2004 when Richards of Aberdeen closed.

[ 88 ] Grey granite was quarried at Rubislaw quarry for more than 300 years, and used for paving setts, kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental pieces. Aberdeen granite was used to build the terraces of the Houses of Parliament and Waterloo Bridge in London. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971. The current owners have begun pumping 40 years of rainwater from the quarry to develop a heritage centre on the site.

[ 89 ] Neptune Energy and Aker Solutions Buildings, North Dee Business Quarter. An example of modern offices becoming more prevalent in Aberdeen's City Centre In-shore fishing was once the predominant industry but was surpassed by deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the 20th century. Catches have fallen because of overfishing and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels, [ 90 ] and so although still an important fishing port it is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of Peterhead and Fraserburgh . The Fisheries Research Services are headquartered in Aberdeen, and there is a marine research laboratory there.

[ 91 ] Aberdeen is well regarded for the agricultural and soil research carried out at The James Hutton Institute (formerly the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute), which has close links to the city's two universities. The Rowett Research Institute is a world-renowned research centre for studies into food and nutrition located in Aberdeen. It has produced three Nobel laureates and there is a high concentration of life scientists working in the city.

[ 92 ] [ 93 ] As oil reserves in the North Sea decrease, there is an effort to rebrand Aberdeen as "Energy Capital of Europe" rather than "Oil Capital of Europe", and there is interest in the development of new energy sources, and technology transfer from oil into renewable energy and other industries is underway. The "Energetica" initiative led by Scottish Enterprise has been designed to accelerate this process.

[ 94 ] Aberdeen has become a major world centre for undersea petroleum technology.

[ 95 ] [ 96 ] North Sea oil and gas [ edit ] Further information: Aberdeen Harbour and North Sea oil Aberdeen Harbour Aberdeen had been a major maritime centre throughout the 19th century, when a group of local entrepreneurs launched the first steam-powered trawler. The steam trawling industry expanded and by 1933 Aberdeen was Scotland's top fishing port, employing nearly 3,000 men with 300 vessels sailing from its harbour. By the time oil was coming on stream, much of the trawling fleet had relocated to Peterhead .

[ 97 ] Geologists had speculated about oil and gas in the North Sea since the middle of the 20th century, but tapping its deep and inhospitable waters was another story. With the Middle Eastern oil sheiks becoming more aware of the political and economic power of their oil reserves and government threats of rationing, the industry began to consider the North Sea as a viable source of oil. Exploration commenced in the 1960s and the first major find in the British sector was in November 1970 in the Forties field, 110 miles (180 km) east of Aberdeen.

[ 10 ] By late 1975, after years of intense construction, the necessary infrastructure was in place. Oil flowed through the Forties pipeline system directly to the refinery at far-away Grangemouth .

[ 98 ] Business [ edit ] Union Street towards Castlegate (facing east) In 2011, the Centre for Cities named Aberdeen as the best-placed city for growth in Britain, as the country looked to emerge from the recent economic downturn.

[ 99 ] With energy still providing the backbone of the local economy, recent years have seen very large new investment in the North Sea owing to rising oil prices and favourable government tax incentives.

[ 100 ] This has led to several oil majors and independents building new global offices in the city.

[ 101 ] Five of Scotland's top ten businesses are based in Aberdeen with a collective turnover of £14 billion, yielding a profit in excess of £2.4 billion. Alongside this 29 of Scotland's top 100 businesses are located in Aberdeen with an employment rate of 77.9%, making it the second highest UK city for employment.

[ 102 ] Figures released in 2016 ranked Aberdeen as having the second highest number of patents processed per person in the UK.

[ 103 ] Shopping [ edit ] The traditional shopping streets are Union Street and George Street , now complemented by shopping centres, including the Bon Accord Centre and the Trinity Shopping Centre . A£190 million retail development, Union Square , reached completion in late September/early October 2009.

[ 104 ] Major retail parks away from the city centre include the Berryden Retail Park, the Kittybrewster Retail Park and the Beach Boulevard Retail Park.

Aberdeen Market has been rebuilt twice, but closed in 2020.

[ 105 ] In March 2004, Aberdeen was awarded Fairtrade City status by the Fairtrade Foundation .

[ 106 ] Landmarks [ edit ] Main articles: Architecture of Aberdeen , Green spaces and walkways in Aberdeen , and Aberdeen theatres and concert halls Duthie Park Aberdeen's architecture is known for its principal use during the Victorian era of granite , which has led to its local nickname of the Granite City.

[ 107 ] Amongst the notable buildings in the city's main street, Union Street , are the Town and County Bank, the Music Hall , the Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades (originating between 1398 and 1527, although completely rebuilt in the 1860s), now a shopping mall; the former office of the Northern Assurance Company, and the National Bank of Scotland . In Castle Street, a continuation eastwards of Union Street, is the new Aberdeen Town House , a very prominent landmark in Aberdeen, built between 1868 and 1873 to a design by Peddie and Kinnear.

[ 108 ] Alexander Marshall Mackenzie 's extension to Marischal College on Broad Street, opened by King Edward VII in 1906, created the second largest granite building in the world (after the Escorial , Madrid).

[ 109 ] In addition to the many fine landmark buildings, Aberdeen has many prominent public statues, three of the most notable being William Wallace at the junction between Union Terrace and Rosemount Viaduct, Robert Burns on Union Terrace above Union Terrace Gardens , and Robert the Bruce holding aloft the charter he issued to the city in 1319 on Broad Street, outside Marischal College .

[ 110 ] Aberdeen has long been famous for its 45 [ 111 ] parks and gardens, and citywide floral displays which include two million roses, eleven million daffodils and three million crocuses. The city has won the Royal Horticultural Society 's Britain in Bloom 'Best City' award ten times, [ 111 ] the overall Scotland in Bloom competition twenty times [ 111 ] and the large city category every year since 1968.

[ 111 ] However, despite recent spurious reports, Aberdeen has never been banned from the Britain in Bloom competition.

[ 112 ] The city won the 2006 Scotland in Bloom "Best City" award along with the International Cities in Bloom award. The suburb of Dyce also won the Small Towns award.

[ 113 ] [ 114 ] Duthie Park opened in 1899 on the north bank of the River Dee . It was named after and given to the city by Miss Elizabeth Crombie Duthie of Ruthrieston in 1881.

[ 115 ] Hazlehead Park , is large and forested, and located on the outskirts of the city.

[ 116 ] Johnston Gardens is a small park of one hectare in the west end of the city. In 2002, the garden was named the best garden in the British Islands .

[ 111 ] Seaton Park , formerly the grounds of a private house, is on the edge of the grounds of St Machar's Cathedral and was acquired for the city in 1947.

[ 117 ] Aberdeen has hosted several theatres throughout its history, some of which have been converted or destroyed. The most famous include: His Majesty's Theatre (HMT), on Rosemount Viaduct [ 118 ] The Tivoli , on Guild Street [ 119 ] Capitol Theatre , on Union Street [ 120 ] Aberdeen Arts Centre , on King Street [ 121 ] The Palace Theatre, on Bridge Street [ 122 ] The main concert hall is the Music Hall on Union Street, built in 1822.

[ 123 ] Transport [ edit ] Main article: Transport in Aberdeen Railway [ edit ] Aberdeen Station concourse in 2022 Aberdeen railway station is served by four train operating companies : ScotRail operates frequent direct trains to Scotland's major cities: Edinburgh , Glasgow and Inverness ; it also runs local services to Inverurie and Montrose [ 124 ] London North Eastern Railway operates services on the East Coast Main Line to Edinburgh, Newcastle , York , Doncaster and London King's Cross [ 125 ] CrossCountry operates services to Plymouth and Edinburgh. The train to Plymouth was part of the UK's previous longest direct passenger train which took 13 hours and 23 minutes to reach Penzance .

[ 126 ] The service to Penzance ceased operation on the 16th May and now terminates in Plymouth, and no longer holds the title for the UK's longest direct rail journey.

[ 127 ] Caledonian Sleeper runs overnight sleeper services to and from London Euston .

[ 128 ] Today, all railway services to the south run via Dundee . The faster main line from Aberdeen to Perth via Forfar and Strathmore closed in 1967, as a result of the Beeching cuts ; the faster main line from Perth to Edinburgh via Glenfarg also closed subsequently in 1970.

[ citation needed ] A second station, at Dyce , serves the north of the city centre; it is on the Aberdeen–Inverness line .
