It is the flagship campus of Indiana University and its largest campus, with over 48,000 students.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Established as the state's seminary in 1820, the name was changed to "Indiana College" in 1829 and to "Indiana University" in 1838.

Indiana University is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 11 ] Its schools and programs include the Jacobs School of Music , Kelley School of Business , School of Education , Luddy School of Informatics , O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs , School of Public Health , School of Medicine , School of Nursing , Hutton Honors College , The Media School, and Maurer School of Law .

[ 12 ] The campus also features the Lilly Library , Eskenazi Museum of Art , and the Indiana Memorial Union .

Indiana athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I and are known as the Indiana Hoosiers . The university is a member of the Big Ten Conference . Since it does not have a mascot, all teams are known simply as "Hoosiers". The Indiana Hoosiers have won 24 NCAA national championships and one Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) national championship, in addition to 145 NCAA individual national championships. Titles won by teams include eight by the Hoosiers men's soccer team , a record-setting six straight in men's swimming and diving, five by the Hoosiers men's basketball team , three in men's cross country, one in men's track and field, and one in wrestling.

History [ edit ] Early years [ edit ] Indiana's state government in Corydon established Indiana University on January 20, 1820, as the "State Seminary." [ 13 ] Construction began in 1822 at what is now called Seminary Square Park near the intersection of Second Street and College Avenue. Classes began on April 4, 1825.

[ 14 ] The first professor was Baynard Rush Hall , a Presbyterian minister who taught all of the classes in 1825–27. In the first year, he taught twelve students and was paid $250. Hall was a classicist who focused on Greek and Latin and believed that the study of classical philosophy and languages formed the basis of the best education.

[ 15 ] The first class graduated in 1830. From 1820 to 1889 a legal-political battle was fought between IU and Vincennes University as to which was the legitimate state university.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] In 1829, Andrew Wylie became the first president, serving until his death in 1851. The school's name was changed to "Indiana College" in 1829, and to "Indiana University" in 1838.

[ 18 ] Wylie and David Maxwell, president of the board of trustees, were devout Presbyterians. They spoke of the nonsectarian status of the school but generally hired fellow Presbyterians. Presidents and professors were expected to set a moral example for their charges. After six ministers in a row, the first non-clergyman to become president was the young biology professor David Starr Jordan , in 1885.

[ 19 ] Jordan followed Baptist theologian Lemuel Moss , who resigned after a scandal broke regarding his involvement with a female professor.

Jordan (president 1884–1891) improved the university's finances and public image, doubled its enrollment, and instituted an elective system along the lines of his alma mater, Cornell University .

[ 20 ] Jordan became president of Stanford University in June 1891.

[ 21 ] The growth of the institution was slow. In 1851, IU had nearly a hundred students and seven professors. IU admitted its first woman student, Sarah Parke Morrison, in 1867, making IU the fourth public university to admit women on an equal basis with men .

[ citation needed ] Morrison went on to become the first female professor at IU in 1873.

[ citation needed ] Mathematician Joseph Swain was IU's first Hoosier-born president, 1893 to 1902. He established Kirkwood Hall in 1894; a gymnasium for men in 1896, which later was named Assembly Hall ; and Kirkwood Observatory in 1900. He began construction for Science Hall in 1901. During his presidency, student enrollment increased from 524 to 1,285.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] In 1883, IU awarded its first PhD and played its first intercollegiate sport (baseball), prefiguring the school's future status as a major research institution and a power in collegiate athletics. But another incident that year was of more immediate concern: the original campus in Seminary Square burned to the ground. The college was rebuilt between 1884 and 1908 at the far eastern edge of Bloomington. (Today, the city has expanded eastward, and the "new" campus is once again in the midst of the city.) One challenge was that Bloomington's limited water supply was inadequate for its population of 12,000 and could not handle university expansion. The university commissioned a study that led to building a reservoir for its use.

[ 24 ] 20th century [ edit ] Morrison Hall in June 1942 In 1902, IU enrolled 1203 undergraduates; all but 65 were Hoosiers. There were 82 graduate students including ten from out-of-state. The curriculum emphasized the classics, as befitted a gentleman, and stood in contrast to the service-oriented curriculum at Purdue University , which presented itself as of direct benefit to farmers, industrialists, and businessmen.

[ 25 ] The first extension office of IU was opened in Indianapolis in 1916. In 1920/1921 the School of Music and the School of Commerce and Finance (what later became the Kelley School of Business ) were opened. In the 1940s Indiana University opened extension campuses in Kokomo and Fort Wayne . The Kinsey Institute for sexual research was established in 1945.

During the Great Depression , Indiana University fared much better than most state schools thanks to the entrepreneurship of its young president Herman Wells . He collaborated with Frederick L. Hovde , the president of Purdue; together they approached the Indiana delegation to Congress, indicating their highest priorities. For Wells, it was to build a world-class music school, replacing dilapidated facilities. As a result of these efforts, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built one of the finest facilities in the country. He added matching funds from the state legislature and opened a full-scale fund-raising campaign among alumni and the business community. In 1942, Wells reported that "The past five years have been the greatest single period of expansion in the physical plant of the University in its entire history. In this period 15 new buildings have been constructed." [ 26 ] [ 27 ] In 1960, the IU student body elected Thomas Atkins , an African-American from Elkhart, Indiana , to the position of president of the student body. A throng of white students protested the result by parading around campus waving Confederate flags and allegedly blamed Atkins' victory on a "bunch of beatniks." When the protesters approached the female dormitory on campus, they were met with "a barrage of cosmetic bottles, old shoes, and other objects." [ 28 ] 21st century [ edit ] In April 2002, thousands of IU students and staff, along with Bloomington residents, rioted across the university campus before merging into adjacent city blocks after the IU men's basketball team lost the NCAA Basketball championship game to the University of Maryland Terrapins.

[ 29 ] Rioters caused extensive damage to university buildings and city businesses, and at least 45 people were arrested during the riot.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In March 2014, the U.S. Department of Education 's Office for Civil Rights initiated a federal investigation of Indiana University's Title IX compliance, encompassing more than 450 sexual harassment and violence complaints filed with the university between 2011 and 2015. The complaints involved both students and university staff or faculty. The investigation revealed concerns with timeliness of response, lack of documentation, not preventing retaliation, and the creation of sexually hostile environments at the campus. The investigation further criticized the lack of mandatory sexual harassment, misconduct, and awareness training for staff, as well as the lack of institutional support for its Title IX Coordinator to oversee compliance by the university.

[ 33 ] In February 2016, the university's Associate Dean of Students, Director of Student Ethics, and Title IX Deputy Director, Jason Casares, abruptly resigned his position after sexual assault allegations were made against him by Association for Student Conduct Administration president-elect, and New York University Assistant Director of Global Community Standards, Jill Creighton, during a conference in Fort Worth, Texas in December 2015.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] The Fort Worth Police Department declined to press charges.

[ 37 ] In May 2016, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights initiated another Title IX investigation into Indiana University for failing to hold a university student accountable for an off-campus rape of another student and failing to follow proper Title IX procedures subsequent to the reporting of the incident.  The university also charged the victim a dorm-relocation fee after the suspected rapist continued to harass the victim around her dormitory, which also went without intervention by the university. The victim's case was also handled by former Title IX Director, Jason Casares prior to his resignation amidst sexual harassment and misconduct allegations as the university's student ethics director and Title IX deputy director.

[ 38 ] In November 2023, Indiana University Student Government treasurer Alex Kaswan and co-director of DEI Makiah Pickett resigned after accusing other student government leadership members of antisemitism and failure to represent the cultural whole of the student body. After learning of the accusations and resignations, U.S. Representative Jim Banks sent a letter to university president Pamela Whitten denouncing such conduct, identifying it as a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and threatened the continued federal funding for the university if the conduct was tolerated by the university administration. Accused student body president Aaliyah Raji responded by denouncing both Islamophobia and antisemitism and stating that the student government combats against those issues.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] Also in November 2023, the university attracted national attention when the university barred a faculty member from teaching after alleging that he improperly assisted the Palestine Solidarity Committee, a student group, in reserving a space on campus.

[ 41 ] Shortly thereafter, the university's administrators also cancelled a planned art exhibition by Samia Halaby , a Palestinian-American artist.

[ 42 ] Both of these events occurred after the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel and in the wake of national attention on alleged antisemitism on college and university campuses. They also occurred in the midst of changes to Indiana laws that some perceived as attacking academic freedom . In the spring of 2024, the university's faculty voted no confidence in the Indiana University system president, the Bloomington campus's provost and executive vice president, and the Bloomington campus's vice provost for faculty and academic affairs.

[ 43 ] In February 2024, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights again initiated a federal investigation of the university in response to a complaint of the violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The complaint was filed by Dr. Zachary Marschall and alleged lack of response and complacency by the university administration to an increasing number of anti-Semitic incidents at the campus.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] The complaint also led to additional federal investigations at the University of Wisconsin , Northwestern University , and the office is also conducting parallel investigations of Johns Hopkins University , Harvard University , the University of Michigan , and others.

[ 47 ] Degree cuts (2025) [ edit ] In 2025, the Indiana General Assembly passed a state budget bill mandating that Indiana's public universities phase out programs that produce fewer than 10 students in an associate degree program, 15 students in a bachelor's degree program, 7 students in a master's degree program, and 3 students in a doctorate degree program, unless the institution received permission from the Indiana Commission for Higher Education to continue offering the program. As a result, the university ended over a hundred programs, including: Bachelor's degree: Art History, American Studies, Atmospheric Science, Cognitive Science, Comparative Literature, Dance, Earth Science, Geography, East Asian Studies, Gender Studies, German Studies, Music/Ballet, Religious Studies, Statistics, and numerous foreign languages Master's degree: African Studies, Comparative Literature, Communications and Culture, Journalism, Latin American Studies, Statistics, Theatre and Drama, and numerous foreign languages PhD: African Diaspora Studies, American Studies, Art History, Astrophysics, Chemical Physics, Classical Studies, Comparative Literature,  Gender Studies,  Public Policy,  Theatre and Drama, and numerous foreign languages [ 48 ] Campus [ edit ] The Sample Gates mark the main entrance to the Indiana University Bloomington campus The Indiana University Bloomington campus of 1,933 acres (7.82 km 2 ) includes abundant green space and historic buildings dating to the university's reconstruction in the late nineteenth century. The campus rests on a bed of Indiana Limestone , specifically Salem Limestone and Harrodsburg Limestone , with outcroppings of St. Louis Limestone .

The "Campus River" is a stream flowing through the center of campus. A section of Bloomington's Clear Creek , [ 49 ] it was formerly named the "Jordan River" after David Starr Jordan , Darwinist , ichthyologist , president of IU, and later, of Stanford University .

[ 50 ] The name was changed, along with several campus buildings, in 2020 by the IU trustees due to Jordan's support of eugenics becoming widely known.

[ 51 ] Bloomington was ranked 5th best city for educated millennials by Business Insider .

[ 52 ] College Ranker listed Bloomington as #6 Best College Town to Live in Forever.

[ 53 ] Architecture [ edit ] United States historic place The Old Crescent U.S. National Register of Historic Places U.S. Historic district Maxwell Hall Location Indiana University Campus, Bloomington, Indiana Area 20 acres (8.1 ha) Built 1884 ( 1884 ) Architect Multiple Architectural style Late Victorian, Gothic, Romanesque NRHP reference No.

80000028 [ 54 ] Added to NRHP September 8, 1980 Many of the campus's buildings, especially the older central buildings, are made from Indiana Limestone quarried locally. The Works Progress Administration built much of the campus's core during the Great Depression . Many of the campus's buildings were built and most of its land acquired during the 1950s and 1960s when first soldiers attending under the GI Bill and then the baby boom swelled the university's enrollment from 5,403 in 1940 to 30,368 in 1970. Some buildings on campus underwent similar expansion. As additions were constructed by building onto the outside of existing buildings, exterior surfaces were incorporated into their new interiors, making this expansion visible in the affected buildings' architecture. The Chemistry and Biology buildings serve as examples, where two of the interior walls of the latter's library were clearly constructed as limestone exteriors. The Bryan House is the traditional on-campus home of the university president.

Nine of the oldest buildings are included in a national historic district known as The Old Crescent . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

[ 54 ] They are the Collegiate Gothic style Student Service Building (1906–1908); Indiana University Museum (1905); Richardsonian Romanesque style Maxwell Building (1890, 1907–1908); Owen Hall (1885); Wylie Hall (1885); Kirkwood Hall (1895); Lindley Hall (1903); Gothic Revival style Rose Well House (1908); and Kirkwood Observatory (1900).

[ 55 ] The Sample Gates serve as the entryway to Indiana University's campus and the Old Crescent. It is positioned between Franklin Hall and Bryan Hall.

[ 56 ] After several failed attempts to create an arched entrance to campus, in 1987, Edson Sample provided funding to build the archway based on the 1961 design proposed by Eggers & Higgins .

[ 57 ] The Indiana University Cinema opened in January 2011 in the former University Theatre building, which was built in the 1930s.

The Bloomington campus also has a biology research greenhouse in the Biology Building that is open to the public, one of the highlights of which is a corpse flower ( Amorphophallus titanum ) named Wally.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] Also on campus, the Kirkwood Observatory is open to the public one day a week.

The Mies Building for the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture + Design opened in 2022.

[ 60 ] Its design is based on an unbuilt plan for a fraternity house by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe .

[ 61 ] The 1979 movie Breaking Away was filmed on location in Bloomington and the IU campus. It also featured a reenactment of the annual Little 500 bicycle race. The IU campus also has trails that many utilize for biking and running. The trails in Bloomington and nearby areas total nearly 1,200 miles (1,900 km).

Indiana Memorial Union [ edit ] Main article: Indiana Memorial Union The Campus River crosses the Dunn Meadow in front of the Indiana Memorial Union The over 500,000-square-foot (46,000 m 2 ) Indiana Memorial Union (IMU) is the second-largest student union in the world.

[ 142 ] The system is the 14th largest library in North America by volumes held.

[ 143 ] Herman B Wells Library [ edit ] IU's Herman B Wells Library holds more than 4.6 million volumes.

[ 144 ] Before a ceremony in June 2005, when it was renamed for IU's former president and chancellor , this building was simply called the Main Library.

[ 145 ] The architectural firm Eggers & Higgins designed the largely windowless, limestone paneled library, whose construction began in 1966 and was completed in 1969.

[ 146 ] The building contains eleven floors in the East Tower (research collection) and five floors in the West Tower (the undergraduate core collection). In 2014 the first floors of both towers were renovated and reintroduced as the Learning Commons and Scholars' Commons. The library is also home to Indiana University Press and the University Graduate School. It is the former home of the Information and Library Science Department, which is now hosted by Luddy Hall.

An oft-repeated urban legend holds that the library is sinking because when it was built, engineers failed to take into account the weight of all the books that would occupy the building. An article in the Indiana Daily Student newspaper debunks this myth, stating, among other things, that the building rests on a 94 ft (28.6 m) thick limestone bedrock.

[ 147 ] Branch libraries [ edit ] In addition to IU's main library, the Bloomington Libraries support more than twenty additional libraries: [ 148 ] Archives of African American Music & Culture Archives of Traditional Music Black Film Center/Archive Business/SPEA Information Commons (Library for the Kelley School of Business and the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs ) The Science Library Education Library, located within the Wendell E.

Klotman founded the repository when it became apparent that rare and valuable films created by and about African Americans were being lost due to lack of preservation and inadequate resources.

[ 150 ] The BFC/A has an extensive collection that includes films on various physical media, posters of numerous sizes for films distributed throughout the world, photographs and film stills, and manuscripts of filmmakers and scholars. Although the materials are not available for circulation or distribution, the archive has rooms for viewing films and utilizing materials.
