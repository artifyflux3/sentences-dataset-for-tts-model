Environmental soil science addresses both the fundamental and applied aspects of the field including: buffers and surface water quality, vadose zone functions, septic drain field site assessment and function, land treatment of wastewater , stormwater , erosion control, soil contamination with metals and pesticides, remediation of contaminated soils, restoration of wetlands , soil degradation , nutrient management , movement of viruses and bacteria in soils and waters, bioremediation , application of molecular biology and genetic engineering to development of soil microbes that can degrade hazardous pollutants, land use , global warming , acid rain , and the study of anthropogenic soils, such as terra preta . Much of the research done in environmental soil science is produced through the use of models.
