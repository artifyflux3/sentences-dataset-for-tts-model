[ 1 ] He is the author of Bankers and Pashas , Revolution in Time , The Unbound Prometheus , The Wealth and Poverty of Nations , and Dynasties .

[ 2 ] Such works have received both praise for detailed retelling of economic history, as well as scorn on charges of Eurocentrism , a charge he openly embraced, arguing that an explanation for an economic miracle that happened originally only in Europe must of necessity be a Eurocentric analysis.

Career [ edit ] Landes earned a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1953, after a B.A.

from City College of New York in 1942.

[ 3 ] While he waited his call-up to serve in World War II, Landes studied cryptanalysis . He was assigned to the Signal Corps, where he worked on deciphering Japanese coded messages.

[ 4 ] Historian Niall Ferguson called him one of his "most revered mentors".

[ 5 ] Landes was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , [ 6 ] the United States National Academy of Sciences , [ 7 ] and the American Philosophical Society .

[ 8 ] His son Richard Landes is a historian and author.
