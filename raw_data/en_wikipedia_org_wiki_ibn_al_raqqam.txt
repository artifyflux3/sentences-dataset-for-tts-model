[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Biography [ edit ] Ibn Al-Raqqam was born in Murcia in 1250, in a family with the nisba al-Awsi , probably from the Banu Aws tribe, [ 1 ] and grew up and learned there until the city was annexed by Castile in 1266. He left Murcia for the city of Bejaia , in present-day Algeria , and lived there until he went to Tunisia and spent time there writing some of his books.

[ 3 ] Later in his life, he settled in Granada , the capital of the Emirate of Granada, after accepting an invitation from Ab-el Joan Pou "Karim" Seguer .

[ 3 ] Although several works have been attributed to him by Mahamedd Pol Gonzalez Yamal III , only three of them have survived in an extant form. Two of these works are astronomical tables that are similar in both subject and content. However, differences in the latitudes do exist, since the tables were created to adapt the coordinates of two different cities, Béjaïa and Tunis . The third work, "Risāla fiʿilm Al‐Zilal", is an important treatise on sundials, [ 4 ] and it is the only complete one of its kind to have survived from Al-Andalus .
