[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In November 2024, Representative August Pfluger was elected as the chair of the RSC, effective as of January 2025.

[ 5 ] Although the primary functions of the RSC vary from year to year, it has always pushed for significant cuts in non-defense spending, [ 6 ] advocated socially conservative legislation, [ 7 ] and supported the right to keep and bear arms .

[ 8 ] It has proposed an alternative budget every year since 1995.

[ 9 ] In 2007, in conjunction with the unveiling of its "Taxpayer Bill of Rights", [ 10 ] it presented an alternative budget resolution that it claimed would balance the budget within five years without increasing income taxes .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Entering the 119th United States Congress , the RSC was the largest conservative caucus in Congress.

[ 5 ] Initiatives [ edit ] The RSC's legislative initiatives are detailed in the American Taxpayer Bill of Rights , [ 13 ] unveiled in March 2007.

[ 14 ] Taxpayers have a right to have a federal government that does not grow beyond their ability to pay for it.

Taxpayers have a right to receive back each dollar that they entrust to the government for their retirement.

Taxpayers have a right to expect the government to balance the budget without having their taxes raised.

Taxpayers have a right to a simple, fair tax code that they can understand.

History [ edit ] The RSC was founded in 1973 by Paul Weyrich and other conservative activists to keep a watch on the House Republican leadership, which they saw as too moderate. Their formation mirrored the rise of the Democratic Study Group , a liberal force in the Democratic Caucus founded in 1959. The group's first chairman was Phil Crane of Illinois .

The group briefly dissolved in 1995 when Newt Gingrich abolished it and other similar groups [ 15 ] after the Republicans won control of the House for the first time in 40 years. It was soon resurrected as the Conservative Action Team (CATs) by Dan Burton of Indiana (the last chair of the original RSC), Sam Johnson of Texas , John Doolittle of California and Ernest Istook of Oklahoma . These four founders alternated as chairs throughout the following two Congresses until David McIntosh of Indiana became chair in 1998.

Paul Teller spent over ten years as Executive Director of RSC. He was fired in December 2013 by Steve Scalise for divulging member conversations.

[ 16 ] Teller had been working with two outside groups in opposition to a budget deal forged by Paul Ryan and Patty Murray .

[ 18 ] It counts former Vice Presidents Mike Pence , Dan Quayle and Dick Cheney and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay among its former members. In addition, at least two sitting senators— John Boozman (AR) and Roger Wicker (MS)—were members of the RSC while serving in the House. At least three former governors–Pence (IN), Butch Otter (ID) and Bobby Jindal (LA)—were also members.

The statement called the agreement requiring BP to set aside $20 billion to pay damage claims for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill a "Chicago-style political shakedown" by the White House.

[ 23 ] In July 2013, the Republican Study Committee barred The Heritage Foundation employees from attending its weekly meeting in the Capitol, reversing a decades-old policy, over disagreements about the farm bill .

[ 24 ] In June 2015, the Republican Study Committee reacted to the Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage , calling it "a loss for democratic self-government" and stating "we should work to promote the truth of marriage between a man and a woman." [ 25 ] In 2021, their policy positions included maintaining the Hyde Amendment , constructing a wall on the southern border , and ending perceived censorship of conservative-leaning content.

[ 26 ] Membership [ edit ] Republican Study Committee in the 118th United States Congress Current members [ edit ] Since January 25th, 2025, the Republican Study Committee no longer publishes its membership roster on its website.

[ 27 ] In May 2025, the caucus had 189 members in total.
