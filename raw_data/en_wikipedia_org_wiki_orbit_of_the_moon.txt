The [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") orbits [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") in the [prograde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_and_prograde_motion "Retrograde and prograde motion") direction and completes one [revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period") relative to the [Vernal Equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_Equinox "March Equinox") and the fixed stars in about 27.3 days (a [tropical month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_month "Tropical month") and [sidereal month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_month "Sidereal month")), and one revolution relative to the Sun in about 29.5 days (a [synodic month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_month "Synodic month")).

On average, the [distance to the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance "Lunar distance") is about 384,400 km (238,900 mi) from Earth's centre, which corresponds to about 60 Earth radii or 1.28 light-seconds.

Earth and the Moon orbit about their [barycentre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentre "Barycentre") (common [centre of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_of_mass "Centre of mass")), which lies about 4,670 km (2,900 miles) from Earth's centre (about 73% of its radius), forming a satellite system called the [Earth–Moon system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93Moon_system "Earth–Moon system"). With a mean [orbital speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed "Orbital speed") around the barycentre of 1.022 km/s (2,290 mph), the Moon covers a distance of approximately its diameter, or about half a degree on the [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere"), each hour.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-9)

The Moon differs from most [regular satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_moon "Regular moon") of other planets in that its [orbital plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy) "Orbital plane (astronomy)") is closer to the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic") plane instead of its [primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_(astronomy) "Primary (astronomy)")'s (in this case, Earth's) equatorial plane. The Moon's orbital plane is [inclined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination "Orbital inclination") by about 5.1° with respect to the ecliptic plane, whereas Earth's equatorial plane is tilted by about 23.4° with respect to the ecliptic plane.

The properties of the orbit described in this section are approximations. The Moon's orbit around Earth has many variations ([perturbations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy) "Perturbation (astronomy)")) due to the gravitational attraction of the Sun and planets, the study of which ([lunar theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_theory "Lunar theory")) has a long history.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-MG-10)

Moon's orbit and sizes of Earth and Moon to scale.

The orbit of the Moon is a nearly circular [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") about Earth (the semimajor and semiminor axes are 384,400 km and 383,800 km, respectively: a difference of only 0.16%). The [equation of the ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse#Equation "Ellipse") yields an [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity "Orbital eccentricity") of 0.0549 and [perigee](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/perigee "wikt:perigee") and [apogee](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/apogee "wikt:apogee") distances of 363,300 km (225744 mi) and 405,507 km (251970 mi) respectively (a difference of 11.6%).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Since nearer objects appear larger, the Moon's apparent size changes as it moves toward and away from an observer on Earth. An event called a "[supermoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon "Supermoon")" occurs when the full Moon is closest to Earth (perigee). The largest possible apparent diameter of the Moon is some 12% larger than the smallest (cf perigee versus apogee distances); the apparent area is then 25% greater and so is the amount of light it reflects toward Earth.

The variance in the Moon's orbital distance corresponds with changes in its tangential and angular speeds, per [Kepler's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_second_law "Kepler's second law"). The mean angular movement relative to an imaginary observer at the Earth–Moon barycentre is 13.176° per day to the east ([J2000.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2000.0 "J2000.0") epoch).

The Moon's [elongation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongation_(astronomy) "Elongation (astronomy)") is its angular distance east of the Sun at any time. At new moon, it is zero and the Moon is said to be in [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy_and_astrology) "Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)"). At full moon, the elongation is 180° and it is said to be in [opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_(astronomy) "Opposition (astronomy)"). In both cases, the Moon is in [syzygy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_(astronomy) "Syzygy (astronomy)"), that is, the Sun, Moon and Earth are nearly aligned. When elongation is either 90° or 270°, the Moon is said to be in [quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_(astronomy) "Quadrature (astronomy)").

[Apsidal precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession "Apsidal precession")—The major axis of Moon's elliptical orbit rotates by one complete revolution once every 8.85 years in the same direction as the Moon's rotation itself. This image looks upwards depicting Earth's geographic south pole and the elliptical shape of the Moon's orbit (vastly exaggerated from its almost circular shape to make the precession evident) is rotating from white to greyer orbits.

Earth's lunar orbit perturbations

The orientation of the orbit is not fixed in space but rotates over time. This orbital precession is called [apsidal precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession "Apsidal precession") and is the rotation of the Moon's orbit within the orbital plane, i.e. the axes of the ellipse change direction. The lunar orbit's [major axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_axis "Major axis") – the longest diameter of the orbit, joining its nearest and farthest points, the [perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perigee "Perigee") and [apogee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee "Apogee"), respectively – makes one complete revolution every 8.85 Earth years, or 3,232.6054 days, as it rotates slowly in the same direction as the Moon itself (direct motion) – meaning precesses eastward by 360°. The Moon's apsidal precession is distinct from the [nodal precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession "Nodal precession") of its orbital plane and [axial precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession "Axial precession") of the moon itself.

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Earth-Moon.PNG/250px-Earth-Moon.PNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Earth-Moon.PNG)

[Orbital inclination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination "Orbital inclination")—the Moon's orbit is inclined by 5.14° to the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic"). This shows the specific configuration at major northern [lunistice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunistice "Lunistice"). At such times, the Earth's north pole is toward the Moon and the Moon is north of the ecliptic.

The mean inclination of the lunar orbit to the [ecliptic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_of_the_ecliptic "Plane of the ecliptic") is 5.145°. Theoretical considerations show that the present inclination relative to the ecliptic plane arose by tidal evolution from an earlier near-Earth orbit with a fairly constant inclination relative to Earth's equator.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-11) It would require an inclination of this earlier orbit of about 10° to the equator to produce a present inclination of 5° to the ecliptic. It is thought that originally the inclination to the equator was near zero, but it could have been increased to 10° through the influence of [planetesimals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetesimal "Planetesimal") passing near the Moon while falling to the Earth.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-12) If this had not happened, the Moon would now lie much closer to the ecliptic and eclipses would be much more frequent.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-13)

The rotational axis of the Moon is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, so the lunar equator is not in the plane of its orbit, but is inclined to it by a constant value of 6.688° (this is the [obliquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obliquity "Obliquity")). As was discovered by [Jacques Cassini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cassini "Jacques Cassini") in 1722, the rotational axis of the Moon precesses with the same rate as its orbital plane, but is 180° out of phase _(see [Cassini's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%27s\_Laws "Cassini's Laws"))_. Therefore, the angle between the ecliptic and the lunar equator is always 1.543°, even though the rotational axis of the Moon is not fixed with respect to the stars.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-14) It also means that when the Moon is farthest north of the ecliptic, the centre of the part seen from Earth is about 6.7° south of the lunar equator and the south pole is visible, whereas when the Moon is farthest south of the ecliptic the centre of the visible part is 6.7° north of the equator and the north pole is visible. This is called [libration in latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libration_in_latitude "Libration in latitude").

The nodes are points at which the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic. The Moon crosses the same node every 27.2122 days, an interval called the _[draconic month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draconic\_month "Draconic month")_ or _draconitic month_. The line of nodes, the intersection between the two respective planes, has a [retrograde motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion "Retrograde motion"): for an observer on Earth, it rotates westward along the ecliptic with a period of 18.6 years or 19.3549° per year. When viewed from the celestial north, the nodes move clockwise around Earth, opposite to Earth's own spin and its revolution around the Sun. An [eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse "Eclipse") of the Moon or Sun can occur when the nodes align with the Sun, roughly every 173.3 days. Lunar orbit inclination also determines eclipses; shadows cross when nodes coincide with full and new moon when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align in three dimensions.

In effect, this means that the "[tropical year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year")" on the Moon is only 347 days long. This is called the [draconic year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draconic_year "Draconic year") or eclipse year. The "seasons" on the Moon fit into this period. For about half of this draconic year, the Sun is north of the lunar equator (but at most 1.543°), and for the other half, it is south of the lunar equator. The effect of these seasons, however, is minor compared to the difference between lunar night and lunar day. At the lunar poles, instead of usual lunar days and nights of about 15 Earth days, the Sun will be "up" for 173 days as it will be "down"; polar sunrise and sunset takes 18 days each year. "Up" here means that the centre of the Sun is above the horizon.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-15) Lunar polar sunrises and sunsets occur around the time of eclipses (solar or lunar). For example, at the [Solar eclipse of March 9, 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_March_9,_2016 "Solar eclipse of March 9, 2016"), the Moon was near its descending node, and the Sun was near the point in the sky where the equator of the Moon crosses the ecliptic. When the Sun reaches that point, the centre of the Sun sets at the lunar north pole and rises at the lunar south pole.

The [solar eclipse of September 1 of the same year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_September_1,_2016 "Solar eclipse of September 1, 2016"), the Moon was near its ascending node, and the Sun was near the point in the sky where the equator of the Moon crosses the ecliptic. When the Sun reaches that point, the centre of the Sun rises at the lunar north pole and sets at the lunar south pole.

#### Inclination to the equator and lunar standstill

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbit_of_the_Moon&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Inclination to the equator and lunar standstill")]

Every 18.6 years, the angle between the Moon's orbit and Earth's [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator") reaches a maximum of 28°36′, the sum of Earth's [equatorial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt "Axial tilt") (23°27′) and the Moon's [orbital inclination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination "Orbital inclination") (5°09′) to the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic"). This is called _major [lunar standstill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar\_standstill "Lunar standstill")_. Around this time, the Moon's [declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination "Declination") will vary from −28°36′ to +28°36′. Conversely, 9.3 years later, the angle between the Moon's orbit and Earth's equator reaches its minimum of 18°20′. This is called a _minor lunar standstill_. The last minor lunar standstill was in October 2015. At that time the descending node was lined up with the equinox (the point in the sky having [right ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension "Right ascension") zero and [declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination "Declination") zero). The nodes are moving west by about 19° per year. The Sun crosses a given node about 20 days earlier each year.

When the inclination of the Moon's orbit to the Earth's equator is at its minimum of 18°20′, the centre of the Moon's disk will be above the [horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon "Horizon") every day from latitudes less than 70°43' (90° − 18°20' – 57' parallax) north or south. When the inclination is at its maximum of 28°36', the centre of the Moon's disk will be above the horizon every day only from latitudes less than 60°27' (90° − 28°36' – 57' parallax) north or south.

At [higher latitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_regions_of_Earth "Polar regions of Earth"), there will be a period of at least one day each month when the Moon does not rise, but there will also be a period of at least one day each month when the Moon does not set. This is similar to the [seasonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season") behaviour of the Sun, but with a period of 27.2 days instead of 365 days. Note that a point on the Moon can actually be visible when it is about 34 [arc minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc "Minute and second of arc") below the horizon, due to [atmospheric refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction "Atmospheric refraction").

Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit with respect to the Earth's equator, the Moon is above the horizon at the [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole "North Pole") and [South Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole "South Pole") for almost two weeks every month, even though the Sun is below the horizon for six months at a time. The period from moonrise to moonrise at the poles is a [tropical month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_month "Tropical month"), about 27.3 days, quite close to the sidereal period. When the Sun is the furthest below the horizon ([winter solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Solstice "Winter Solstice")), the Moon will be full when it is at its highest point. When the Moon is in [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation) "Gemini (constellation)") it will be above the horizon at the North Pole, and when it is in [Sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation) "Sagittarius (constellation)") it will be up at the South Pole.

The Moon's light is used by [zooplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooplankton "Zooplankton") in the Arctic when the Sun is below the horizon for months[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-16) and must have been helpful to the animals that lived in Arctic and Antarctic regions when the climate was warmer.

History of observations and measurements
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbit_of_the_Moon&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: History of observations and measurements")]

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Moon_paths.gif/250px-Moon_paths.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moon_paths.gif)

The apparent trajectory of the Moon in the sky seen from Earth each night is like a wide ellipse, although the path depends on the time of the year and [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude").

About [1000 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000s_BC_(decade) "1000s BC (decade)"), the [Babylonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon "Babylon") were the first human civilization known to have kept a consistent record of lunar observations. Clay tablets from that period, which have been found in Iraq, are inscribed with [cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform "Cuneiform") writing recording the times and dates of moonrises and moonsets, the stars that the Moon passed close by, and the time differences between rising and setting of both the Sun and the Moon around the time of a [full moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon "Full moon"). [Babylonian astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy "Babylonian astronomy") discovered the three main periods of the Moon's motion and used [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis "Data analysis") to build lunar calendars that extended well into the future.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-MG-10) This use of detailed, systematic observations to make predictions based on experimental data may be classified as the first [scientific study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method") in human history. However, the Babylonians seem to have lacked any geometric or physical interpretation of their data, and they could not predict future lunar eclipses (though "warnings" were issued before likely eclipse times).

[Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") astronomers were the first to introduce and analyze [mathematical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") of the motion of objects in the sky. [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") described lunar motion by using a well-defined geometric model of [epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle "Epicycle") and [evection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evection "Evection").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-MG-10)

[Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") was the first to develop a complete theory of motion, [Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics "Newtonian mechanics"). The observations of the lunar motion were the main test of his theory.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-MG-10)

There are several different periods associated with the lunar orbit.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-17) The [sidereal month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_month "Sidereal month") is the time it takes to make one complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars. It is about 27.32 days. The [synodic month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_month "Synodic month") is the time it takes the Moon to reach the same visual [phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase "Lunar phase"). This varies notably throughout the year,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-AA-18) but averages around 29.53 days. The synodic period is longer than the sidereal period because the Earth–Moon system moves in its orbit around the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") during each sidereal month, hence a longer period is required to achieve a similar alignment of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. The [anomalistic month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalistic_month "Anomalistic month") is the time between perigees and is about 27.55 days. The Earth–Moon separation determines the strength of the lunar tide raising force.

The [draconic month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draconic_month "Draconic month") is the time from [ascending node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_node "Orbital node") to ascending node. The time between two successive passes of the same ecliptic longitude is called the [tropical month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_month "Tropical month"). The latter periods are slightly different from the sidereal month.

The average length of a [calendar month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month "Month") (a twelfth of a year) is about 30.4 days. This is not a lunar period, though the calendar month is historically related to the visible lunar phase.

The Moon's distance from [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") and [Moon phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase "Lunar phase") in 2014.

Moon phases: 0 (1)—[new moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_moon "New moon"), 0.25—first quarter, 0.5—[full moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon "Full moon"), 0.75—last quarter

The [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") attraction that the Moon exerts on Earth is the cause of [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide "Tide") in both the ocean and the solid Earth; the Sun has a smaller tidal influence. The solid Earth responds quickly to any change in the tidal forcing, the distortion taking the form of an ellipsoid with the high points roughly beneath the Moon and on the opposite side of Earth. This is a result of the high speed of [seismic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_waves "Seismic waves") within the solid Earth.

However the speed of [seismic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_wave "P wave") is not infinite and, together with the effect of energy loss within the Earth, this causes a slight delay between the passage of the maximum forcing due to the Moon across and the maximum Earth tide. As the Earth rotates faster than the Moon travels around its orbit, this small angle produces a gravitational torque which slows the Earth and accelerates the Moon in its orbit.

In the case of the ocean tides, the speed of tidal waves in the ocean[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-19) is far slower than the speed of the Moon's tidal forcing. As a result, the ocean is never in near equilibrium with the tidal forcing. Instead, the forcing generates the long ocean waves which propagate around the ocean basins until eventually losing their energy through turbulence, either in the deep ocean or on shallow continental shelves.

Although the ocean's response is the more complex of the two, it is possible to split the ocean tides into a small ellipsoid term which affects the Moon plus a second term which has no effect. The ocean's ellipsoid term also slows the Earth and accelerates the Moon, but because the ocean dissipates so much tidal energy, the present ocean tides have an order of magnitude greater effect than the solid Earth tides.

Because of the tidal torque, caused by the ellipsoids, some of Earth's angular (or rotational) momentum is gradually being transferred to the rotation of the Earth–Moon pair around their mutual centre of mass, called the barycentre. See [tidal acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_acceleration "Tidal acceleration") for a more detailed description.

This slightly greater orbital angular momentum causes the Earth–Moon distance to increase at approximately 38 millimetres per year.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-20)[Conservation of angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_angular_momentum "Conservation of angular momentum") means that Earth's axial rotation is gradually slowing, and because of this its day lengthens by approximately 24 microseconds every year (excluding [glacial rebound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound#Effects "Post-glacial rebound")). Both figures are valid only for the current configuration of the continents. [Tidal rhythmites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythmites "Rhythmites") from 620 million years ago show that, over hundreds of millions of years, the Moon receded at an average rate of 22 mm (0.87 in) per year (2200 km or 0.56% or the Earth-moon distance per hundred million years) and the day lengthened at an average rate of 12 microseconds per year (or 20 minutes per hundred million years), both about half of their current values. From 650 to 280 million years ago, through two intervals where Earth's rotation decelerated, the moon moved approximately 20,000 km further away, which increased the daylength on Earth by 2.2 hours.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-21)

The present high rate may be due to near [resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance "Resonance") between natural ocean frequencies and tidal frequencies.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-22) Another explanation is that in the past the Earth rotated much faster, a day possibly lasting only 9 hours on the early Earth. The resulting tidal waves in the ocean would have then been much shorter and it would have been more difficult for the long wavelength tidal forcing to excite the short wavelength tides.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-23)

The Moon is gradually receding from Earth into a higher orbit. This has resulted in the length of a [anomalistic month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalistic_month "Anomalistic month") having increased from 20 days to today's 27.55 days over the course of 3.2 billion years.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-m870-24) Calculations suggest that this would continue for about 50 billion years.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-25)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-26) By that time, Earth and the Moon would be in a mutual spin–orbit resonance or [tidal locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking "Tidal locking"), in which the Moon will orbit Earth in about 47 days (currently 27 days), and both the Moon and Earth would rotate around their axes in the same time, always facing each other with the same side. This has already happened to the Moon—the same side always faces Earth—and is also slowly happening to the Earth. However, the slowdown of Earth's rotation is not occurring fast enough for the rotation to lengthen to a month before other effects change the situation: approximately 2.3 billion years from now, the increase of the Sun's [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation") will have caused Earth's oceans to evaporate,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-27) removing the bulk of the tidal friction and acceleration.

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Lunar_libration_with_phase_Oct_2007_HD.gif/250px-Lunar_libration_with_phase_Oct_2007_HD.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lunar_libration_with_phase_Oct_2007_HD.gif)

Animation of the Moon as it cycles through its phases. The apparent wobbling of the Moon is known as [libration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libration "Libration").

The Moon is in [synchronous rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_rotation "Synchronous rotation"), meaning that it keeps the same face toward Earth at all times. This synchronous rotation is only true on average because the Moon's orbit has a definite eccentricity. As a result, the angular velocity of the Moon varies as it orbits Earth and hence is not always equal to the Moon's rotational velocity which is more constant. When the Moon is at its perigee, its orbital motion is faster than its rotation. At that time the Moon is a bit ahead in its orbit with respect to its rotation about its axis, and this creates a perspective effect which allows us to see up to eight degrees of longitude of its eastern (right) [far side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon "Far side of the Moon"). Conversely, when the Moon reaches its apogee, its orbital motion is slower than its rotation, revealing eight degrees of longitude of its western (left) far side. This is referred to as _optical libration in longitude_.

The Moon's axis of rotation is inclined by in total 6.7° relative to the normal to the plane of the ecliptic. This leads to a similar perspective effect in the north–south direction that is referred to as _optical libration in latitude_, which allows one to see almost 7° of latitude beyond the pole on the far side. Finally, because the Moon is only about 60 Earth radii away from Earth's centre of mass, an observer at the equator who observes the Moon throughout the night moves laterally by one Earth diameter. This gives rise to a _diurnal libration_, which allows one to view an additional one degree's worth of lunar longitude. For the same reason, observers at both of Earth's [geographical poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_pole "Geographical pole") would be able to see one additional degree's worth of libration in latitude.

Besides these "optical librations" caused by the change in perspective for an observer on Earth, there are also "physical librations" which are actual [nutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation "Nutation") of the direction of the pole of rotation of the Moon in space: but these are very small.

Path of Earth and Moon around Sun
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbit_of_the_Moon&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Path of Earth and Moon around Sun")]

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Moon_trajectory1.svg/500px-Moon_trajectory1.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moon_trajectory1.svg)

Section of Earth's and Moon's trajectories around the Sun[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-shapes3-28)

When viewed from the north [celestial pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_pole "Celestial pole") (that is, from the approximate direction of the star [Polaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris "Polaris")) the Moon orbits Earth [anticlockwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticlockwise "Anticlockwise") and Earth orbits the Sun anticlockwise, and the Moon and Earth rotate on their own axes anticlockwise.

The [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corkscrew_rule "Corkscrew rule") can be used to indicate the direction of the angular velocity. If the thumb of the right hand points to the north celestial pole, its fingers curl in the direction that the Moon orbits Earth, Earth orbits the Sun, and the Moon and Earth rotate on their own axes.

In representations of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), it is common[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] to draw the trajectory of Earth from the point of view of the Sun, and the trajectory of the Moon from the point of view of Earth. This could give the impression that the Moon orbits Earth in such a way that sometimes it goes backwards when viewed from the Sun's perspective.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][_[relevant?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing\_better\_articles#Stay\_on\_topic "Wikipedia:Writing better articles")_] However, because the orbital velocity of the Moon around Earth (1 km/s) is small compared to the orbital velocity of Earth about the Sun (30 km/s), this never happens. There are no rearward loops in the Moon's solar orbit.

Considering the [Earth–Moon system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93Moon_system "Earth–Moon system") as a [binary planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_planet "Binary planet"), its centre of gravity is within Earth, about 4,671 km (2,902 miles)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-Seidelmann1-29) or 73.3% of the Earth's radius from the centre of the Earth. This centre of gravity remains on the line between the centres of the Earth and Moon as the Earth completes its diurnal rotation. The path of the Earth–Moon system in its solar orbit is defined as the movement of this mutual centre of gravity around the Sun. Consequently, Earth's centre veers inside and outside the solar orbital path during each synodic month as the Moon moves in its orbit around the common centre of gravity.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-convex-30)

The Sun's gravitational effect on the Moon is more than twice that of Earth's on the Moon; consequently, the Moon's trajectory is always convex[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-convex-30)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-31) (as seen when looking Sunward at the entire Sun–Earth–Moon system from a great distance outside Earth–Moon solar orbit), and is nowhere concave (from the same perspective) or looped.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-shapes3-28)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#cite_note-convex-30) That is, the region enclosed[_[where?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming\_conventions\_(geographic\_names) "Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)")_] by the Moon's orbit of the Sun is a [convex set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set "Convex set").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
