( November 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In physics , semiclassical refers to a theory in which one part of a system is described quantum mechanically , whereas the other is treated classically . For example, external fields will be constant, or when changing will be classically described. In general, it incorporates a development in powers of the Planck constant , resulting in the classical physics of power 0, and the first nontrivial approximation to the power of (−1). In this case, there is a clear link between the quantum-mechanical system and the associated semi-classical and classical approximations, as it is similar in appearance to the transition from physical optics to geometric optics .

History [ edit ] Max Planck was the first to introduce the idea of quanta of energy in 1900 while studying black-body radiation . In 1906, he was also the first to write that quantum theory should replicate classical mechanics at some limit, particularly if the Planck constant h were infinitesimal.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] With this idea he showed that Planck's law for thermal radiation leads to the Rayleigh–Jeans law , the classical prediction (valid for large wavelength ).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Instances [ edit ] Some examples of a semiclassical approximation include: WKB approximation : electrons in classical external electromagnetic fields .

semiclassical gravity : quantum field theory within a classical curved gravitational background (see general relativity ).

quantum chaos : quantization of classical chaotic systems.

magnetic properties of materials and astrophysical bodies under the effect of large magnetic fields (see for example De Haas–Van Alphen effect ) quantum field theory : only Feynman diagrams with at most a single closed loop (see for example one-loop Feynman diagram ) are considered, which corresponds to the powers of the Planck constant.
