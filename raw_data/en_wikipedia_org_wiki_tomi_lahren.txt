[ 31 ] She has said that she is a commentator, not a journalist, [ 32 ] and that her shows are not about presenting news neutrally, but about commentary and "mak[ing] the news".

[ 19 ] Lahren has been described as an "anti-feminist who admires strong women." [ 19 ] She has said that while she does not consider herself a feminist, [ 33 ] she believes in women's empowerment and looks up to various women from both the political left and the political right.

[ 19 ] In March 2017, Lahren said she was pro-abortion rights , sparking criticism from a number of anti-abortion writers.

[ 34 ] TheBlaze owner Glenn Beck, among others, noted that Lahren had previously publicly said she was anti-abortion, in addition to numerous other inconsistencies on other issues.

[ 28 ] Soon thereafter, Lahren told Playboy that she had always supported abortion rights as a matter of national law but was personally against abortion.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] While in college, Lahren wrote a feature for the Las Vegas Review-Journal about a classmate who had turned to stripping to support herself.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] Lahren is also in favor of same-sex marriage .

[ 39 ] In June 2020, she supported Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch 's vote and majority opinion in the combined cases of Bostock v. Clayton County , Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda , and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , ruling that businesses cannot fire LGBTQ people for their sexuality or gender identity. Lahren stated, "You can be Christian, conservative, and a proud Trump supporter and believe people should not be fired for who they love. Conservative doesn't come in one flavor, one race, one religion, one gender or one sexuality ... and I won't sit by quietly and allow certain self-righteous and self-appointed and anointed conservative thought policemen make that decree." [ 40 ] Some of Lahren's commentaries on race issues have been described by critics as racist or race-baiting, which she disputes.

[ 4 ] In July 2016, Lahren posted a tweet comparing the Black Lives Matter movement to the Ku Klux Klan .

[ 19 ] Tens of thousands of people signed a Change.org petition in response asking for her to be fired from TheBlaze .

[ 41 ] The petition was unsuccessful. In August 2016, she released a video criticizing NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick , who had been protesting police brutality by kneeling during the playing of the national anthem before football games .

[ 4 ] In August 2018, at a political rally for Kelli Ward , Lahren warned against voters electing 'RINOs' ( Republicans in name only ) into Congress; the term was applied to Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake .

[ 42 ] Lahren was criticized as cruel and disrespectful as McCain was in very poor health; that day he discontinued medical treatment for brain cancer, and he died the next day. Many people have criticized Lahren for her behavior including former Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren .

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] In November 2018, Lahren said that the "highlight" of her Thanksgiving had been watching United States Border Patrol fire tear gas at migrants trying to illegally cross over the Mexico–United States border.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] In December 2018, she ran a Fox Nation segment focusing on how members of a Central American migrant caravan that had been stopped in Mexico that year were carrying diseases; she listed several unconfirmed cases of HIV/AIDS and chickenpox to support the claim.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] Personal life In June 2019, Lahren announced on Instagram that she was engaged to her boyfriend, Brandon Fricke.

[ 49 ] Their engagement was called off in 2020.

[ 50 ] In early 2021, Lahren was linked to fellow Fox broadcaster and former Major League Baseball catcher J. P. Arencibia .

[ 51 ] On September 25, 2021, Lahren confirmed that she was engaged on an episode of Justice with Judge Jeanine . They were married October 21, 2022.

[ 52 ] Lahren owns "a chihuahua mutt named Kota." [ 12 ] In April 2020, Lahren moved from Los Angeles to Nashville .

[ 53 ] Lahren is an avid runner, and has a tattoo of a wheat leaf and South Dakota's state flower (the pulsatilla ) on the back of her neck, as well as a tattoo of "roman numeral 11 with a semicolon", since eleven is her lucky number.
