The name reflects its location at a bend in the Danube ( Celtic root lentos = "bendable"). This strategic position on the river made it the first Roman fort in the Noricum region, protecting a vital transportation route.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The name "Linz" in its present form was first documented in 799.

[ 3 ] Linz was mentioned as a fortified city in 1236 and was granted city rights in 1324.

[ 5 ] Johannes Kepler spent several years of his life in the city teaching mathematics.

[ 6 ] On 15 May 1618 he discovered Kepler's laws of planetary motion . The local public university Johannes Kepler University Linz is named for him.

[ 7 ] The Oeconomische Encyclopädie (also simply known as the Krünitz ), with the entry about Linz being written around 1800, [ 8 ] describes the city as well built and fortified and its economy as growing, partially because of its location on the Danube and the connection to routes to Hungary and Vienna. At that time, the city had a population of 16,000–17,000. Major industries were the productions of gunpowder, iron, steel, salt, and firewood. The wool industry was particularly important: a wool manufactory, established in 1672, was the biggest in then-Austria, or rather, the Austrian states . It was nationalized in 1754. Plans, made in 1770, of selling it to a tradesman were canceled. Although it kept production going, by the end of the 18th century its golden era was over. When the Krünitz entry was written, the manufactuary had a yearly revenue of 1.5 million Gulden and was generating 100,000 in profit and was employing around 30,000 people.

[ 9 ] Anton Bruckner spent the years between 1855 and 1868 working as a local composer and organist in the Old Cathedral, Linz . The Brucknerhaus is named for him.

[ 10 ] Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn (an Austrian town near the German border) and moved to Linz during his childhood. The notorious Holocaust bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann also spent his youth in Linz. Until the end of his life, Hitler considered Linz to be his hometown.

[ 11 ] Hitler effected the founding of the Bruckner Symphony Orchestra, which began presenting concerts in autumn 1943. His plan for one of the bell towers in Linz to play a theme from Bruckner's Fourth Symphony never came to pass.

[ 12 ] During World War II Linz was a giant industrial complex in support of the Nazi war effort.

Hermann Göring supervised the construction of the Voest complex, ultimately a gigantic construction site built by slave labour. The Mauthausen concentration camp was established to the east of Linz, but three Mauthausen sub-camps were within the Voest complex.

[ 13 ] In addition to an ordnance depot Linz had a benzol plant which was bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II .

[ 14 ] The city's confrontation with its Nazi past resulted in the renaming of many streets. In 1945, immediately after the end of the Nazi dictatorship, 39 streets in Linz were renamed, but from 1946 to 1987, only two streets were renamed. However, since 1988, 17 new traffic areas were named after victims of National Socialism or resistance fighters.

The main square (built in 1230), with an area of 13,200 m 2 (142,000 sq ft), is one of the largest converted squares in Europe. In the middle of the main square the high "Pestsäule" (" plague column ", also known as "Dreifaltigkeitssäule" (Dreifaltigkeit means Holy Trinity )) was built to remember the people who died in the plague epidemics.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] It was designed by Antonio Beduzzi in 1713, and was finished in 1723.

[ 31 ] Around the main square are many historically relevant and architecturally interesting houses, such as the Old Town Hall, the Feichtinger House with its carillon, which changes the melody depending on the season, the Kirchmayr House, the Schmidtberger House or the bridgehead buildings, which house a part of the Linz Art University.

West of the main square there is the old quarter with many other historic buildings, such as Renaissance houses or older houses with a baroque face.

Near the Schloss/castle, being the former residence of emperor Friedrich the III—the oldest Austrian church is located: Sankt/Saint Martins church. It was built during early medieval Carolingian times.

[ 32 ] St. Mary's Cathedral (Mariä-Empfängnis-Dom), Roman Catholic, [ 33 ] in Gothic-Revival style. With a total height of 134.8 m (442 ft), the cathedral is the tallest church in Austria. Constructed in the years of 1862 and 1924, it is fully built of sandstone with unfinished front details.

Mozarthaus is the house, dating to the end of the 16th century, where the famous Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed the "Linz" Symphony and "Linz" Sonata during a three-day stay there in November 1783. Today, the exterior and inner courtyard of the house can be visited, but not the interior.

Pöstlingberg-Kirche: pilgrimage church on the Pöstlingberg hill. The basilica is the city's landmark and was built from 1738 until 1774, located on 537m sea level.

Pöstlingbergbahn is the steepest mountain rail in the world which was built in 1898 and operates gear-wheel free (functional grip between wheel and rail: gradient of 10.5%) Linzer Grottenbahn: A grotto railway is based up on the hill of Pöstling Brucknerhaus : the concert and congress house located on the Donaulände was first opened in 1973 and is venue of the Brucknerfest since 1974. It is named after the composer Anton Bruckner, who was born in Ansfelden , a small town next to Linz.

[ 34 ] The modern Concert Hall owes its unique acoustics to its wood paneling. The Great Hall of the Bruckner House, also called Brucknersaal, is the architectural jewel hosting an organ consisting of more than 4,200 pipes and 51 registers. The spacious stage in particular was designed for 220 performers.

[ 35 ] In 2017 the life and works of Anton Bruckner were the focus of the Bruckner Festival held under the motto "Bruckner elementar". Bruckner's works were the focus of the festival presented by national and international artists.

[ 36 ] Gugl Stadium , is home to the LASK (Linzer Athletik Sport Klub), which is claimed to be the third oldest football club in Austria.

[ 37 ] Linzer Landestheater [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Kremsmünsterer Haus: is to find at the "Alter Markt", located in the inner city of Linz where, as legends say, emperor Friedrich III. had died.

Landhaus: The country house was built in the 16th century and is the headquarters of the governor, the upper Austrian parliament and the government of upper Austria.

Johannes Kepler used to teach here for more than 14 years.

Further information: Linz Castle Architecture [ edit ] The former townhouse of Kremsmünster Abbey A historic suburban villa at Freinberg The old town hall As many central European cities, the cityscape of Linz is characterised by small and several sacred buildings. The Mariä Empfängnis Dom or New Cathedral is the biggest church in Austria, not by height (it is roughly 2 metres shorter than the St. Stephen's Cathedral ( Stephansdom ) in Vienna), but by capacity.

The historic centre is characterised by its medieval architectural style, whereas in those parts of the city that border with the historic centre the architecture is of neoclassical , neo-baroque and neo-renaissance styles. Even further from the historic centre there are living areas, such as Franckviertel , Froschberg , Bindermichl and Kleinmünchen southern of the Danube and Alt-Urfahr northern of the Danube. These areas are where residential buildings can be found that are still referred to as " Hitlerbauten " or "Hitler buildings", because they were built during the interwar period and the time of Nazi dictatorship. The residential area called Gugl became a well liked living area among the wealthy at around 1900, which is why there are numerous villas still there today.

Amongst the newer buildings is the Linz Hauptbahnhof station, which was designed by Wilhelm Holzbauer and added the Terminal Tower skyscraper as part of a mixed-use complex. Between 2005 und 2011 it was voted Austria's most beautiful railway station seven times in a row by the Verkehrsclub Österreich . The Wissensturm ("Tower of knowledge") with a height of about 63 metres, houses the public library and the Volkshochschule , an adult education centre. It was designed by Franz Kneidinger and Heinz Stögmüller and opened in 2007.

Lentos Art Museum , which opened in 2003, was designed by Zürich-based architects Weber & Hofer and the Musiktheater (music theatre), which opened in 2013, was designed by Terry Pawson.

Culture [ edit ] The city is now home to a vibrant music and arts scene that is well-funded by the city and the state of Upper Austria. Between Lentos Art Museum and the "Brucknerhaus", is the "Donaulände", which is also referred to as "Kulturmeile" ("culture mile"). This is a park alongside the river, which is used mainly by young people to relax and meet in summer. It is also used for the Ars Electronica Festival in early September and the "Stream Festival", which takes place annually. In June, July and August the "Musikpavillon" is placed in the park where musical groups of different styles perform on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays free of charge.

Linz has other culture institutions, such as the Posthof, which is near the harbour, [ 40 ] and the Stadtwerkstatt , which is by the river Danube.

[ 41 ] The Pflasterspektakel , an international street art festival, takes place each year in July in and around the Landstraße and the main square.

[ 42 ] Linz was the European Capital of Culture in 2009, along with Vilnius , the capital of Lithuania .

[ 43 ] The aim is to maintain and represent the cultural diversity.

[ 44 ] The Ars Electronica Center can be considered as the centre of media art and attracts every year during its festival national and international guests to Linz.

The latest project developed by Linz in the context of the City of Media Arts project is the Valie Export Center, which is located in the Tabakfabrik (tobacco factory) and carried out in cooperation with the University of Art and Design Linz. It serves as an international research hub for media and performance art. Beyond that, it comprises the legacy as well as the archives of the most renowned media artist coming from Linz, Valie Export , who has received numerous national as well as international prizes.

[ 45 ] Along with the Ars Electronica archives, Linz hosts two internationally renowned archives for media art.

[ 46 ] Since 2009, the Open Commons Linz initiative has made available a wide variety of "free" data: geo-data and statistical information having to do with city life, local government, recreation and tourism. An associated effort is the Hotspot initiative that has installed 202 hotspots providing free WLAN, as well as Public Server, the municipal cloud available to all citizens registered in Linz. Linz is thus at the forefront in Europe when it comes to universal access to open data.

[ 47 ] Linz houses 43 galleries and exhibit rooms, 13 cultural centres, one club centre, as well as four educational institutes.

Museums [ edit ] Lentos museum The Lentos (built 2003) is a modern art gallery, presenting art from the 20th and 21st centuries. It is situated on the south banks of the river Danube. The building can be illuminated at night from the inside with blue, pink, red and violet, due to its plastic casing.

Ars Electronica Center (AEC) (also called museum of the future ) is a museum and research facility on the north bank of the Danube (in the Urfahr district), across the river from the Hauptplatz (main square). The AEC is a significant world centre for new media arts, attracting a large gathering of technologically oriented artists every year for the Ars Electronica Festival .
