( August 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Axiomatic logical system In mathematics , Robinson arithmetic is a finitely axiomatized fragment of first-order Peano arithmetic (PA), first set out by Raphael M. Robinson in 1950.

[ 1 ] It is usually denoted Q .

Q is PA without the axiom schema of mathematical induction .

Q is weaker than PA but it has the same language, and both theories are incomplete .

Q is important and interesting because it is a finitely axiomatized fragment of PA that is recursively incompletable and essentially undecidable .

Axioms [ edit ] The background logic of Q is first-order logic with identity , denoted by infix '='. The individuals, called natural numbers , are members of a set called N with a distinguished member 0 , called zero . There are three operations over N : A unary operation called successor and denoted by prefix S ; Two binary operations , addition and multiplication , denoted by infix + and · , respectively.

The following axioms for Q are Q1–Q7 in Burgess (2005 , p. 42) (cf. also the axioms of first-order arithmetic ).

Variables not bound by an existential quantifier are bound by an implicit universal quantifier .

Sx ≠ 0 0 is not the successor of any number.

( Sx = Sy ) → x = y If the successor of x is identical to the successor of y , then x and y are identical. (1) and (2) yield the minimum of facts about N (it is an infinite set bounded by 0 ) and S (it is an injective function whose domain is N ) needed for non-triviality. The converse of (2) follows from the properties of identity.

y = 0 ∨ ∃ x ( Sx = y ) Every number is either 0 or the successor of some number. The axiom schema of mathematical induction present in arithmetics stronger than Q turns this axiom into a theorem.

x + 0 = x x + Sy = S ( x + y ) (4) and (5) are the recursive definition of addition .

x · 0 = 0 x·Sy = ( x·y ) + x (6) and (7) are the recursive definition of multiplication .

Variant axiomatizations [ edit ] The axioms in Robinson (1950) are (1)–(13) in Mendelson (2015 , pp. 202–203). The first 6 of Robinson's 13 axioms are required only when, unlike here, the background logic does not include identity.

The usual strict total order on N , "less than" (denoted by "<"), can be defined in terms of addition via the rule x < y ↔ ∃ z ( Sz + x = y ) . Equivalently, we get a definitional conservative extension of Q by taking "<" as primitive and adding this rule as an eighth axiom; this system is termed " Robinson arithmetic R " in Boolos, Burgess & Jeffrey (2002 , Sec 16.4).

A different extension of Q , which we temporarily call Q+ , is obtained if we take "<" as primitive and add (instead of the last definitional axiom) the following three axioms to axioms (1)–(7) of Q : ¬( x < 0) x < Sy ↔ ( x < y ∨ x = y ) x < y ∨ x = y ∨ y < x Q+ is still a conservative extension of Q , in the sense that any formula provable in Q+ not containing the symbol "<" is already provable in Q . (Adding only the first two of the above three axioms to Q gives a conservative extension of Q that is equivalent to what Burgess (2005 , p. 56) calls Q* . See also Burgess (2005 , p. 230, fn. 24), but note that the second of the above three axioms cannot be deduced from "the pure definitional extension" of Q obtained by adding only the axiom x < y ↔ ∃ z ( Sz + x = y ) .) Among the axioms (1)–(7) of Q , axiom (3) needs an inner existential quantifier.

Shoenfield (1967 , p. 22) gives an axiomatization that has only (implicit) outer universal quantifiers, by dispensing with axiom (3) of Q but adding the above three axioms with < as primitive. That is, Shoenfield's system is Q+ minus axiom (3), and is strictly weaker than Q+ , since axiom (3) is independent of the other axioms (for example, the ordinals less than ω ω ω ω {\displaystyle \omega ^{\omega }} forms a model for all axioms except (3) when Sv is interpreted as v + 1). Shoenfield's system also appears in Boolos, Burgess & Jeffrey (2002 , Sec 16.2), where it is called the " minimal arithmetic " (also denoted by Q ). A closely related axiomatization, that uses "≤" instead of "<", may be found in Machover (1996 , pp. 256–257).

Metamathematics [ edit ] On the metamathematics of Q see Boolos, Burgess & Jeffrey (2002 , chpt. 16), Tarski, Mostowski & Robinson (1953) , Smullyan (1991) , Mendelson (2015 , pp. 202–203) and Burgess (2005 , §§1.5a, 2.2). The intended interpretation of Q is the natural numbers and their usual arithmetic in which addition and multiplication have their customary meaning, identity is equality , Sx = x + 1, and 0 is the natural number zero .

Any model (structure) that satisfies all axioms of Q except possibly axiom (3) has a unique submodel ("the standard part") isomorphic to the standard natural numbers ( N , +, ·, S, 0) . (Axiom (3) need not be satisfied; for example the polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients forms a model that satisfies all axioms except (3).) Q , like Peano arithmetic , has nonstandard models of all infinite cardinalities . However, unlike Peano arithmetic, Tennenbaum's theorem does not apply to Q , and it has computable non-standard models. For instance, there is a computable model of Q consisting of integer-coefficient polynomials with positive leading coefficient, plus the zero polynomial, with their usual arithmetic.

A notable characteristic of Q is the absence of the axiom scheme of induction . Hence it is often possible to prove in Q every specific instance of a fact about the natural numbers, but not the associated general theorem. For example, 5 + 7 = 7 + 5 is provable in Q , but the general statement x + y = y + x is not. Similarly, one cannot prove that Sx ≠ x .

[ 2 ] A model of Q that fails many of the standard facts is obtained by adjoining two distinct new elements a and b to the standard model of natural numbers and defining Sa = a , Sb = b , x + a = b and x + b = a for all x , a + n = a and b + n = b if n is a standard natural number, x ·0 = 0 for all x , a · n = b and b · n = a if n is a non-zero standard natural number, x · a = a for all x except x = a , x · b = b for all x except x = b , a · a = b , and b · b = a .

[ 3 ] Q is interpretable in a fragment of Zermelo's axiomatic set theory , consisting of extensionality , existence of the empty set , and the axiom of adjunction . This theory is S' in Tarski, Mostowski & Robinson (1953 , p. 34) and ST in Burgess (2005 , pp. 90–91, 223). See general set theory for more details.

Q is a finitely axiomatized first-order theory that is considerably weaker than Peano arithmetic (PA), and whose axioms contain only one existential quantifier . Yet like PA it is incomplete and incompletable in the sense of Gödel's incompleteness theorems , and essentially undecidable.

Robinson (1950) derived the Q axioms (1)–(7) above by noting just what PA axioms are required [ 4 ] to prove that every computable function is representable in PA.

[ 5 ] The only use this proof makes of the PA axiom schema of induction is to prove a statement that is axiom (3) above, and so, all computable functions are representable in Q .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The conclusion of Gödel's second incompleteness theorem also holds for Q : no consistent recursively axiomatized extension of Q can prove its own consistency, even if we additionally restrict Gödel numbers of proofs to a definable cut.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] The first incompleteness theorem applies only to axiomatic systems defining sufficient arithmetic to carry out the necessary coding constructions (of which Gödel numbering forms a part). The axioms of Q were chosen specifically to ensure they are strong enough for this purpose. Thus the usual proof of the first incompleteness theorem can be used to show that Q is incomplete and undecidable. This indicates that the incompleteness and undecidability of PA cannot be blamed on the only aspect of PA differentiating it from Q , namely the axiom schema of induction .

Gödel's theorems do not hold when any one of the seven axioms above is dropped. These fragments of Q remain undecidable, but they are no longer essentially undecidable: they have consistent decidable extensions, as well as uninteresting models (i.e., models that are not end-extensions of the standard natural numbers).
