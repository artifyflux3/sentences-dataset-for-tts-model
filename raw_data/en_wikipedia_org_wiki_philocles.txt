] ( Greek : Φιλοκλῆς ), was  an Athenian tragic poet during the 5th century BC. Through his mother, Philopatho ( Greek : Φιλοπαθώ ), he had three famous uncles: Aeschylus , the famous poet, Cynaegirus , hero of the battle of Marathon , and Ameinias , hero of the battle of Salamis . The Suda claims that Philocles was the father of the tragic playwright Morsimus , who was in turn the father of the tragedian Astydamas the Elder and was in his turn the father of the tragedian Astydamas the Younger .

[ 1 ] Works [ edit ] According to the Suda , Philocles wrote 100 tragedies. Philocles is best known for winning first prize in the competition against Sophocles ' Oedipus Rex .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Philocles also wrote a play on the subject of Tereus , which was parodied in Aristophanes ' The Birds along with Sophocles' treatment of the same subject .

[ 4 ] A scholiast has noted that Philocles' Tereus was part of his Pandionis tetralogy.

[ 4 ] An extant fragment shows that Philocles wrote a play covering the story of Hermione , Neoptolemus and Orestes , a subject also addressed by Euripides in his play Andromache and by Sophocles in his Hermione .

[ 5 ] In Philocles' version of the Hermione myth, Hermione is betrothed to Neoptolemus by her father Menelaus while she is pregnant with Orestes' child.

[ 5 ] Philocles also wrote plays entitled Oedipus and Philoctetes .

[ 6 ] The Suda also names the following as plays of Philocles: Erigone , Nauplius , Oineus , Priam , and Penelope .
