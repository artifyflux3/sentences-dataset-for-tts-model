Ltd., London.

A New Era of Thought is about the fourth dimension and its implications on human thinking. It influenced the work of P.D. Ouspensky , particularly his book Tertium Organum where it is frequently quoted; Scientific American writer Martin Gardner , who mentioned this book in some of his articles; [ 1 ] and Rudy Rucker 's The Fourth Dimension .

[ 2 ] It is prefaced by Alicia Boole and H. John Falk.

A New Era of Thought is inspired by Plato 's allegory of the cave and is influenced by the works of Immanuel Kant , Carl Friedrich Gauss and Nikolai Lobachevsky . The book has xvi and 230 pages.

Synopsis [ edit ] A New Era of Thought consists of two parts. The first part is a collection of philosophical and mathematical essays on the fourth dimension. These essays are somewhat disconnected. They teach the possibility of thinking four-dimensionally and about the religious and philosophical insights thus obtainable. In the second part Hinton develops a system of coloured cubes. These cubes serve as model to get a four-dimensional perception as a basis of four-dimensional thinking. This part describes how to visualize a tesseract by looking at several 3-D cross sections of it. The system of cubic models in A New Era of Thought is a forerunner of the cubic models in Hinton's book The Fourth Dimension .
