The ideas of Irlen syndrome are not supported by scientific evidence, and its treatment has been described as a health fraud .

History [ edit ] The condition was proposed in the 1980s.

[ 1 ] Early studies investigating Irlen syndrome as a treatable condition have been criticized for taking a biased and subjective approach to the research.

[ 1 ] The ideas of Irlen syndrome are pseudoscientific and not supported by scientific evidence.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Irlen method [ edit ] The Irlen method uses colored overlays and tinted lenses in the form of glasses or contact lenses. The method is intended to correct visual processing problems; it is claimed the resultant retiming of visual signals in the brain improves symptoms associated with Irlen syndrome.

[ 5 ] Treatment of Irlen syndrome has been described as a health fraud that takes advantage of vulnerable people.
