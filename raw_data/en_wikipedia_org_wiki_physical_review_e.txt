45808357 Links Journal homepage Physical Review E is a peer-reviewed , scientific journal , published monthly by the American Physical Society . The main field of interest is collective phenomena of many-body systems .  It is edited by Dario Corradini as of December 2024.

[ 1 ] While original research content requires subscription, editorials, news, and other non-research content is openly accessible .

Scope [ edit ] Although the focus of this journal is many-body phenomena , the broad scope of the journal includes quantum chaos , soft matter physics, classical chaos , biological physics and granular materials.

Also emphasized are statistical physics , equilibrium and transport properties of fluids, liquid crystals , complex fluids, polymers , chaos, fluid dynamics , plasma physics , classical physics , and computational physics .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Former names [ edit ] This journal began as " Physical Review " in 1893. In 1913 the American Physical Society took over Physical Review . In 1970 Physical Review was subdivided into Physical Review A , B , C , and D . From 1990 until 1993 a process was underway which split the journal then entitled Physical Review A: General Physics into two journals. Hence, from  1993 until 2000, one of the split off journals became Physical Review E: Statistical Physics, Plasmas, Fluids, and Related Interdisciplinary Topics . In 2001 the journal was changed, in name, to its present title. As an aside, in January 2007, the section which published works on classical optics was transferred from Physical Review E to Physical Review A . This action unified the classical and quantum parts of optics into a single journal.

[ 3 ] Rapid Communications [ edit ] Physical Review E Rapid Communications was announced on June 7, 2010. This section (or feature) gives priority to results which are deemed significant, and merits a prominent display on the Physical Review E website. The specific article is displayed for several weeks, and is part of a rotation with other articles, also deemed significant.
