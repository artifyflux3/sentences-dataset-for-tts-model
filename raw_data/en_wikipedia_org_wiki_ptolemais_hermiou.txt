Today, the city of El Mansha ( Arabic : المنشأة ) [ 2 ] - Bsoi ( Coptic : ⲡⲥⲟⲓ ) in the Sohag Governorate is located where the ancient city used to be.

History [ edit ] Ptolemais Hermiou was established on the west bank of the Nile at the site of the Egyptian village of Psoï in the Thinis nome by the Ptolemaic ruler Ptolemy I Soter sometime after 312 BCE.

[ 3 ] Whether it was intended from the outset to replace Thebes as a political centre is disputed.

[ 4 ] The name Hermiou could refer to a person called Hermias that could have coordinated the foundation for Ptolemy.

[ 5 ] According to Strabo , it was the largest city in the Thebaid , equal to Memphis in size. Together with Naukratis and Alexandria , it was one of only three cities with proper Greek city status. Therefore, it also had its own constitution, an assembly with elected magistrates and judges.

[ 6 ] Greek settlers to the city were brought over from the Peloponnese and northern Greece .

[ 7 ] The city housed temples to Greek and Egyptian gods ( Zeus , Dionysus , Isis ) as well as a cult for the worship of the Ptolemaic Dynasty . There was also a theater and actor's guild present in the city.

[ 8 ] Titular see [ edit ] The provincial capital and hence Metropolitan archdiocese of the Late Roman province of Thebais Secunda , which had faded, was nominally restored as a Latin Metropolitan titular archbishopric in the late 19th century as Ptolemais antea Syis , renamed simply Ptolemais in 1925, Ptolemais in Thebaide in 1933.

It has been vacant for decades, having had the following incumbents of the highest rank : Lorenzo Passerini (1892.07.11 – 1901.04.18), later Titular Latin Patriarch of Antioch (1901.04.18 – 1915.12.13) Luigi Canali, Franciscans (O.F.M. Obs.) (1901.08.03 – 1905.04.22) José Marcondes Homem de Melo (1906.12.06 – 1908.08.09) Raffaele Virili (1915.01.14 – 1925.03.09) Paolo Giobbe (1925.03.30 – 1958.12.15) (later Cardinal) Pietro Parente (1959.10.23 – 1965.12.07) (later Cardinal) References [ edit ] ^ a b c "Egypt: Governorates, Major Cities & Towns - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information" .
