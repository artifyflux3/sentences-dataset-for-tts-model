Garden tools can be divided into hand tools and power tools .

Hand tools [ edit ] Main article: Hand tool Pruning tools that can be used to maintain a garden Today's garden tools originated with the earliest agricultural implements used by humans. Examples include the hatchet , axe , sickle , scythe , pitchfork , spade , shovel , trowel , hoe , fork , and rake . In some places, the machete is common.

The earliest tools were made variously of wood, flint, metal, tin, and bone. The development of metalworking , first in copper and later in bronze , iron , and steel , produced today's durable tools, including such efficient cutting tools as pruning shears (secateurs – for example anvil pruners ), grass shears , and loppers .

Increasing use of modern alloys allows many tools to be made both stronger and lighter, making them more durable and easier to use.

Ergonomics [ edit ] This section possibly contains original research .

Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations . Statements consisting only of original research should be removed.

( December 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Some modern tool designs reflect ergonomic considerations, being designed to induce less stress on the human body in use. The most efficient tools keep the body in a neutral position to help reduce the stress on joints and muscles, which also require less energy to use.

Power tools [ edit ] Main article: Power tool The first power tool to become popular with gardeners was the lawn mower .

[ citation needed ] It was followed by various cultivators (such as the rototiller ), string trimmers , hedge trimmers , lawn aerators , lawn sweepers , trenchers , leaf blowers , chainsaws , mini-tractors , and others.

Power tools have resulted in the transition from manual labor to large-scale mechanised agriculture .

Environmental impact [ edit ] The exhaust fumes from primarily 2-stroke gas-powered equipment is a source of air pollution.

[ 1 ] US emission standards specifically limit emissions from these small engines, which are being forced to become more efficient and less polluting. As Q1 2024 petrol powered tools are banned in California.
