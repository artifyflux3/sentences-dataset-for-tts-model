For other uses, see School of thought (disambiguation) .

A school of thought , or intellectual tradition , is the perspective of a group of people who share common characteristics of opinion or outlook of a philosophy , [ 1 ] discipline , belief , social movement , economics , cultural movement , or art movement .

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The phrase has become a common colloquialism which is used to describe those that think alike or those that focus on a common idea.

[ 3 ] The term's use is common place.

[ according to whom?

] [ 2 ] Schools are often characterized by their currency, and thus classified into "new" and "old" schools. There is a convention, in political and philosophical fields of thought, to have  "modern" and "classical" schools of thought. An example is the modern and classical liberals . This dichotomy is often a component of paradigm shift . However, it is rarely the case that there are only two schools in any given field.

Schools are often named after their founders such as the " Rinzai school " of Zen , named after Linji Yixuan ; and the Asharite school of early Muslim philosophy , named after Abu l'Hasan al-Ashari . They are often also named after their places of origin, such as the Ionian school of philosophy , which originated in Ionia ; the Chicago school of architecture , which originated in Chicago, Illinois ; the Prague school of linguistics, named after a linguistic circle founded in Prague ; and the Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School , whose representatives lived in Tartu and Moscow .

An example of a school of thought in Christianity (and Gnosticism ) is Neoplatonism , which has massively influenced Christian thought , from Augustinianism to Renaissance / Humanism to the present day.
