The unit square in the real plane In mathematics , a unit square is a square whose sides have length 1 .  Often, the unit square refers specifically to the square in the Cartesian plane with corners at the four points (0, 0 ), (1, 0) , (0, 1) , and (1, 1) .

[ 1 ] Cartesian coordinates [ edit ] In a Cartesian coordinate system with coordinates ( x , y ) , a unit square is defined as a square consisting of the points where both x and y lie in a closed unit interval from 0 to 1 .

That is, a unit square is the Cartesian product I × I , where I denotes the closed unit interval.

Complex coordinates [ edit ] The unit square can also be thought of as a subset of the complex plane , the topological space formed by the complex numbers .
In this view, the four corners of the unit square are at the four complex numbers 0 , 1 , i , and 1 + i .

Rational distance problem [ edit ] Unsolved problem in mathematics Is there a point in the plane at a rational distance from all four corners of a unit square?

More unsolved problems in mathematics It is not known whether any point in the plane is a rational distance from all four vertices of the unit square.
