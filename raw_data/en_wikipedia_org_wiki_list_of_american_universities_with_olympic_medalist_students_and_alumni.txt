( April 2025 ) The list of American universities with Olympic medalist students and alumni shows the number of Olympic medals won by students and alumni of American universities in the Olympic Games up through 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics . Many of these athletes did not compete for the United States; the American college sports model, in which post-secondary institutions sponsor a wide range of athletic competitions and provide scholarships and subsidies to athletes with little regard for their origin, has the effect of drawing university-age athletes from all over the world to the United States for both academic and athletic study.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] This list considers both summer and winter Olympic games, and only those who actually received Olympic medals are counted. Therefore, the list includes Olympic athletes only and excludes coaches, staff managers and so on.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] In addition, if an athlete attended more than one university, that athlete might show up in the medal count of each university attended.

[ 7 ] For example, Alma Richards who won the gold medal in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics in the high jump attended BYU prep school (degree), Cornell University (degree), the University of Southern California (degree) and Stanford University .

[ 8 ] He is listed in the medal count for BYU, Cornell and the University of Southern California, but Stanford does not include him in its list. Finally, in this list, universities are presented in descending order starting from those with the most Olympic medals.

In the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics , the university with the most Olympic medals in the U.S. was Stanford University (26 medals), followed by the University of Southern California (21 medals), the University of Florida (17 medals), UCLA (16 medals) and UC Berkeley (16 medals).

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Although the 2024 Summer Olympics results have been announced, [ 13 ] some have not yet been added to the tables below.

Notes [ edit ] ^ Stanford's count (296=150+79+67) may have overlooked or excluded some medals from the past Summer/Winter Olympics. For fair comparison, some of these medals have been manually added to Stanford's count in this list (with supporting sources): Alma Richards (1 gold), Debi Thomas (1 bronze), Sami Jo Small (2 golds, 1 silver), and John Coyle (1 silver).

^ The UCLA count has produced inconsistent and conflicting figures in the past few years, some of which included medals "won" by coaches and staff members. The latest UCLA count claims to include student athletes only, and is thus adopted in this list.

^ University of Texas's current count has overlooked or excluded the medals won by Gabrielle Thomas (1 silver, 1 bronze) at the 2020 Summer Olympics. These medals have been manually added to this list.

^ University of Texas's current count has overlooked or excluded the medals won by Gabrielle Thomas (1 silver, 1 bronze) at the 2020 Summer Olympics. These medals have been manually added to this list.

^ This count is fewer than Michigan's count (185=84+47+52) because Michigan's count also includes coaches, staff, etc.

^ This count is fewer than Harvard's count (116=47+48+21) because Harvard's count also includes coaches, staff, etc. On the other hand, Harvard's current count has not been updated to reflect the medals won by Gabrielle Thomas (1 silver, 1 bronze) at the 2020 Summer Olympics – these medals have been manually added to this list.

^ Harvard's current count has not been updated to reflect the medals won by Gabrielle Thomas (1 silver, 1 bronze) at the 2020 Summer Olympics – these medals have been manually added to this list.

^ The two sources provided describe the medals for the entire Indiana University system, while the first source allows to display medals for Indiana University Bloomington only.

^ The sources from University of Arizona provide conflicting medal counts. The latest sources (2021 & 2016) are used in this list.

^ This count is fewer than Minnesota's count because Minnesota's count also includes coaches.

^ This count has not included medalists from 2014 & 2018 Winter Olympics, as well as from 2020 Summer Olympics.

^ The count is based on the sources that counted Olympic medalists from the Northern Michigan University Olympic Training Center. But in reality an athlete may not be a student at the university.

^ Purdue's count includes Chris Huffins (bronze medal 2000), who is a coach at Purdue rather than an athlete. He is not included in this list.

^ This count is likely incomplete.

^ This count is fewer than Syracuse's count (29=18+8+3) because Syracuse's count also includes coaches.
