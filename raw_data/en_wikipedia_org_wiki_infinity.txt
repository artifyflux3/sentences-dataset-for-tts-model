The [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle "Sierpiński triangle") contains infinitely many (scaled-down) copies of itself.

**Infinity** is something which is boundless, endless, or larger than any [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"). It is denoted by ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21), called the [infinity symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_symbol "Infinity symbol").

From the time of the [ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_mathematics "Ancient Greek mathematics"), the [philosophical nature of infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_(philosophy) "Infinity (philosophy)") has been the subject of many discussions among philosophers. In the 17th century, with the introduction of the infinity symbol[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-:1-1) and the [infinitesimal calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_calculus "Infinitesimal calculus"), mathematicians began to work with [infinite series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_series "Infinite series") and what some mathematicians (including [l'Hôpital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_de_l%27H%C3%B4pital "Guillaume de l'Hôpital") and [Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli "Johann Bernoulli"))[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-Jesseph-2) regarded as infinitely small quantities, but infinity continued to be associated with endless processes. As mathematicians struggled with the foundation of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"), it remained unclear whether infinity could be considered as a number or [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)") and, if so, how this could be done.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-:1-1) At the end of the 19th century, [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor "Georg Cantor") enlarged the mathematical study of infinity by studying [infinite sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set "Infinite set") and [infinite numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number "Transfinite number"), showing that they can be of various sizes.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-:1-1)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-3) For example, if a line is viewed as the set of all of its points, their infinite number (i.e., the [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality "Cardinality") of the line) is larger than the number of [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-4) In this usage, infinity is a mathematical concept, and infinite [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") can be studied, manipulated, and used just like any other mathematical object.

The mathematical concept of infinity refines and extends the old philosophical concept, in particular by introducing infinitely many different sizes of infinite sets. Among the axioms of [Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory "Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory"), on which most of modern mathematics can be developed, is the [axiom of infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity "Axiom of infinity"), which guarantees the existence of infinite sets.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-:1-1) The mathematical concept of infinity and the manipulation of infinite sets are widely used in mathematics, even in areas such as [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics") that may seem to have nothing to do with them. For example, [Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem "Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem") implicitly relies on the existence of [Grothendieck universes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_universe "Grothendieck universe"), very large infinite sets,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-5) for solving a long-standing problem that is stated in terms of [elementary arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_arithmetic "Elementary arithmetic").

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), it is an open question [whether the universe is spatially infinite or not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe#Size_and_regions "Universe").

Ancient cultures had various ideas about the nature of infinity. The [ancient Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_period "Vedic period") and the [Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") did not define infinity in precise formalism as does modern mathematics, and instead approached infinity as a philosophical concept.

The earliest recorded idea of infinity in Greece may be that of [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander") (c. 610 – c. 546 BC) a [pre-Socratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy "Pre-Socratic philosophy") Greek philosopher. He used the word _[apeiron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeiron "Apeiron")_, which means "unbounded", "indefinite", and perhaps can be translated as "infinite".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-:1-1)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-6)

[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") (350 BC) distinguished _potential infinity_ from _[actual infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual\_infinity "Actual infinity")_, which he regarded as impossible due to the various [paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxes "Paradoxes") it seemed to produce.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-7) It has been argued that, in line with this view, the [Hellenistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic "Hellenistic") Greeks had a "horror of the infinite"[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-9) which would, for example, explain why [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") (c. 300 BC) did not say that there are an infinity of primes but rather "Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-10) It has also been maintained, that, in proving the [infinitude of the prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitude_of_the_prime_numbers "Infinitude of the prime numbers"), Euclid "was the first to overcome the horror of the infinite".[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-11) There is a similar controversy concerning Euclid's [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate"), sometimes translated:

> If a straight line falling across two [other] straight lines makes internal angles on the same side [of itself whose sum is] less than two right angles, then the two [other] straight lines, being produced to infinity, meet on that side [of the original straight line] that the [sum of the internal angles] is less than two right angles.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-12)

Other translators, however, prefer the translation "the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely ...",[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-13) thus avoiding the implication that Euclid was comfortable with the notion of infinity. Finally, it has been maintained that a reflection on infinity, far from eliciting a "horror of the infinite", underlay all of early Greek philosophy and that Aristotle's "potential infinity" is an aberration from the general trend of this period.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-14)

### Zeno: Achilles and the tortoise

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Infinity&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Zeno: Achilles and the tortoise")]

[Zeno of Elea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Elea "Zeno of Elea") (c. 495 – c. 430 BC) did not advance any views concerning the infinite. Nevertheless, his paradoxes,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-Zeno's_paradoxes-15) especially "Achilles and the Tortoise", were important contributions in that they made clear the inadequacy of popular conceptions. The paradoxes were described by [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") as "immeasurably subtle and profound".[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-16)

[Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles "Achilles") races a tortoise, giving the latter a head start.

*   Step #1: Achilles runs to the tortoise's starting point while the tortoise walks forward.
*   Step #2: Achilles advances to where the tortoise was at the end of Step #1 while the tortoise goes yet further.
*   Step #3: Achilles advances to where the tortoise was at the end of Step #2 while the tortoise goes yet further.
*   Step #4: Achilles advances to where the tortoise was at the end of Step #3 while the tortoise goes yet further.

Etc.

Apparently, Achilles never overtakes the tortoise, since however many steps he completes, the tortoise remains ahead of him.

Zeno was not attempting to make a point about infinity. As a member of the [Eleatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleatic "Eleatic") school which regarded motion as an illusion, he saw it as a mistake to suppose that Achilles could run at all. Subsequent thinkers, finding this solution unacceptable, struggled for over two millennia to find other weaknesses in the argument.

Finally, in 1821, [Augustin-Louis Cauchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy "Augustin-Louis Cauchy") provided both a satisfactory definition of a limit and a proof that, for 0 <_x_< 1,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-17)![Image 3: {\displaystyle a+ax+ax^{2}+ax^{3}+ax^{4}+ax^{5}+\cdots ={\frac {a}{1-x}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/273688d4c215ab7a8c65ccbe30c52a678b550c0c)

Suppose that Achilles is running at 10 meters per second, the tortoise is walking at 0.1 meters per second, and the latter has a 100-meter head start. The duration of the chase fits Cauchy's pattern with _a_ = 10 seconds and _x_ = 0.01. Achilles does overtake the tortoise; it takes him

The [Jain mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_mathematics#Jain_mathematics_(400_BCE_%E2%80%93_200_CE) "Indian mathematics") text _[Surya Prajnapti](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surya\_Prajnapti&action=edit&redlink=1 "Surya Prajnapti (page does not exist)")_ (c. 4th–3rd century BCE) classifies all numbers into three sets: [enumerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerable "Enumerable"), innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-18)

*   Enumerable: lowest, intermediate, and highest
*   Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable, and innumerably innumerable
*   Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite

In the 17th century, European mathematicians started using infinite numbers and infinite expressions in a systematic fashion. In 1655, [John Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis "John Wallis") first used the notation ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21) for such a number in his _De sectionibus conicis_,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-19) and exploited it in area calculations by dividing the region into [infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") strips of width on the order of ![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{\infty }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/286a6d82b16111d4ae231286d8e66bb0c9713d7f)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-20) But in _Arithmetica infinitorum_ (1656),[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-21) he indicates infinite series, infinite products and infinite continued fractions by writing down a few terms or factors and then appending "&c.", as in "1, 6, 12, 18, 24, &c."[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-22)

In 1699, [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") wrote about equations with an infinite number of terms in his work _[De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_analysi\_per\_aequationes\_numero\_terminorum\_infinitas "De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas")_.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-23)

The infinity symbol ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21) (sometimes called the [lemniscate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate "Lemniscate")) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity. The symbol is encoded in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") at U+221E∞INFINITY (&infin;)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-24) and in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX "LaTeX") as `\infty`.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-25)

It was introduced in 1655 by [John Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis "John Wallis"),[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-27) and since its introduction, it has also been used outside mathematics in modern mysticism[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-28) and literary [symbology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbology "Symbology").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-29)

[Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz"), one of the co-inventors of [infinitesimal calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_calculus "Infinitesimal calculus"), speculated widely about infinite numbers and their use in mathematics. To Leibniz, both infinitesimals and infinite quantities were ideal entities, not of the same nature as appreciable quantities, but enjoying the same properties in accordance with the [Law of continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_continuity "Law of continuity").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-30)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-Jesseph-2)

In [real analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis "Real analysis"), the symbol ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21), called "infinity", is used to denote an unbounded [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function "Limit of a function").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-31) It is not a real number itself. The notation ![Image 10: {\displaystyle x\rightarrow \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02579e74e2ef1ca0befceba816b311fe5bfd6844) means that _![Image 11: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4)_ increases without bound, and ![Image 12: {\displaystyle x\to -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1a02931d12f93c144745ec549edf61e85fba2c3d) means that _![Image 13: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4)_ decreases without bound. For example, if ![Image 14: {\displaystyle f(t)\geq 0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f73da3eb2fb3bf9f777a76c755f66313b3a9061) for every _![Image 15: {\displaystyle t}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560)_, then[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-32)

Infinity can also be used to describe [infinite series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_series "Infinite series"), as follows:

In addition to defining a limit, infinity can be also used as a value in the extended real number system. Points labeled ![Image 16: {\displaystyle +\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bddbb0e4420a7e744cf71bd71216e11b0bf88831) and ![Image 17: {\displaystyle -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1) can be added to the [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") of the real numbers, producing the two-point [compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactification_(mathematics) "Compactification (mathematics)") of the real numbers. Adding algebraic properties to this gives us the [extended real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_number "Extended real number").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-34) We can also treat ![Image 18: {\displaystyle +\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bddbb0e4420a7e744cf71bd71216e11b0bf88831) and ![Image 19: {\displaystyle -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1) as the same, leading to the [one-point compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-point_compactification "One-point compactification") of the real numbers, which is the [real projective line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_line "Real projective line").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-35)[Projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry") also refers to a [line at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_at_infinity "Line at infinity") in plane geometry, a [plane at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_at_infinity "Plane at infinity") in three-dimensional space, and a [hyperplane at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_at_infinity "Hyperplane at infinity") for general [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(mathematics_and_physics) "Dimension (mathematics and physics)"), each consisting of [points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity "Point at infinity").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-36)

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Riemann_sphere1.svg/250px-Riemann_sphere1.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Riemann_sphere1.svg)

By [stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection "Stereographic projection"), the complex plane can be "wrapped" onto a sphere, with the top point of the sphere corresponding to infinity. This is called the [Riemann sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere "Riemann sphere").

In [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis "Complex analysis") the symbol ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21), called "infinity", denotes an unsigned infinite [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics) "Limit (mathematics)"). The expression ![Image 22: {\displaystyle x\rightarrow \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02579e74e2ef1ca0befceba816b311fe5bfd6844) means that the magnitude![Image 23: {\displaystyle |x|}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4eb41e5fd5dc37eaa1718dfbf4bc082edb991936) of _![Image 24: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4)_ grows beyond any assigned value. A [point labeled ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity "Point at infinity") can be added to the complex plane as a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") giving the [one-point compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-point_compactification "One-point compactification") of the complex plane. When this is done, the resulting space is a one-dimensional [complex manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold"), or [Riemann surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface"), called the extended complex plane or the [Riemann sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere "Riemann sphere").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-37) Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (which leads to the one exception that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables [division by zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_zero "Division by zero"), namely ![Image 26: {\displaystyle z/0=\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d8796ee3f88b038e113bfd7a20633183722a6d7) for any nonzero [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")_![Image 27: {\displaystyle z}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/bf368e72c009decd9b6686ee84a375632e11de98)_. In this context, it is often useful to consider [meromorphic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meromorphic_function "Meromorphic function") as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21) at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of [Möbius transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation "Möbius transformation") (see [Möbius transformation § Overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation#Overview "Möbius transformation")).

### Nonstandard analysis

Infinitesimals (ε) and infinities (ω) on the hyperreal number line (1/ε = ω/1)

The original formulation of [infinitesimal calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_calculus "Infinitesimal calculus") by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and Gottfried Leibniz used infinitesimal quantities. In the second half of the 20th century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various [logical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_system "Logical system"), including [smooth infinitesimal analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_infinitesimal_analysis "Smooth infinitesimal analysis") and [nonstandard analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_analysis "Nonstandard analysis"). In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a [hyperreal field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number "Hyperreal number"); there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian [transfinites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number "Transfinite number"). For example, if H is an infinite number in this sense, then H+H=2H and H+1 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to [non-standard calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_calculus "Non-standard calculus") is fully developed in [Keisler (1986)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#CITEREFKeisler1986).

One-to-one correspondence between an infinite set and its proper subset

A different form of "infinity" is the [ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number "Ordinal number") and [cardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number "Cardinal number") infinities of set theory—a system of [transfinite numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number "Transfinite number") first developed by [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor "Georg Cantor"). In this system, the first transfinite cardinal is [aleph-null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph-null "Aleph-null") (ℵ 0), the cardinality of the set of [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"). This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late 19th century from works by Cantor, [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege "Gottlob Frege"), [Richard Dedekind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dedekind "Richard Dedekind") and others—using the idea of collections or sets.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-:1-1)

Dedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of [one-to-one correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_correspondence "One-to-one correspondence") as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (derived from [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part. (However, see [Galileo's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_paradox "Galileo's paradox") where Galileo concludes that positive integers cannot be compared to the subset of positive [square integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number "Square number") since both are infinite sets.) An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its [proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_subset "Proper subset") parts; this notion of infinity is called [Dedekind infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_infinite "Dedekind infinite"). The diagram to the right gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. "size".[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-38)

Cantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: [ordinal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number "Ordinal number") and [cardinal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number "Cardinal number"). Ordinal numbers characterize [well-ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordered "Well-ordered") sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and (ordinary) infinite [sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") which are maps from the positive [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers "Integers") leads to [mappings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") from ordinal numbers to transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is [countably infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set "Countable set"). If a set is too large to be put in one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called _[uncountable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable\_set "Uncountable set")_. Cantor's views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity as part of a consistent and coherent theory.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-39) Certain extended number systems, such as the [hyperreal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number "Hyperreal number"), incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-40)

### Cardinality of the continuum

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Infinity&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Cardinality of the continuum")]

One of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8798d172f59e21f2ce193a3118d4063d19353ded) is greater than that of the natural numbers ![Image 32: {\displaystyle {\aleph _{0}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/98d41341ae020c937dee3df105f059eb93ed96c8); that is, there are more real numbers **R** than natural numbers **N**. Namely, Cantor showed that ![Image 33: {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} =2^{\aleph _{0}}>{\aleph _{0}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16d9e38e6111127ba395d142775504a2dbe9fe55).[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-41)

The [continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis "Continuum hypothesis") states that there is no [cardinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number "Cardinal number") between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is, ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} =\aleph _{1}=\beth _{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b0ad512ea947a600dace4fec2372d2f9ef1f6c20).

This hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved within the widely accepted [Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory "Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory"), even assuming the [Axiom of Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_Choice "Axiom of Choice").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-42)

[Cardinal arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_arithmetic "Cardinal arithmetic") can be used to show not only that the number of points in a [real number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number_line "Real number line") is equal to the number of points in any [segment of that line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment"), but also that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any [finite-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-dimensional "Finite-dimensional") space.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-43)

[![Image 35](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Peanocurve.svg/250px-Peanocurve.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Peanocurve.svg)

The first three steps of a fractal construction whose limit is a [space-filling curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve "Space-filling curve"), showing that there are as many points in a one-dimensional line as in a two-dimensional square

The first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_(trigonometric_function) "Tangent (trigonometric function)") function, which provides a [one-to-one correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_correspondence "One-to-one correspondence") between the [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") (−⁠π/2⁠, ⁠π/2⁠) and**R**.

The second result was proved by Cantor in 1878, but only became intuitively apparent in 1890, when [Giuseppe Peano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano "Giuseppe Peano") introduced the [space-filling curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve "Space-filling curve"), curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube"), or [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube "Hypercube"), or finite-dimensional space. These curves can be used to define a one-to-one correspondence between the points on one side of a square and the points in the square.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-44)

Until the end of the 19th century, infinity was rarely discussed in [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), except in the context of processes that could be continued without any limit. For example, a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") was what is now called a [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment"), with the proviso that one can extend it as far as one wants; but extending it _infinitely_ was out of the question. Similarly, a line was usually not considered to be composed of infinitely many points but was a location where a point may be placed. Even if there are infinitely many possible positions, only a finite number of points could be placed on a line. A witness of this is the expression "the [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") of _a point_ that satisfies some property" (singular), where modern mathematicians would generally say "the set of _the points_ that have the property" (plural).

One of the rare exceptions of a mathematical concept involving [actual infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_infinity "Actual infinity") was [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"), where [points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_at_infinity "Points at infinity") are added to the [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") for modeling the [perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "Perspective (graphical)") effect that shows [parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines "Parallel lines") intersecting "at infinity". Mathematically, points at infinity have the advantage of allowing one to not consider some special cases. For example, in a [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"), two distinct [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") intersect in exactly one point, whereas without points at infinity, there are no intersection points for parallel lines. So, parallel and non-parallel lines must be studied separately in classical geometry, while they need not be distinguished in projective geometry.

Before the use of [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory") for the [foundation of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_of_mathematics "Foundation of mathematics"), points and lines were viewed as distinct entities, and a point could be _located on a line_. With the universal use of set theory in mathematics, the point of view has dramatically changed: a line is now considered as _the set of its points_, and one says that a point _belongs to a line_ instead of _is located on a line_ (however, the latter phrase is still used).

In particular, in modern mathematics, lines are _infinite sets_.

The [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") that occur in classical [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") have always a finite [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space) "Dimension (vector space)"), generally two or three. However, this is not implied by the abstract definition of a vector space, and vector spaces of infinite dimension can be considered. This is typically the case in [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis") where [function spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space") are generally vector spaces of infinite dimension.

In topology, some constructions can generate [topological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") of infinite dimension. In particular, this is the case of [iterated loop spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_loop_space "Iterated loop space").

The structure of a [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal") object is reiterated in its magnifications. Fractals can be magnified indefinitely without losing their structure and becoming "smooth"; they have infinite perimeters and can have infinite or finite areas. One such [fractal curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_curve "Fractal curve") with an infinite perimeter and finite area is the [Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake "Koch snowflake").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-45)

[Leopold Kronecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Kronecker "Leopold Kronecker") was skeptical of the notion of infinity and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism was developed in the [philosophy of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics "Philosophy of mathematics") called [finitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitism "Finitism"), an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of [constructivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constructivism "Mathematical constructivism") and [intuitionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism "Intuitionism").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-46)

In [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), an [infinite regress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_regress "Infinite regress") argument is "a distinctively philosophical kind of argument purporting to show that a thesis is defective because it generates an infinite series when either (form A) no such series exists or (form B) were it to exist, the thesis would lack the role (e.g.,of justification) that it is supposed to play."[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-47)

In [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic"), both the [compactness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness_theorem "Compactness theorem") and [Löwenheim–Skolem theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_theorem "Löwenheim–Skolem theorem") are used to construct [non-standard models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_model_of_arithmetic "Non-standard model of arithmetic") with certain infinite properties.

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), approximations of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") are used for [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory) "Continuum (theory)") measurements and [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") are used for [discrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable "Countable") measurements (i.e., counting). Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite [plane wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_wave "Plane wave") exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-48)

The first published proposal that the universe is infinite came from Thomas Digges in 1576.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-49) Eight years later, in 1584, the Italian philosopher and astronomer [Giordano Bruno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno "Giordano Bruno") proposed an unbounded universe in _On the Infinite Universe and Worlds_: "Innumerable suns exist; innumerable earths revolve around these suns in a manner similar to the way the seven planets revolve around our sun. Living beings inhabit these worlds."[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-50)

[Cosmologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") have long sought to discover whether infinity exists in our physical [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"): Are there an infinite number of stars? Does the universe have infinite volume? Does space "[go on forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe "Shape of the universe")"? This is still an open question of [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology"). The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge. By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth's curvature, one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from. The universe, at least in principle, might have a similar [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"). If so, one might eventually return to one's starting point after travelling in a straight line through the universe for long enough.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-51)

The curvature of the universe can be measured through [multipole moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipole_moments "Multipole moments") in the spectrum of the [cosmic background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation "Cosmic microwave background radiation"). To date, analysis of the radiation patterns recorded by the [WMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAP "WMAP") spacecraft hints that the universe has a flat topology. This would be consistent with an infinite physical universe.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-NASA_Shape-52)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-Fermi_Flat-53)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-54)

However, the universe could be finite, even if its curvature is flat. An easy way to understand this is to consider two-dimensional examples, such as video games where items that leave one edge of the screen reappear on the other. The topology of such games is [toroidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus") and the geometry is flat. Many possible bounded, flat possibilities also exist for three-dimensional space.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-55)

The concept of infinity also extends to the [multiverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse "Multiverse") hypothesis, which, when explained by astrophysicists such as [Michio Kaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku "Michio Kaku"), posits that there are an infinite number and variety of universes.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-56) Also, [cyclic models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model "Cyclic model") posit an infinite amount of [Big Bangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"), resulting in an infinite variety of universes after each Big Bang event in an infinite cycle.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-Nautilus2014-57)

The [IEEE floating-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating-point "IEEE floating-point") standard (IEEE 754) specifies a positive and a negative infinity value (and also [indefinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN "NaN") values). These are defined as the result of [arithmetic overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_overflow "Arithmetic overflow"), [division by zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_zero "Division by zero"), and other exceptional operations.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-58)

Some [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language"), such as [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)")[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-59) and [J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language) "J (programming language)"),[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-60) allow the programmer an explicit access to the positive and negative infinity values as language constants. These can be used as [greatest and least elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_element "Greatest element"), as they compare (respectively) greater than or less than all other values. They have uses as [sentinel values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value "Sentinel value") in [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") involving [sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting "Sorting"), [searching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm "Search algorithm"), or [windowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function "Window function").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In languages that do not have greatest and least elements but do allow [overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading "Operator overloading") of [relational operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator "Relational operator"), it is possible for a programmer to _create_ the greatest and least elements. In languages that do not provide explicit access to such values from the initial state of the program but do implement the floating-point [data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type "Data type"), the infinity values may still be accessible and usable as the result of certain operations.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In programming, an [infinite loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_loop "Infinite loop") is a [loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(computing) "Loop (computing)") whose exit condition is never satisfied, thus executing indefinitely.

[Perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "Perspective (graphical)") artwork uses the concept of [vanishing points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_point "Vanishing point"), roughly corresponding to mathematical [points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity "Point at infinity"), located at an infinite distance from the observer. This allows artists to create paintings that realistically render space, distances, and forms.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-61) Artist [M.C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.C._Escher "M.C. Escher") is specifically known for employing the concept of infinity in his work in this and other ways.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-62)

Variations of [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess "Chess") played on an unbounded board are called [infinite chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_chess "Infinite chess").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-63)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-64)

[Cognitive scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science")[George Lakoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff "George Lakoff") considers the concept of infinity in mathematics and the sciences as a metaphor. This perspective is based on the basic metaphor of infinity(BMI), defined as the ever-increasing sequence <1, 2, 3, …>.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#cite_note-65)
