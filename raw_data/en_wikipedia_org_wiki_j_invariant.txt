It is the unique such function that is holomorphic away from a simple pole at the cusp such that j ( e 2 π π i / 3 ) = 0 , j ( i ) = 1728 = 12 3 .

{\displaystyle j{\big (}e^{2\pi i/3}{\big )}=0,\quad j(i)=1728=12^{3}.} Rational functions of j {\displaystyle j} are modular, and in fact give all modular functions of weight 0. Classically, the j {\displaystyle j} -invariant was studied as a parameterization of elliptic curves over C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } , but it also has surprising connections to the symmetries of the Monster group (this connection is referred to as monstrous moonshine ).

Definition [ edit ] Real part of the j -invariant as a function of the square of the nome on the unit disk Phase of the j -invariant as a function of the square of the nome on the unit disk Further information: Elliptic curve § Elliptic curves over the complex numbers , and Modular forms The j -invariant can be defined as a function on the upper half-plane H = { τ τ ∈ ∈ C ∣ ∣ Im ⁡ ⁡ ( τ τ ) > 0 } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}=\{\tau \in \mathbb {C} \mid \operatorname {Im} (\tau )>0\}} , by j ( τ τ ) = 1728 g 2 ( τ τ ) 3 Δ Δ ( τ τ ) = 1728 g 2 ( τ τ ) 3 g 2 ( τ τ ) 3 − − 27 g 3 ( τ τ ) 2 = 1728 g 2 ( τ τ ) 3 ( 2 π π ) 12 η η 24 ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle j(\tau )=1728{\frac {g_{2}(\tau )^{3}}{\Delta (\tau )}}=1728{\frac {g_{2}(\tau )^{3}}{g_{2}(\tau )^{3}-27g_{3}(\tau )^{2}}}=1728{\frac {g_{2}(\tau )^{3}}{(2\pi )^{12}\,\eta ^{24}(\tau )}}} with the third definition implying j ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle j(\tau )} can be expressed as a cube , also since 1728 = 12 3 {\displaystyle {}=12^{3}} . The function cannot be continued analytically beyond the upper half-plane due to the natural boundary at the real line.

The given functions are the modular discriminant Δ Δ ( τ τ ) = g 2 ( τ τ ) 3 − − 27 g 3 ( τ τ ) 2 = ( 2 π π ) 12 η η 24 ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle \Delta (\tau )=g_{2}(\tau )^{3}-27g_{3}(\tau )^{2}=(2\pi )^{12}\,\eta ^{24}(\tau )} , Dedekind eta function η η ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle \eta (\tau )} , and modular invariants, g 2 ( τ τ ) = 60 G 4 ( τ τ ) = 60 ∑ ∑ ( m , n ) ≠ ≠ ( 0 , 0 ) ( m + n τ τ ) − − 4 {\displaystyle g_{2}(\tau )=60G_{4}(\tau )=60\sum _{(m,n)\neq (0,0)}\left(m+n\tau \right)^{-4}} g 3 ( τ τ ) = 140 G 6 ( τ τ ) = 140 ∑ ∑ ( m , n ) ≠ ≠ ( 0 , 0 ) ( m + n τ τ ) − − 6 {\displaystyle g_{3}(\tau )=140G_{6}(\tau )=140\sum _{(m,n)\neq (0,0)}\left(m+n\tau \right)^{-6}} where G 4 ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle G_{4}(\tau )} , G 6 ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle G_{6}(\tau )} are Fourier series , G 4 ( τ τ ) = π π 4 45 E 4 ( τ τ ) G 6 ( τ τ ) = 2 π π 6 945 E 6 ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}G_{4}(\tau )&={\frac {\pi ^{4}}{45}}\,E_{4}(\tau )\\[4pt]G_{6}(\tau )&={\frac {2\pi ^{6}}{945}}\,E_{6}(\tau )\end{aligned}}} and E 4 ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle E_{4}(\tau )} , E 6 ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle E_{6}(\tau )} are Eisenstein series , E 4 ( τ τ ) = 1 + 240 ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ n 3 q n 1 − − q n E 6 ( τ τ ) = 1 − − 504 ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ n 5 q n 1 − − q n {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}E_{4}(\tau )&=1+240\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {n^{3}q^{n}}{1-q^{n}}}\\[4pt]E_{6}(\tau )&=1-504\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {n^{5}q^{n}}{1-q^{n}}}\end{aligned}}} and q = e 2 π π i τ τ {\displaystyle q=e^{2\pi i\tau }} (the square of the nome ). The j -invariant can then be directly expressed in terms of the Eisenstein series as, j ( τ τ ) = 1728 E 4 ( τ τ ) 3 E 4 ( τ τ ) 3 − − E 6 ( τ τ ) 2 {\displaystyle j(\tau )=1728{\frac {E_{4}(\tau )^{3}}{E_{4}(\tau )^{3}-E_{6}(\tau )^{2}}}} with no numerical factor other than 1728. This implies a third way to define the modular discriminant, [ 1 ] Δ Δ ( τ τ ) = ( 2 π π ) 12 E 4 ( τ τ ) 3 − − E 6 ( τ τ ) 2 1728 {\displaystyle \Delta (\tau )=(2\pi )^{12}\,{\frac {E_{4}(\tau )^{3}-E_{6}(\tau )^{2}}{1728}}} For example, using the definitions above and τ τ = 2 i {\displaystyle \tau =2i} , then the Dedekind eta function η η ( 2 i ) {\displaystyle \eta (2i)} has the exact value , η η ( 2 i ) = Γ Γ ( 1 4 ) 2 11 / 8 π π 3 / 4 {\displaystyle \eta (2i)={\frac {\Gamma \left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)}{2^{11/8}\pi ^{3/4}}}} implying the transcendental numbers , g 2 ( 2 i ) = 11 Γ Γ ( 1 4 ) 8 2 8 π π 2 , g 3 ( 2 i ) = 7 Γ Γ ( 1 4 ) 12 2 12 π π 3 {\displaystyle g_{2}(2i)={\frac {11\,\Gamma \left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)^{8}}{2^{8}\pi ^{2}}},\qquad g_{3}(2i)={\frac {7\,\Gamma \left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)^{12}}{2^{12}\pi ^{3}}}} but yielding the algebraic number (in fact, an integer ), j ( 2 i ) = 1728 g 2 ( 2 i ) 3 g 2 ( 2 i ) 3 − − 27 g 3 ( 2 i ) 2 = 66 3 .

{\displaystyle j(2i)=1728{\frac {g_{2}(2i)^{3}}{g_{2}(2i)^{3}-27g_{3}(2i)^{2}}}=66^{3}.} In general, this can be motivated by viewing each τ as representing an isomorphism class of elliptic curves. Every elliptic curve E over C is a complex torus, and thus can be identified with a rank 2 lattice; that is, a two-dimensional lattice of C . This lattice can be rotated and scaled (operations that preserve the isomorphism class), so that it is generated by 1 and τ ∈ H . This lattice corresponds to the elliptic curve y 2 = 4 x 3 − − g 2 ( τ τ ) x − − g 3 ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle y^{2}=4x^{3}-g_{2}(\tau )x-g_{3}(\tau )} (see Weierstrass elliptic functions ).

Note that j is defined everywhere in H as the modular discriminant is non-zero. This is due to the corresponding cubic polynomial having distinct roots.

The fundamental region [ edit ] The usual choice of a fundamental domain (gray) for the modular group acting on the upper half plane.

It can be shown that Δ is a modular form of weight twelve, and g 2 one of weight four, so that its third power is also of weight twelve. Thus their quotient, and therefore j , is a modular function of weight zero, in particular a holomorphic function H → C invariant under the action of SL(2, Z ) . Quotienting out by its centre { ±I } yields the modular group , which we may identify with the projective special linear group PSL(2, Z ) .

By a suitable choice of transformation belonging to this group, τ τ ↦ ↦ a τ τ + b c τ τ + d , a d − − b c = 1 , {\displaystyle \tau \mapsto {\frac {a\tau +b}{c\tau +d}},\qquad ad-bc=1,} we may reduce τ to a value giving the same value for j , and lying in the fundamental region for j , which consists of values for τ satisfying the conditions | τ τ | ≥ ≥ 1 − − 1 2 < R ( τ τ ) ≤ ≤ 1 2 − − 1 2 < R ( τ τ ) < 0 ⇒ ⇒ | τ τ | > 1 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}|\tau |&\geq 1\\[5pt]-{\tfrac {1}{2}}&<{\mathfrak {R}}(\tau )\leq {\tfrac {1}{2}}\\[5pt]-{\tfrac {1}{2}}&<{\mathfrak {R}}(\tau )<0\Rightarrow |\tau |>1\end{aligned}}} The function j ( τ ) when restricted to this region still takes on every value in the complex numbers C exactly once.  In other words, for every c in C , there is a unique τ in the fundamental region such that c = j ( τ ) . Thus, j has the property of mapping the fundamental region to the entire complex plane.

Additionally two values τ,τ' ∈ H produce the same elliptic curve iff τ = T(τ') for some T ∈ PSL(2, Z ) . This means j provides a bijection from the set of elliptic curves over C to the complex plane.

[ 2 ] As a Riemann surface , the fundamental region has genus 0 , and every ( level one ) modular function is a rational function in j ; and, conversely, every rational function in j is a modular function. In other words, the field of modular functions is C ( j ) .

Class field theory and j [ edit ] Further information: Complex multiplication and Hilbert's twelfth problem The j -invariant has many remarkable properties: If τ is any point of the upper half plane whose corresponding elliptic curve has complex multiplication (that is, if τ is any element of an imaginary quadratic field with positive imaginary part, so that j is defined), then j ( τ ) is an algebraic integer .

[ 3 ] These special values are called singular moduli .

The field extension Q [ j ( τ ), τ ]/ Q ( τ ) is abelian, that is, it has an abelian Galois group .

Let Λ be the lattice in C generated by {1, τ }.

It is easy to see that all of the elements of Q ( τ ) which fix Λ under multiplication form a ring with units, called an order . The other lattices with generators {1, τ ′ }, associated in like manner to the same order define the algebraic conjugates j ( τ ′ ) of j ( τ ) over Q ( τ ) . Ordered by inclusion, the unique maximal order in Q ( τ ) is the ring of algebraic integers of Q ( τ ) , and values of τ having it as its associated order lead to unramified extensions of Q ( τ ) .

These classical results are the starting point for the theory of complex multiplication.

Transcendence properties [ edit ] In 1937 Theodor Schneider proved the aforementioned result that if τ is a quadratic irrational number in the upper half plane then j ( τ ) is an algebraic integer.  In addition he proved that if τ is an algebraic number but not imaginary quadratic then j ( τ ) is transcendental.

The j function has numerous other transcendental properties.

Kurt Mahler conjectured a particular transcendence result that is often referred to as Mahler's conjecture, though it was proved as a corollary of results by Yu. V. Nesterenko and Patrice Phillipon in the 1990s.  Mahler's conjecture (now proven) is that, if τ is in the upper half plane, then e 2π iτ and j ( τ ) are never both simultaneously algebraic. Stronger results are now known, for example if e 2π iτ is algebraic then the following three numbers are algebraically independent, and thus at least two of them transcendental: j ( τ τ ) , j ′ ′ ( τ τ ) π π , j ′ ′ ′ ′ ( τ τ ) π π 2 {\displaystyle j(\tau ),{\frac {j^{\prime }(\tau )}{\pi }},{\frac {j^{\prime \prime }(\tau )}{\pi ^{2}}}} The q -expansion and moonshine [ edit ] Several remarkable properties of j have to do with its q -expansion ( Fourier series expansion), written as a Laurent series in terms of q = e 2π iτ , which begins: j ( τ τ ) = q − − 1 + 744 + 196884 q + 21493760 q 2 + 864299970 q 3 + 20245856256 q 4 + ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle j(\tau )=q^{-1}+744+196884q+21493760q^{2}+864299970q^{3}+20245856256q^{4}+\cdots } Note that j has a simple pole at the cusp, so its q -expansion  has no terms below q −1 .

All the Fourier coefficients are integers, which results in several almost integers , notably Ramanujan's constant : e π π 163 ≈ ≈ 640320 3 + 744 {\displaystyle e^{\pi {\sqrt {163}}}\approx 640320^{3}+744} .

The asymptotic formula for the coefficient of q n is given by e 4 π π n 2 n 3 / 4 {\displaystyle {\frac {e^{4\pi {\sqrt {n}}}}{{\sqrt {2}}\,n^{3/4}}}} , as can be proved by the Hardy–Littlewood circle method .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Moonshine [ edit ] More remarkably, the Fourier coefficients for the positive exponents of q are the dimensions of the graded part of an infinite-dimensional graded algebra representation of the monster group called the moonshine module – specifically, the coefficient of q n is the dimension of grade- n part of the moonshine module, the first example being the Griess algebra , which has dimension 196,884, corresponding to the term 196884 q . This startling observation, first made by John McKay , was the starting point for moonshine theory .

The study of the Moonshine conjecture led John Horton Conway and Simon P. Norton to look at the genus-zero modular functions. If they are normalized to have the form q − − 1 + O ( q ) {\displaystyle q^{-1}+{O}(q)} then John G. Thompson showed that there are only a finite number of such functions (of some finite level), and Chris J. Cummins later showed that there are exactly 6486 of them, 616 of which have integral coefficients.

[ 6 ] Alternate expressions [ edit ] We have j ( τ τ ) = 256 ( 1 − − x ) 3 x 2 {\displaystyle j(\tau )={\frac {256\left(1-x\right)^{3}}{x^{2}}}} where x = λ (1 − λ ) and λ is the modular lambda function λ λ ( τ τ ) = θ θ 2 4 ( e π π i τ τ ) θ θ 3 4 ( e π π i τ τ ) = k 2 ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle \lambda (\tau )={\frac {\theta _{2}^{4}(e^{\pi i\tau })}{\theta _{3}^{4}(e^{\pi i\tau })}}=k^{2}(\tau )} a ratio of Jacobi theta functions θ m , and is the square of the elliptic modulus k ( τ ) .

[ 7 ] The value of j is unchanged when λ is replaced by any of the six values of the cross-ratio : [ 8 ] { λ λ , 1 1 − − λ λ , λ λ − − 1 λ λ , 1 λ λ , λ λ λ λ − − 1 , 1 − − λ λ } {\displaystyle \left\lbrace {\lambda ,{\frac {1}{1-\lambda }},{\frac {\lambda -1}{\lambda }},{\frac {1}{\lambda }},{\frac {\lambda }{\lambda -1}},1-\lambda }\right\rbrace } The branch points of j are at {0, 1, ∞} , so that j is a Belyi function .

[ 9 ] Expressions in terms of theta functions [ edit ] Define the nome q = e π iτ and the Jacobi theta function , ϑ ϑ ( 0 ; τ τ ) = ϑ ϑ 00 ( 0 ; τ τ ) = 1 + 2 ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ ( e π π i τ τ ) n 2 = ∑ ∑ n = − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ q n 2 {\displaystyle \vartheta (0;\tau )=\vartheta _{00}(0;\tau )=1+2\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\left(e^{\pi i\tau }\right)^{n^{2}}=\sum _{n=-\infty }^{\infty }q^{n^{2}}} from which one can derive the auxiliary theta functions, defined here . Let, a = θ θ 2 ( q ) = ϑ ϑ 10 ( 0 ; τ τ ) b = θ θ 3 ( q ) = ϑ ϑ 00 ( 0 ; τ τ ) c = θ θ 4 ( q ) = ϑ ϑ 01 ( 0 ; τ τ ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a&=\theta _{2}(q)=\vartheta _{10}(0;\tau )\\b&=\theta _{3}(q)=\vartheta _{00}(0;\tau )\\c&=\theta _{4}(q)=\vartheta _{01}(0;\tau )\end{aligned}}} where ϑ ij and θ n are alternative notations, and a 4 − b 4 + c 4 = 0 .  Then we have the for modular invariants g 2 , g 3 , g 2 ( τ τ ) = 2 3 π π 4 ( a 8 + b 8 + c 8 ) g 3 ( τ τ ) = 4 27 π π 6 ( a 8 + b 8 + c 8 ) 3 − − 54 ( a b c ) 8 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}g_{2}(\tau )&={\tfrac {2}{3}}\pi ^{4}\left(a^{8}+b^{8}+c^{8}\right)\\g_{3}(\tau )&={\tfrac {4}{27}}\pi ^{6}{\sqrt {\frac {\left(a^{8}+b^{8}+c^{8}\right)^{3}-54\left(abc\right)^{8}}{2}}}\\\end{aligned}}} and modular discriminant, Δ Δ = g 2 3 − − 27 g 3 2 = ( 2 π π ) 12 ( 1 2 a b c ) 8 = ( 2 π π ) 12 η η ( τ τ ) 24 {\displaystyle \Delta =g_{2}^{3}-27g_{3}^{2}=(2\pi )^{12}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}}abc\right)^{8}=(2\pi )^{12}\eta (\tau )^{24}} with Dedekind eta function η ( τ ) . The j ( τ ) can then be rapidly computed, j ( τ τ ) = 1728 g 2 3 g 2 3 − − 27 g 3 2 = 32 ( a 8 + b 8 + c 8 ) 3 ( a b c ) 8 {\displaystyle j(\tau )=1728{\frac {g_{2}^{3}}{g_{2}^{3}-27g_{3}^{2}}}=32{\frac {\left(a^{8}+b^{8}+c^{8}\right)^{3}}{\left(abc\right)^{8}}}} Algebraic definition [ edit ] So far we have been considering j as a function of a complex variable. However, as an invariant for isomorphism classes of elliptic curves, it can be defined purely algebraically.

[ 10 ] Let y 2 + a 1 x y + a 3 y = x 3 + a 2 x 2 + a 4 x + a 6 {\displaystyle y^{2}+a_{1}xy+a_{3}y=x^{3}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{4}x+a_{6}} be a plane elliptic curve over any field . Then we may perform successive transformations to get the above equation into the standard form y 2 = 4 x 3 − g 2 x − g 3 (note that this transformation can only be made when the characteristic of the field is not equal to 2 or 3). The resulting coefficients are: b 2 = a 1 2 + 4 a 2 , b 4 = a 1 a 3 + 2 a 4 , b 6 = a 3 2 + 4 a 6 , b 8 = a 1 2 a 6 − − a 1 a 3 a 4 + a 2 a 3 2 + 4 a 2 a 6 − − a 4 2 , c 4 = b 2 2 − − 24 b 4 , c 6 = − − b 2 3 + 36 b 2 b 4 − − 216 b 6 , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}b_{2}&=a_{1}^{2}+4a_{2},\quad &b_{4}&=a_{1}a_{3}+2a_{4},\\b_{6}&=a_{3}^{2}+4a_{6},\quad &b_{8}&=a_{1}^{2}a_{6}-a_{1}a_{3}a_{4}+a_{2}a_{3}^{2}+4a_{2}a_{6}-a_{4}^{2},\\c_{4}&=b_{2}^{2}-24b_{4},\quad &c_{6}&=-b_{2}^{3}+36b_{2}b_{4}-216b_{6},\end{aligned}}} where g 2 = c 4 and g 3 = c 6 .  We also have the discriminant Δ Δ = − − b 2 2 b 8 + 9 b 2 b 4 b 6 − − 8 b 4 3 − − 27 b 6 2 .

{\displaystyle \Delta =-b_{2}^{2}b_{8}+9b_{2}b_{4}b_{6}-8b_{4}^{3}-27b_{6}^{2}.} The j -invariant for the elliptic curve may now be defined as j = c 4 3 Δ Δ {\displaystyle j={\frac {c_{4}^{3}}{\Delta }}} In the case that the field over which the curve is defined has characteristic different from 2 or 3, this is equal to j = 1728 c 4 3 c 4 3 − − c 6 2 .

{\displaystyle j=1728{\frac {c_{4}^{3}}{c_{4}^{3}-c_{6}^{2}}}.} Inverse function [ edit ] The inverse function of the j -invariant can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function 2 F 1 (see also the article Picard–Fuchs equation ). Explicitly, given a number N , to solve the equation j ( τ ) = N for τ can be done in at least four ways.

Method 1 : Solving the sextic in λ , j ( τ τ ) = 256 ( 1 − − λ λ ( 1 − − λ λ ) ) 3 ( λ λ ( 1 − − λ λ ) ) 2 = 256 ( 1 − − x ) 3 x 2 {\displaystyle j(\tau )={\frac {256{\bigl (}1-\lambda (1-\lambda ){\bigr )}^{3}}{{\bigl (}\lambda (1-\lambda ){\bigr )}^{2}}}={\frac {256\left(1-x\right)^{3}}{x^{2}}}} where x = λ (1 − λ ) , and λ is the modular lambda function so the sextic can be solved as a cubic in x . Then, τ τ = i 2 F 1 ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 1 ; 1 − − λ λ ) 2 F 1 ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 1 ; λ λ ) = i M ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 , 1 − − λ λ ) M ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 , λ λ ) {\displaystyle \tau =i\ {\frac {{}_{2}F_{1}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}},{\tfrac {1}{2}},1;1-\lambda \right)}{{}_{2}F_{1}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}},{\tfrac {1}{2}},1;\lambda \right)}}=i{\frac {\operatorname {M} (1,{\sqrt {1-\lambda }})}{\operatorname {M} (1,{\sqrt {\lambda }})}}} for any of the six values of λ , where M is the arithmetic–geometric mean .

[ note 1 ] Method 2 : Solving the quartic in γ , j ( τ τ ) = 27 ( 1 + 8 γ γ ) 3 γ γ ( 1 − − γ γ ) 3 {\displaystyle j(\tau )={\frac {27\left(1+8\gamma \right)^{3}}{\gamma \left(1-\gamma \right)^{3}}}} then for any of the four roots , τ τ = i 3 2 F 1 ( 1 3 , 2 3 , 1 ; 1 − − γ γ ) 2 F 1 ( 1 3 , 2 3 , 1 ; γ γ ) {\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {i}{\sqrt {3}}}{\frac {{}_{2}F_{1}\left({\tfrac {1}{3}},{\tfrac {2}{3}},1;1-\gamma \right)}{{}_{2}F_{1}\left({\tfrac {1}{3}},{\tfrac {2}{3}},1;\gamma \right)}}} Method 3 : Solving the cubic in β , j ( τ τ ) = 64 ( 1 + 3 β β ) 3 β β ( 1 − − β β ) 2 {\displaystyle j(\tau )={\frac {64\left(1+3\beta \right)^{3}}{\beta \left(1-\beta \right)^{2}}}} then for any of the three roots, τ τ = i 2 2 F 1 ( 1 4 , 3 4 , 1 ; 1 − − β β ) 2 F 1 ( 1 4 , 3 4 , 1 ; β β ) {\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {i}{\sqrt {2}}}{\frac {{}_{2}F_{1}\left({\tfrac {1}{4}},{\tfrac {3}{4}},1;1-\beta \right)}{{}_{2}F_{1}\left({\tfrac {1}{4}},{\tfrac {3}{4}},1;\beta \right)}}} Method 4 : Solving the quadratic in α , j ( τ τ ) = 1728 4 α α ( 1 − − α α ) {\displaystyle j(\tau )={\frac {1728}{4\alpha (1-\alpha )}}} then, τ τ = i 2 F 1 ( 1 6 , 5 6 , 1 ; 1 − − α α ) 2 F 1 ( 1 6 , 5 6 , 1 ; α α ) {\displaystyle \tau =i\ {\frac {{}_{2}F_{1}\left({\tfrac {1}{6}},{\tfrac {5}{6}},1;1-\alpha \right)}{{}_{2}F_{1}\left({\tfrac {1}{6}},{\tfrac {5}{6}},1;\alpha \right)}}} One root gives τ , and the other gives − ⁠ 1 / τ ⁠ , but since j ( τ ) = j (− ⁠ 1 / τ ⁠ ) , it makes no difference which α is chosen. The latter three methods can be found in Ramanujan 's theory of elliptic functions to alternative bases.

The inversion is applied in high-precision calculations of elliptic function periods even as their ratios become unbounded.

[ citation needed ] A related result is the expressibility via quadratic radicals of the values of j at the points of the imaginary axis whose magnitudes are powers of 2 (thus permitting compass and straightedge constructions ). The latter result is hardly evident since the modular equation for j of order 2 is cubic.

Failure to classify elliptic curves over other fields [ edit ] The j {\displaystyle j} -invariant is only sensitive to isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over the complex numbers, or more generally, an algebraically closed field . Over other fields there exist examples of elliptic curves whose j {\displaystyle j} -invariant is the same, but are non-isomorphic. For example, let E 1 , E 2 {\displaystyle E_{1},E_{2}} be the elliptic curves associated to the polynomials E 1 : y 2 = x 3 − − 25 x E 2 : y 2 = x 3 − − 4 x , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}E_{1}:&{\text{ }}y^{2}=x^{3}-25x\\E_{2}:&{\text{ }}y^{2}=x^{3}-4x,\end{aligned}}} both having j {\displaystyle j} -invariant 1728 {\displaystyle 1728} . Then, the rational points of E 2 {\displaystyle E_{2}} can be computed as: E 2 ( Q ) = { ∞ ∞ , ( 2 , 0 ) , ( − − 2 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 0 ) } {\displaystyle E_{2}(\mathbb {Q} )=\{\infty ,(2,0),(-2,0),(0,0)\}} since x 3 − − 4 x = x ( x 2 − − 4 ) = x ( x − − 2 ) ( x + 2 ) .

{\displaystyle x^{3}-4x=x(x^{2}-4)=x(x-2)(x+2).} There are no rational solutions with y = a ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle y=a\neq 0} . This can be shown using Cardano's formula to show that in that case the solutions to x 3 − − 4 x − − a 2 {\displaystyle x^{3}-4x-a^{2}} are all irrational. 
On the other hand, on the set of points { n ( − − 4 , 6 ) : n ∈ ∈ Z } {\displaystyle \{n(-4,6):n\in \mathbb {Z} \}} the equation for E 1 {\displaystyle E_{1}} becomes 36 n 2 = − − 64 n 3 + 100 n {\displaystyle 36n^{2}=-64n^{3}+100n} . Dividing by 4 n {\displaystyle 4n} to eliminate the ( 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (0,0)} solution, the quadratic formula gives the rational solutions: n = − − 9 ± ± 81 − − 4 ⋅ ⋅ 16 ⋅ ⋅ ( − − 25 ) 2 ⋅ ⋅ 16 = − − 9 ± ± 41 32 .

{\displaystyle n={\frac {-9\pm {\sqrt {81-4\cdot 16\cdot (-25)}}}{2\cdot 16}}={\frac {-9\pm 41}{32}}.} If these curves are considered over Q ( 10 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} ({\sqrt {10}})} , there is an isomorphism E 1 ( Q ( 10 ) ) ≅ ≅ E 2 ( Q ( 10 ) ) {\displaystyle E_{1}(\mathbb {Q} ({\sqrt {10}}))\cong E_{2}(\mathbb {Q} ({\sqrt {10}}))} sending ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ ( μ μ 2 x , μ μ 3 y ) where μ μ = 10 2 .

{\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto (\mu ^{2}x,\mu ^{3}y)\ {\text{ where }}\ \mu ={\frac {\sqrt {10}}{2}}.} References [ edit ] Notes [ edit ] ^ The equality holds if the arithmetic–geometric mean M ⁡ ⁡ ( a , b ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {M} (a,b)} of complex numbers a , b {\displaystyle a,b} (such that a , b ≠ ≠ 0 ; a ≠ ≠ ± ± b {\displaystyle a,b\neq 0;a\neq \pm b} ) is defined as follows: Let a 0 = a {\displaystyle a_{0}=a} , b 0 = b {\displaystyle b_{0}=b} , a n + 1 = ( a n + b n ) / 2 {\displaystyle a_{n+1}=(a_{n}+b_{n})/2} , b n + 1 = ± ± a n b n {\displaystyle b_{n+1}=\pm {\sqrt {a_{n}b_{n}}}} where the signs are chosen such that | a n − − b n | ≤ ≤ | a n + b n | {\displaystyle |a_{n}-b_{n}|\leq |a_{n}+b_{n}|} for all n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} } . If | a n − − b n | = | a n + b n | {\displaystyle |a_{n}-b_{n}|=|a_{n}+b_{n}|} , the sign is chosen such that ℑ ℑ ( b n / a n ) > 0 {\displaystyle \Im (b_{n}/a_{n})>0} . Then M ⁡ ⁡ ( a , b ) = lim n → → ∞ ∞ a n = lim n → → ∞ ∞ b n {\displaystyle \operatorname {M} (a,b)=\lim _{n\to \infty }a_{n}=\lim _{n\to \infty }b_{n}} . When a , b {\displaystyle a,b} are positive real (with a ≠ ≠ b {\displaystyle a\neq b} ), this definition coincides with the usual definition of the arithmetic–geometric mean for positive real numbers.
