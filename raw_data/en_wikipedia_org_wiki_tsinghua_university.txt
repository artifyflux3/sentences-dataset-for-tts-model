It is affiliated with and funded by the Ministry of Education of China . The university is part of Project 211 , Project 985 , and the Double First-Class Construction . It is also a member in the C9 League .

Tsinghua University's campus is in northwest Beijing, on the site of the former imperial gardens of the Qing dynasty . The university has 21 schools and 59 departments, with faculties in science, engineering, humanities, law, medicine, history, philosophy, economics, management, education, and art.

[ 8 ] Since it was established in 1911, it has produced notable leaders in science, engineering, politics, business, and academia.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] History [ edit ] The plaque at the entrance of Tsinghua Garden . The garden is among the oldest components of the campus of Tsinghua University A glimpse of Xichun Garden , a Qing dynasty garden on Tsinghua University campus Built in 1917, the Grand Auditorium with its Jeffersonian architectural design is a centerpiece of the old campus Main article: History of Tsinghua University Further information: Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program Early 20th century (1911–1949) [ edit ] Tsinghua University was established in Beijing during a tumultuous period of national upheaval and conflicts with foreign powers which culminated in the Boxer Rebellion , an uprising against foreign influence in China. After the suppression of the revolt by a foreign alliance including the United States, the ruling Qing dynasty was required to pay indemnities to alliance members. United States Secretary of State John Hay suggested that the US$30 million Boxer indemnity allotted to the United States was excessive. After much negotiation with Qing ambassador Liang Cheng , president of the United States Theodore Roosevelt obtained approval from the United States Congress in 1909 to reduce the indemnity payment by US$10.8 million, on the condition that the funds would be used as scholarships for Chinese students to study in the United States.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Using this fund, the Tsinghua College ( 清華學堂 ; Qīnghuá Xuétáng ) was established in Beijing, on 29 April 1911 on the site of a former royal garden to serve as a preparatory school for students the government planned to send to the United States.

[ 13 ] Faculty members for sciences were recruited by the YMCA from the United States, and its graduates transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation.

[ citation needed ] The motto of Tsinghua, "Self-Discipline and Social Commitment", was derived from a 1914 speech by prominent scholar and faculty member Liang Qichao , in which he quoted the I Ching to describe a notion of the ideal gentleman.

[ 14 ] In 1925, the school established its own four-year undergraduate program and started a research institute on Chinese studies.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] In 1928, the school changed its name to National Tsinghua University.

[ 20 ] During the Second Sino-Japanese War , many Chinese universities were forced to evacuate their campuses to avoid the Japanese invasion. In 1937, Tsinghua University, Peking University and Nankai University merged to form the Changsha Temporary University, located in Changsha , Hunan . The merged university later became the National Southwestern Associated University , located in Kunming , Yunnan. The Tsinghua University section of the merged university returned to Beijing at the end of World War II.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Later 20th century (post-1949) [ edit ] After the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, China experienced a communist revolution leading to the creation of the People's Republic of China. Tsinghua University's then president Mei Yiqi , along with many professors, fled to Taiwan with the retreating Nationalist government . They established the National Tsing Hua Institute of Nuclear Technology in 1955, which later became the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, an institution independent and distinct from Tsinghua University.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] In 1952, the Chinese Communist Party regrouped the country's higher education institutions in an attempt to build a Soviet style system where each institution specialized in a certain field of study, such as social sciences or natural sciences.

[ 29 ] Tsinghua University was streamlined into a polytechnic institute with a focus on engineering and the natural sciences.

[ 30 ] In 1953, Tsinghua established a political counselor program, becoming the first university to do so following the Ministry of Education 's 1952 directive to begin piloting such programs.

[ 31 ] : 107 As political counselors, new graduates who were also Communist Party members worked as political counselors in managing the student body and student organizations, often simultaneously serving as Communist Youth League secretaries.

[ 31 ] : 107 The program was later expanded to other universities following its endorsement by Deng Xiaoping and became further institutionalized across China in the 1990s and 2000s.

[ 31 ] : 108 During the Third Front construction, Tsinghua established a branch in Mianyang , Sichuan province .

[ 32 ] In 1966, the efforts of Tsinghua researchers were critical in China's transition from vacuum-tube computers to fully transistorized computers .

[ 33 ] : 101 From 1966 to 1976, China experienced immense sociopolitical upheaval and instability during the Cultural Revolution . Many university students walked out of classrooms at Tsinghua and other institutions, and some went on to join the Red Guards , resulting in the complete shutdown of the university as faculty were persecuted or otherwise unable to teach.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] It was not until 1978, after the Cultural Revolution ended, that the university began to take in students and re-emerge as a force in Chinese politics and society.

[ 36 ] During the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign of 1973 to 1976, critique groups formed at Tsinghua and Peking University disseminated commentaries under the pseudonym of "Liang Xiao".

[ 37 ] The pseudonym sounds like a person's name but is a homophone for "two schools".

[ 37 ] In the 1980s, Tsinghua evolved beyond the polytechnic model and incorporated a multidisciplinary system emphasizing collaboration between distinct schools within the broader university environment.

[ 38 ] Under this system, several schools have been re-incorporated, including Tsinghua Law School , the School of Economics and Management , the School of Sciences, the School of Life Sciences, the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, the School of Public Policy and Management , and the Academy of Arts and Design.

[ 11 ] In 1996, the School of Economics and Management established a partnership with the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . One year later, Tsinghua and MIT began the MBA program known as the Tsinghua-MIT Global MBA.

[ 39 ] In 1998, Tsinghua became the first Chinese university to offer a Master of Laws (LLM) program in American law , through a cooperative venture with the Temple University Beasley School of Law .

[ 40 ] 21st century [ edit ] Tsinghua alumni include the current General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and paramount leader of China, Xi Jinping '79, who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering, along with the CCP General Secretary and former Paramount Leader of China Hu Jintao '64, who graduated with a degree in hydraulic engineering . In addition to its powerful alumni, Tsinghua has a reputation for hosting globally prominent guest speakers, with international leaders Bill Clinton , Tony Blair , Henry Kissinger , Carlos Ghosn , and Henry Paulson having lectured to the university community.

[ 41 ] As of 2018, Tsinghua University consists of 20 schools and 58 university departments, 41 research institutes, 35 research centers, and 167 laboratories, including 15 national key laboratories.

[ 42 ] In September 2006, the Peking Union Medical College , a renowned medical school, was renamed "Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University" although it and Tsinghua University are technically separate institutions.

[ 43 ] The university operates the Tsinghua University Press , which publishes academic journals, textbooks, and other scholarly works.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] The traditional He Tang Yue Se ( moonlit pond ) is part of the Qing dynasty Prince's Residence and Garden located on the grounds of Tsinghua University Through its constituent colleges, graduate and professional schools, and other institutes, Tsinghua University offers more than 82 bachelor's degree programs, 80 master's degree programs and 90 PhD programs.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] In 2014, Tsinghua established Xinya College, a residential liberal arts college, as a pilot project to reform undergraduate education at the university. Modeled after universities in the United States and Europe, Xinya combines general and professional education in a liberal arts tradition, featuring a core curriculum of Chinese and Western literature and civilization studies and required courses in physical education and foreign languages. Furthermore, while most Tsinghua undergraduates must choose a specific major upon entrance, Xinya students declare their majors at the end of freshman year, enabling them to explore several different fields of study.

[ 48 ] In December 2014, Tsinghua University established the Advisory Committee of Undergraduate Curriculum (ACUC).

[ 49 ] It became the first student autonomous organization in mainland China for students to participate in the school's management.

[ 50 ] The Tsinghua University Academic Committee, which was formally established on 8 July 2015, has stipulated in the committee's charter that students should be consulted through the ACUC for resolutions involving undergraduate students.

[ 51 ] From then on, Tsinghua commenced a new round of academic reform lasting ever since, including establishing GPA grading system, [ 52 ] adding the writing classes, critical thinking classes, second foreign languages classes into curriculum, [ 53 ] requiring undergrads to be able to swim before graduation, [ 54 ] cooperating with the Peking University on class cross-registration to supplement each other's general education curriculum, [ 55 ] reducing fees on class withdraw, transcripts and certificates, [ 56 ] and adjusting the graduate school co-terminal admission policies.

[ 57 ] In 2016, Schwarzman Scholars was established with almost US$400 million endowment by Steven Schwarzman , the chairman and CEO of the Blackstone Group and other multinational corporations and global leaders.

Schwarzman Scholars annually selects 100–200 scholars across the world to enroll in a one-year fully-funded master's degree leadership program designed to cultivate the next generation of global leaders. 40% students are selected from the United States, 20% students are selected from China, 40% are selected from rest of the world. These scholars reside on the university campus at Schwarzman College , a residential college built specifically for the program.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] In 2016, Tsinghua's expenditures were RMB 13.7 billion (US$3.57 billion at purchasing power parity), the largest budget of any university in China.

[ 60 ] According to a 2018 Financial Times report, Tsinghua University has been linked to cyber-espionage .

[ 61 ] In 2024, Tsinghua announced that its office of the university president had merged into the university's Chinese Communist Party committee, which would directly administer the university henceforth.

[ 62 ] Academics [ edit ] Tsinghua University engages in extensive research and offers 51 bachelor's degree programs, 139 master's degree programs, and 107 doctoral programs through 20 colleges and 57 departments covering a broad range of subjects, [ 63 ] including science, engineering, arts and literature, social sciences, law, medicine.

[ 64 ] Along with its membership in the C9 League, Tsinghua University affiliations include the Association of Pacific Rim Universities , [ 65 ] a group of 50 leading Asian and American universities, Washington University in St. Louis 's McDonnell International Scholars Academy, a group of 35 premier global universities, [ 66 ] and the Association of East Asian Research Universities , a 17-member research collaboration network of top regional institutions.

[ 67 ] Tsinghua is an associate member of the Consortium Linking Universities of Science and Technology for Education and Research (CLUSTER) .

[ 68 ] Tsinghua is a member of a Low Carbon Energy University Alliance (LCEUA), together with the University of Cambridge and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] Admissions [ edit ] Admission to Tsinghua for both undergraduate and graduate schools is extremely competitive. Undergraduate admissions for domestic students is decided through the gaokao , the Chinese national college entrance exam, which allows students to list Tsinghua University among their preferred college choices. While selectivity varies by province, the sheer number of high school students applying for college each year has resulted in overall acceptance rates far lower than 0.1% of all test takers.

[ 71 ] Admission to Tsinghua's graduate schools is also very competitive. Only about 16% of MBA applicants are admitted each year.

[ 72 ] Research [ edit ] Research at Tsinghua University is mainly supported by government funding from national programs and special projects. In the areas of science and technology, funding from these sources totals over 20 billion yuan, which subsidizes more than 1,400 projects every year conducted by the university. With the prospective increase of state investment in science and technology, research at Tsinghua is projected to receive more financial support from the state.

[ 73 ] In 2007, Tsinghua was granted security clearance to conduct classified research of military interest.

[ 74 ] Each year, the university hosts the Intellectual Property Summer Institute in cooperation with Franklin Pierce Law Center of Concord , New Hampshire.

[ 75 ] The scientific research institutions in Tsinghua University are divided into three categories, including government-approved institutions, institutions independently established by the university and institutions jointly established by the university and independent legal entities outside the university.

As of 31 December 2022, Tsinghua University has 428 university-level scientific research institutions in operation.

Many Chinese legal scholars graduated during that era, including Wang Tieya (王铁崖), Gong Xiangrui (龚祥瑞) and Lou Bangyan (楼邦彦).

[ 189 ] In 1952, in response to the government policy of turning Tsinghua University into an engineering-focused university, the law school was dismissed; the faculty were appointed to other universities, including Peking University and Peking College of Political Science and Law (the predecessor of China University of Political Science and Law).

[ 190 ] Until 1995, there was no formal "school of law" at Tsinghua University, yet courses on law were still taught in Tsinghua University from the early 1980s.

[ 191 ] On 8 September 1995, the Tsinghua University Department of Law was formally re-established; on 25 April 1999, the 88th anniversary of Tsinghua University, the university formally changed the department into the "School of Law". The "new" law school inherited the spirit of the "old" law school and has endeavored to add international factors to its students' curriculum. Due to its outstanding faculty members and students, the Tsinghua University School of Law has risen to become one of the leading law schools in China and since 2011, [ 192 ] has been consistently ranked as the best or the second-best law school in mainland China by QS World University Rankings.
