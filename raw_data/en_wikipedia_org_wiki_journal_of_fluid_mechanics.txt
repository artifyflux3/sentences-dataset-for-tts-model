01782778 Links Journal homepage Online access Online archive The Journal of Fluid Mechanics is a peer-reviewed scientific journal in the field of fluid mechanics . It publishes original work on theoretical, computational, and experimental aspects of the subject.

The journal is published by Cambridge University Press and retains a strong association with the University of Cambridge , in particular the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP). Until January 2020, volumes were published twice a month in a single-column B5 format, but the publication is now online-only with the same frequency.

[ 1 ] The journal was established in 1956 by George Batchelor , who remained the editor-in-chief for some forty years. He started out as the sole editor, but later a team of associate editors provided assistance in arranging the review of articles.

Detlef Lohse is the author who has most papers (180 times) appeared in this journal.

Editors [ edit ] The following people have been editor (later, editor in chief) of the Journal of Fluid Mechanics : 1956–1996: George Batchelor (DAMTP) 1966–1983: Keith Moffatt (DAMTP) 1996–2000: David Crighton (DAMTP) 2000–2006: Tim Pedley (DAMTP) 2000–2010: Stephen H.
