Find sources: "Legal archaeology" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Legal archaeology is an area of legal scholarship "involving detailed historical reconstruction and analysis of important cases." [ 1 ] While most legal scholars confine their research to published opinions of court cases, legal archaeologists examine the historical and social context in which a court case was decided.

[ 2 ] These facts may show what social and cultural forces were at work in a particular case. Professors can use legal archaeology to "sensitize students as to how inequality, specifically with regard to race, gender and class affects what occurs throughout the cases they study." [ 3 ] A legal archaeologist may also research biographical material on the judges, attorneys, and parties to a court case. Such information may show whether a judge held particular biases in a case, or whether one party had superior legal representation that caused the party to prevail in a case.
