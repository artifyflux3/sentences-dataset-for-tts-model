Groups with operators were extensively studied by Emmy Noether and her school in the 1920s. She employed the concept in her original formulation of the three Noether isomorphism theorems .

{\displaystyle (g\cdot h)^{\omega }=g^{\omega }\cdot h^{\omega }.} For each ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle \omega \in \Omega } , the application g ↦ ↦ g ω ω {\displaystyle g\mapsto g^{\omega }} is then an endomorphism of G . From this, it results that a Ω-group can also be viewed as a group G with an indexed family ( u ω ω ) ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle \left(u_{\omega }\right)_{\omega \in \Omega }} of endomorphisms of G .

Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is called the operator domain . The associate endomorphisms [ 2 ] are called the homotheties of G .

Given two groups G , H with same operator domain Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } , a homomorphism of groups with operators from ( G , Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle (G,\Omega )} to ( H , Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle (H,\Omega )} is a group homomorphism ϕ ϕ : G → → H {\displaystyle \phi :G\to H} satisfying ϕ ϕ ( g ω ω ) = ( ϕ ϕ ( g ) ) ω ω {\displaystyle \phi \left(g^{\omega }\right)=(\phi (g))^{\omega }} for all ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle \omega \in \Omega } and g ∈ ∈ G .

{\displaystyle g\in G.} A subgroup S of G is called a stable subgroup , Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } -subgroup or Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } -invariant subgroup if it respects the homotheties, that is s ω ω ∈ ∈ S {\displaystyle s^{\omega }\in S} for all s ∈ ∈ S {\displaystyle s\in S} and ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω .

{\displaystyle \omega \in \Omega .} Category-theoretic remarks [ edit ] In category theory , a group with operators can be defined [ 3 ] as an object of a functor category Grp M where M is a monoid (i.e. a category with one object) and Grp denotes the category of groups . This definition is equivalent to the previous one, provided Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is a monoid (if not, we may expand it to include the identity and all compositions ).

A morphism in this category is a natural transformation between two functors (i.e., two groups with operators sharing same operator domain M ).  Again we recover the definition above of a homomorphism of groups with operators (with f the component of the natural transformation).

A group with operators is also a mapping Ω Ω → → End G r p ⁡ ⁡ ( G ) , {\displaystyle \Omega \rightarrow \operatorname {End} _{\mathbf {Grp} }(G),} where End G r p ⁡ ⁡ ( G ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {End} _{\mathbf {Grp} }(G)} is the set of group endomorphisms of G .

Examples [ edit ] Given any group G , ( G , ∅) is trivially a group with operators Given a module M over a ring R , R acts by scalar multiplication on the underlying abelian group of M , so ( M , R ) is a group with operators.

As a special case of the above, every vector space over a field K is a group with operators ( V , K ).

Applications [ edit ] The Jordan–Hölder theorem also holds in the context of groups with operators. The requirement that a group have a composition series is analogous to that of compactness in topology , and can sometimes be too strong a requirement. It is natural to talk about "compactness relative to a set", i.e. talk about composition series where each ( normal ) subgroup is an operator-subgroup relative to the operator set X , of the group in question.
