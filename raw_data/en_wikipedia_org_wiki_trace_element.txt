In nutrition , trace elements are classified into two groups: essential trace elements, and non-essential trace elements. Essential trace elements are needed for many physiological and biochemical processes in both plants and animals. Not only do trace elements play a role in biological processes but they also serve as catalysts to engage  in redox – oxidation and reduction mechanisms.

[ 3 ] Trace elements of some heavy metals have a biological role as essential micronutrients .

Types [ edit ] Main article: Mineral (nutrient) The two types of trace element in biochemistry are classed as essential or non-essential.

Essential trace elements [ edit ] An essential trace element is a dietary element , a mineral that is only needed in minute quantities for the proper growth, development, and physiology of the organism.

[ 4 ] The essential trace elements are those that are required to perform vital metabolic activities in organisms.

[ 5 ] Essential trace elements in human nutrition , and other animals include iron (Fe) (hemoglobin), copper (Cu) ( respiratory pigments ), cobalt (Co) ( Vitamin B12 ), iodine (I), manganese (Mn), chlorine (Cl), molybdenum (Mo), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) (enzymes).

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Although they are essential, they become toxic at high concentrations.

[ 7 ] Non-essential trace elements [ edit ] Non-essential trace elements include silver (Ag), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb). They have no known biological function in mammals, with toxic effects even at low concentration.

[ 5 ] The structural components of cells and tissues that are required in the diet in gram quantities daily are known as bulk elements .
