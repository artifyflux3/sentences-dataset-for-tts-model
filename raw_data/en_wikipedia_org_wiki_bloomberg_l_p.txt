It was co-founded by Michael Bloomberg in 1981, with Thomas Secunda , Duncan MacMillan , Charles Zegar , [ 2 ] and a 12% ownership investment by Bank of America through its brokerage subsidiary Merrill Lynch .

[ 3 ] Bloomberg L.P. provides financial software tools and enterprise applications such as analytics and an equity trading platform, data services, and news to financial companies and organizations through the Bloomberg Terminal (via its Bloomberg Professional Service), its core revenue -generating product.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] History [ edit ] Bloomberg Terminal at London City Airport In 1981, Salomon Brothers was acquired, and Michael Bloomberg , a general partner, was given a $10 million partnership settlement.

[ 9 ] Bloomberg, having designed in-house computerized financial systems for Salomon, used his $10 million partnership buyout to start Innovative Market Systems (IMS).

[ 10 ] Bloomberg developed and built his own computerized system to provide real-time market data, financial calculations and other financial analytics to Wall Street firms. The Market Master terminal, later called the Bloomberg Terminal, was released to market in December 1982.

[ 11 ] Merrill Lynch became the first customer, purchasing 20 terminals and a 30% equity stake in the company for $30 million in exchange for a five-year restriction on marketing the terminal to Merrill Lynch's competitors. Merrill Lynch released IMS from this restriction in 1984.

[ 12 ] In 1986, the company renamed itself Bloomberg L.P. ( limited partnership ).

[ 13 ] Bloomberg launched Bloomberg Business News, later Bloomberg News, in 1990, with Matthew Winkler as editor-in-chief.

[ 14 ] Bloomberg.com was first established on September 29, 1993, as a financial portal with information on markets, currency conversion , news and events, and Bloomberg Terminal subscriptions.

[ 15 ] In late 1996, Bloomberg bought back one-third of Merrill Lynch's 30 percent stake in the company for $200 million, valuing the company at $2 billion.

[ 16 ] In 2008, facing losses during the financial crisis, Merrill Lynch agreed to sell its remaining 20 percent stake in the company back to Bloomberg Inc., [ 17 ] majority-owned by Michael Bloomberg, [ 18 ] for a reported $4.43 billion, valuing Bloomberg L.P. at approximately $22.5 billion.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Bloomberg L.P. has remained a private company since its founding, the majority of which is owned by billionaire Michael Bloomberg.

[ 19 ] To run for the position of Mayor of New York against Democrat Mark Green in 2001, Bloomberg gave up his position of CEO and appointed Lex Fenwick as CEO in his stead.

[ 21 ] In 2012, Peter Grauer became the chairman of the company, a role he still holds.

[ 22 ] In 2008, Fenwick became the CEO of Bloomberg Ventures, a new venture capital division and Daniel Doctoroff , former deputy mayor in the Bloomberg administration, was named president and CEO, serving until September 2014.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] At that point, it was announced that Michael Bloomberg would be taking the reins of his eponymous market data company from Doctoroff, who was chief executive of Bloomberg for the past six years after his term as deputy mayor.

[ 25 ] In May 2022, Bloomberg announced it would launch a new venture in the UK, Bloomberg UK, as part of a wider international strategy. Bloomberg UK plans to hire in the region and has launched a standalone website, a weekly video series, a podcast and new event series.

( November 2024 ) Turner Construction and Bloomberg LP construction scandal [ edit ] Between 2010 and 2017, a "pay-to-play" scheme went along between two Turner Construction executives, two Bloomberg executives; and vendors and subcontractors involving interior construction at the Bloomberg offices including its headquarters at 731 Lexington Ave.

Bloomberg L.P.

[ edit ] In 1996, former Bloomberg L.P. sales representative Mary Ann Olszewski sued the company, alleging that she was drugged and raped by her supervisor, Bryan Lewis, and claimed she was terminated shortly after reporting the incident in a May 25, 1995, meeting.

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] The lawsuit also alleged the company internally investigated Olszewski, attempting to get coworkers to portray her as "flirtatious" or a "sex hound." [ 106 ] Olszewski also claimed that male employees at the company engaged in the "sexual degradation of women" and that the company "took no steps to prevent or curtail the ongoing sexual harassment of female employees by Michael Bloomberg." [ 105 ] Bloomberg, on behalf of Bloomberg L.P., testified that he was made aware of the rape allegation and offered to move Olszewski into another sales unit.

[ 106 ] Bloomberg also testified that he did not find Olszewski's allegation genuine because there was not "an unimpeachable third-party witness" present during the alleged event, elaborating that "there are times when three people are together." [ 107 ] The case was dismissed by a federal judge in 1999 after Olszewski's lawyer had ignored repeated deadlines to submit a response to a motion to end the case. The case was re-opened by another lawyer in 2000, but disappeared from the court docket in 2001.

[ 106 ] Sekiko Sakai Garrison v. Michael Bloomberg and Bloomberg L.P.

[ edit ] In 1997, former Bloomberg L.P. sales executive Sekiko Sakai Garrison filed a lawsuit against the company and Michael Bloomberg, alleging sexual harassment and wrongful termination .

[ 108 ] [ 109 ] Garrison alleged that when she told Bloomberg that she was pregnant, he told her to "Kill it!" and said "Great! Number 16," referring to the number of women in the company who were pregnant or on maternity leave at the time.

[ 107 ] According to the lawsuit, Garrison told a manager about the incident but was told to "forget it ever happened" before being fired.

[ 105 ] Garrison also claimed that Bloomberg told female salespeople to "line up to give him [oral sex] as a wedding present," referring to a male employee who was getting married.

[ 105 ] The lawsuit also alleged that Bloomberg berated a female employee who had trouble finding a nanny, saying, "It's a f------ baby! All it does is eat and s---! It doesn't know the difference between you and anyone else! All you need is some black who doesn't even have to speak English to rescue it from a burning building!" [ 105 ] [ 108 ] The company did not admit any wrongdoing, but settled the lawsuit out of court in 2000.

[ 106 ] EEOC v. Bloomberg L.P.

[ edit ] In September 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a class-action lawsuit against Bloomberg L.P. on behalf of more than 80 female employees who argued that Bloomberg L.P. engaged in discrimination against women who took maternity leave .

[ 110 ] In August 2011, Judge Loretta A. Preska of the federal United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan dismissed the charges, writing that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did not present sufficient evidence to support its claim.

[ 111 ] In September 2013, Preska dismissed an EEOC lawsuit on behalf of 29 pregnant employees of Bloomberg L.P.

[ 112 ] In addition, she dismissed pregnancy bias claims from five individual plaintiffs, and allowed part of the case from a sixth plaintiff to proceed.

[ 113 ] Bloomberg L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve [ edit ] Bloomberg L.P. brought a lawsuit against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Bloomberg L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ) to force the Fed to share details about its lending programs during the U.S. Government bailout in 2008.

[ 114 ] The records documented Federal Reserve loans issued to financial firms and revealed the identities of the firms, the amounts borrowed and the collateral posted in return.

[ 115 ] Bloomberg L.P. won at the trial court level.

[ 116 ] The Second Circuit Court ruled in favor of Bloomberg L.P. in March 2010, but the case was appealed to the Supreme Court by a group of large U.S. commercial banks in October. In March 2011, the Supreme Court let stand the Second Circuit Court ruling mandating the release of Fed bailout details.

[ 117 ] Bloomberg L.P. v. Bloomberg Ltd [ edit ] On October 22, 2008, Bloomberg L.P. applied for a change of name of Bloomberg Ltd, under s. 69(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2006 . Bloomberg L.P. then amended its name to Bloomberg Finance Three L.P. Bloomberg Ltd was ordered at the Company Names Tribunal on May 11, 2009, to change its name so as to not have a name that would likely interfere, by similarity, with the goodwill of Bloomberg Finance Three L.P. as well as to pay costs.

[ 118 ] Nafeesa Syeed v. Bloomberg L.P.

[ edit ] According to a recent case in August 2020, Bloomberg L.P. is again being charged with discrimination against black and non-white workers. Nafeesa Syeed, who served at Bloomberg for around four years as a national security reporter and Middle East reporter, sued the corporation in New York city court for sexism based on her gender and her ethnicity as a South Asian-American. Bloomberg faces a related complaint by a former saleswoman, who filed under a pseudonym in June and the corporation is now seeking to compel a public release of her name. Throughout both cases the same law firm represents the plaintiffs.

[ 119 ] Fossil fuel advertising [ edit ] An investigation by the Intercept , the Nation , and DeSmog found that Bloomberg L.P. is one of the leading media outlets that publishes advertising for the fossil fuel industry.

[ 120 ] Journalists who cover climate change for Bloomberg News are concerned that conflicts of interest with the companies and industries that caused climate change and obstructed action will reduce the credibility of their reporting on climate change and cause readers to downplay the climate crisis .

[ 120 ] 2024 Russian prisoner exchange [ edit ] While the 2024 Russian prisoner exchange was still in progress, Bloomberg News broke a news embargo by reporting information provided by the White House. Other publications, including the Wall Street Journal , criticized Bloomberg for breaking the embargo, potentially jeopardizing the exchange, and for a Bloomberg editor's apparent boasting for being the one to first publish a breaking news story.
