Biodiversity databases store taxonomic information alone or more commonly also other information like distribution (spatial) data and ecological data, which provide information on the biodiversity of a particular area or group of living organisms. They may store specimen-level information, species-level information, information on nomenclature, or any combination of the above. Most are available online.

Specimen-focused databases contain data about individual specimens, as represented by vouchered museum specimens, collections of specimen photographs, data on field-based specimen observations and morphological or genetic data. Species-focused databases contain information summarised at the species-level. Some species-focused databases attempt to compile comprehensive data about particular species ( FishBase ), while others focus on particular species attributes, such as checklists of species in a given area (FEOW) or the conservation status of species ( CITES or IUCN Red List ). Nomenclators act as summaries of taxonomic revisions and set  a key between specimen-focused and species-focused databases. They do this because taxonomic revisions use specimen data to determine species limits.

In the second phase under UGC project (2015 onwards) the study has been extended to three more states namely Delhi, Tripura and Manipur reporting occurrence of 161 species. rRNA sequence data for these fungi is added as Phylogenetic Map and distribution data is available as Google Map https://globalamfungi.com/ Integrated Botanical Information System (IBIS) [ 19 ] Plants of Australia X Taxonomic information, collection details, photographs https://www.anbg.gov.au/ibis/ iNaturalist All forms of life X X X X X X X X X X Geolocated observations, location checklists, taxonomic information, range maps https://www.inaturalist.org/ iSpot All forms of life large enough to photograph X X X X X X X X X Geolocated individual observations and other information produced by citizen science participants https://nbn.org.uk/tools-and-resources/useful-websites/ispot/ Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) [ 20 ] All taxa of interest to North America, with other taxa included as available X X X X X X X X X X Taxonomic information, including higher taxonomy https://www.itis.gov/ JACQ [ 21 ] Specimens from various Herbaria X Contains information about plant specimen taxonomy and collection information https://jacq.org/ Mammal Networked Information System (MaNIS) Mammals X The original objectives of MaNIS were to 1) facilitate open access to combined specimen data from a web browser, 2) enhance the value of specimen collections, 3) conserve curatorial resources, and 4) use a design paradigm that can be easily adopted by other disciplines with similar needs. The system just as FishNet, HerpNET and ORNIS refers now to the VertNet portal.
