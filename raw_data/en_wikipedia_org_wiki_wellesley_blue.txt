Founded in 1870 by Henry and Pauline Durant as a female seminary , it is a member of the Seven Sisters Colleges , an unofficial grouping of women's colleges in the northeastern United States, one of which became coeducational and one is no longer independent.

[ 7 ] Wellesley enrolls approximately 2,500 students, including transgender , non-binary and genderqueer students since 2015. It contains 60 departmental and interdepartmental majors spanning the liberal arts, as well as over 150 student clubs and organizations. Wellesley athletes compete in the NCAA Division III New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference . Its 500-acre (200 ha) campus was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and houses the Davis Museum and a botanic garden .

History [ edit ] Campus of Wellesley College as it appeared c.

1880 Wellesley was founded by Pauline and Henry Fowle Durant , believers in educational opportunity for women, who intended that the college should prepare women for "great conflicts, for vast reforms in social life".

[ 8 ] Its charter was signed on March 17, 1870, by Massachusetts governor William Claflin . The original name of the college was the "Wellesley Female Seminary"; its renaming to Wellesley College was approved by the Massachusetts legislature on March 7, 1873. Wellesley first opened its doors to students on September 8, 1875. At the time of its founding, Wellesley College's campus was actually situated in Needham ; however, in 1880 residents of West Needham voted to secede and in 1881 the area was chartered as a new town, Wellesley .

Wellesley College was a leading center for women's study in the sciences. Between 1875 and 1921, Wellesley employed more female scientists than any other U.S. institution of high education.

[ 9 ] After MIT , it was the second college in the United States to initiate laboratory science instruction for undergraduates. In early 1896, Sarah Frances Whiting , the first professor of physics and astronomy, was among the first U.S. scientists to conduct experiments in X-rays .

[ 10 ] 1922 cover of Judge depicting a Wellesley graduate The first president of Wellesley was Ada Howard . There have been thirteen more presidents in its history: Alice Freeman Palmer , Helen Almira Shafer , Julia Irvine , Caroline Hazard , Ellen Fitz Pendleton , Mildred H. McAfee , Margaret Clapp , Ruth M. Adams, Barbara W. Newell , Nannerl O. Keohane (later the president of Duke University from 1993 to 2004), Diana Chapman Walsh , H. Kim Bottomly , and incumbent president Paula Johnson .

The original architecture of the college consisted of one very large building, College Hall, which was approximately 150 metres (490 ft) in length and five stories in height. It was completed in 1875. The architect was Hammatt Billings . College Hall was both an academic building and a residential building. On March 17, 1914, it was destroyed by fire, the precise cause of which was never officially established. The fire was first noticed by students who lived on the fourth floor near the zoology laboratory. It has been suggested that an electrical or chemical accident in this laboratory—specifically, an electrical incubator used in the breeding of beetles—triggered the fire.

[ 11 ] A group of residence halls known as the Tower Court complex is located on top of the hill where the old College Hall once stood.

After the loss of the Central College Hall in 1914, the college adopted a master plan in 1921 and expanded into several new buildings. The campus hosted a Naval Reserve Officer Training program during the Second World War , and the College President Mildred McAfee took a leave of absence to lead the Women's Reserve of the U.S. Navy. She received the Distinguished Service Medal in 1945.

[ 12 ] Wellesley College began to significantly revise its curriculum after the war and through the late 1960s; in 1968, the college began its exchange programs between other colleges in the area such as MIT.

[ 12 ] In 2013 the faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.

[ 13 ] The school has admitted transgender, non-binary, and genderqueer students since adopting an inclusive admissions policy in 2015.

[ 14 ] In 2023, the majority of students voted to admit transgender men in a referendum.

[ 15 ] Campus [ edit ] A view of Wellesley College (background) in 1904 from across Lake Waban, with the topiary hedges of the Hunnewell Estate and Gardens in the foreground.

The 500-acre (200 ha) campus overlooks Lake Waban and includes evergreen, deciduous woodlands and open meadows.

Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.

, Boston's preeminent landscape architect at the beginning of the 20th century, described Wellesley's landscape as "not merely beautiful, but with a marked individual character not represented so far as I know on the ground of any other college in the country".

[ 16 ] He also wrote: "I must admit that the exceedingly intricate and complex topography and the peculiarly scattered arrangement of most of the buildings somewhat baffled me".

[ 17 ] The campus is adjacent to the privately owned Hunnewell Estates Historic District , the gardens of which can be viewed from the lake's edge on campus.

The original master plan for Wellesley's campus landscape was developed by Olmsted, Arthur Shurcliff , and Ralph Adams Cram in 1921. This landscape-based concept represented a break from the architecturally defined courtyard and quadrangle campus arrangement that was typical of American campuses at the time. The 720-acre (2.9 km 2 ) site's glaciated topography, a series of meadows, and native plant communities shaped the original layout of the campus, resulting in a campus architecture that is integrated into its landscape.

The campus offers multiple housing options, including Tower Court, which was built after College Hall burnt down, the Quad (Quint, including Munger), the "New Dorms", referring to the east-side dormitories erected in the 1950s, and multiple "Branch Halls", including both a Spanish and French-speaking house. In total, Wellesley offers 17 different residence halls for students to live in.

The most recent master plan for Wellesley College was completed in 1998 by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates. According to the designers, this plan was intended to restore and recapture the original landscape character of the campus that had been partially lost as the campus evolved through the 20th century. In 2011, Wellesley was listed by Travel+Leisure magazine as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.

[ 18 ] Wellesley is home to Green Hall, completed in 1931, the only building bearing the name of famed miser Hetty Green ; the building was funded by her children.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Part of the building is the Galen L. Stone Tower, housing a 32-bell carillon , which is routinely played between classes by members of the Guild of Carillonneurs.

Houghton Chapel was dedicated in 1899 in the center of the college campus.

[ 21 ] The architectural firm of Heins & LaFarge designed Houghton [ 21 ] of gray stone in the classic Latin cross floor plan. The exterior walls are pierced by stained glass windows. Window designers include Tiffany ; John La Farge ; Reynolds, Francis & Rohnstock ; and Jeffrey Gibson .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The chapel can seat up to 750 people.

[ 21 ] Houghton is used by the college for a variety of religious and secular functions, like lectures and music concerts, [ 21 ] and is also available for rental.

[ 26 ] The lower-level houses the Multifaith Center.

[ 21 ] Wellesley College campus, fall 2006 In 1905 Andrew Carnegie donated $125,000 to build what is now known as Clapp Library, on the condition that the college match the amount for an endowment. The money was raised by 1907 and construction began June 5, 1909. In 1915 Carnegie gave another $95,446 towards an addition. This renovation added a recreational reading room, offices, archives, a reserve reading room, added space for rare books and additional stacks.

[ 27 ] The building underwent renovations from 1956 to 1959, that doubled its size. From 1973 to 1975 a major addition was added to the right-hand side of the building. In 1974 the building was renamed for Margaret Antoinette Clapp , a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and member of the 1930 class who served as the eighth college president from 1949 to 1966.

[ 28 ] The Davis Museum art collections are open to the public The Davis Museum , opened in 1993, was the first building in North America designed by Pritzker Prize -winning architect Rafael Moneo , whose notion of the museum as a "treasury" or "treasure chamber" informs its design. The Davis is at the heart of the arts on the Wellesley campus adjacent to the academic quad and is connected by an enclosed bridge to the Jewett Arts Center, designed by Paul Rudolph . The collections span from ancient art from around the world to contemporary art exhibitions, and admission is free to the general public.

Administration [ edit ] Tower Court is the largest dorm The president of Wellesley College is Paula Johnson .

[ 29 ] She previously founded the Connors Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital , and was the Grace A. Young Family Professor of Medicine in the Field of Women's Health at Harvard Medical School , as well as professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health . Johnson succeeded H. Kim Bottomly to become Wellesley's 14th President in July 2016.

Wellesley's fund-raising campaign in 2005 set a record for liberal arts colleges with a total of $472.3 million, 18.1% more than the goal of $400 million.

[ 30 ] According to data compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education , Wellesley's campaign total is the largest of any liberal arts college. In late 2015, the college launched another campaign, with a goal of $500 million.

[ 31 ] Many alumnae including Madeleine Albright , Hillary Clinton , Diane Sawyer , Susan Wagner , and Cokie Roberts collaborated on the campaign video and launch festivities. As of Fall 2017, over $446 million has been raised.

[ 32 ] Wellesley Centers for Women [ edit ] The Wellesley Centers for Women (WCW) is one of the largest gender -focused social science research-and-action organizations in the United States.

[ 33 ] Located on and nearby the Wellesley College campus, WCW was established when the Center for Research on Women (founded 1974) and the Stone Center for Development Services and Studies at Wellesley College (founded 1981) merged into a single organization in 1995.

[ 34 ] It is home to several prominent American feminist scholars, including Jean Kilbourne and Peggy McIntosh . The executive director of the Wellesley Centers for Women is Layli Maparyan. Since 1974, the Wellesley Centers for Women has produced over 200 scholarly articles and over 100 books.

[ 34 ] The Wellesley Centers for Women has five key areas of research: education, economic security, mental health, youth and adolescent development, and gender-based violence. WCW is also home to long-standing and highly successful action programs that engage in curriculum development and training, professional development, evaluation, field building, and theory building. Those programs include the National SEED Project, the National Institute on Out-of-School Time, Open Circle, the Jean Baker Miller Training Institute, and Women's Review of Books.

[ 35 ] Academics [ edit ] Margaret Clapp Library Wellesley's average class size is between 17 and 20 students, with a student-faculty ratio of 7:1. 60 departmental and interdepartmental majors are offered, [ 36 ] and students have the option to propose their own major.

[ 37 ] Wellesley offers support to nontraditional aged students through the Elisabeth Kaiser Davis Degree Program, open to students over the age of 24.

[ 38 ] The program allows women who, for various reasons, were unable to start or complete a bachelor's degree at a younger age to attend Wellesley.

The Whitin Observatory is home to the Astronomy department, and occasionally has viewing nights open to the public.

Wellesley offers dual degree programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Olin College of Engineering , enabling students to receive a Bachelor of Science at those schools in addition to a Bachelor of Arts at Wellesley.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] Wellesley also has a joint five-year BA/MA program with Brandeis University 's International Business School, which allows qualified Wellesley students to receive a Masters of Arts degree from the school, as well as a Bachelor of Arts at Wellesley.

[ 41 ] Wellesley College offers research collaborations and cross-registration programs with other Boston-area institutions, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Babson College , Olin College , and Brandeis University .

[ 73 ] Athletics [ edit ] Wellesley athletics logo Wellesley fields 13 varsity sports teams – basketball, crew, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, and volleyball. Wellesley does not have a mascot in the traditional sense – its sports teams are referred to both individually and collectively as "the Blue" (the school colors are royal blue and white). Wellesley is a member of the NCAA NCAA Division III and the Eastern Conference Athletic Conference (ECAC) and competes primarily as a member of the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC).

Preparations for a spring game of quidditch The Wellesley College Crew Team, affectionately known as "Blue Crew", was founded in 1970 and was the first women's intercollegiate rowing team in the country. In 2016, Blue Crew won the NCAA Division III Rowing Championship as a team for the first time in Wellesley history, with its first Varsity 8+ boat placing first and second Varsity 8+ boat placing second. This historic win marked the first time a team from Wellesley College won a national championship and the first time a women's college won the NCAA Rowing Championships. In 2022, Blue Crew won the NCAA Division III Rowing Championship as a team for a second time, with both its first Varsity 8+ and second Varsity 8+ boats placing second.

[ citation needed ] In 2023, Blue Crew again won the NCAA Division III Rowing Championship as a team, with its first Varsity 8+ boat placing first and second Varsity 8+ boat placing second.

[ 74 ] Wellesley also fields club teams in archery, alpine & Nordic skiing, equestrian, ice hockey, rugby, sailing, squash, Ultimate Frisbee, and water polo. Squash was originally a varsity sport but was downgraded to a club sport status in 2017 when the college left the proper division.

[ citation needed ] Traditions [ edit ] Wellesley College Library Hoop rolling is an annual tradition at the college that dates to 1895.

[ 77 ] Each senior has a wooden hoop, often passed down to them from their "big". Before graduation, the seniors, wearing their graduation robes, run a short race while rolling their hoops. In the early 20th century, the winner was said to be the first in her class to marry; in the 1980s, the winner was said to become the class's first CEO; and since the 1990 Commencement speech by then- First Lady Barbara Bush , the winner has been said to be the first to achieve success, however she defines it.

[ 78 ] The winner is also carried by their classmates and thrown in Lake Waban.

The Wellesley campus sits just before the halfway mark on the Boston Marathon course, and students come out to cheer runners in what has become known as the "Scream Tunnel".

[ 79 ] Students have been cheering on runners since the first running of the marathon.

[ 80 ] In 1966 the school heard word that a woman was running in the race and turned out in numbers in cheer her on.

[ 81 ] Once women were officially allowed to register for the 1972 race, the campus cheer tradition became more popular.

[ 82 ] This day known commonly as "MarMon" (Marathon Monday) is the one day students can count on a break from academics as the campus celebrates the runners and each other in jolly fashion.
