For Aboriginal reserves created by Acts of parliament from the 19th C, see Aboriginal reserves .

The proposed Ngarrabullgin Indigenous Protected Area Yaua waterhole after rain, Angas Downs IPA An Indigenous Protected Area ( IPA ) is a class of protected area used in Australia ; each is formed by voluntary agreement with Indigenous Australians , and declared by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islander representative organisations. Each is formally recognised  by the Australian Government as being part of its National Reserve System .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The areas may comprise land and sea, and are managed by Indigenous groups for the conservation of biodiversity . Managing IPAs also helps to protect the cultural values of their country for future generations, and has benefits for Indigenous health, education, economic and social cohesion.

[ 3 ] As of 2020, there were 78 IPAs, covering around 46.53% of the National Reserve system.

[ 4 ] In September 2021, a further seven IPAs were declared, which will lead to IPAs comprising more than half of Australia's National Reserve System.

[ 5 ] Indigenous rangers are employed to work in IPAs as well as in other remote areas of Australia, on land management and related projects.

[ 6 ] History [ edit ] During the 1990s the Australian Government was working in cooperation with State and Territory Governments to build a National Reserve System aimed at protecting, for future generations , a representative sample of Australia's diverse range of flora, fauna and eco-systems.

[ 7 ] As part of this effort, Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander owners of lands and seas were asked, and many who were interested in re-establishing effective indigenous land management agreed to participate in this endeavour.

[ 7 ] At a national conference of Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders held in 1997, it was agreed and resolved by the delegates present that a new class of "Indigenous" protected area should be formed as follows: [ 8 ] An Indigenous Protected Area is [to be] governed by the continuing responsibilities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to care for and protect lands and waters for present and future generations... Indigenous Protected Areas may include areas of land and waters over which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are custodians , and which shall be managed for cultural biodiversity and conservation, permitting customary sustainable resource use and sharing of benefit.

The first trialling of this new environmental partnership aimed at adding the new class of Protected Areas to Australia's National Reserve System, was with the Adnyamathanha people of Nepabunna Aboriginal community, volunteering 580 square kilometres (220 sq mi) of rugged limestone hills, siltstone flats, springs and waterholes between the Flinders Ranges and Gammon Ranges National Parks to be managed as an Indigenous Protected Area.

[ 7 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The land selected for the first proposed Indigenous Protected area was held by the South Australian Aboriginal Lands Trust (on a 99-year lease, for the Adnyamathanha people [ 11 ] ), and, by 26 August 1998, an agreement had been reached to see the people of Nepabunna Aboriginal community engaged and some employed in restoring the landscape to its former natural and cultural value, and Australia's first Indigenous Protected Area, the Nantawarrina Indigenous Protected Area was declared.

[ 9 ] At the opening ceremony in 1998, Nantawarrina was declared "the first Indigenous Protected Area in South Australia, Australia and internationally" by Gurtrude Johnson, an Adnyamathanha traditional owner .

[ 11 ] By 2007 the kind of partnership agreed and started with the Nantawarrina Indigenous Protected Area had grown to include 23 declared Indigenous Protected Areas covering close to 170,000 km 2 (66,000 sq mi), or 23 per cent of the National Reserve System . By agreeing to establish Indigenous Protected Areas, Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islander peoples contributed two-thirds of all new additions to Australia's National Reserve System over the decade 1997–2007.

[ 7 ] In July 2012, The Nature Conservancy , alongside the Central Land Council and government representatives from Australia’s National Reserve System , helped announce the launch of the Southern Tanami Indigenous Protected Area . This Indigenous Protected Area is Australia’s largest land reserve, spanning 10,150,000 hectares (25,100,000 acres).

[ 12 ] It protects important pieces of the Northern Territory ’s natural legacy. Included in the Southern Tanami reserve are much of Lake Mackay —Australia’s second-largest lake—and an enormous swathe of the Tanami Desert. This IPA links a variety of habitats that includes deserts and savannas , giving plant and animal species the space they need to manoeuvre around threats like bushfires and climate change .

[ 13 ] Two new areas were declared in Western Australia in 2020, bringing the total number to 78.

[ 14 ] In September 2021, a further seven IPAs were declared, which will lead to IPAs comprising more than half of Australia's National Reserve System.

[ 5 ] In May 2022, the incoming Labor government under Anthony Albanese committed to boosting the funding for managing the IPAs to the tune of A$10 million annually; also to doubling the number of Indigenous rangers to 38,000 by 2030, and also to improving gender diversity in employment.

[ 15 ] Criteria and description [ edit ] Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander land and sea owners (including native title holders ) may be encouraged, or themselves apply to the Australian Government to establish an Indigenous Protected Area on their lands/seas.  However, an Indigenous Protected Area can only come into existence where: [ 1 ] land and/or seas are owned by Aboriginal Australian or Torres Strait Islander peoples; and significant biodiversity occurs within such Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander-owned lands or seas; and the Aboriginal Australians or Torres Strait Islanders concerned enter into a formal conservation agreement with the Australian Government to manage some of their lands or seas as an IUCN standard "protected area" .

Most IPAs are dedicated under IUCN Categories 5 and 6, which promote a balance between conservation and other sustainable uses to deliver social, cultural and economic benefits for local Indigenous communities.

[ 4 ] [ 3 ] Indigenous rangers are employed to work in IPAs as well as in other remote areas of Australia, on land management and related projects.

[ 6 ] IPA data [ edit ] IPA data is available online from several sources.

Three maps offering different views of all IPA project locations are available on the National Indigenous Australians Agency 's IPA page: an interactive map and project summaries; Indigenous Protected Areas (PDF) and the Indigenous Protected Areas - Commonwealth Funded Indigenous Ranger Groups (PDF), which also lists the ranger group names.

[ 4 ] Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment 's Collaborative Australian Protected Area Database (CAPAD).

[ 16 ] Updated on a two-year schedule, but some data values may be incorrect or out-of-date. Data provided via Excel spreadsheets, by state and territory.

The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), "the most comprehensive global database of marine and terrestrial protected areas", is a produced by the UN Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Says it is updated monthly, [ 17 ] but the Australian section as of September 2021 shows the Australian Government source as 2020 (lists 78 IPAs under "Indigenous peoples").
