In [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") and [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), the **3D rotation group**, often denoted **[SO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group")(3)**, is the [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") of all [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation") about the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)") of [three-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space")[Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space")![Image 1: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) under the operation of [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-1)

By definition, a rotation about the origin is a transformation that preserves the origin, [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance") (so it is an [isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry")), and [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(vector_space) "Orientation (vector space)") (i.e., _handedness_ of space). Composing two rotations results in another rotation, every rotation has a unique [inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function") rotation, and the [identity map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_map "Identity map") satisfies the definition of a rotation. Owing to the above properties (along composite rotations' [associative property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property "Associative property")), the set of all rotations is a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") under composition.

Every non-trivial rotation is determined by its axis of rotation (a line through the origin) and its angle of rotation. Rotations are not commutative (for example, rotating _R_ 90° in the x-y plane followed by _S_ 90° in the y-z plane is not the same as _S_ followed by _R_), making the 3D rotation group a [nonabelian group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-abelian_group "Non-abelian group"). Moreover, the rotation group has a natural structure as a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") for which the group operations are [smoothly differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function"), so it is in fact a [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group"). It is [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") and has dimension 3.

Rotations are [linear transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_transformation "Linear transformation") of ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) and can therefore be represented by [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)") once a [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_of_a_vector_space "Basis of a vector space") of ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) has been chosen. Specifically, if we choose an [orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis "Orthonormal basis") of ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5), every rotation is described by an [orthogonal 3 × 3 matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix "Orthogonal matrix") (i.e., a 3 × 3 matrix with real entries which, when multiplied by its [transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose "Transpose"), results in the [identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix")) with [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") 1. The group SO(3) can therefore be identified with the group of these matrices under [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication "Matrix multiplication"). These matrices are known as "special orthogonal matrices", explaining the notation SO(3).

The group SO(3) is used to describe the possible rotational symmetries of an object, as well as the possible orientations of an object in space. Its [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation "Group representation") are important in physics, where they give rise to the [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") of integer [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)").

Besides just preserving length, rotations also preserve the [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") between vectors. This follows from the fact that the standard [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") between two vectors **u** and **v** can be written purely in terms of length (see the [law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines "Law of cosines")): ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} ={\frac {1}{2}}\left(\|\mathbf {u} +\mathbf {v} \|^{2}-\|\mathbf {u} \|^{2}-\|\mathbf {v} \|^{2}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2be32bc3925318102e0a1d5f45a696051b5198d2)

It follows that every length-preserving linear transformation in ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) preserves the dot product, and thus the angle between vectors. Rotations are often defined as linear transformations that preserve the inner product on ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5), which is equivalent to requiring them to preserve length. See [classical group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_group "Classical group") for a treatment of this more general approach, where SO(3) appears as a special case.

Orthogonal and rotation matrices
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_rotation_group&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Orthogonal and rotation matrices")]

Every rotation maps an [orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis "Orthonormal basis") of ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) to another orthonormal basis. Like any linear transformation of [finite-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-dimensional "Finite-dimensional") vector spaces, a rotation can always be represented by a [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"). Let _R_ be a given rotation. With respect to the [standard basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_basis "Standard basis")**e**1, **e**2, **e**3 of ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) the columns of _R_ are given by (_R_**e**1, _R_**e**2, _R_**e**3). Since the standard basis is orthonormal, and since _R_ preserves angles and length, the columns of _R_ form another orthonormal basis. This [orthonormality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormality "Orthonormality") condition can be expressed in the form

![Image 10: {\displaystyle R^{\mathsf {T}}R=RR^{\mathsf {T}}=I,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f00b1d1fa4a159fc813f017112c4b3bc45b7635)
where _R_ T denotes the [transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose "Transpose") of _R_ and I is the 3 × 3[identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix"). Matrices for which this property holds are called [orthogonal matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix "Orthogonal matrix"). The group of all 3 × 3 orthogonal matrices is denoted O(3), and consists of all proper and improper rotations.

In addition to preserving length, proper rotations must also preserve orientation. A matrix will preserve or reverse orientation according to whether the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") of the matrix is positive or negative. For an orthogonal matrix _R_, note that det _R_ T = det _R_ implies (det _R_)2 = 1, so that det _R_ = ±1. The [subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup "Subgroup") of orthogonal matrices with determinant +1 is called the _special [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal\_group "Orthogonal group")_, denoted SO(3).

Thus every rotation can be represented uniquely by an orthogonal matrix with unit determinant. Moreover, since composition of rotations corresponds to [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication "Matrix multiplication"), the rotation group is [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic "Isomorphic") to the special orthogonal group SO(3).

[Improper rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_rotation "Improper rotation") correspond to orthogonal matrices with determinant −1, and they do not form a group because the product of two improper rotations is a proper rotation.

The rotation group is a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") under [function composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") (or equivalently the [product of linear transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product "Matrix product")). It is a [subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup "Subgroup") of the [general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group") consisting of all [invertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix "Invertible matrix") linear transformations of the [real 3-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space "Real coordinate space")![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-2)

Furthermore, the rotation group is [nonabelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonabelian_group "Nonabelian group"). That is, the order in which rotations are composed makes a difference. For example, a quarter turn around the positive _x_-axis followed by a quarter turn around the positive _y_-axis is a different rotation than the one obtained by first rotating around _y_ and then _x_.

The orthogonal group, consisting of all proper and improper rotations, is generated by reflections. Every proper rotation is the composition of two reflections, a special case of the [Cartan–Dieudonné theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan%E2%80%93Dieudonn%C3%A9_theorem "Cartan–Dieudonné theorem").

### Complete classification of finite subgroups

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_rotation_group&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Complete classification of finite subgroups")]

The finite subgroups of ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (3)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8366fc6e92660ba077b87b745b305a4176b1d1ef) are completely [classified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_theorem "Classification theorem").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-coxeter-3)

Every finite subgroup is isomorphic to either an element of one of two [countably infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countably_infinite "Countably infinite") families of planar isometries: the [cyclic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group "Cyclic group")![Image 13: {\displaystyle C_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0301812adb392070d834ca2df4ed97f1cf132f33) or the [dihedral groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group "Dihedral group")![Image 14: {\displaystyle D_{2n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/317005e1541e49becbb38da665de9d667b8863b2), or to one of three other groups: the [tetrahedral group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedral_group "Tetrahedral group")![Image 15: {\displaystyle \cong A_{4}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b9c787947b23c62f7360e3fdd060af896e32c6bc), the [octahedral group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedral_group "Octahedral group")![Image 16: {\displaystyle \cong S_{4}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a9037c415dceccb174f6bd8e2cb6d777053b5122), or the [icosahedral group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedral_group "Icosahedral group")![Image 17: {\displaystyle \cong A_{5}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3dea51f976c1fc6e55ca425cbf639c25f1530a1f).

Every nontrivial proper rotation in 3 dimensions fixes a unique 1-dimensional [linear subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace") of ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) which is called the _axis of rotation_ (this is [Euler's rotation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem "Euler's rotation theorem")). Each such rotation acts as an ordinary 2-dimensional rotation in the plane [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal "Orthogonal") to this axis. Since every 2-dimensional rotation can be represented by an angle _φ_, an arbitrary 3-dimensional rotation can be specified by an axis of rotation together with an [angle of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_rotation "Angle of rotation") about this axis. (Technically, one needs to specify an orientation for the axis and whether the rotation is taken to be [clockwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwise_and_counterclockwise "Clockwise and counterclockwise") or [counterclockwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterclockwise "Counterclockwise") with respect to this orientation).

For example, counterclockwise rotation about the positive _z_-axis by angle _φ_ is given by

![Image 19: {\displaystyle R_{z}(\phi )={\begin{bmatrix}\cos \phi &-\sin \phi &0\\\sin \phi &\cos \phi &0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f62c196069d2c1a2ce655d79fa0e48e7fc977255)
Given a [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector")**n** in ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) and an angle _φ_, let _R_(_φ_, **n**) represent a counterclockwise rotation about the axis through **n** (with orientation determined by **n**). Then

*   _R_(0, **n**) is the identity transformation for any **n**
*   _R_(_φ_, **n**) = _R_(−_φ_, −**n**)
*   _R_(π + _φ_, **n**) = _R_(π − _φ_, −**n**).

Using these properties one can show that any rotation can be represented by a unique angle _φ_ in the range 0 ≤ φ ≤ π and a unit vector **n** such that

*   **n** is arbitrary if _φ_ = 0
*   **n** is unique if 0 <_φ_<π
*   **n** is unique up to a [sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics) "Sign (mathematics)") if _φ_ = π (that is, the rotations _R_(π, ±**n**) are identical).

In the next section, this representation of rotations is used to identify SO(3) topologically with three-dimensional real projective space.

The Lie group SO(3) is [diffeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") to the [real projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space "Real projective space")![Image 21: {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ^{3}(\mathbb {R} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8f5ea9bdc7df9ead8e852c208b16ebdbb1a8f5ae)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-4)

Consider the solid ball in ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) of radius π (that is, all points of ![Image 23: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) of distance π or less from the origin). Given the above, for every point in this ball there is a rotation, with axis through the point and the origin, and rotation angle equal to the distance of the point from the origin. The identity rotation corresponds to the point at the center of the ball. Rotations through an angle 𝜃 between 0 and π (not including either) are on the same axis at the same distance. Rotation through angles between 0 and −π correspond to the point on the same axis and distance from the origin but on the opposite side of the origin. The one remaining issue is that the two rotations through π and through −π are the same. So we [identify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(topology) "Quotient space (topology)") (or "glue together") [antipodal points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodal_point "Antipodal point") on the surface of the ball. After this identification, we arrive at a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space")[homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to the rotation group.

Indeed, the ball with antipodal surface points identified is a [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold"), and this manifold is [diffeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") to the rotation group. It is also diffeomorphic to the [real 3-dimensional projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space "Real projective space")![Image 24: {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ^{3}(\mathbb {R} ),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eacc73ad667eb9da5d2c9532fc4287673081c21a) so the latter can also serve as a topological model for the rotation group.

These identifications illustrate that SO(3) is [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") but not [simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected "Simply connected"). As to the latter, in the ball with antipodal surface points identified, consider the path running from the "north pole" straight through the interior down to the south pole. This is a closed loop, since the north pole and the south pole are identified. This loop cannot be shrunk to a point, since no matter how it is deformed, the start and end point have to remain antipodal, or else the loop will "break open". In terms of rotations, this loop represents a continuous sequence of rotations about the _z_-axis starting (by example) at the identity (center of the ball), through the south pole, jumping to the north pole and ending again at the identity rotation (i.e., a series of rotation through an angle _φ_ where _φ_ runs from 0 to [2 π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry) "Turn (geometry)")).

Surprisingly, running through the path twice, i.e., running from the north pole down to the south pole, jumping back to the north pole (using the fact that north and south poles are identified), and then again running from the north pole down to the south pole, so that _φ_ runs from 0 to 4 π, gives a closed loop which _can_ be shrunk to a single point: first move the paths continuously to the ball's surface, still connecting north pole to south pole twice. The second path can then be mirrored over to the antipodal side without changing the path at all. Now we have an ordinary closed loop on the surface of the ball, connecting the north pole to itself along a great circle. This circle can be shrunk to the north pole without problems. The [plate trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_trick "Plate trick") and similar tricks demonstrate this practically.

The same argument can be performed in general, and it shows that the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") of SO(3) is the [cyclic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group "Cyclic group") of order 2 (a fundamental group with two elements). In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") applications, the non-triviality (more than one element) of the fundamental group allows for the existence of objects known as [spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor "Spinor"), and is an important tool in the development of the [spin–statistics theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin%E2%80%93statistics_theorem "Spin–statistics theorem").

The [universal cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_cover "Universal cover") of SO(3) is a [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") called [Spin(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin(3) "Spin(3)"). The group Spin(3) is isomorphic to the [special unitary group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group "Special unitary group") SU(2); it is also diffeomorphic to the unit [3-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere "3-sphere")_S_ 3 and can be understood as the group of [versors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versor "Versor") ([quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") with [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value") 1). The connection between quaternions and rotations, commonly exploited in [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics"), is explained in [quaternions and spatial rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation "Quaternions and spatial rotation"). The map from _S_ 3 onto SO(3) that identifies antipodal points of _S_ 3 is a [surjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective "Surjective")[homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism "Homomorphism") of Lie groups, with [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(algebra) "Kernel (algebra)") {±1}. Topologically, this map is a two-to-one [covering map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_map "Covering map"). (See the [plate trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_trick "Plate trick").)

Connection between SO(3) and SU(2)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_rotation_group&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Connection between SO(3) and SU(2)")]

In this section, we give two different constructions of a two-to-one and [surjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective "Surjective")[homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism "Homomorphism") of SU(2) onto SO(3).

### Using quaternions of unit norm

One can then verify that if ![Image 34: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) is in ![Image 35: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) and ![Image 36: {\displaystyle q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06809d64fa7c817ffc7e323f85997f783dbdf71d) is a unit quaternion, then ![Image 37: {\displaystyle qvq^{-1}\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8c9e28a565e979fc227ea796af35b5e9493d2ac)

Furthermore, the map ![Image 38: {\displaystyle v\mapsto qvq^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b4be07ce2ccd2a07afd7de386589bc28046c3fe) is a rotation of ![Image 39: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b00b2b4fd27c2cbffa02df568472f77b194a6db9) Moreover, ![Image 40: {\displaystyle (-q)v(-q)^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd8bca5eeb2c21ffdcf5d010927c01d700693997) is the same as ![Image 41: {\displaystyle qvq^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6321214bc52695b7e410628dfa92da50eee04ea9). This means that there is a 2:1 homomorphism from quaternions of unit norm to the 3D rotation group SO(3).

One can work this homomorphism out explicitly: the unit quaternion, q, with ![Image 42: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}q&=w+x\mathbf {i} +y\mathbf {j} +z\mathbf {k} ,\\1&=w^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2},\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/369445259e51e13f2c8faa1224933f37f6bbdfe7) is mapped to the rotation matrix ![Image 43: {\displaystyle Q={\begin{bmatrix}1-2y^{2}-2z^{2}&2xy-2zw&2xz+2yw\\2xy+2zw&1-2x^{2}-2z^{2}&2yz-2xw\\2xz-2yw&2yz+2xw&1-2x^{2}-2y^{2}\end{bmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e462d99341f03df03fe2faabecb908cd60a21860)

This is a rotation around the vector (_x_, _y_, _z_) by an angle 2 _θ_, where cos _θ_ = _w_ and |sin _θ_| = ‖(_x_, _y_, _z_)‖. The proper sign for sin _θ_ is implied, once the signs of the axis components are fixed. The 2:1-nature is apparent since both _q_ and −_q_ map to the same _Q_.

### Using Möbius transformations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_rotation_group&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Using Möbius transformations")]

[![Image 44](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Stereoprojnegone.svg/300px-Stereoprojnegone.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stereoprojnegone.svg)

Stereographic projection from the sphere of radius ⁠1/2⁠ from the north pole (_x_, _y_, _z_) = (0, 0, ⁠1/2⁠) onto the plane M given by _z_ = −⁠1/2⁠ coordinatized by (_ξ_, _η_), here shown in cross section.

The general reference for this section is [Gelfand, Minlos & Shapiro (1963)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#CITEREFGelfandMinlosShapiro1963). The points _P_ on the sphere

![Image 45: {\displaystyle \mathbf {S} =\left\{(x,y,z)\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}:x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}={\frac {1}{4}}\right\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39623077830169fb70dc52dfb7e86bdd4dbc7cb8)
can, barring the north pole _N_, be put into one-to-one [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") with points _S_(_P_) = _P'_ on the plane _M_ defined by _z_ = −⁠1/2⁠, see figure. The map _S_ is called [stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection "Stereographic projection").

Let the coordinates on M be (_ξ_, _η_). The line _L_ passing through _N_ and _P_ can be parametrized as

![Image 46: {\displaystyle L(t)=N+t(N-P)=\left(0,0,{\frac {1}{2}}\right)+t\left(\left(0,0,{\frac {1}{2}}\right)-(x,y,z)\right),\quad t\in \mathbb {R} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f744cc4126c0fa13bcf3abfb45bc787698225cb6)
Demanding that the _z_-coordinate of ![Image 47: {\displaystyle L(t_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/27777fe9cd5e27daa7fc2bcefe88d8b79936db42) equals −⁠1/2⁠, one finds

![Image 48: {\displaystyle t_{0}={\frac {1}{z-{\frac {1}{2}}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cc4fab98a5bb129545ef548a3faaa8f13fe286c5)
We have ![Image 49: {\displaystyle L(t_{0})=(\xi ,\eta ,-1/2).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/153133882839c421d9d9d2fef1ba344efc40a1fc) Hence the map

![Image 50: {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}S:\mathbf {S} \to M\\P=(x,y,z)\longmapsto P'=(\xi ,\eta )=\left({\frac {x}{{\frac {1}{2}}-z}},{\frac {y}{{\frac {1}{2}}-z}}\right)\equiv \zeta =\xi +i\eta \end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22160cbbded3475d2cf441400470fead286e3802)
where, for later convenience, the plane _M_ is identified with the complex plane ![Image 51: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8f4d5d3ec97eee8b915d3b14d3fb38579ee639d2)

For the inverse, write _L_ as

![Image 52: {\displaystyle L=N+s(P'-N)=\left(0,0,{\frac {1}{2}}\right)+s\left(\left(\xi ,\eta ,-{\frac {1}{2}}\right)-\left(0,0,{\frac {1}{2}}\right)\right),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9270b308a50b4fad11ce0746f01d9c31b4cc42f1)
and demand _x_ 2 + _y_ 2 + _z_ 2 = ⁠1/4⁠ to find _s_ = ⁠1/1 + _ξ_ 2 + _η_ 2⁠ and thus

![Image 53: {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}S^{-1}:M\to \mathbf {S} \\P'=(\xi ,\eta )\longmapsto P=(x,y,z)=\left({\frac {\xi }{1+\xi ^{2}+\eta ^{2}}},{\frac {\eta }{1+\xi ^{2}+\eta ^{2}}},{\frac {-1+\xi ^{2}+\eta ^{2}}{2+2\xi ^{2}+2\eta ^{2}}}\right)\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f3a4e15da4658b0d2df30b0b2447766337cb467b)
If _g_ ∈ SO(3) is a rotation, then it will take points on **S** to points on **S** by its standard action Π _s_(_g_) on the embedding space ![Image 54: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b00b2b4fd27c2cbffa02df568472f77b194a6db9) By composing this action with _S_ one obtains a transformation _S_ ∘ Π _s_(_g_) ∘ _S_−1 of M,

![Image 55: {\displaystyle \zeta =P'\longmapsto P\longmapsto \Pi _{s}(g)P=gP\longmapsto S(gP)\equiv \Pi _{u}(g)\zeta =\zeta '.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f624854e9dd2fc4536050e9ce136d732bc485cc6)
Thus Π _u_(_g_) is a transformation of ![Image 56: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7) associated to the transformation Π _s_(_g_) of ![Image 57: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5).

It turns out that _g_ ∈ SO(3) represented in this way by Π _u_(_g_) can be expressed as a matrix Π _u_(_g_) ∈ SU(2) (where the notation is recycled to use the same name for the matrix as for the transformation of ![Image 58: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7) it represents). To identify this matrix, consider first a rotation _g_ _φ_ about the _z_-axis through an angle _φ_,

![Image 59: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'&=x\cos \phi -y\sin \phi ,\\y'&=x\sin \phi +y\cos \phi ,\\z'&=z.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7adcf12eabf85bff8a48a92451a69a70bc2f6d2b)
Hence

![Image 60: {\displaystyle \zeta '={\frac {x'+iy'}{{\frac {1}{2}}-z'}}={\frac {e^{i\phi }(x+iy)}{{\frac {1}{2}}-z}}=e^{i\phi }\zeta ={\frac {e^{\frac {i\phi }{2}}\zeta +0}{0\zeta +e^{-{\frac {i\phi }{2}}}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f11eb6c0aebb6af4a7b47b24b68a4e08351f26f)
which, unsurprisingly, is a rotation in the complex plane. In an analogous way, if _g_ _θ_ is a rotation about the _x_-axis through an angle θ, then

![Image 61: {\displaystyle w'=e^{i\theta }w,\quad w={\frac {y+iz}{{\frac {1}{2}}-x}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c2b3dfe5bb9ce68f4bee4f35eb3fa597a885fbf)
which, after a little algebra, becomes

![Image 62: {\displaystyle \zeta '={\frac {\cos {\frac {\theta }{2}}\zeta +i\sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}}{i\sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}\zeta +\cos {\frac {\theta }{2}}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4570940e1529243572cebe39846e607e4c46458)
These two rotations, ![Image 63: {\displaystyle g_{\phi },g_{\theta },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4997463b1e060a7fbfaeaa877b1af29b5e471b38) thus correspond to [bilinear transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_transform "Bilinear transform") of **R**2 ≃ **C** ≃ _M_, namely, they are examples of [Möbius transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation "Möbius transformation").

A general Möbius transformation is given by

![Image 64: {\displaystyle \zeta '={\frac {\alpha \zeta +\beta }{\gamma \zeta +\delta }},\quad \alpha \delta -\beta \gamma \neq 0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/93fd5b026af4e5e8c1f07a42aaae41336f935c46)
The rotations, ![Image 65: {\displaystyle g_{\phi },g_{\theta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6c258a3cb0f4727cc571b971767fbc99b4436e91) generate all of SO(3) and the composition rules of the Möbius transformations show that any composition of ![Image 66: {\displaystyle g_{\phi },g_{\theta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6c258a3cb0f4727cc571b971767fbc99b4436e91) translates to the corresponding composition of Möbius transformations. The Möbius transformations can be represented by matrices

![Image 67: {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}\alpha &\beta \\\gamma &\delta \end{pmatrix}},\qquad \alpha \delta -\beta \gamma =1,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e081f99a19f12cbe9dfe44567a92e06edd587452)
since a common factor of _α_, _β_, _γ_, _δ_ cancels.

For the same reason, the matrix is _not_ uniquely defined since multiplication by −_I_ has no effect on either the determinant or the Möbius transformation. The composition law of Möbius transformations follow that of the corresponding matrices. The conclusion is that each Möbius transformation corresponds to two matrices _g_, −_g_ ∈ SL(2, **C**).

Using this correspondence one may write

![Image 68: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Pi _{u}(g_{\phi })&=\Pi _{u}\left[{\begin{pmatrix}\cos \phi &-\sin \phi &0\\\sin \phi &\cos \phi &0\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}\right]=\pm {\begin{pmatrix}e^{i{\frac {\phi }{2}}}&0\\0&e^{-i{\frac {\phi }{2}}}\end{pmatrix}},\\\Pi _{u}(g_{\theta })&=\Pi _{u}\left[{\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\0&\sin \theta &\cos \theta \end{pmatrix}}\right]=\pm {\begin{pmatrix}\cos {\frac {\theta }{2}}&i\sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}\\i\sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}&\cos {\frac {\theta }{2}}\end{pmatrix}}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22565ba61ca4a960754f63a9332628a797792ac4)
These matrices are unitary and thus Π _u_(SO(3)) ⊂ SU(2) ⊂ SL(2, **C**). In terms of [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles")[[nb 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-6) one finds for a general rotation

![Image 69: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}g(\phi ,\theta ,\psi )=g_{\phi }g_{\theta }g_{\psi }&={\begin{pmatrix}\cos \phi &-\sin \phi &0\\\sin \phi &\cos \phi &0\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\0&\sin \theta &\cos \theta \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\cos \psi &-\sin \psi &0\\\sin \psi &\cos \psi &0\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}\\&={\begin{pmatrix}\cos \phi \cos \psi -\cos \theta \sin \phi \sin \psi &-\cos \phi \sin \psi -\cos \theta \sin \phi \cos \psi &\sin \phi \sin \theta \\\sin \phi \cos \psi +\cos \theta \cos \phi \sin \psi &-\sin \phi \sin \psi +\cos \theta \cos \phi \cos \psi &-\cos \phi \sin \theta \\\sin \psi \sin \theta &\cos \psi \sin \theta &\cos \theta \end{pmatrix}},\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2d8390d24d69712dd7c475961c67270b072644cc)1

With the substitutions, Π(_g_ _α_, _β_) assumes the form of the right hand side ([RHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_side "Right-hand side")) of (**[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#math_2)**), which corresponds under Π _u_ to a matrix on the form of the RHS of (**[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#math_1)**) with the same _φ_, _θ_, _ψ_. In terms of the complex parameters _α_, _β_,

To verify this, substitute for _α_. _β_ the elements of the matrix on the RHS of (**[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#math_2)**). After some manipulation, the matrix assumes the form of the RHS of (**[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#math_1)**).

It is clear from the explicit form in terms of Euler angles that the map

just described is a smooth, 2:1 and surjective [group homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homomorphism "Group homomorphism"). It is hence an explicit description of the [universal covering space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_covering_space "Universal covering space") of SO(3) from the [universal covering group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_covering_group "Universal covering group")SU(2).

If ![Image 78: {\displaystyle R(\phi ,{\boldsymbol {n}})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9099b4e9721d58ed9554336e0041496850706973) denotes a counterclockwise rotation with angle φ about the axis specified by the unit vector ![Image 79: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {n}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/336c0aeeee838a26734050e07d045b040a8bfed2) then

### A note on Lie algebras

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_rotation_group&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: A note on Lie algebras")]

In [Lie algebra representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra_representation "Lie algebra representation"), the group SO(3) is compact and simple of rank 1, and so it has a single independent [Casimir element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_element "Casimir element"), a quadratic invariant function of the three generators which commutes with all of them. The Killing form for the rotation group is just the [Kronecker delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta "Kronecker delta"), and so this Casimir invariant is simply the sum of the squares of the generators, ![Image 99: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {J}}_{x},{\boldsymbol {J}}_{y},{\boldsymbol {J}}_{z},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a70f7cc60947545d505aa58dc0d48603d5240abc) of the algebra

![Image 100: {\displaystyle [{\boldsymbol {J}}_{x},{\boldsymbol {J}}_{y}]={\boldsymbol {J}}_{z},\quad [{\boldsymbol {J}}_{z},{\boldsymbol {J}}_{x}]={\boldsymbol {J}}_{y},\quad [{\boldsymbol {J}}_{y},{\boldsymbol {J}}_{z}]={\boldsymbol {J}}_{x}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6eb35b6ad6e2c39742ca6423fac8bf75ad4a2c9b)
That is, the Casimir invariant is given by

![Image 101: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {J}}^{2}\equiv {\boldsymbol {J}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {J}}={\boldsymbol {J}}_{x}^{2}+{\boldsymbol {J}}_{y}^{2}+{\boldsymbol {J}}_{z}^{2}\propto {\boldsymbol {I}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dec64044c017e6a267c63737f0bc1d4a38042dc9)
For unitary irreducible [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra_representation "Lie algebra representation")D j, the eigenvalues of this invariant are real and discrete, and characterize each representation, which is finite dimensional, of dimensionality ![Image 102: {\displaystyle 2j+1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a0a258cc33d54429124aedc154d9b3a968c4d99b). That is, the eigenvalues of this Casimir operator are

![Image 103: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {J}}^{2}=-j(j+1){\boldsymbol {I}}_{2j+1},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/955a6240a4be70673e13d7b7492d72ea95df4fb8)
where j is integer or half-integer, and referred to as the [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)") or [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum").

So, the 3 × 3 generators _**L**_ displayed above act on the triplet (spin 1) representation, while the 2 × 2 generators below, _**t**_, act on the [doublet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor "Spinor") ([spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2 "Spin-1/2")) representation. By taking [Kronecker products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product "Kronecker product") of _D_ 1/2 with itself repeatedly, one may construct all higher irreducible representations D j. That is, the resulting generators for higher spin systems in three spatial dimensions, for arbitrarily large j, can be calculated using these [spin operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_operator "Spin operator") and [ladder operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_operator "Ladder operator").

For every unitary irreducible representations D j there is an equivalent one, _D_−_j_−1. All infinite-dimensional irreducible representations must be non-unitary, since the group is compact.

In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), the Casimir invariant is the "angular-momentum-squared" operator; integer values of spin j characterize [bosonic representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson "Boson"), while half-integer values [fermionic representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"). The [antihermitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew-Hermitian_matrix "Skew-Hermitian matrix") matrices used above are utilized as [spin operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_operator "Spin operator"), after they are multiplied by i, so they are now [hermitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix "Hermitian matrix") (like the Pauli matrices). Thus, in this language,

![Image 104: {\displaystyle [{\boldsymbol {J}}_{x},{\boldsymbol {J}}_{y}]=i{\boldsymbol {J}}_{z},\quad [{\boldsymbol {J}}_{z},{\boldsymbol {J}}_{x}]=i{\boldsymbol {J}}_{y},\quad [{\boldsymbol {J}}_{y},{\boldsymbol {J}}_{z}]=i{\boldsymbol {J}}_{x}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77cbe4e368f4f50472c0d68f8375936e9d6a055b)
and hence

![Image 105: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {J}}^{2}=j(j+1){\boldsymbol {I}}_{2j+1}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87d1634e5cc6655f8fdec7ce15ef6472d285c525)
Explicit expressions for these D j are,

![Image 106: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left({\boldsymbol {J}}_{z}^{(j)}\right)_{ba}&=(j+1-a)\delta _{b,a}\\\left({\boldsymbol {J}}_{x}^{(j)}\right)_{ba}&={\frac {1}{2}}\left(\delta _{b,a+1}+\delta _{b+1,a}\right){\sqrt {(j+1)(a+b-1)-ab}}\\\left({\boldsymbol {J}}_{y}^{(j)}\right)_{ba}&={\frac {1}{2i}}\left(\delta _{b,a+1}-\delta _{b+1,a}\right){\sqrt {(j+1)(a+b-1)-ab}}\\\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7fdc76b81a12cc92cc3b5c6325b4bac1c43a8d72)
where j is arbitrary and ![Image 107: {\displaystyle 1\leq a,b\leq 2j+1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f299d7753bb1df8cc351cd527c4aef5964c46a64).

For example, the resulting spin matrices for spin 1 (![Image 108: {\displaystyle j=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91423fb032c471061948939f4a6811bf463780e0)) are

![Image 109: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\boldsymbol {J}}_{x}&={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}{\begin{pmatrix}0&1&0\\1&0&1\\0&1&0\end{pmatrix}}\\{\boldsymbol {J}}_{y}&={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}{\begin{pmatrix}0&-i&0\\i&0&-i\\0&i&0\end{pmatrix}}\\{\boldsymbol {J}}_{z}&={\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&0&0\\0&0&-1\end{pmatrix}}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6fe7c423226c7bdbfea35ab165e1ea786e3261ab)
Note, however, how these are in an equivalent, but different basis, the [spherical basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_basis#Change_of_basis_matrix "Spherical basis"), than the above i _**L**_ in the Cartesian basis.[[nb 3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-12)

For higher spins, such as spin ⁠3/2⁠ (![Image 110: {\displaystyle j={\tfrac {3}{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/475370dbf5495aee4664cf82b0c1c8a035a303c0)):

### Isomorphism with 𝖘𝖚(2)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_rotation_group&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Isomorphism with 𝖘𝖚(2)")]

The Lie algebras ![Image 114: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}(3)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb4f1d3d3bf3da64b92af1a1018ce00545808b9d) and ![Image 115: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {su}}(2)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/369267d5eae15a7478ebb52c71fcec1449a10dc9) are isomorphic. One basis for ![Image 116: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {su}}(2)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/369267d5eae15a7478ebb52c71fcec1449a10dc9) is given by[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-13)

![Image 117: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {t}}_{1}={\frac {1}{2}}{\begin{bmatrix}0&-i\\-i&0\end{bmatrix}},\quad {\boldsymbol {t}}_{2}={\frac {1}{2}}{\begin{bmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}},\quad {\boldsymbol {t}}_{3}={\frac {1}{2}}{\begin{bmatrix}-i&0\\0&i\end{bmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0117b11bb7d14277fcd7cc885a33235109480262)
These are related to the [Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrix "Pauli matrix") by

![Image 118: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {t}}_{i}\longleftrightarrow {\frac {1}{2i}}\sigma _{i}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ae6399637414517fb7892246fa2628b2b8e869d6)
The Pauli matrices abide by the physicists' convention for Lie algebras. In that convention, Lie algebra elements are multiplied by i, the exponential map (below) is defined with an extra factor of i in the exponent and the [structure constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_constant "Structure constant") remain the same, but the _definition_ of them acquires a factor of i. Likewise, commutation relations acquire a factor of i. The commutation relations for the ![Image 119: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {t}}_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d8c0976a680fe420e26a0760edcbed33e92aed2c) are

![Image 120: {\displaystyle [{\boldsymbol {t}}_{i},{\boldsymbol {t}}_{j}]=\varepsilon _{ijk}{\boldsymbol {t}}_{k},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/28856ed20f15fbc3ba113622cf650f1fecffe0e4)
where [_ε_ _ijk_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_symbol "Levi-Civita symbol") is the totally anti-symmetric symbol with _ε_ 123 = 1. The isomorphism between ![Image 121: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}(3)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb4f1d3d3bf3da64b92af1a1018ce00545808b9d) and ![Image 122: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {su}}(2)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/369267d5eae15a7478ebb52c71fcec1449a10dc9) can be set up in several ways. For later convenience, ![Image 123: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}(3)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb4f1d3d3bf3da64b92af1a1018ce00545808b9d) and ![Image 124: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {su}}(2)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/369267d5eae15a7478ebb52c71fcec1449a10dc9) are identified by mapping

![Image 125: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {L}}_{x}\longleftrightarrow {\boldsymbol {t}}_{1},\quad {\boldsymbol {L}}_{y}\longleftrightarrow {\boldsymbol {t}}_{2},\quad {\boldsymbol {L}}_{z}\longleftrightarrow {\boldsymbol {t}}_{3},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73bd9d4a47bd7665e4f0c58662cec8da2caa0a49)
and extending by linearity.

Since SO(3) is a matrix Lie group, its exponential map is defined using the standard [matrix exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_exponential "Matrix exponential") series,

![Image 126: {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}\exp :{\mathfrak {so}}(3)\to \operatorname {SO} (3)\\A\mapsto e^{A}=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{k!}}A^{k}=I+A+{\tfrac {1}{2}}A^{2}+\cdots .\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fa1a3092df3649d460df0ca5c400c6f1848e47cb)
For any [skew-symmetric matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew-symmetric_matrix "Skew-symmetric matrix")_A_ ∈ 𝖘𝖔(3), _e A_ is always in SO(3). The proof uses the elementary properties of the matrix exponential

![Image 127: {\displaystyle \left(e^{A}\right)^{\textsf {T}}e^{A}=e^{A^{\textsf {T}}}e^{A}=e^{A^{\textsf {T}}+A}=e^{-A+A}=e^{A-A}=e^{A}\left(e^{A}\right)^{\textsf {T}}=e^{0}=I.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/26552a11b20b05e67e348953bc03296380702863)
since the matrices _A_ and _A_ T commute, this can be easily proven with the skew-symmetric matrix condition. This is not enough to show that 𝖘𝖔(3) is the corresponding Lie algebra for SO(3), and shall be proven separately.

The level of difficulty of proof depends on how a matrix group Lie algebra is defined. [Hall (2003)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#CITEREFHall2003) defines the Lie algebra as the set of matrices

![Image 128: {\displaystyle \left\{A\in \operatorname {M} (n,\mathbb {R} )\left|e^{tA}\in \operatorname {SO} (3)\forall t\right.\right\},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9409c19331edd1319b169798d86fc2a7a7487a5e)
in which case it is trivial. [Rossmann (2002)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#CITEREFRossmann2002) uses for a definition derivatives of smooth curve segments in SO(3) through the identity taken at the identity, in which case it is harder.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-14)

For a fixed _A_ ≠ 0, _e tA_, −∞ <_t_< ∞ is a [one-parameter subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-parameter_subgroup "One-parameter subgroup") along a [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") in SO(3). That this gives a one-parameter subgroup follows directly from properties of the exponential map.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-15)

The exponential map provides a [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") between a neighborhood of the origin in the 𝖘𝖔(3) and a neighborhood of the identity in the SO(3).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-16) For a proof, see [Closed subgroup theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_subgroup_theorem "Closed subgroup theorem").

The exponential map is [surjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective "Surjective"). This follows from the fact that every _R_ ∈ SO(3), since every rotation leaves an axis fixed ([Euler's rotation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem "Euler's rotation theorem")), and is conjugate to a [block diagonal matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_diagonal_matrix "Block diagonal matrix") of the form

![Image 129: {\displaystyle D={\begin{pmatrix}\cos \theta &-\sin \theta &0\\\sin \theta &\cos \theta &0\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}=e^{\theta L_{z}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/097f9f9753d513863b0ba88b5c601ab42b4b2397)
such that _A_ = _BDB_−1, and that

![Image 130: {\displaystyle Be^{\theta L_{z}}B^{-1}=e^{B\theta L_{z}B^{-1}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2119ada2c6b41c467bb81692c4ecc132a8e329d3)
together with the fact that 𝖘𝖔(3) is closed under the [adjoint action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_representation "Adjoint representation") of SO(3), meaning that _BθL z B_−1 ∈ 𝖘𝖔(3).

Thus, e.g., it is easy to check the popular identity

![Image 131: {\displaystyle e^{-\pi L_{x}/2}e^{\theta L_{z}}e^{\pi L_{x}/2}=e^{\theta L_{y}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a5ad2422addeca40a7338218449fea4d115c1ea3)
As shown above, every element _A_ ∈ 𝖘𝖔(3) is associated with a vector _**ω**_ = _θ_ _**u**_, where _**u**_ = (_x_,_y_,_z_) is a unit magnitude vector. Since _**u**_ is in the null space of A, if one now rotates to a new basis, through some other orthogonal matrix _O_, with **u** as the z axis, the final column and row of the rotation matrix in the new basis will be zero.

Thus, we know in advance from the formula for the exponential that exp(_OAO_ T) must leave _**u**_ fixed. It is mathematically impossible to supply a straightforward formula for such a basis as a function of _**u**_, because its existence would violate the [hairy ball theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem "Hairy ball theorem"); but direct exponentiation is possible, and [yields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis%E2%80%93angle_representation#Exponential_map_from_%F0%9D%96%98%F0%9D%96%94(3)_to_SO(3) "Axis–angle representation")

This is recognized as a matrix for a rotation around axis _**u**_ by the angle θ: cf. [Rodrigues' rotation formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigues%27_rotation_formula "Rodrigues' rotation formula").

Given _R_ ∈ SO(3), let ![Image 135: {\displaystyle A={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(R-R^{\mathrm {T} }\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fac798d86a511f66c8d113123b600d0cd57ec56d) denote the antisymmetric part and let ![Image 136: {\textstyle \|A\|={\sqrt {-{\frac {1}{2}}\operatorname {Tr} \left(A^{2}\right)}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/772c27848ef001a5e3d7642524dd20031020b065) Then, the logarithm of R is given by[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-Eng%C3%B8_2001-11)

This is manifest by inspection of the mixed symmetry form of Rodrigues' formula,

Uniform random sampling

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_rotation_group&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Uniform random sampling")]

![Image 139: {\displaystyle SO(3)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16c677fee782e584fd417726201ce27c567f1e11) is doubly covered by the group of unit quaternions, which is isomorphic to the 3-sphere. Since the [Haar measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_measure "Haar measure") on the unit quaternions is just the 3-area measure in 4 dimensions, the Haar measure on ![Image 140: {\displaystyle SO(3)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16c677fee782e584fd417726201ce27c567f1e11) is just the pushforward of the 3-area measure.

Consequently, generating a uniformly random rotation in ![Image 141: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) is equivalent to generating a uniformly random point on the 3-sphere.

Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_rotation_group&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula")]

Suppose X and Y in the Lie algebra are given. Their exponentials, exp(_X_) and exp(_Y_), are rotation matrices, which can be multiplied. Since the exponential map is a surjection, for some Z in the Lie algebra, exp(_Z_) = exp(_X_) exp(_Y_), and one may tentatively write

![Image 145: {\displaystyle Z=C(X,Y),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2ba1bf19a610b8c4f4b7e7e82439b2d0219b76f)
for C some expression in _X_ and _Y_. When exp(_X_) and exp(_Y_) commute, then _Z_ = _X_ + _Y_, mimicking the behavior of complex exponentiation.

The general case is given by the more elaborate [BCH formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCH_formula "BCH formula"), a series expansion of nested Lie brackets.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-18) For matrices, the Lie bracket is the same operation as the [commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator "Commutator"), which monitors lack of commutativity in multiplication. This general expansion unfolds as follows,[[nb 4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-19)

![Image 146: {\displaystyle Z=C(X,Y)=X+Y+{\frac {1}{2}}[X,Y]+{\tfrac {1}{12}}[X,[X,Y]]-{\frac {1}{12}}[Y,[X,Y]]+\cdots .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/deb50254cdee1dcfdbb89e3c9994d201051418bd)
The infinite expansion in the BCH formula for SO(3) reduces to a compact form,

![Image 147: {\displaystyle Z=\alpha X+\beta Y+\gamma [X,Y],}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cdd2c4da063f9ec30359beaacd3767b962f3875)
for suitable trigonometric function coefficients (_α_, _β_, _γ_).

It is worthwhile to write this composite rotation generator as

![Image 148: {\displaystyle \alpha X+\beta Y+\gamma [X,Y]{\underset {{\mathfrak {so}}(3)}{=}}X+Y+{\frac {1}{2}}[X,Y]+{\frac {1}{12}}[X,[X,Y]]-{\frac {1}{12}}[Y,[X,Y]]+\cdots ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/11e64023ced100d20590d64041bc325a08fba789)
to emphasize that this is a _Lie algebra identity_.

The above identity holds for all [faithful representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithful_representation "Faithful representation") of 𝖘𝖔(3). The [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(algebra) "Kernel (algebra)") of a Lie algebra homomorphism is an [ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(Lie_algebra) "Ideal (Lie algebra)"), but 𝖘𝖔(3), being [simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_(abstract_algebra) "Simple (abstract algebra)"), has no nontrivial ideals and all nontrivial representations are hence faithful. It holds in particular in the doublet or spinor representation. The same explicit formula thus follows in a simpler way through Pauli matrices, cf. the [2×2 derivation for SU(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices#Exponential_of_a_Pauli_vector "Pauli matrices").

For the general _n_ × _n_ case, one might use Ref.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-20)

Infinitesimal rotations
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_rotation_group&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Infinitesimal rotations")]

An [infinitesimal rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_rotation_matrix "Infinitesimal rotation matrix") or differential rotation matrix is a [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)") representing an [infinitely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") small [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation").

While a [rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix "Rotation matrix") is an [orthogonal matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix "Orthogonal matrix")![Image 149: {\displaystyle R^{\mathsf {T}}=R^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/85439c87cf2430c0c01e9eb25f6d6cee89ee3238) representing an element of ![Image 150: {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9fa71842f19b6810b4bfa9eb282e92fbf285094e) (the [special orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group")), the [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mathematics) "Differential (mathematics)") of a rotation is a [skew-symmetric matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew-symmetric_matrix "Skew-symmetric matrix")![Image 151: {\displaystyle A^{\mathsf {T}}=-A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8f020a5cc94f0fd27929041f589affa0e575a083) in the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space")![Image 152: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}(n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/57c18bd074c7bdc79ea650563edde2e2bc080321) (the [special orthogonal Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_Lie_algebra "Special orthogonal Lie algebra")), which is not itself a rotation matrix.

An infinitesimal rotation matrix has the form

![Image 153: {\displaystyle I+d\theta \,A,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e3da72e5ca97ba81447afc60fae1a089f4c1a20f)

For example, if ⁠![Image 157: {\displaystyle A=L_{x}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4eaa5e8d5cb15b03dfa763d36362a272c1c7fd83)⁠, representing an infinitesimal three-dimensional rotation about the x-axis, a basis element of ⁠![Image 158: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}(3)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb4f1d3d3bf3da64b92af1a1018ce00545808b9d)⁠, then

The computation rules for infinitesimal rotation matrices are the usual ones except that infinitesimals of second order are dropped. With these rules, these matrices do not satisfy all the same properties as ordinary finite rotation matrices under the usual treatment of infinitesimals.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-22) It turns out that _the order in which infinitesimal rotations are applied is irrelevant_.

Realizations of rotations
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_rotation_group&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Realizations of rotations")]

We have seen that there are a variety of ways to represent rotations:

*   as orthogonal matrices with determinant 1,
*   by axis and rotation angle
*   in [quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") algebra with [versors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versor "Versor") and the map [3-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere "3-sphere")_S_ 3 → SO(3) (see [quaternions and spatial rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation "Quaternions and spatial rotation"))
*   in [geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra") as a [rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_(mathematics) "Rotor (mathematics)")
*   as a sequence of three rotations about three fixed axes; see [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angle "Euler angle").

Spherical harmonics

The group SO(3) of three-dimensional Euclidean rotations has an infinite-dimensional representation on the Hilbert space

Its elements are square integrable complex-valued functions[[nb 5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-23) on the sphere. The inner product on this space is given by

The Lorentz group action restricts to that of SO(3) and is expressed as

![Image 166: {\displaystyle (\Pi (R)f)(\theta (x),\phi (x))=\sum _{\ell =1}^{\infty }\sum _{m=-\ell }^{m=\ell }\sum _{m'=-\ell }^{m'=\ell }D_{mm'}^{(\ell )}(R)f_{\ell m'}Y_{m}^{\ell }\left(\theta \left(R^{-1}x\right),\phi \left(R^{-1}x\right)\right),\qquad R\in \operatorname {SO} (3),\quad x\in \mathbf {S} ^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dc3368a8ffafb5960be67166351209e979b6569d)H4

This action is unitary, meaning that

![Image 167: {\displaystyle \langle \Pi (R)f,\Pi (R)g\rangle =\langle f,g\rangle \qquad \forall f,g\in \mathbf {S} ^{2},\quad \forall R\in \operatorname {SO} (3).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e6bcbe64a890bd54a4b6bedb81b97cec938975ce)H5

The _D_(_ℓ_) can be obtained from the _D_(_m_, _n_) of above using [Clebsch–Gordan decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients "Clebsch–Gordan coefficients"), but they are more easily directly expressed as an exponential of an odd-dimensional **su**(2)-representation (the 3-dimensional one is exactly 𝖘𝖔(3)).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-25)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-26) In this case the space _L_ 2(**S**2) decomposes neatly into an infinite direct sum of irreducible odd finite-dimensional representations _V_ 2 _i_ + 1, _i_ = 0, 1, ... according to[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-27)

This is characteristic of infinite-dimensional unitary representations of SO(3). If Π is an infinite-dimensional unitary representation on a [separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_space "Separable space")[[nb 6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-28) Hilbert space, then it decomposes as a direct sum of finite-dimensional unitary representations.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-Gelfand_M_S-24) Such a representation is thus never irreducible. All irreducible finite-dimensional representations (Π, _V_) can be made unitary by an appropriate choice of inner product,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite_note-Gelfand_M_S-24)

where the integral is the unique invariant integral over SO(3) normalized to 1, here expressed using the [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles") parametrization. The inner product inside the integral is any inner product on _V_.

The rotation group generalizes quite naturally to _n_-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), ![Image 170: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) with its standard Euclidean structure. The group of all proper and improper rotations in _n_ dimensions is called the [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group") O(_n_), and the subgroup of proper rotations is called the [special orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group") SO(_n_), which is a [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") of dimension _n_(_n_ − 1)/2.

In [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"), one works in a 4-dimensional vector space, known as [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space") rather than 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Unlike Euclidean space, Minkowski space has an inner product with an indefinite [signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_signature "Metric signature"). However, one can still define _generalized rotations_ which preserve this inner product. Such generalized rotations are known as [Lorentz transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation") and the group of all such transformations is called the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group "Lorentz group").

The rotation group SO(3) can be described as a subgroup of [E+(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SE(3) "SE(3)"), the [Euclidean group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group "Euclidean group") of [direct isometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group#Direct_and_indirect_isometries "Euclidean group") of Euclidean ![Image 171: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b00b2b4fd27c2cbffa02df568472f77b194a6db9) This larger group is the group of all motions of a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body"): each of these is a combination of a rotation about an arbitrary axis and a translation, or put differently, a combination of an element of SO(3) and an arbitrary translation.

In general, the rotation group of an object is the [symmetry group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_group "Symmetry group") within the group of direct isometries; in other words, the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries. For [chiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(mathematics) "Chirality (mathematics)") objects it is the same as the full symmetry group.

'_[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3)#cite\_ref-6)_ _**This is effected by first applying a rotation ![Image 172: {\displaystyle g\_{\theta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/aedf5ba36e3a9362424d65717feae5cc7cbada2b) through**_**φ _about the_ z _-axis to take the_ x _-axis to the line_ L _, the intersection between the planes_ xy _and_ x'y**, the latter being the rotated _xy_-plane. Then rotate with ![Image 173: {\displaystyle g_{\theta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aedf5ba36e3a9362424d65717feae5cc7cbada2b) through θ about _L_ to obtain the new _z_-axis from the old one, and finally rotate by ![Image 174: {\displaystyle g_{\psi }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc8ca165904d0990611ca4aefb77482a62a7e821) through an angle ψ about the _new_ _z_-axis, where ψ is the angle between L and the new _x_-axis. In the equation, ![Image 175: {\displaystyle g_{\theta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aedf5ba36e3a9362424d65717feae5cc7cbada2b) and ![Image 176: {\displaystyle g_{\psi }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc8ca165904d0990611ca4aefb77482a62a7e821) are expressed in a temporary _rotated basis_ at each step, which is seen from their simple form. To transform these back to the original basis, observe that ![Image 177: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{\theta }=g_{\phi }g_{\theta }g_{\phi }^{-1}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6fc73f074699b35ce50916b3cfb95e6fc3ac2510) Here boldface means that the rotation is expressed in the _original_ basis. Likewise, ![Image 178: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{\psi }=g_{\phi }g_{\theta }g_{\phi }^{-1}g_{\phi }g_{\psi }\left[g_{\phi }g_{\theta }g_{\phi }^{-1}g_{\phi }\right]^{-1}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f0c1b4f9dae05dcdb68b7dbac5631fc70e8cffd) Thus ![Image 179: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{\psi }\mathbf {g} _{\theta }\mathbf {g} _{\phi }=g_{\phi }g_{\theta }g_{\phi }^{-1}g_{\phi }g_{\psi }\left[g_{\phi }g_{\theta }g_{\phi }^{-1}g_{\phi }\right]^{-1}*g_{\phi }g_{\theta }g_{\phi }^{-1}*g_{\phi }=g_{\phi }g_{\theta }g_{\psi }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d2f40e8079a8f380e4f598c51335f31f825fbfa6)

Convergence is guaranteed when ![Image 183: {\displaystyle \|X\|+\|Y\|<\log 2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6fc45dd2dad2bbfe24b25c14b20f4e2bc4c159ef) and ![Image 184: {\displaystyle \|Z\|<\log 2.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dd02484062e1cb0ff1fdd3bf40ad0de15a9cef1b) The series may still converge even if these conditions are not fulfilled.
