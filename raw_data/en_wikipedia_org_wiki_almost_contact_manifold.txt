( October 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In the mathematical field of differential geometry , an almost-contact structure is a certain kind of geometric structure on a smooth manifold . Such structures were introduced by Shigeo Sasaki in 1960.

Precisely, given a smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} , an almost-contact structure consists of a hyperplane distribution Q {\displaystyle Q} , an almost-complex structure J {\displaystyle J} on Q {\displaystyle Q} , and a vector field ξ ξ {\displaystyle \xi } which is transverse to Q {\displaystyle Q} . That is, for each point p {\displaystyle p} of M {\displaystyle M} , one selects a codimension-one linear subspace Q p {\displaystyle Q_{p}} of the tangent space T p M {\displaystyle T_{p}M} , a linear map J p : Q p → → Q p {\displaystyle J_{p}:Q_{p}\to Q_{p}} such that J p ∘ ∘ J p = − − id Q p {\displaystyle J_{p}\circ J_{p}=-\operatorname {id} _{Q_{p}}} , and an element ξ ξ p {\displaystyle \xi _{p}} of T p M {\displaystyle T_{p}M} which is not contained in Q p {\displaystyle Q_{p}} .

Given such data, one can define, for each p {\displaystyle p} in M {\displaystyle M} , a linear map η η p : T p M → → R {\displaystyle \eta _{p}:T_{p}M\to \mathbb {R} } and a linear map φ φ p : T p M → → T p M {\displaystyle \varphi _{p}:T_{p}M\to T_{p}M} by η η p ( u ) = 0 if u ∈ ∈ Q p η η p ( ξ ξ p ) = 1 φ φ p ( u ) = J p ( u ) if u ∈ ∈ Q p φ φ p ( ξ ξ ) = 0.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\eta _{p}(u)&=0{\text{ if }}u\in Q_{p}\\\eta _{p}(\xi _{p})&=1\\\varphi _{p}(u)&=J_{p}(u){\text{ if }}u\in Q_{p}\\\varphi _{p}(\xi )&=0.\end{aligned}}} This defines a one-form η η {\displaystyle \eta } and (1,1)-tensor field φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } on M {\displaystyle M} , and one can check directly, by decomposing v {\displaystyle v} relative to the direct sum decomposition T p M = Q p ⊕ ⊕ { k ξ ξ p : k ∈ ∈ R } {\displaystyle T_{p}M=Q_{p}\oplus \left\{k\xi _{p}:k\in \mathbb {R} \right\}} , that η η p ( v ) ξ ξ p = φ φ p ∘ ∘ φ φ p ( v ) + v {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\eta _{p}(v)\xi _{p}&=\varphi _{p}\circ \varphi _{p}(v)+v\end{aligned}}} for any v {\displaystyle v} in T p M {\displaystyle T_{p}M} . Conversely, one may define an almost-contact structure as a triple ( ξ ξ , η η , φ φ ) {\displaystyle (\xi ,\eta ,\varphi )} which satisfies the two conditions η η p ( v ) ξ ξ p = φ φ p ∘ ∘ φ φ p ( v ) + v {\displaystyle \eta _{p}(v)\xi _{p}=\varphi _{p}\circ \varphi _{p}(v)+v} for any v ∈ ∈ T p M {\displaystyle v\in T_{p}M} η η p ( ξ ξ p ) = 1 {\displaystyle \eta _{p}(\xi _{p})=1} Then one can define Q p {\displaystyle Q_{p}} to be the kernel of the linear map η η p {\displaystyle \eta _{p}} , and one can check that the restriction of φ φ p {\displaystyle \varphi _{p}} to Q p {\displaystyle Q_{p}} is valued in Q p {\displaystyle Q_{p}} , thereby defining J p {\displaystyle J_{p}} .
