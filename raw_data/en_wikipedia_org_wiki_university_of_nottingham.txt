The **University of Nottingham** is a public [research university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_university "Research university") in [Nottingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham "Nottingham"), England. It was founded as **University College Nottingham** in 1881, and was granted a [royal charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_charter "Royal charter") in 1948.

Nottingham's main campus ([University Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Park_Campus,_Nottingham "University Park Campus, Nottingham")) with Jubilee Campus and teaching hospital ([Queen's Medical Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Medical_Centre "Queen's Medical Centre")) are located within the [City of Nottingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Nottingham "City of Nottingham"), with a number of smaller campuses and sites elsewhere in [Nottinghamshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottinghamshire "Nottinghamshire") and [Derbyshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire "Derbyshire"). Outside the UK, the university has campuses in [Semenyih, Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semenyih,_Malaysia "Semenyih, Malaysia"), and [Ningbo, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo,_China "Ningbo, China"). Nottingham is organised into five constituent faculties, within which there are more than 50 schools, departments, institutes and research centres. Nottingham has more than 46,000 students and 7,000 staff across the UK, China and Malaysia and had an income of £834.7 million in 2023–24, of which £141.6 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £615.3 million.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-Nottingham_Financial_Statement_23/24-1)

The institution's alumni have been awarded one Nobel Prize, a Fields Medal, and a Gabor Medal and Prize. The university is a member of the [Association of Commonwealth Universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Commonwealth_Universities "Association of Commonwealth Universities"), the [European University Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_University_Association "European University Association"), the [Russell Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Group "Russell Group"), [Universitas 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universitas_21 "Universitas 21"), [Universities UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_UK "Universities UK"), the [Virgo Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Consortium "Virgo Consortium"), and participates in the [Sutton Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Trust "Sutton Trust") Summer School programme as a member of the [Sutton 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Trust#Sutton_Trust_30 "Sutton Trust").

The University of Nottingham traces its origins to both the founding of an [adult education school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_school "Normal school") in 1798, and the University Extension Lectures inaugurated by the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge") in 1873—the first of their kind in the country.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-ReferenceA-10) However, the foundation of the university is generally regarded as being the establishment of University College Nottingham, in 1881 as a college preparing students for examinations of the [University of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_London "University of London").

In 1875, an anonymous donor provided £10,000 to establish the work of the Adult Education School and Cambridge Extension Lectures on a permanent basis, and the Corporation of Nottingham agreed to erect and maintain a building for this purpose and to provide funds to supply the instruction.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-ReferenceA-10)

The foundation stone of the college was duly laid in 1877 by the former Prime Minister [William Ewart Gladstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ewart_Gladstone "William Ewart Gladstone"),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-NottinghamBriefHistory-11) and the college's neo-gothic building on Shakespeare Street was formally opened in 1881 by [Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Leopold,_Duke_of_Albany "Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-NottinghamBriefHistory-11) In 1881, there were four professors – of Literature, Physics, Chemistry and Natural Science. New departments and chairs quickly followed: Engineering in 1884, Classics combined with Philosophy in 1893, French in 1897 and Education in 1905; in 1905 the combined Department of Physics and Mathematics became two separate entities; in 1911 Departments of English and Mining were created, in 1912, Economics, and Geology combined with Geography; History in 1914, Adult Education in 1923 and Pharmacy in 1925.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-ReferenceA-10)

The university college underwent significant expansion in the 1920s, when it moved from the centre of Nottingham to a large campus on the city's outskirts. The new campus, called University Park, was completed in 1928, and financed by an endowment fund, public contributions, and the generosity of [Sir Jesse Boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Boot "Jesse Boot") (later Lord Trent) who presented 35 acres (14 ha) to the City of Nottingham in 1921.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-12) Boot and his fellow benefactors sought to establish an "elite seat of learning" committed to widening participation,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-13) and hoped that the move would solve the problems facing University College Nottingham, in its restricted building on Shakespeare Street. Boot stipulated that, whilst part of the Highfields site, lying south-west of the city, should be devoted to the University College, the rest should provide a place of recreation for the residents of the city, and, by the end of the decade, the landscaping of the lake and public park adjoining University Boulevard was completed. The original University College building on Shakespeare Street in central Nottingham, known as the Arkwright Building, now forms part of [Nottingham Trent University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Trent_University "Nottingham Trent University")'s City Campus.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-14)

University College Nottingham was initially accommodated within the [Trent Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Building "Trent Building"), an imposing white limestone structure with a distinctive clock tower, designed by Morley Horder, and formally opened by [King George V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_George_V "King George V") on 10 July 1928. During this period of development, Nottingham attracted high-profile lecturers, including [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), [H. G. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells "H. G. Wells"), and [Mahatma Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi "Mahatma Gandhi").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-15) The blackboard used by Einstein during his time at Nottingham is still on display in the Physics department.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-16)

Apart from its physical transfer to surroundings that could not be more different from its original home, the college made few developments between the wars. The Department of Slavonic Languages (later Slavonic Studies) was established in 1933, the teaching of Russian having been introduced in 1916. In 1933–34, the Departments of Electrical Engineering, Zoology and Geography, which had been combined with other subjects, were made independent; and in 1938 a supplemental Charter provided for a much wider representation on the Governing Body. However, further advances were delayed by the outbreak of war in 1939.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-ReferenceA-10)

University College Nottingham students received their degrees from the University of London.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-17) However, in 1943, the university was granted its [royal charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_charter "Royal charter") which endowed it with university status and gave it the power to confer degrees. In 1948 University College Nottingham was incorporated as the University of Nottingham.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-18)

In the 1940s, the Midlands Agricultural and Dairy College at [Sutton Bonington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Bonington "Sutton Bonington") merged with the university as the School of Agriculture, and in 1956 the Portland Building was completed to complement the Trent Building. In 1970, the university established the UK's first new medical school of the 20th century.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-NottinghamBriefHistory-11)

The university has used several logos throughout its history, beginning with its coat of arms. Later, Nottingham adopted a simpler logo, in which a stylised version of [Nottingham Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Castle "Nottingham Castle") was surrounded by the text "The University of Nottingham". In 2001 Nottingham undertook a major re-branding exercise, which included replacing the logo with the current one.

In 1999, Jubilee Campus was opened on the former site of the [Raleigh Bicycle Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh_Bicycle_Company "Raleigh Bicycle Company"), one mile (1.6 km) away from the [University Park Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Park_Campus,_Nottingham "University Park Campus, Nottingham"). Nottingham then began to expand overseas, opening campuses in [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia") and in China in 1999 and 2004 respectively. In 2005, the [King's Meadow Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Meadow_Campus "King's Meadow Campus") opened near University Park.

In November 2023, it was announced that the University of Nottingham had become the first university in the UK to be awarded an [Athena SWAN Gold Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena_SWAN "Athena SWAN") for its commitment to advancing gender equality.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-19)

[University Park Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Park_Campus,_Nottingham "University Park Campus, Nottingham"), to the west of Nottingham city centre, is the 330-acre (1.3 km 2) main campus of the University of Nottingham. Set around its lake and clock-tower and with extensive parkland greenery,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-21) University Park has won numerous awards for its architecture and landscaping, and has been named the greenest campus in the country in a Green Flag Award.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-22)

At the south entrance to the main campus, in Highfields Park, lies the Lakeside Arts Centre, the university's public arts facility and performance space. The D.H. Lawrence Pavilion houses a range of cultural facilities, including a 225 capacity theatre space, a series of craft cabinets, the Weston Gallery (which displays the university's manuscript collection), the Wallner gallery, which exists as a platform for local and regional artists, and a series of visual arts, performance and hospitality spaces. Other nearby facilities include the Djanogly Art Gallery, Recital Hall and Theatre, which in the past have hosted recordings and broadcasts by BBC Radio 3, local community theatre partnerships, contemporary art exhibitions, and cultural festivals.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-BBC_Radio_3_%E2%80%93_Beethoven%E2%80%99s_String_Quartet_at_the_Djanogly_Concert_Hall,_Nottingham-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-Culture_and_the_Arts-24)

 Jubilee Campus, features the _Sir Harry and Lady Djanogly Learning Resource Centre_, a library designed in the shape of an inverted cone situated on an island in a lake.

[Jubilee Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_Campus "Jubilee Campus"), designed by Sir [Michael Hopkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hopkins_(architect) "Michael Hopkins (architect)"), was opened by [Queen Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom "Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom") in 1999, and is approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) from University Park. The campus' facilities house the Schools of Education and Computer Science, and The [Nottingham University Business School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_University_Business_School "Nottingham University Business School"). The site is also the home of The National College for School Leadership. Additional investment of £9.2 million in Jubilee Campus was completed in 2004, with a second building for Nottingham University Business School opened by [Lord Sainsbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sainsbury,_Baron_Sainsbury_of_Turville "David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-ukcorr.org-25) The environmentally friendly nature of the campus and its buildings have been a factor in the awards that it has received, including the Millennium Marque Award for Environmental Excellence, the British Construction Industry Building Project of the Year, the RIBA Journal Sustainability Award, and the Civic Trust Award for Sustainability.

The Jubilee Campus won the commendation of the Energy Globe Award judges in 2005.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-ukcorr.org-25) The campus is distinct for its modern and unique architecture, culminating in [Aspire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspire_(sculpture) "Aspire (sculpture)"), a 60-metre tall artistic structure is the tallest freestanding structure in the UK. The university plans to invest £200 million in a new scheme designed by [Ken Shuttleworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Shuttleworth_(architect) "Ken Shuttleworth (architect)"), designer of the London '[Gherkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_St_Mary_Axe "30 St Mary Axe")' and founder of [Make Architects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Architects "Make Architects"). However, the architecture of the Jubilee Campus is not admired by all, and the newly completed Amenities Building and YANG Fujia Building have been labelled the second worst new architectural design in Britain in a survey.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-26)

The [GlaxoSmithKline Carbon Neutral Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline_Carbon_Neutral_Laboratory "GlaxoSmithKline Carbon Neutral Laboratory") is part of the university's School of Chemistry and is the UK's first carbon neutral laboratory.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-27) On 12 September 2014 a large fire broke out during its construction,[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-29) resulting in the official opening being delayed until 2017.

The [City Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_City_Hospital "Nottingham City Hospital") Campus houses staff and postgraduate students specialising in respiratory medicine, stroke medicine, oncology, physiotherapy, and public health. The campus was expanded in 2009 to house a new institute of public health and a specialist centre for tobacco research.

[Sutton Bonington Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Bonington_Campus "Sutton Bonington Campus") houses Nottingham's School of Biosciences and the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, and is about 12 miles (19 kilometres) south of the City of Nottingham, between the M1 motorway, [Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratcliffe-on-Soar_Power_Station "Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station"), and the [Midland Main Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Main_Line "Midland Main Line") railway. The campus is centred on the historic manor of Sutton Bonington and retains many of its own botanic gardens and lakes.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-30) The University Farm, including the Dairy Centre, is at the Sutton Bonington Campus.

[King's Meadow Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Meadow_Campus "King's Meadow Campus") was established in 2005 on the former [Central Independent Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Independent_Television "Central Independent Television") Studios site on Lenton Lane. It mainly accommodates administrative functions, but also the Department of Manuscripts and Special Collections. A functioning television studio remains at the site, that continues to be rented to the film and television industry.

[Castle Meadow Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Meadow_Campus "Castle Meadow Campus") is a 3.75-hectare site below [Nottingham Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Castle "Nottingham Castle"), purchased by the university in 2021, having been previously owned by HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs). Existing buildings are to be refurbished with the campus planned to open from 2023. [[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-31)

### International campuses

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Nottingham&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: International campuses")]

 Nottingham also boasts a campus in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Nottingham has introduced overseas campuses as part of a growth strategy. The first stage in this strategy was the establishment in 1999 of a campus in [Semenyih](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semenyih "Semenyih"), Selangor, Malaysia, a short distance from [Kuala Lumpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur "Kuala Lumpur"). This was followed in 2004 by a campus in [Ningbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo "Ningbo"), [Zhejiang Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_Province "Zhejiang Province"), China.

The Malaysia campus was the first campus of a British university in Malaysia and one of the first anywhere in the world, earning the [Queen's Award for Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Award_for_Enterprise "Queen's Award for Enterprise") 2001 and the Queen's Award for Industry (International Trade) 2006.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-32) In September 2005, the Malaysia campus moved to a purpose-built campus at Semenyih, 18 miles (29.0 km) south of Kuala Lumpur city centre.

The £40 million Ningbo campus was completed in 2005, and was officially opened by [John Prescott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prescott "John Prescott"), the UK's Deputy Prime Minister, in February 2006. Like the Malaysia Campus, Ningbo Campus builds on the University Park in the UK and includes a lake, its own version of Nottingham's famous Trent Building, and the Centre for Sustainable Energy Technologies (CSET), China's first zero-carbon building.

The University of Nottingham Students' Union is heavily involved with providing student activities at the university and has more than 190 [student societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_societies "Student societies") affiliated to it. A further 76 clubs are affiliated to the Students' Union's [Sports Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Union "Athletic Union"). Nottingham participates yearly in the [Varsity Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Varsity_Series_(Nottingham_universities) "The Varsity Series (Nottingham universities)"), a number of sporting events between the students and staff of the university and traditional rivals [Loughborough University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough_University "Loughborough University")[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-73) and [Nottingham Trent University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Trent_University "Nottingham Trent University").

The student newspaper _[Impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact\_(student\_magazine) "Impact (student magazine)")_ is published regularly during term time. The Students' Union radio station is [University Radio Nottingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Radio_Nottingham "University Radio Nottingham"). A range of student theatre takes place at [The New Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Theatre_(Nottingham) "New Theatre (Nottingham)"). The Students' Union also operates a student-run professional sound and lighting company, [TEC PA & Lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEC_PA_%26_Lighting "TEC PA & Lighting"), who provide services for many events such as graduation, balls, and many other events, both within the university and to external clients.

The Students' Union also organises a number of activities and events involving students and staff with the local community. The Student Volunteer Centre sees more than 4500 students each year volunteering in local schools and community organisations, as well as a range of other projects throughout the city of Nottingham. The Union has the largest student-run RAG organisation outside of the US, "Karnival" (abbreviated to "Karni"), which raised £1.61 million in 2012.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-74) The Students' Union also runs an international volunteering project, [InterVol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterVol "InterVol"), which sends student volunteers to work in rural African communities.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-75)

Karnival also ran "RAG raids", a format of charity fundraising in other cities, which proved to be one of the most profitable charity sources for the university with notably a single RAG raid in 2014 raising £66,552.72 for the Poppy Appeal. However, in April 2017 the raids were controversially banned by the students' union over the fears for the safety on students.

The University of Nottingham has a system of halls located on its campus. The halls are generally named either after counties, districts, or places in the [East Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands "East Midlands") or significant people associated with the university.

On 14 May 2008, [Hicham Yezza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hicham_Yezza "Hicham Yezza"), a member of staff, and [Rizwaan Sabir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizwaan_Sabir "Rizwaan Sabir"), a postgraduate student, were arrested at the University of Nottingham and were [detained for six days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Two "Nottingham Two") under the Terrorism Act 2000. The university informed the police after finding an edited version of the [al-Qaeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda "Al-Qaeda") training manual the student was using for his research. Both were released without charge from terrorism offences.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-78)[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-79) In September 2011, Rizwaan Sabir was awarded £20,000 compensation for false imprisonment by [Nottinghamshire Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottinghamshire_Police "Nottinghamshire Police").

The university came under criticism after the only professor involved in terrorism studies at the institution, [Rod Thornton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Thornton "Rod Thornton"), decided that, because of the university's lack of guidance to him regarding their position over possession of terrorist publications, he was no longer willing to risk possible arrest by teaching terrorism studies at the university, although he would continue in his other responsibilities.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-sabir2010-80) As a result, terrorism studies are no longer being taught at the University of Nottingham.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-sabir2010-80)

For a 2011 conference of the [British International Studies Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_International_Studies_Association "British International Studies Association"), Thornton prepared a paper which alleged the university had engaged in systematic persecution against Yezza, Sabir, and junior academics in the department.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-81) One of Thornton's colleagues at Nottingham complained to BISA about alleged [defamatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamatory "Defamatory") content of Thornton's paper, and a spokesman for the university called it "highly defamatory of a number of his colleagues". The paper was later removed from BISA's website.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-suspended-82)

In early May 2011, Thornton was suspended by the university for the "breakdown in working relationships" caused by the paper. In an open letter published in _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Guardian "The Guardian")_, 67 international researchers including [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky") asked for Thornton's reinstatement and an independent examination of the university's actions, saying that Thornton's paper "carefully details what appear to be examples of serious misconduct from senior university management over the arrest of two university members".[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-letter-83) In 2011, a campaign was launched calling for the reinstatement of Rod Thornton and for a public inquiry into the university's actions.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-84) In March 2012 it was announced that Thornton was leaving his job as a lecturer at Nottingham, and that, "for his part, Dr Thornton accepts that the article which he published on the BISA website in April 2011 contained a number of inaccuracies."[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-85) Thornton apologized for any offence he might have caused.

### COVID-19 pandemic response

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Nottingham&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: COVID-19 pandemic response")]

In the 2020–21 academic year, students of the University of Nottingham organised large-scale campaigning against the university management team and specifically the Vice-Chancellor, [Shearer West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearer_West "Shearer West"), for wider academic, welfare, and financial support for students, due to the on-going [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic").[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-86)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-87)[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-88)

As of 4 February, the university administration initiated a safety net policy, for a variety of assignment types, in partial compliance with student demands. However demands for a wider university policy to support students with welfare support have yet to be made, with further complaints arising due to minimal financial support being provided to home students and additional issues arising for international students - resulting in a number of go-fund me pages being created to help international students pay their tuition.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-89)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-90)

Student campaigners are yet to comment on the development of this situation.

### Attitudes towards Catholicism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Nottingham&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Attitudes towards Catholicism")]

At the start of the 2021–22 academic year, [Patrick McKinney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_McKinney "Patrick McKinney"), [Bishop of Nottingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Nottingham_(Roman_Catholic) "Bishop of Nottingham (Roman Catholic)"), appointed [Fr David Palmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fr_David_Palmer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Fr David Palmer (page does not exist)") to position of [Catholic Chaplain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain "Chaplain") to the university. The university actively blocked his appointment on the basis of his views on [abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion "Abortion") and [euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia "Euthanasia").[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-91)[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-Anti-abortion_priest_%E2%80%98cancelled%E2%80%99_by_university-92) This triggered mass international criticism, including from [Ann Furedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Furedi "Ann Furedi"), a former chief executive of the [British Pregnancy Advisory Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Pregnancy_Advisory_Service "British Pregnancy Advisory Service") with strongly pro-choice views, who described the decision as "stupid" and stated "I disagree with his views on abortion but as a Catholic priest he's expressing a mainstream Catholic view. Universities can't tell chaplains what religious beliefs to express".[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-93)

Fr Palmer's criticism of abortion and euthanasia were entirely in line with [the Catholic Church's teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church "Catechism of the Catholic Church").[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham#cite_note-94)[_[improper synthesis?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No\_original\_research#Synthesis\_of\_published\_material "Wikipedia:No original research")_]
