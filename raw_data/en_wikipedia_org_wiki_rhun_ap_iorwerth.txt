Early and personal life [ edit ] Rhun ap Iorwerth was born in Tonteg , Rhondda Cynon Taf , to Edward Morus and Gwyneth ( née Humphreys) Jones.

[ 2 ] Born Rhun ap Iorwerth Jones, [ 3 ] his name is Welsh for 'Rhun, the son of Iorwerth ', a name commonly anglicised as Edward.

[ 4 ] He uses ap Iorwerth as his surname.

[ 5 ] He was brought up in Meirionydd and then Anglesey from age five.

[ 6 ] Both ap Iorwerth's parents were teachers and Welsh language campaigners.

[ 6 ] His father was a primary school headteacher who composed various songs and musicals for children and young people, [ 2 ] [ 7 ] including Cwm-Rhyd-y-Rhosyn , a collaboration with Dafydd Iwan .

[ 8 ] Ap Iorwerth has an older sister, Awen Iorwerth, an orthopaedic surgeon .

[ 9 ] He attended Ysgol Rhyd-y-Main, Dolgellau , for a short period, before moving to Anglesey and attending Ysgol Gynradd Llandegfan (Llandegfan Primary School), followed by secondary education at Ysgol David Hughes , Menai Bridge .

[ 6 ] He then studied politics and Welsh at Cardiff University , and graduated in 1993.

[ 6 ] [ 10 ] After living in both Cardiff and London, ap Iorwerth lives in Anglesey with his wife and has three children.

[ 2 ] Career [ edit ] In 1994, ap Iorwerth joined BBC Cymru Wales , and worked as a journalist at BBC Westminster. Returning to Wales after the 1997 devolution referendum , he became BBC Wales's Chief Political Correspondent in 2001, a post he held for five years, before moving into presenting roles. He has been presenter of The Politics Show Wales , Dragon's Eye , ampm, BBC Radio Wales's Good Morning Wales , BBC Radio Cymru's Post Cyntaf breakfast news programme, the weekly political discussion programme Dau o'r Bae , and the BBC's main evening news programme for S4C Newyddion . He has also been a regular correspondent for BBC Network news, featuring on all BBC News channels. Outside news, he has presented numerous series for S4C, including its coverage of the National Eisteddfod , Y Rhufeiniaid ('The Romans'), and the arts series Pethe .

[ 11 ] In January 2012, ap Iorwerth was announced as one of the patrons of the Cronfa Betsi Fund, the charitable arm of the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board .

[ 12 ] Political career [ edit ] Rhun ap Iorwerth in 2014 On 20 June 2013, the former Plaid Cymru leader Ieuan Wyn Jones resigned from the Welsh Assembly seat of Ynys Môn in order to take a post leading the new Menai Science Park, [ 13 ] [ 14 ] triggering a by-election in the constituency.

[ 15 ] In June 2013, BBC Cymru Wales announced that ap Iorwerth had stepped down from his role as a news presenter to pursue a Plaid Cymru nomination for the by-election.

[ 16 ] The by-election provoked a local debate, in which Wylfa Nuclear Power Station became a key issue. The by-election was seen as key – had Welsh Labour won then they would have had an outright majority in the Assembly with 31 out of the 60 seats. The election on 1 August 2013 saw ap Iorwerth gain 12,601 votes, over the second-placed candidate Tal Michael (Labour), on a turnout of 42.45%.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] In January 2014, he was appointed as Plaid Cymru's spokesperson on Economy and Enterprise, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] which also included Transport.

[ 21 ] Ap Iorwerth held his seat in 2016.

[ 22 ] Shortly after those elections, he was appointed as Shadow Minister for Health, as Plaid Cymru had become the second largest party.

[ 23 ] In October 2016 this ceased to be a shadow cabinet role, as Plaid ceased to be the second largest party.

[ 24 ] He unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of Plaid Cymru in 2018 , losing to Adam Price . He was later appointed as joint deputy leader, [ 25 ] and as Plaid Spokesperson for Economy and Finance.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] He also took responsibility for the Plaid Health portfolio in February 2020.

[ 28 ] In May 2021, he was reshuffled to just the Health and Social Care portfolio.

[ 29 ] Rhun ap Iorwerth's office in Llangefni In July 2022, he announced his candidacy to become Plaid Cymru's prospective parliamentary candidate in Ynys Môn for the 2024 United Kingdom general election .

[ 30 ] In October 2023 he was replaced as candidate by Llinos Medi .

[ 31 ] In March 2023, as Plaid Cymru's spokesperson on health and care, ap Iorwerth called for a public inquiry into Betsi Cadwaladr health board failures and repeatedly called to replace Betsi with smaller health boards.

[ 32 ] In 2025, Rhun ap Iorwerth was inducted to the Gorsedd at a ceremony during the National Eisteddfod of Wales at Wrexham.

[ 33 ] Leadership of Plaid Cymru [ edit ] See also: Frontbench Team of Rhun ap Iorwerth In May 2023, ap Iorwerth announced he was running to become leader of Plaid Cymru.

[ 34 ] He was elected unopposed .

[ 35 ] On 17 March 2024, ap Iorwerth announced an early conclusion to the co-operation agreement between Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru, stating "I remain deeply concerned that the First Minister [ Vaughan Gething ] has failed to pay back the £200,000 donation to his leadership campaign from a company convicted of environmental offences, and believe it demonstrates a significant lack of judgment".

[ 36 ] In the 2026 Senedd election , he will be a candidate in the Bangor Conwy Môn constituency .
