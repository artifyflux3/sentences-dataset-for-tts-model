The axiom of projective determinacy , abbreviated PD , states that for any two-player infinite game of perfect information of length ω in which the players play natural numbers , if the victory set (for either player, since the projective sets are closed under complementation) is projective, then one player or the other has a winning strategy .

The axiom is not a theorem of ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent), but unlike the full axiom of determinacy (AD), which contradicts the axiom of choice , it is not known to be inconsistent with ZFC. PD follows from certain large cardinal axioms, such as the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals .

Consequences [ edit ] PD implies that all projective sets are Lebesgue measurable (in fact, universally measurable ) and have the perfect set property and the property of Baire .  It also implies that every projective binary relation may be uniformized by a projective set.

PD implies that for all positive integers n {\displaystyle n} , there is a largest countable Σ Σ 2 n 1 {\displaystyle \Sigma _{2n}^{1}} set.
