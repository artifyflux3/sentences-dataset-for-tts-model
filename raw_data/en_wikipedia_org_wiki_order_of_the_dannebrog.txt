Precedence Next (higher) Order of the Elephant Next (lower) Medal of Merit Related Decoration of the Cross of Honour of the Dannebrog Grand Commander Grand Cross Commander 1st Class Commander Knight 1st Class Knight Ribbon bars of the Order The Order of the Dannebrog ( Danish : Dannebrogordenen ) [ 3 ] is a Danish order of chivalry instituted in 1671 by Christian V , inspired by the legend that the Dannebrog flag fell from the sky in 1219. The Order's ribbon reflects the flag's colors, white and red, and the badge takes the form of the Dannebrog cross, as used in the royal arms since the 17th century.

[ 4 ] Until 1808, membership in the Order was limited to fifty members of noble or royal rank, [ 5 ] who formed a single class known as White Knights to distinguish them from the Blue Knights who were members of the Order of the Elephant .

[ 6 ] In 1808, the Order was reformed and divided into four classes.

Today, the Order of the Dannebrog is a means of honouring and rewarding the faithful servants of the modern Danish state for meritorious civil or military service, for a particular contribution to the arts, sciences or business life, or for working for Danish interests. Women have been eligible for the Order since 1951. The reigning monarch serves as Grand Master, and appointments are typically made on ministerial recommendation.

[ 4 ] Insignia [ edit ] The badge of the Order is a white enamelled Dannebrog cross (i.e., a cross pattée , the lower arm being longer than the others) with a red enamelled border, for the Knights in silver, and for everyone else in gold or silver gilt. At the top of this cross is the royal cypher of the bestowing monarch, crowned with the distinctive Danish royal crown [ a ] On its front, the cross bears the royal cyphers of Christian V at its centre, as well as the motto of the Order: Gud og Kongen (God and the King) on its arms. On its reverse are found the crowned royal cyphers of Valdemar II Sejr , Christian V and Frederik VI , [ b ] as well as the years 1219, 1671 and 1808, the years that each of them ascended the Danish throne. In each of the four angles of the cross is found a small Danish royal crown.

The collar of the Order is made of gold, with small enamelled Dannebrog crosses alternating with alternating crowned royal cyphers representing Kings Valdemar II Sejr and Christian V, the reputed and actual founders of the Order.  When the collar is worn the sash is not worn.

The star of the Order is an eight-pointed silver star with straight rays with an enamelled Dannebrog cross (similar to the front of the badge but without the royal cypher above and the royal crowns between the arms of the cross) at the centre.

The breast cross of the Order is similar to the cross on the star but larger and with faceted silver instead of white enamel and without the silver rays of the star .

The ribbon of the Order is white silk moiré with red borders, the national colours of Denmark.

[ 2 ] Details of the vestments of the Knights of the Dannebrog, c. 1750 The Order originally had a distinctive habit worn by the knights (after 1808, by the Knights Grand Cross) on very solemn occasions.  The habit consisted of a white doublet , white breeches , white stockings and white shoes, over which was worn a red mantle with a white lining and with the star of the order embroidered in silver on its left side.  Over this red mantle was worn a short white shoulder cape with a standing collar embroidered in gold, upon which was worn the collar of the Order (the habit was always worn with the collar and never with the ribbon of the Order).  The habit also had a black hat with a plume of white and red ostrich feathers.  This habit was almost identical to that worn by the knights of the Order of the Elephant .

Grades [ edit ] The Order is divided into six grades, which are grouped into four classes: Special class Grand Commander ( Storkommandør; S.Kmd.

) – wears the badge with diamonds [ c ] on a necklet (gentlemen) or on a bow (ladies), plus the star on the left chest; First Order class Grand Cross ( Storkors; S.K.

) – wears the badge on a collar or on a sash on the right shoulder, plus the star on the left chest; Second Order class Commander 1st Class ( Kommandør af 1. grad; K.1 ) – wears the breast cross on the left chest, plus (for gentlemen) the badge on a neck ribbon; Commander ( Kommandør; K.

) – wears the badge on a neck ribbon (gentlemen) or on a bow (ladies); Third Order class Knight 1st Class ( Ridder af 1. grad; R.1 ) – wears the badge on a ribbon (gentlemen) or on a bow (ladies) with rosette on the left chest; Knight ( Ridder; R.

) – wears the badge on a ribbon (gentlemen) or on a bow (ladies) on the left chest.

The Grand Commander grade is reserved for persons of princely origin. It is awarded only to royalty with close family ties to the Danish Royal House. The Grand Cross grade can, as a special honor, be awarded 'with diamonds' (S.K.i diam., short for Storkors i diamanter ). The Order also has a related decoration, known as the Cross of Honour (D.Ht., short for Dannebrogordens Hæderstegn ).

[ 2 ] The insignia of the Order must be returned upon the death of the holder.

Order of wear [ edit ] The order of wear for five of the six grades with their respective insignia (gentlemen) – 1: Knight; 2: Knight 1st Class; 3: Commander; 4: Commander 1st Class; 5: Grand Cross Cross of Honour [ edit ] The Dannebrogordenens Hæderstegn (Cross of Honour of the Order of the Dannebrog) in modern times is only awarded to Danes on whom the Order of the Dannebrog has already been bestowed. It is also worn by members of the Danish royal family. Its badge is similar to the badge of the Order, but all in silver. It is worn on a ribbon (by gentlemen) or bow (by ladies), with rosette , on the left chest.

Recipients [ edit ] The Court Marshal of Denmark (at left) wearing the Grand Cross insignia Each Danish ministry has a quota of Knights and Knights 1st class that they may use at their discretion. It is most often given to high-ranking officers of the police , armed forces and emergency services .

Also used for politicians in Folketinget after 8 years of elected service. Ministers are given the rank of Knight 1st Class.

The rank of Commander is given to colonels, ministers and other high-ranking officials as a retirement-decoration after long service. Commander 1st class is given for admirals, generals, Supreme-court judges, ambassadors, and other governmental leaders as a retirement decoration.

British general Sir Arthur Paget wearing the Grand Cross, 1908 The Grand Cross is most often used for admirals, generals, Supreme-court judges, ambassadors and similar as a reward for very meritorious service to Denmark.

Grand Cross with Breaststar with Diamonds [ d ] is most often given to high-ranking officers of the Royal Court, such as Hofmarskals .

Finally, the Grand Commander grade is given only to 8 people. The reigning monarch is always a Grand Commander, and he/she may give the grade to 7 others, most often close family.

Diplomatic use [ edit ] Award of the Order of the Dannebrog is often used as a tool of diplomacy. If a foreign country has an Order that they give to foreign diplomats in their country, then their diplomats in Denmark can be given an Order of the Dannebrog. To be eligible, the foreign ambassador must have resided in Denmark for at least three years.

Diplomatic rank Rank of the Order Ambassador Grand Cross Chargé d'Affaires e.p. ( en pieds ) Commander (Commander 1st Class, if over 40 years of age) Chargé d'Affaires a.i.

The number of Grand Commanders never exceed 8.

Revocation [ edit ] It is possible for membership in the Order to be revoked. Before 1808, membership had only been revoked on two occasions – Peder Griffenfeld who was charged with treason, and Samuel Christoph von Plessen [ da ] (1640–1704) who was charged with looting and gross misconduct. In more recent times, it has been revoked on the basis of criminality, such as Peter Adler Alberti (1910), Erik Ninn-Hansen (1995), Peter Brixtofte (2008) and Christian Kjær (2019). Foreigners have also had their membership revoked. Several prominent Nazi officials, such as Hermann Göring and Konstantin von Neurath , were awarded the Order, but it was later revoked.

^ Valdemar II is the Danish king associated with the legendary origins of the Dannebrog and the reputed first founder of the Order, Christian V is the founder of the present Order and Frederik VI reformed the Order, dividing it into its present six grades ^ On this badge table cut diamonds entirely replace the white enamel of the cross and smaller diamonds completely cover the royal crowns in the angles of this cross, the royal cypher of the current monarch and its royal crown at the top of this cross as well as the connecting link by which this badge hangs from its ribbon.  Only the red enamel border which surrounds the table cut diamond cross of the badge is not set with diamonds.

^ I.e., fourteen table-cut diamonds are set on the white enamel of the cross of the Order, which in this case has no royal ciphers, dates nor motto.

According to those statutes, the order had only one grade called 'White Knight', corresponding to today's 'Grand Cross Knight'. The circle of knights was limited to Danish royalty and noblemen; commoners were not considered. That changed in connection with the expansion of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1808. On that occasion, the order was divided into different grades, and the circle of those decorated was widened to include common-born persons. Along with a series of lesser changes later, the decisions from 1808 continue as the formal basis for conferral of the Order of the Dannebrog. Today, Danish commoners constitute by far the largest group of those decorated ^ "The Order of Dannebrog" .
