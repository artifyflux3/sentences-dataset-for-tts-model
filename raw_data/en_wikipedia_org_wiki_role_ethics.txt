[ 1 ] Morality is derived from a person's relationship with their community.

[ 2 ] The ethics of Confucianism is an example of role ethics, [ 1 ] in particular the Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant Virtues ( Chinese : 三綱五常 ; pinyin : Sāngāng Wǔcháng ; Jyutping : Saam1 Gong1 Ng5 Soeng4 ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : Sam-kòng Ngó͘-siông ).

Confucianism [ edit ] Tang Dynasty depiction of Confucius Confucian role ethics centers around filial piety or xiao , a respect for family members.

[ 3 ] The concept is elaborated in the Confucian text Classic of Filial Piety : "In serving his parents, a filial son reveres them in daily life; he makes them happy while he nourishes them; he takes anxious care of them in sickness; he shows great sorrow over their death; and he sacrifices to them with solemnity." [ 4 ] Filial duty requires the desire to be filial, and not just the act of filial piety.

[ 2 ] In Confucian societies, filial piety determines the "moral worth" of an individual in a community and acts as a form of social capital .

[ 4 ] According to Roger T. Ames and Henry Rosemont, "Confucian normativity is defined by living one's family roles to maximum effect." In Confucian role ethics, morality is based on a person's fulfillment of a role, such as that of a parent or a child. These roles are established as relationships, and are not individualistic. Confucian roles are not rational , and originate through the xin , or human emotions.

[ 2 ] The concept of li or ritual propriety is crucial to Confucian roles. Propriety reinforces family relationships, and binds together the community. The performance of li expresses a person's moral commitment as a human being.

[ 2 ] In Japan, modern Confucian scholars like Uno Tetsuto and Ichimura Sanjiro have attempted to mix Confucian role ethics with concepts such as democracy and human rights .

[ 5 ] Stoicism [ edit ] Epictetus developed and introduced role ethics into Stoicism , an approach to ethics based on taking seriously the different roles we all play in life. The roles are: the general role of a human being in society (the human cosmopolis ) at large; roles that we choose for ourselves, being a father, or friend; roles that the circumstances assign to us, being a son or daughter.

Epictetus's role ethics was a development of a similar concept developed by Panaetius who was a philosopher of the middle Stoa .
