A case study is an in-depth analysis which focuses on a single event, several events, and/or a specific aspect of an event.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] List [ edit ] Case studies published by academia are included in this list. As part of the United States National Weather Service 's (NWS) and Environment and Climate Change Canada 's (ECCC) official duties, they are required to conduct a damage survey on every tornado in the United States and Canada. For this reason, only publications by the NWS and ECCC beyond a standard damage survey are included as, on average, over 1,200 tornadoes occur annually in the two countries together. Tornado records in Europe are kept by the European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL) in the European Severe Weather Database. For this reason, only publications by ESSL outside of the database are included.

This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources .

[ 16 ] A case study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University on how historic masonry structures in Mayfield, Kentucky performed during the tornado.

[ 17 ] A detailed damage survey and analysis of part of the tornado's track, focusing mainly on Mayfield, Kentucky published by Timothy Marshall , a meteorologist, structural and forensic engineer ; Zachary B. Wienhoff, with Haag Engineering Company; Christine L. Wielgos, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service of Paducah; and Brian E. Smith, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service of Omaha . In their conclusion, the researchers state, “the tornado damage rating might have been higher had more wind resistant structures been encountered. Also, the fast forward speed of the tornado had little ‘dwell’ time of strong winds over a building and thus, the damage likely would have been more severe if the tornado were slower.” [ 18 ] 2022 Arabi–New Orleans tornado EF3 Researchers with Auburn University , Florida International University , Pennsylvania State University , Louisiana State University , University of South Alabama , University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign , University of Kentucky , and CoreLogic , published an academic case study on how hurricane -resistant houses performed during the tornado.
