In particular, a smooth structure allows mathematical analysis to be performed on the manifold.

[ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] A smooth structure on a manifold M {\displaystyle M} is a collection of smoothly equivalent smooth atlases. Here, a smooth atlas for a topological manifold M {\displaystyle M} is an atlas for M {\displaystyle M} such that each transition function is a smooth map , and two smooth atlases for M {\displaystyle M} are smoothly equivalent provided their union is again a smooth atlas for M .

{\displaystyle M.} This gives a natural equivalence relation on the set of smooth atlases.

A smooth manifold is a topological manifold M {\displaystyle M} together with a smooth structure on M .

{\displaystyle M.} Maximal smooth atlases [ edit ] By taking the union of all atlases belonging to a smooth structure, we obtain a maximal smooth atlas . This atlas contains every chart that is compatible with the smooth structure. There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between smooth structures and maximal smooth atlases.   
Thus, we may regard a smooth structure as a maximal smooth atlas and vice versa.

In general, computations with the maximal atlas of a manifold are rather unwieldy. For most applications, it suffices to choose a smaller atlas. 
For example, if the manifold is compact , then one can find an atlas with only finitely many charts.

Equivalence of smooth structures [ edit ] If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } and ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } are two maximal atlases on M {\displaystyle M} the two smooth structures associated to μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } and ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } are said to be equivalent if there is a diffeomorphism f : M → → M {\displaystyle f:M\to M} such that μ μ ∘ ∘ f = ν ν .

{\displaystyle \mu \circ f=\nu .} [ citation needed ] Exotic spheres [ edit ] John Milnor showed in 1956 that the 7-dimensional sphere admits a smooth structure that is not equivalent to the standard smooth structure. A sphere equipped with a nonstandard smooth structure is called an exotic sphere .

E8 manifold [ edit ] The E8 manifold is an example of a topological manifold that does not admit a smooth structure. This essentially demonstrates that Rokhlin's theorem holds only for smooth structures, and not topological manifolds in general.

Related structures [ edit ] The smoothness requirements on the transition functions can be weakened, so that the transition maps are only required to be k {\displaystyle k} -times continuously differentiable; or strengthened, so that the transition maps are required to be real-analytic. Accordingly, this gives a C k {\displaystyle C^{k}} or (real-)analytic structure on the manifold rather than a smooth one. Similarly, a complex structure can be defined by requiring the transition maps to be holomorphic.
