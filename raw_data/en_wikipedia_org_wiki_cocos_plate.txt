The Cocos plate was created approximately 23 million years ago when the Farallon plate broke into two pieces, which also created the Nazca plate . The Cocos plate also broke into two pieces, creating the small Rivera plate .

[ 2 ] The Cocos plate is bounded to the northeast by the North American plate and the Caribbean plate . To the west it is bounded by the Pacific plate and to the south by the Nazca plate .

The only land above water on the Cocos plate is Cocos Island , which is administered by Costa Rica and lies approximately 550 km (342 mi; 297 nmi) southwest of the Costa Rican mainland.

Geology [ edit ] The Cocos plate was created by sea floor spreading along the East Pacific Rise and the Cocos Ridge , specifically in a complicated area geologists call the Cocos-Nazca spreading system. From the rise the plate is pushed eastward and pushed or dragged (perhaps both) under the less dense Caribbean plate , in the process called subduction . The subducted leading edge heats up and adds its water to the mantle above it. In the mantle layer called the asthenosphere , mantle rock melts to make magma , trapping superheated water under great pressure. As a result, to the northeast of the subducting edge lies the continuous arc of volcanos – also known as the Central America Volcanic Arc – stretching from Costa Rica to Guatemala , and a belt of earthquakes that extends farther north, into Mexico .

The northern boundary of the Cocos plate is the Middle America Trench . The eastern boundary is a transform fault , the Panama fracture zone . The southern boundary is a mid-oceanic ridge , the Cocos–Nazca spreading centre .

[ 3 ] The western boundary is another mid-ocean ridge, the East Pacific Rise .

A hotspot under the Galápagos Islands lies along the Galápagos Rise. ( see Galápagos hotspot and Galápagos microplate ) The Rivera plate , north of the Cocos plate, is thought to have separated from the Cocos plate 5–10 million years ago. The boundary between the two plates appears to lack a definite transform fault , yet they are regarded as distinct. After its separation from the Cocos plate, the Rivera plate started acting as an independent microplate.

[ 2 ] The devastating 1985 Mexico City earthquake and the 2017 Chiapas earthquake were results of the subduction of the Cocos plate beneath the North American plate . The devastating El Salvador earthquakes in January 2001 and February 2001 were generated by the subduction of this plate beneath the Caribbean plate .
