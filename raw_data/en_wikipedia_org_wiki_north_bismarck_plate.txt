While the map relates to a 2003 model where it was proposed to be still active, it is reasonably accurate compared to current understanding.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Type Minor Movement 1 north-west Speed 1 nil independent of Pacific plate which has 96 mm/year Features Pacific Ocean 1 Relative to the African plate The North Bismarck plate is a small tectonic plate located in the Bismarck Sea off the northeast coast of New Guinea . It is currently regarded as a relic or inactive plate by most.

[ 3 ] [ 2 ] At one time it was called the Manus plate, but this term was later used for a modelled microplate at the south east boundary of the North Bismarck plate.

[ 1 ] : 22 Tectonics [ edit ] The plate contains most of the Melanesian arc volcanoes, related to current and historic arc volcanism, except those of New Britain which are on the active South Bismarck plate .

[ 2 ] To the north it has collided with the Pacific plate and the Caroline plate , part of the western part is subducting under other active plates in New Guinea , and it is separated from the South Bismarck plate by a divergent boundary called the Bismarck Seismic Sea Lineation (BSSL).

[ 4 ] The BSSL is a very seismically active area but the assigned shallow earthquakes tend to be less than magnitude 7.

[ 5 ] The plate is moving westerly along with the Pacific plate .

[ 2 ] Between the plate and the Caroline plate is the West Melanesian Trench and between the plate and the Pacific plate is the Kilinailau Trench .

[ 2 ] Neither trench has good evidence for current subduction activity but were certainly historically active.

[ 2 ] : 68 There are a few shallow low intensity earthquakes to the south/south west of these trenches on a line of the old arc that extends from the smaller northern Admiralty Islands in the west through to Mussau Island and beyond.
