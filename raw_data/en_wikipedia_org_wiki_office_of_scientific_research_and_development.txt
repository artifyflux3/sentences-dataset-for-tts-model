Agency executive Vannevar Bush Parent agency Office for Emergency Management Child agencies Committee on Medical Research Manhattan Project The Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) was an agency of the United States federal government created to coordinate scientific research for military purposes during World War II . Arrangements were made for its creation during May 1941, and it was created formally by Executive Order 8807 on June 28, 1941.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It superseded the work of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was given almost unlimited access to funding and resources, and was directed by Vannevar Bush , who reported only to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt .

The research was widely varied, and included projects devoted to new and more accurate bombs , reliable detonators, work on the proximity fuze , guided missiles , radar and early-warning systems, lighter and more accurate hand weapons, more effective medical treatments (including work to make penicillin at scale, which was necessary for its use as a drug [ 3 ] ), more versatile vehicles, and, the most secret of all, the S-1 Section , which later became the Manhattan Project and developed the first atomic weapons .
