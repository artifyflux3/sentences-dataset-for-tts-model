It is a special case of the Lévy–Prokhorov metric , and is named after the French mathematician Paul Lévy .

Definition [ edit ] Let F , G : R → → [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle F,G:\mathbb {R} \to [0,1]} be two cumulative distribution functions. Define the Lévy distance between them to be L ( F , G ) := inf { ε ε > 0 | F ( x − − ε ε ) − − ε ε ≤ ≤ G ( x ) ≤ ≤ F ( x + ε ε ) + ε ε , ∀ ∀ x ∈ ∈ R } .

{\displaystyle L(F,G):=\inf\{\varepsilon >0|F(x-\varepsilon )-\varepsilon \leq G(x)\leq F(x+\varepsilon )+\varepsilon ,\;\forall x\in \mathbb {R} \}.} Intuitively, if between the graphs of F and G one inscribes squares with sides parallel to the coordinate axes (at points of discontinuity of a graph vertical segments are added), then the side-length of the largest such square is equal to L ( F , G ).

A sequence of cumulative distribution functions { F n } n = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \{F_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty }} weakly converges to another cumulative distribution function F {\displaystyle F} if and only if L ( F n , F ) → → 0 {\displaystyle L(F_{n},F)\to 0} .
