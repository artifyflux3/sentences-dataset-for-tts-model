The **comma****,** is a [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") mark that appears in several variants in different languages. Some [typefaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface "Typeface") render it as a small line, slightly curved or straight, but inclined from the vertical; others give it the appearance of a miniature filled-in figure 9 placed on the [baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(typography) "Baseline (typography)"). In many typefaces it is the same shape as an [apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe "Apostrophe") or single closing [quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark")’.

The comma is used in many contexts and [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"), mainly to separate parts of a [sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics) "Sentence (linguistics)") such as [clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause "Clause"), and items in lists mainly when there are three or more items listed. The word _comma_ comes from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language")[κόμμα](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek "wikt:κόμμα") (_kómma_), which originally meant a cut-off piece, specifically in [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar"), a short [clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause "Clause").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-2)

A comma-shaped mark is used as a [diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic") in several writing systems and is considered distinct from the [cedilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedilla "Cedilla"). In [Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_empire "Byzantine empire") and modern copies of [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek"), the "[rough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_breathing "Rough breathing")" and "[smooth breathings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_breathing "Smooth breathing")" (ἁ, ἀ) appear above the letter. In [Latvian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_orthography "Latvian orthography"), [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_orthography "Romanian orthography"), and [Livonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livonian_orthography "Livonian orthography"), the [comma diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#Diacritical_usage) appears below the letter, as in ș.

In [spoken language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_language "Spoken language"), a common [rule of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb "Rule of thumb") is that the function of a comma is generally performed by a [pause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)#Pause "Prosody (linguistics)").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-3)

_In this article,_⟨x⟩_denotes a [grapheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme "Grapheme") (writing) and_ /x/ _denotes a [phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme "Phoneme") (sound)._

The development of [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") is much more recent than the alphabet.

In the 3rd century BC, [Aristophanes of Byzantium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes_of_Byzantium "Aristophanes of Byzantium") invented a system of single [dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct") (_théseis_) at varying levels, which separated verses and indicated the amount of breath needed to complete each fragment of the text when [reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process) "Reading (process)") aloud.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-4) The different lengths were signified by a dot at the bottom, middle, or top of the line. For a short passage, a _komma_ in the form of a dot ⟨·⟩ was placed mid-level. This is the origin of the concept of a comma, although the name came to be used for the mark itself instead of the clause it separated.

The mark used today is descended from a /, a diagonal [slash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation) "Slash (punctuation)") known as _virgula suspensiva_, used from the 13th to 17th centuries to represent a pause. The modern comma was first used by [Aldus Manutius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Manutius "Aldus Manutius").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-6)

In general, the comma shows that the words immediately before the comma are less closely or exclusively linked [grammatically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar") to those immediately after the comma than they might be otherwise. The comma performs a number of functions in [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") writing. It is used in generally similar ways in other languages, particularly European ones, although the rules on comma usage – and their rigidity – vary from language to language.

### List separator and the serial (Oxford) comma

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comma&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: List separator and the serial (Oxford) comma")]

Commas are placed between items in lists, as in _They own a cat, a dog, two rabbits, and seven mice._

Whether the final conjunction, most frequently _and_, should be preceded by a comma, called the _serial comma_, is one of the most disputed linguistic or stylistic questions in English:

*   They served apples, peaches, and bananas. (serial comma used)
*   They served apples, peaches and bananas. (serial comma omitted)

The serial comma is used much more often, usually routinely, in the United States. A majority of American style guides mandate its use, including _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_, [Strunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Strunk_Jr. "William Strunk Jr.") and [White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._B._White "E. B. White")'s classic _[The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Elements\_of\_Style "The Elements of Style")_, and the [U.S. Government Publishing Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Government_Publishing_Office "United States Government Publishing Office")'s _Style Manual_.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-7) Conversely, the _[AP Stylebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP\_Stylebook "AP Stylebook")_ for journalistic writing advises against it.

The serial comma is also known as the Oxford comma, Harvard comma, or series comma. Although less common in British English, its usage occurs within both American and British English. It is called the Oxford comma because of its long history of use by Oxford University Press.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-8)

According to _New Hart's Rules_, "house style will dictate" whether to use the serial comma. "The general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently." No association with region or dialect is suggested, other than that its use has been strongly advocated by Oxford University Press.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-9) Its use is preferred by [Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Watson_Fowler "Henry Watson Fowler")'s _[Modern English Usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern\_English\_Usage "Modern English Usage")_. It is recommended by the United States [Government Printing Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Printing_Office "Government Printing Office"), [Harvard University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University_Press "Harvard University Press"), and the classic _Elements of Style_ of [Strunk and White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strunk_and_White "Strunk and White").

Use of a comma may prevent ambiguity:

*   The sentence _I spoke to the boys, Sam and Tom_ could mean either _I spoke to the boys and Sam and Tom_ (I spoke to more than three people) or _I spoke to the boys, who are Sam and Tom_ (I spoke to two people);
*   _I spoke to the boys, Sam, and Tom_ – must be _the boys and Sam and Tom_ (I spoke to more than three people).

The serial comma does not eliminate all confusion. Consider the following sentence:

*   _I thank my mother, Anne Smith, and Thomas._ This could mean either _my mother and Anne Smith and Thomas_ (three people) or _my mother, who is Anne Smith; and Thomas_ (two people). This sentence might be recast as "my mother (Anne Smith) and Thomas" for clarity.
*   _I thank my mother, Anne Smith and Thomas._ Because the comma after "mother" is conventionally used to prepare the reader for an [appositive phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apposition "Apposition") – that is, a renaming of or further information about a noun – this construction formally suggests that my mother's name is "Anne Smith and Thomas". Because that is implausible, it is relatively clear that the construction refers to two separate people. Compare "I thank my friend, Smith and Wesson", in which the ambiguity is obvious to those who recognise [Smith and Wesson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson "Smith & Wesson") as a business name.

As a [rule of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb "Rule of thumb"), _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Guardian "The Guardian") Style Guide_[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-10) suggests that straightforward lists (_he ate ham, eggs and chips_) do not need a comma before the final "and", but sometimes it can help the reader (_he ate cereal, kippers, bacon, eggs, toast and marmalade, and tea_). _The Chicago Manual of Style_ and other academic writing guides require the serial comma: all lists must have a comma before the "and" prefacing the last item in a series (see [Differences between American and British usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#Differences_between_American_and_British_usage) below).

If the individual items of a list are long, complex, affixed with description, or themselves contain commas, [semicolons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon "Semicolon") may be preferred as separators, and the list may be introduced with a [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)").

In [news headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_style#Headline "News style"), a comma might replace the word "and", even if there are only two items, in order to save space, as in this headline from Reuters:[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-11)

*   _Trump, Macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy._

### Separation of clauses

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comma&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Separation of clauses")]

Commas are often used to separate [clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause "Clause"). In English, a comma is often used to separate a [dependent clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_clause "Dependent clause") from the [independent clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_clause "Independent clause") if the dependent clause comes first: _After I fed the cat, I brushed my clothes._ (Compare this with _I brushed my clothes after I fed the cat._) A [relative clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_clause "Relative clause") takes commas if it is non-[restrictive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictiveness "Restrictiveness"), as in _I cut down all the trees, which were over six feet tall._ (Without the comma, this would mean that only the trees more than six feet tall were cut down.) Some style guides prescribe that two [independent clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_clause "Independent clause") joined by a coordinating [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjunction "Grammatical conjunction") (_for_, _and_, _nor_, _but_, _or_, _yet_, _so_) must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-Fowler3rev1-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-getitwriteonline1-13) In the following sentences, where the second clause is independent (because it can stand alone as a sentence), the comma is considered by those guides to be necessary:

*   _Mary walked to the party, but she was unable to walk home._
*   _Designer clothes are silly, and I can't afford them anyway._
*   _Don't push that button, or twelve tons of high explosives will go off right under our feet!_

In the following sentences, where the second half of the sentence is a dependent clause (because it does not contain an explicit [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(grammar) "Subject (grammar)")), those guides prescribe that the comma be omitted:

*   _Mary walked to the party but was unable to walk home._
*   _I think designer clothes are silly and can't afford them anyway._

However, such guides permit the comma to be omitted if the second independent clause is very short, typically when the second independent clause is an [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood "Imperative mood"),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-Fowler3rev1-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-getitwriteonline1-13) as in:

*   _Sit down and shut up._

The above guidance is not universally accepted or applied. Long [coordinate clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_clause "Coordinate clause"), particularly when separated by "but", are often separated by commas:[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-14)

*   _She had very little to live on, but would never have dreamed of taking what was not hers._

In some languages, such as [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") and [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language"), stricter rules apply on comma use between clauses, with dependent clauses always being set off with commas, and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions.

The joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction (as in _"It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark."_) is known as a _[comma splice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma\_splice "Comma splice")_ and is sometimes considered an error in English;[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-15) in most cases a semicolon should be used instead. A comma splice should not be confused, though, with the literary device called _[asyndeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asyndeton "Asyndeton")_, in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted for a specific stylistic effect.

A much debated comma is the one in the [Second Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"), which says _"A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."_ but ratified by several states as _"A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."_ which has caused much debate on its interpretation.

Commas are always used to set off certain [adverbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverb "Adverb") at the beginning of a sentence, including _however_, _in fact_, _therefore_, _nevertheless_, _moreover_, _furthermore_, and _still_.

*   _Therefore, a comma would be appropriate in this sentence._
*   _Nevertheless, I will not use one._

If these adverbs appear in the middle of a sentence, they are followed and preceded by a comma. As in the second of the two examples below, if a semicolon separates the two sentences and the second sentence starts with an adverb, this adverb is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma.

*   _In this sentence, furthermore, commas would also be called for._
*   _This sentence is a bit different; however, a comma is necessary as well._

Using commas to offset certain adverbs is optional, including _then_, _so_, _yet_, _instead_, and _too_ (meaning _also_).

*   _So, that's it for this rule._ or
*   _So that's it for this rule._
*   _A comma would be appropriate in this sentence, too._ or
*   _A comma would be appropriate in this sentence too._

### Parenthetical phrases

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comma&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Parenthetical phrases")]

Commas are often used to enclose [parenthetical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthesis_(rhetoric) "Parenthesis (rhetoric)") words and phrases within a sentence (i.e., information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence). Such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma, unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence. The following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:

*   Introductory phrase: _Once upon a time, my father ate a muffin._[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-16)
*   Interjection: _My father ate the muffin, gosh darn it!_
*   Aside: _My father, if you don't mind me telling you this, ate the muffin._
*   [Appositive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apposition "Apposition"): _My father, a jaded and bitter man, ate the muffin._
*   Absolute phrase: _My father, his eyes flashing with rage, ate the muffin._
*   Free modifier: _My father, chewing with unbridled fury, ate the muffin._
*   Resumptive modifier: _My father ate the muffin, a muffin which no man had yet chewed._
*   Summative modifier: _My father ate the muffin, a feat which no man had attempted._

The parenthesization of phrases may change the connotation, reducing or eliminating [ambiguity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity "Ambiguity"). In the following example, the thing in the first sentence that is relaxing is the cool day, whereas in the second sentence, it is the walk since the introduction of commas makes "on a cool day" parenthetical:

_They took a walk on a cool day that was relaxing._ _They took a walk, on a cool day, that was relaxing._
As more phrases are introduced, ambiguity accumulates, but when commas separate each phrase, the phrases clearly become modifiers of just one thing. In the second sentence below, that thing is _the walk_:

_They took a walk in the park on a cool day that was relaxing._ _They took a walk, in the park, on a cool day, that was relaxing._
A comma is used to separate _coordinate adjectives_ (i.e., [adjectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective#Order "Adjective") that directly and equally modify the following noun). Adjectives are considered coordinate if the meaning would be the same if their order were reversed or if _and_ were placed between them. For example:

*   _The dull, incessant droning_ but _the cute little cottage._
*   _The devious lazy red frog_ suggests there are lazy red frogs (one of which is devious), while _the devious, lazy red frog_ does not carry this connotation.

Some writers precede quoted material that is the grammatical object of an active verb of speaking or writing with a comma, as in _Mr. Kershner says, "You should know how to use a comma."_ Quotations that follow and support an assertion are often preceded by a [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)") rather than a comma.

Other writers do not put a comma before quotations unless one would occur anyway. Thus, they would write _Mr. Kershner says "You should know how to use a comma."_

When a date is written as a month followed by a day followed by a year, a comma separates the day from the year: December 19, 1941. This style is common in American English. The comma is used to avoid confusing consecutive numbers: December 19 1941. Most style manuals, including _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-17) and the _[AP Stylebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP\_Stylebook "AP Stylebook")_,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-18) also recommend that the year be treated as a parenthetical, requiring a second comma after it: _"Feb. 14, 1987, was the target date."_

If just the month and year are given, no commas are used:[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-19) "Her daughter may return in June 2009 for the reunion."

When the day precedes the month, the month name separates the numeric day and year, so commas are not necessary to separate them: "The [Raid on Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Alexandria_(1941) "Raid on Alexandria (1941)") was carried out on 19 December 1941."

### In geographical names

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comma&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: In geographical names")]

Commas are used to separate parts of geographical references, such as city and state (_Dallas, Texas_) or city and country (_Kampala, Uganda_). Additionally, most style manuals, including _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-20) and the _AP Stylebook_,[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-21) recommend that the second element be treated as a parenthetical, requiring a second comma after: _"The plane landed in Kampala, Uganda, that evening."_[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-22)

The [United States Postal Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service "United States Postal Service")[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-23) and [Royal Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail "Royal Mail")[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-24) recommend leaving out punctuation when writing addresses on actual letters and packages, as the marks hinder [optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition "Optical character recognition"). [Canada Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Post "Canada Post") has similar guidelines, making only very limited use of hyphens.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-25)

Similar to the case in natural languages, commas are often used to delineate the boundary between multiple [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") in a list (e.g., ![Image 1: {\displaystyle (3,5,12)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/00a5215626d258ab9f47fa3b4a711d724fd48e62)). Commas are also used to indicate the [comma derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_derivative "Comma derivative") of a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-26)

In representing large numbers, from the right side to the left, English texts usually use commas to separate each group of three digits in front of the decimal.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-27) This is almost always done for numbers of six or more digits, and often for four or five digits but not in front of the number itself. However, in much of Europe, Southern Africa and Latin America, [periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") or spaces are used instead; the comma is used as a [decimal separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator "Decimal separator"), equivalent to the use in English of the [decimal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator "Decimal separator").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-28) In India, the groups are two digits, except for the rightmost group, which is of three digits. In some styles, the comma may not be used for this purpose at all (e.g. in the [SI writing style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Unit_symbols_and_the_values_of_quantities "International System of Units")[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-29)); a space may be used to separate groups of three digits instead.

Commas are used when rewriting names to present the surname first, generally in instances of alphabetization by surname: _Smith, John_. They are also used before many titles that follow a name: _John Smith, Ph.D._

It can also be used in regnal names followed by their occupation: _Louis XIII, king of France and Navarre_.

Similarly in lists that are presented with an inversion: _socks, green: 3 pairs; socks, red: 2 pairs; tie, regimental: 1_.

Commas may be used to indicate that a word, or a group of words, has been omitted,[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-30) as in _The cat was white; the dog, brown._ (Here the comma replaces _was_.)

Commas are placed before, after, or around a noun or pronoun used independently in speaking to some person, place, or thing:

*   _I hope, John, that you will read this._

### Between the subject and predicate

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comma&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Between the subject and predicate")]

In his 1785 essay _An Essay on Punctuation_, [Joseph Robertson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Robertson_(clergyman) "Joseph Robertson (clergyman)") advocated a comma between the subject and predicate of long sentences for clarity; however, this usage is regarded as an error in modern times.

*   _The good taste of the present age, has not allowed us to neglect the cultivation of the English language._
*   _Whoever is capable of forgetting a benefit, is an enemy to society._

### Differences between American and British usage in placement of commas and quotation marks

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comma&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Differences between American and British usage in placement of commas and quotation marks")]

The comma and the [quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark") can be paired in several ways.

In Great Britain and many other parts of the world, punctuation is usually placed within quotation marks only if it is part of what is being quoted or referred to:[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-APA-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-WilbersonChicago14-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-33)

*   My mother gave me the nickname "Bobby Bobby Bob Bob Boy", which really made me angry.

In American English, the comma was commonly included inside a quotation mark:[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-APA-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-WilbersonChicago14-32)

*   My mother gave me the nickname "Bobby Bobby Bob Bob Boy," which really made me angry.

During the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War"), the British carried the comma over into abbreviations. Specifically, "Special Operations, Executive" was written "S.O.,E.". Nowadays, even the [full stops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") are frequently discarded in British usage.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-34)

Languages other than English
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comma&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Languages other than English")]

Western European languages like German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese use the same comma as English, with similar spacing, though usage may be somewhat different. For instance, in Standard German, subordinate clauses are always preceded by commas.

The basic comma is defined in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") as U+002C,COMMA (&comma;), and many variants by typography or language are also defined.

There are various other Unicode characters that include commas or comma-like figures with other characters or marks, that are not shown in these tables.

[Modern Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") uses the same [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") comma for its _kómma_ (κόμμα)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-nicky-35) and it is officially [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek "Romanization of Greek") as a Latin comma,[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-36) but it has additional roles owing to its conflation with the former [hypodiastole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodiastole "Hypodiastole"), a curved [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct") used to disambiguate certain homonyms. As such, the comma functions as a [silent letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_letter "Silent letter") in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing [ό,τι](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%8C,%CF%84%CE%B9 "wikt:ό,τι") (_ó,ti_, 'whatever') from [ότι](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%8C%CF%84%CE%B9 "wikt:ότι") (_óti_, 'that').[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-nicky-35)

The **enumeration** or **ideographic comma** (U+3001、IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA) is used in [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_punctuation "Chinese punctuation"),[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-:Reinders-37): 20 [Japanese punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_punctuation "Japanese punctuation"), and somewhat in [Korean punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation "Korean punctuation"). In China and Korea, this comma ([顿号](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%A1%BF%E5%8F%B7 "wikt:顿号"); [頓號](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%A0%93%E8%99%9F "wikt:頓號"); _dùnhào_) is usually only used to separate items in lists, while it is the more common form of comma in Japan ([読点](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%AA%AD%E7%82%B9 "wikt:読点"), _tōten_, lit.'clause mark').

In documents that mix [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_script "Japanese script") and [Latin scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script "Latin script"), the **full-width comma** (U+FF0C，FULLWIDTH COMMA) is used; this is the standard form of comma ([逗号](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%80%97%E5%8F%B7 "wikt:逗号"); [逗號](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%80%97%E8%99%9F "wikt:逗號")) in China. Since East Asian typography permits commas to join dependent clauses dealing with certain topics or lines of thought, commas may be used in ways that would be considered [comma splices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_splice "Comma splice") in English.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

[Korean punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation "Korean punctuation") uses both commas and [interpuncts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct") for lists.

In Unicode 5.2.0, "numbers with commas" (U+1F101 🄁 DIGIT ZERO COMMA through U+1F10A 🄊 DIGIT NINE COMMA) were added to the [Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosed_Alphanumeric_Supplement "Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement") block for compatibility with the [ARIB STD B24 character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARIB_STD_B24_character_set "ARIB STD B24 character set").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-39)

The comma in the [Arabic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script "Arabic script") used by languages including [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic"), [Urdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu "Urdu"), and [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language "Persian language"), is "upside-down" ⟨_،_⟩ (U+060C،ARABIC COMMA), in order to distinguish it from the [Arabic diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_diacritic "Arabic diacritic")_ḍammah_⟨ُ⟩ representing the vowel /u/, which is similarly shaped.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-40) In Arabic texts, the Western-styled comma (٫) is used as a [decimal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_point "Decimal point").

[Hebrew script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_script "Hebrew script") is also written from right to left. However, [Hebrew punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation "Hebrew punctuation") includes only a regular comma ⟨_,_⟩.

Reversed comma (U+2E41⹁REVERSED COMMA) is used in [Sindhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindhi_language "Sindhi language") when written in Arabic script. It is distinct from the standard Arabic comma.

[Dravidian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages "Dravidian languages") such as [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language "Tamil language"), [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language "Telugu language"), [Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada "Kannada"), and [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam "Malayalam") also use the punctuation mark in similar usage to that of European languages with similar spacing.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-41)[_[circular reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Wikipedia\_and\_sources\_that\_mirror\_or\_use\_it "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

In the common [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)") encoding systems [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") and [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII"), character 44 ([0x2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal")) corresponds to the comma symbol. The [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML")[numeric character reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_character_reference "Numeric character reference") is `&#44;`.

In many computer languages commas are used as a field delimiter to separate arguments to a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine "Subroutine"),[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-42) to separate elements in a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type "Array data type"), and to perform data designation on multiple variables at once.

In the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") the comma symbol is an [operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_operator "Comma operator") which evaluates its first [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming) "Parameter (computer programming)") (which may have side-effects) and then returns the value of its evaluated second argument. This is useful in _for_[statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(programming) "Statement (programming)") and [macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science) "Macro (computer science)").

In [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk "Smalltalk") and [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)"), the [comma operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_operator "Comma operator") is used to [concatenate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation "Concatenation") collections, including strings. In APL, it is also used [monadically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation "Unary operation") to rearrange the items of an array into a list.

In [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog "Prolog"), the comma is used to denote [Logical Conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Conjunction "Logical Conjunction") ("and").

The [comma-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values "Comma-separated values") (CSV) format is very commonly used in exchanging text data between database and spreadsheet formats.

The comma is used as a [diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic") mark in [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language "Romanian language") under ⟨s⟩ (⟨Ș⟩, ⟨ș⟩), and under ⟨t⟩ (⟨Ț⟩, ⟨ț⟩). A [cedilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedilla "Cedilla") is occasionally used instead of it, but this is technically incorrect. The symbol ⟨d̦⟩ ('[d with comma below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-comma "D-comma")') was used as part of the [Romanian transitional alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_transitional_alphabet "Romanian transitional alphabet") (19th century) to indicate the sounds denoted by the Latin letter ⟨z⟩ or letters ⟨dz⟩, where derived from a [Cyrillic ѕ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dze "Dze") (⟨ѕ⟩, /dz/). The comma and the cedilla are both derivative of ⟨ʒ⟩ (a small cursive ⟨z⟩) placed below the letter. From this standpoint alone, ⟨ș⟩, ⟨ț⟩, and ⟨d̦⟩ could potentially be regarded as stand-ins for /sz/, /tz/, and /dz/ respectively.

In [Latvian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_language "Latvian language"), the comma is used on the letters ⟨ģ⟩, ⟨ķ⟩, ⟨ļ⟩, ⟨ņ⟩, and historically also ⟨ŗ⟩, to indicate [palatalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_(phonetics) "Palatalization (phonetics)"). Because the lowercase letter ⟨g⟩ has a [descender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descender "Descender"), the comma is rotated 180° and placed over the letter. Although their [Adobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Systems "Adobe Systems")[glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph") names are 'letter with comma', their names in the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") Standard are 'letter with a cedilla'. They were introduced to the Unicode standard before 1992 and, per Unicode Consortium policy, their names cannot be altered. In the late 1920s and 1930s, the [Latgalian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latgalian_language "Latgalian language") orthography used in Siberia used additional letters with comma: ⟨c̦⟩, ⟨d̦⟩, ⟨m̦⟩, ⟨p̦⟩, ⟨ș⟩, ⟨ț⟩, ⟨v̦⟩, ⟨z̦⟩.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-43)

In [Livonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livonian_language "Livonian language"), whose alphabet is based on a mixture of Latvian and [Estonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language "Estonian language") alphabets, the comma is used on the letters ⟨ḑ⟩, ⟨ļ⟩, ⟨ņ⟩, ⟨ŗ⟩, ⟨ț⟩ to indicate palatalization in the same fashion as Latvian, except that Livonian uses ⟨ḑ⟩ and ⟨ț⟩ to represent the same [palatal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_consonant "Palatal consonant")[plosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive_consonant "Plosive consonant") phonemes which Latvian writes as ⟨ģ⟩ and ⟨ķ⟩ respectively.

In [Czech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language "Czech language") and [Slovak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_language "Slovak language"), the diacritic in the characters ⟨ď⟩, ⟨ť⟩, and ⟨ľ⟩ resembles a superscript comma, but it is used instead of a [caron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caron "Caron") because the letter has an [ascender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascender_(typography) "Ascender (typography)"). Other ascender letters with carons, such as letters ⟨ȟ⟩ (used in [Finnish Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Kalo_language "Finnish Kalo language") and [Lakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_language "Lakota language")) and ⟨ǩ⟩ (used in [Skolt Sami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skolt_Sami_language "Skolt Sami language")), did not modify their carons to superscript commas.

In 16th-century [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala"), the archaic letter [cuatrillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuatrillo "Cuatrillo") with a comma (⟨Ꜯ⟩ and ⟨ꜯ⟩) was used to write Mayan languages.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#cite_note-44)
