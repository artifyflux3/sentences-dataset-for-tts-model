The payload fraction is the quotient of the payload mass and the total vehicle mass at the start of its journey. It is a function of specific impulse , propellant mass fraction and the structural coefficient . In aircraft, loading less than full fuel for shorter trips is standard practice to reduce weight and fuel consumption. For this reason, the useful load fraction calculates a similar number, but it is based on the combined weight of the payload and fuel together in relation to the total weight.

Propeller-driven airliners had useful load fractions on the order of 25–35%. Modern jet airliners have considerably higher useful load fractions, on the order of 45–55%.

For orbital rockets the payload fraction is between 1% and 5%, while the useful load fraction is perhaps 90%.
