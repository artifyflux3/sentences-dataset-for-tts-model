The awards were presented every year at either Worldcon or the North American Science Fiction Convention (NASFiC).  In 2018 they were replaced by Notable Book Lists of the same names sponsored by the Library and Information Technology Association (LITA).

The Golden Duck Awards were funded by Super-Con-Duck-Tivity, Inc., the sponsor of the U.S. midwest regional science fiction convention DucKon .  Winners were selected by a group of teachers, librarians, parents, high tech workers and reviewers.

Categories [ edit ] The categories are: Picture Book Middle Grades (the Eleanor Cameron Award) Young Adult (the Hal Clement Award) There was also a provision for a Special Award if a book was found to be outstanding but did not fit any of the standard categories.

Winners [ edit ] Picture Book Award [ edit ] The Picture Book Award is sometimes given to a book with non-fictional science content with a story "wrapper" as well as traditional science fiction themes.
