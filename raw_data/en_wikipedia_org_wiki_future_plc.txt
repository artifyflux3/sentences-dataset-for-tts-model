It was started in 1985 by Chris Anderson . It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index .

History [ edit ] 1985–2012 [ edit ] The company was founded by Chris Anderson as Future Publishing in Somerton, Somerset , England, with the sole magazine Amstrad Action in 1985.

[ 2 ] An early innovation was the inclusion of free software on magazine covers.

[ 2 ] It acquired GP Publications and established what would become Future US in 1994.

[ 3 ] Anderson sold the company to Pearson plc for £52.7m in 1994, but bought it back in 1998, for £142 million.

[ 2 ] The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1999.

[ 4 ] Anderson left the company in 2001.

[ 5 ] In 2004, the company was accused of corruption when it published positive reviews for the video game Driver 3 in two of its owned magazines, Xbox World and PSM2 .

[ 6 ] 2012–2015 [ edit ] Future published the official magazines for the consoles of all three major games console manufacturers ( Microsoft , Nintendo , and Sony ); however PlayStation: The Official Magazine ceased publishing in November 2012, and Official Nintendo Magazine ceased publishing in October 2014.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The chief executive and finance director both resigned at short notice after a profit warning in October 2011. It was noted that a re-structuring would be necessary as the company moved to a digital model.

[ 9 ] Future announced it would cut 55 jobs from its UK operation as part of a restructuring to adapt "more effectively to the company's rapid transition to a primarily digital business model." [ 10 ] The company announced in March 2014 that it would close all of its U.S.-based print publications and shift U.S. print support functions such as consumer marketing, production and editorial leadership for Future's international print brands to the UK.

[ 11 ] Later in 2014, Future sold its sport and craft titles to Immediate Media , and its auto titles to Kelsey Media.

[ 12 ] In April 2014, Zillah Byng-Thorne (then finance director) was appointed chief executive to replace Mark Wood, who had been in the position since 2011.

[ 11 ] 2016–2021 [ edit ] In 2018, Future made further major acquisitions. It bought the What Hi-Fi?

, FourFourTwo , Practical Caravan , and Practical Motorhome brands from Haymarket ; and it acquired NewBay Media , publisher of numerous broadcast, professional-video, and systems-integration trade titles, as well as several consumer music magazines.

[ 13 ] This acquisition returned most of the U.S. consumer music magazines to Future, with the exception of Revolver which had been sold to Project M Group in 2017.

[ 14 ] It bought the Purch Group for $132m by September 2018, [ 15 ] [ 16 ] and in February 2019 bought Mobile Nations including the titles Android Central , iMore , Windows Central and Thrifter for $115 million.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Future also acquired Procycling and Cyclingnews.com from Immediate Media .

[ 19 ] In July 2019 the company bought SmartBrief, a digital media publisher, for an initial sum of $45 million.

[ 20 ] In November 2019, the company bought Barcroft Studios for £23.5 million in a combination of cash and shares.

[ 21 ] It renamed it Future Studios and announced the launch of "Future Originals", an anthology gaming series, a "factual" series focusing on the paranormal, and a new true-crime show, in partnership with Marie Claire .

[ 22 ] In April 2020, it acquired TI Media with 41 brands for £140 million.

[ 23 ] In November, it agreed to a £594m takeover of GoCo plc, known for its Gocompare.com price-comparison website.

[ 24 ] In August 2021, it acquired Dennis Publishing and its 12 magazines, for £300 million.

[ 25 ] 2022–present [ edit ] The company was criticised in February 2022 for the size of the remuneration package being offered to Zillah Byng-Thorne, the chief executive. It was noted that she could receive £40 million if the company performed well.

[ 26 ] Byng-Thorne resigned with effect from 3 April 2023 and was replaced as chief executive by Jon Steinberg .

[ 27 ] In April 2023, the company sold its shooting magazines including Shooting Times and Sporting Gun to Fieldsports Press.

[ 28 ] In August 2024, the company announced that its American trade papers Broadcasting & Cable and Multichannel News [ 29 ] would be closing after more than 90 years, with the main title Broadcasting having been first published in 1931 and the merged title Multichannel News dating from 1980.

[ 30 ] In October 2024, the company closed a number of consumer titles in the United Kingdom, including Play , All About Space , Total 911 , and 3D World , with the monthly movie magazine Total Film [ 31 ] [ 32 ] ceasing publication after 27 years.

[ 33 ] Kevin Li Ying took over the position of CEO on 31 March 2025.

[ 34 ] Organisation [ edit ] In addition to media and magazines, the company has two other businesses: Future Studios is its video division, built upon the acquisition of Barcroft Media in 2019.

[ 35 ] Marketforce is its sales, marketing, and distribution company, acquired as part of a 2019 deal with TI Media.
