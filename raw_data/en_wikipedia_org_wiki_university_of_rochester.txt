[ 10 ] It was founded in 1850 and moved into its current campus, next to the Genesee River in 1930. With approximately 30,000 full-time employees, the university is the largest private employer in Upstate New York and the seventh-largest in all of New York State .

[ 11 ] With over 12,000 students, the university offers 160 undergraduate and 30 graduate programs across seven schools spread throughout five campuses.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] The College of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering is the largest school, [ 14 ] and it includes the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The Eastman School of Music , founded by and named after George Eastman , is located in Downtown Rochester .

The university is also home to Rochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics , a national laboratory supported by the US Department of Energy . The university is classified among " R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity " and is a member of the Association of American Universities , which emphasizes academic research.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] The university's sports teams, the Rochester Yellowjackets , compete in NCAA Division III . The school is a founding member of the University Athletic Association (UAA).

History [ edit ] The façade of Rush Rhees Library , the main library on campus Early history [ edit ] The University of Rochester traces its origins to The First Baptist Church of Hamilton, New York , which was founded in 1796. The church established the Baptist Education Society of the State of New York, later renamed the Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution , in 1817.

[ 17 ] This institution gave birth to both Madison University and the University of Rochester. Its function was to train clergy in the Baptist tradition. When it aspired to grant higher degrees, it created a collegiate division separate from the theological division .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] The collegiate division was granted a charter by the State of New York in 1846, after which its name was changed to Madison University .

[ 19 ] John Wilder and the Baptist Education Society urged that the new university be moved to Rochester, New York . However, legal action prevented the move. In response, dissenting faculty, students, and trustees defected and departed for Rochester, where they sought a new charter for a new university. Madison University was eventually renamed Colgate University .

[ 19 ] Founding [ edit ] Asahel C. Kendrick , professor of Greek, was among the faculty that departed Madison University for Rochester. Kendrick served as acting president while a national search was conducted. He reprised this role until 1853, when Martin Brewer Anderson of the Andover Newton Theological Seminary in Massachusetts was selected to fill the inaugural posting.

[ 20 ] The University of Rochester's new charter was awarded by the Regents of the State of New York on January 31, 1850. The charter stipulated that the university have $100,000 in endowment within five years, upon which the charter would be reaffirmed. An initial gift of $10,000 was pledged by John Wilder, which helped catalyze significant gifts from individuals and institutions.

[ 20 ] Classes began that November, with approximately 60 students enrolled, including 28 transfers from Madison.

[ 20 ] From 1850 to 1862, the university was housed in the old United States Hotel in downtown Rochester on Buffalo Street near Elizabeth Street (now West Main Street near the I-490 overpass).

[ 21 ] For the next 10 years, the college expanded its scope and secured its future through an expanding endowment, student body, and faculty. In parallel, a gift of 8 acres of farmland from local businessman and Congressman Azariah Boody secured the first campus of the university, upon which Anderson Hall was constructed and dedicated in 1862. Over the next sixty years, this Prince Street Campus grew by a further 17 acres and was developed to include fraternities houses, dormitories, and academic buildings including Anderson Hall, Sibley Library, Eastman and Carnegie Laboratories, the Memorial Art Gallery , and Cutler Union.

[ 22 ] The Great Hall of Rush Rhees Library Twentieth century [ edit ] The first female students were admitted in 1900, the result of an effort led by famous suffragist Susan B. Anthony and Helen Barrett Montgomery . During the 1890s, a number of women took classes and labs at the university as "visitors" but were not officially enrolled nor were their records included in the college register. President David Jayne Hill allowed the first woman, Helen E. Wilkinson, to enroll as a normal student, although she was not allowed to matriculate or pursue a degree. Thirty-three women enrolled among the first class in 1900, and Ella S. Wilcoxen was the first to receive a degree, in 1901.

[ 23 ] The first female member of the faculty was Elizabeth Denio who retired as Professor Emeritus in 1917. Male students moved to River Campus upon its completion in 1930 while the female students remained on the Prince Street campus until 1955.

Anthony's work left a lasting impression on the university, with multiple awards, buildings and centers being named after her.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] Expansion [ edit ] Major growth occurred under the leadership of Benjamin Rush Rhees over his 1900–1935 tenure. During this period, George Eastman became a major donor, giving more than $50 million to the university during his life.

[ 26 ] Under the patronage of Eastman, the Eastman School of Music was created in 1921. In 1925, at the behest of the General Education Board and with significant support from John D. Rockefeller , George Eastman, and Henry A. Strong 's family, medical and dental schools were created.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] The university awarded its first PhD that same year.

During World War II , Rochester was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

[ 29 ] In 1942, the university was invited to join the Association of American Universities as an affiliate member and it was made a full member by 1944.

[ 30 ] Between 1946 and 1947, in infamous uranium experiments , researchers at the university injected uranium-234 and uranium-235 into six people to study how much uranium their kidneys could tolerate before becoming damaged.

[ 31 ] In 1955, the separate colleges for men and women were merged into the college on the River Campus. In 1958, three new schools were created in engineering, business administration, and education.

[ 32 ] With guidance provided by Lewis White Beck at this time, the university also acquired widespread international recognition for the excellence of its Ph.D. program in Philosophy as well as close research collaborations with Kantian scholars throughout Germany and the United States.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] The Graduate School of Management was named after William E. Simon , former Secretary of the Treasury in 1986. He committed significant funds to the school because of his belief in the school's free market philosophy and grounding in economic analysis.

[ 37 ] Under the leadership of William Riker , the Department of Political Science at Rochester went from a six-person faculty with no graduate program to one of the most exciting political science departments in the United States. Riker established a new undergraduate program and trained an extraordinary number of graduate students. What emerged at Rochester, in the words of University of Georgia 's Keith T. Poole and Princeton's Howard Rosenthal , was "the best doctoral program in political science in the world." According to Berkeley professors Nelson Polby and Eric Shickler , Rochester professor Richard Fenno "contributed more to the understanding of the U.S. Congress than any other scholar in the more than 200 years since the founding of the American nation".

[ 38 ] Name change controversy [ edit ] Following the princely gifts given throughout his life, George Eastman left the entirety of his estate to the university after his death by suicide.

[ 39 ] The total of these gifts surpassed $100 million, before inflation, and, as such, Rochester enjoyed a privileged position amongst the most well-endowed universities. During the expansion years between 1936 and 1976, [ 40 ] the University of Rochester's financial position ranked third, near Harvard University 's endowment and the University of Texas System 's Permanent University Fund .

[ 41 ] Due to financial mismanagement combined with a decline in the value of large investments and a lack of portfolio diversity, the university's place dropped to the top 25 by the end of the 1980s.

[ 40 ] At the same time, the preeminence of the city of Rochester's major employers began to decline.

In response, the university commissioned a study to determine if the name of the institution should be changed to "Eastman University" or "Eastman Rochester University". The study concluded a name change could be beneficial because the use of a place name in the title led respondents to incorrectly believe it was a public university, and because the name "Rochester" connoted a "cold and distant outpost." Reports of the latter conclusion led to controversy and criticism in the Rochester community. Ultimately, the name "University of Rochester" was retained.

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] In response, university president Thomas H. Jackson announced the launch of a "Renaissance Plan" for the college that reduced enrollment from 4,500 to 3,600, creating a more selective admissions process.

[ 46 ] The plan also revised the undergraduate curriculum significantly, creating the current system with only one required course and only a few distribution requirements, known as clusters.

[ 47 ] Part of this plan called for the end of graduate doctoral studies in chemical engineering, comparative literature, linguistics, and mathematics, [ 46 ] the last of which was met by national outcry.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] The plan was largely scrapped and mathematics exists as a graduate course of study to this day.

[ 51 ] Twenty-first century [ edit ] Shortly after taking office, university president Joel Seligman commenced the private phase of the Meliora Challenge, a $1.2 billion capital campaign, in 2005.

[ 52 ] The campaign reached its goal in 2015, a year before the campaign was slated to conclude.

[ 52 ] In 2016, the university announced the Meliora Challenge had exceeded its goal and surpassed $1.36 billion. These funds were allocated to support over 100 new endowed faculty positions and nearly 400 new scholarships.

[ 53 ] After and during the completion of the challenge, the university embarked on a new phase of construction, resulting in the addition of significant campus facilities. This expansion included the construction of two new student dormitories, O'Brien Hall (2013) and Genesee Hall (2017). Furthermore, other additions included Wegmans Hall (2016), a new building for the Computer and Data Science Departments, LeChase Hall (2013), designed to host the Warner School of Education, and Rettner Hall (2013).

[ 54 ] The University also expanded the Medical Center, constructing a new Children's Hospital , cancer center and  research building.

[ 55 ] On September 1, 2017, a complaint was filed by eight current and former faculty members at the University of Rochester with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The complaint includes allegations of sexual misconduct/harassment by a tenure track faculty member, and condemnation of the response of the university administration.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] The university's initial public response to the complaint was a claim that the allegations were thoroughly investigated and could not be substantiated.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] A new, independent investigation found the individuals covered in the report had not violated policy; however, significant recommendations were made to push the university towards leadership in policy regarding relationships between faculty, staff, employees, and students.

[ 61 ] On the same day as the release of the report, university president Joel Seligman publicly announced his previously tendered resignation.

[ 62 ] In 2019, federal judge Lawrence Vilardo ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on 15 of 16 legal claims, allowing their lawsuit to proceed.

[ 63 ] After a mediation process, the lawsuit was settled in 2020 when the university agreed to pay the plaintiffs $9.4 million, and thanked them for their efforts.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] Sarah C. Mangelsdorf succeeded Feldman as president of the university in 2019.

[ 66 ] Mangelsdorf is the first woman to serve as president of the university.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] In 2021, the Sloan Performing Arts Center opened, providing space for theatrical programs, dance programs, concerts, and other activities and serves as a home for the Institute for the Performing Arts.

[ 68 ] In 2023, the university completed the $51.5m purchase of College Town, a 312,000-square-foot, mixed-use complex near the Medical Center and began work on a $42m expansion of the Laboratory for Laser Energetics.

[ 69 ] After student protests against the Israel–Hamas war in November 2023, [ 70 ] University of Rochester students joined other campuses across the United States in setting up encampments on campus.

[ 71 ] The university suspended and banned several students from campus for participating in the protests.

[ 72 ] The Department of Public Safety also arrested four students on felony criminal mischief charges in November 2024 for allegedly plastering "wanted" posters across campus that the university denounced as "antisemitic".

[ 73 ] Strong Memorial Hospital , the main teaching hospital at the University, is currently undergoing its largest expansion, tripling the size of its Emergency department and adding a new, nine-story patient tower, which is the largest capital project in university history.

[ 74 ] In 2024, Tom Golisano announced that he had made a $50 million donation, the largest single gift in the university's history, to build the Golisano Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Institute and expand care for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in the Rochester region.

[ 75 ] Administration [ edit ] Statue of Rochester's first president, Martin Brewer Anderson .

The university is headed by a board of trustees, with Richard B. Handler as the chairman.

[ 76 ] The board appoints the president of the university. As of 2018, ten people have held the role of regularly-appointed president, with the eleventh to be inaugurated in 2019.

[ 77 ] On four occasions, the board of trustees has called upon members of the faculty to serve as an executive officer (Kendrick), acting president (Lattimore and Burton), or interim president (Feldman) during periods of transition.

It is bounded by Bausch & Lomb Riverside Park, an 18-acre (7.3 ha) public park along the east bank of the Genesee River formerly known as the Olmstead River Walk, and Mount Hope Cemetery , where the grave sites of Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass can be found. The River Campus was acquired in the late 1920s from the Oak Hill Country Club through a land swap deal orchestrated in part by Edwin Sage Hubbell and funded largely by George Eastman.

After a period of landscaping, grading, and construction, the original buildings of the campus were dedicated in 1930 when the first class of River Campus was welcomed to the Men's college. The main academic buildings are examples of the Greek Revival style in 20th-century collegiate architecture. The main buildings situated upon the Eastman Quadrangle are Rush Rhees Library at the head, flanked by the Morey Hall, Bausch & Lomb Hall, Lattimore Hall, and Dewey Hall. The Rush Rhees Library, the unofficial symbol of the university, is also home to the Hopeman Memorial Carillon , the largest carillon in New York State, featuring 50 bells that chime on the quarter-hour.

[ 79 ] Todd Union, constructed in 1930, has been recommended by New York State's Board for Historic Preservation to be added to the State and National Registers of Historic Places as "a key site associated with Rochester's LGBTQ+ history". Todd Union has an early and significant association with the University of Rochester's Gay Liberation Front (UR GLF), an organization that worked to advance the gay liberation movement on campus and in the city of Rochester in the 1970s.

[ 80 ] River Campus is home to a number of student exhibition spaces. The AsIs Gallery in the Sage Art Center showcases rotating exhibitions of student works from studio classes at U of R. As a work-in-progress critique space, this exhibition space provides students the opportunity to develop their work in a semi-professional space. The Gallery at the Art and Music Library features work from students and local artists in the highly trafficked Rush Rhees Art and Music Library. Hartnett Gallery, in Wilson Commons, is a student-supported gallery that showcases international and professional contemporary artists as well as an annual juried student exhibition.

T he pasSAGE is an annex of the Sage Art Center which features a long-term exhibition selected by a faculty committee. There is also a Senior Thesis Gallery in the Sage Arts Center that features senior undergraduate works.

[ 81 ] Medical Center [ edit ] The University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) is the primary campus for the university's medical education, research and main patient care facility. The Medical Center is next to the River Campus and is dominated by Strong Memorial Hospital , the School of Medicine and Dentistry building, and the Arthur Kornberg Medical Research Building. URMC also houses the School of Nursing, Golisano Children's Hospital , and a variety of research centers, including the Wilmot Cancer Center, the Aab Institute of Biomedical Sciences, and the Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute.

Eastman School of Music [ edit ] The Eastman School of Music is situated on its own campus in downtown Rochester, which includes a residence for students, classroom and performance facilities, and the Eastman Theatre , a 2,326-seat concert hall which also serves as the primary venue of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra .

The campus includes student housing for graduate students, the Laboratory for Laser Energetics , a Department of Energy-funded national lab, the Larry and Cindy Bloch Alumni and Advancement Center, the Center for Optics Manufacturing, the Center for Optoelectronics and Imaging, and the now-defunct Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory (NSRL).

Mount Hope Campus [ edit ] The Mount Hope Campus consists of a number of old mansion homes including the Witmer Family House, [ 82 ] which serves as the official residence of the President of the university, and the Patrick Barry House, [ 83 ] which serves as the official residence of the provost of the university.

Memorial Art Gallery Memorial Art Gallery [ edit ] Main article: Memorial Art Gallery The university's first permanent campus was at the former farm of Azariah Boody .

[ 84 ] While a number of buildings still stand including Anderson Hall, the Eastman Laboratories, and a number of student dormitories, these buildings have been absorbed by private companies or the Rochester School of the Arts. The university retains control of a few acres of land including the land under the Sibley Library (razed), old campus gates, the Memorial Art Gallery's old and new wings, and the Cutler Union, a prime example of the Collegiate Gothic style of 20th-century architecture.

The Memorial Art Gallery was founded in 1913 as a part of the University of Rochester through a gift from Emily Sibley Watson as a memorial to her son, James George Averell.

[ 88 ] The university has more than 103,000 living alumni and employs nearly 2,300 tenure-track faculty, with more than 20,000 faculty and staff across the university and the Strong Health System.

[ 89 ] The only required undergraduate course is the first-year writing seminar. In lieu of a core curriculum, undergraduates complete coursework in each of three disciplines: humanities , social sciences , and natural sciences . Students choose a major, consisting of more than ten courses, and a cluster, consisting of three related courses. The student must ensure at least a cluster is met in each discipline; however, second majors and minors are often used to fulfill these requirements. Students who pursue accredited engineering fields are exempt from this system and are required to have only one humanities or social science cluster.

[ 90 ] Research [ edit ] Rochester is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity".

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] Rochester had a research expenditure of $450 million in 2022.
