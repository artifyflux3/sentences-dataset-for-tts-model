**Space warfare** is combat in which one or more belligerents are in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"). The scope of space warfare includes _ground-to-space warfare_, such as attacking [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") from the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"); _space-to-space warfare_, such as satellites attacking satellites; and _space-to-ground warfare_, such as satellites attacking Earth-based targets. There exist international treaties, which are in place to attempt to regulate conflicts in space and limit the installation of space [weapon systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_system "Weapon system"), especially [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons "Nuclear weapons").

On October 31, 2023, during a [Yemeni missile strike on Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis "Red Sea crisis"), [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel")'s [Arrow 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_2 "Arrow 2") system intercepted a [ballistic missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile "Ballistic missile") launched from [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen") by [Houthi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi "Houthi") rebels; this successful interception occurred outside of Earth's [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") thus making it the first recorded practical instance of space warfare during an active conflict.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-2) On April 14, 2024, [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran") launched more than [120 ballistic missiles at Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2024_Iranian_strikes_against_Israel "April 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel"), making it the first large-scale incident in which a space weapon was used.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-3)

From 1985 to 2002, there was a [United States Space Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Command "United States Space Command"), which in 2002 merged with the [United States Strategic Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Strategic_Command "United States Strategic Command"), leaving the [United States Space Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force "United States Space Force") (formerly [Air Force Space Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Space_Command "Air Force Space Command") until 2019) as the primary American military [space force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_force "Space force"). The [Russian Space Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Space_Forces_(VKS) "Russian Space Forces (VKS)"), established on August 10, 1992, which became an independent section of the [Russian Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces "Russian Armed Forces") on June 1, 2001, was replaced by the [Russian Aerospace Defence Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Aerospace_Defence_Forces "Russian Aerospace Defence Forces") starting December 1, 2011, but was reestablished as a component of the [Russian Aerospace Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Aerospace_Forces "Russian Aerospace Forces") on August 1, 2015. In 2019, India conducted a test of the [ASAT missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon "Anti-satellite weapon"); this made out the fourth country with that capability. In April of the same year, the [Indian Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Armed_Forces "Indian Armed Forces") established the [Defence Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Space_Agency "Defence Space Agency").

During the early Cold War, a survivable reconnaissance asset was considered highly valuable. In a time before satellites, this meant building an aircraft that could fly higher or faster, or both, compared to any interceptor that would try to bring it down. Notably, the United States would introduce the [U-2 spy plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_U-2 "Lockheed U-2") in 1956. It was thought, at the time of its introduction, that the plane’s service ceiling of 24,000 metres (80,000 ft) would render it immune to Soviet aircraft, missiles, and radar. That was the case until the [1960 U-2 incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_U-2_incident "1960 U-2 incident"), where a United States U-2 [spy plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance_aircraft "Reconnaissance aircraft") was shot down by the [Soviet Air Defense Forces’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Air_Defence_Forces "Soviet Air Defence Forces")[S-75 Dvina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-75_Dvina "S-75 Dvina") (SA-2 Guideline) [surface-to-air missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile "Surface-to-air missile") while conducting photographic [aerial reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance "Aerial reconnaissance") deep inside [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") territory.

Three years before the incident, in 1957, a modified [R-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-7_(rocket_family) "R-7 (rocket family)") rocket carried the world's first artificial satellite, [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1 "Sputnik 1"), into an orbit hundreds of kilometers above sea level, notably beyond the reach of any existing weapons system. While Sputnik 1 held no military value, only transmitting radio signals back to Earth for three weeks, its launch sparked the beginning of the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race"). This spurred the United States to hasten and re-emphasize its space programs, culminating in the [Explorer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorer_program "Explorer program"), which launched the first American satellite into orbit in 1958. In tandem with the effort to achieve superior [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight") capability over the other, the United States and the Soviet Union began to develop space warfare capabilities.

Early efforts to conduct space warfare were directed at space-to-space warfare, as ground-to-space systems were considered to be too slow and too isolated by Earth's [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") and [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") to be effective at the time. The history of active space warfare development goes back to the 1960s when the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") began the [Almaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaz "Almaz") project, a project designed to give them the ability to do on-orbit inspections of satellites and destroy them if needed. Similar planning in the United States took the form of the [Blue Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Gemini "Blue Gemini") project, which consisted of modified Gemini capsules that would be able to deploy weapons and perform surveillance.

One early test of electronic space warfare, the so-called [Starfish Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime "Starfish Prime") test, took place in 1962 when the United States exploded a ground-launched nuclear weapon in space to test the effects of an [electromagnetic pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse "Electromagnetic pulse"). The result was a deactivation of many then-orbiting satellites, both American and Soviet. The deleterious and unfocused effects of the EMP test led to the banning of nuclear weapons in space in the [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty "Outer Space Treaty") of 1967. (See [high-altitude nuclear explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_nuclear_explosion "High-altitude nuclear explosion").)

In the early 1960s, the [U.S. military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._military "U.S. military") produced a film called _Space and National Security_ which depicted space warfare.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:1-4)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/ASAT_missile_launch.jpg/250px-ASAT_missile_launch.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ASAT_missile_launch.jpg)

A [USAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAF "USAF")[F-15 Eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-15_Eagle "F-15 Eagle") launching an [ASM-135 ASAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASM-135_ASAT "ASM-135 ASAT") (anti-satellite) missile in 1985

Through the 1970s, the Soviet Union continued their project and test-fired a cannon to test space station defense. This was considered too dangerous to do with a crew on board, however, so the test was conducted after the crew had returned to Earth.

A 1976 Soviet report suggested that the design of the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") had been guided by a requirement to deliver a payload- such as a bomb- over Russia and return to land after a single orbit. This may have been a confusion based on requirements 3A and 3B for the shuttle's design, which required the craft to be able to deploy or retrieve an object from a [polar orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_orbit "Polar orbit") in a single pass.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-5)

Both the Soviets and the United States developed [anti-satellite weaponry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon "Anti-satellite weapon") designed to shoot down satellites. While early efforts paralleled other space-to-space warfare concepts, the United States was able in the 1980s to develop ground-to-space [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser") anti-satellite weapons. None of these systems are known to be active today; however, a less powerful civilian version of the ground-to-space laser system is commonly used in the astronomical technique of [adaptive optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics "Adaptive optics").

In 1984, the [Strategic Defence Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defence_Initiative "Strategic Defence Initiative") (SDI) was proposed. It was nicknamed _Star Wars_ after the popular science fiction franchise [Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars "Star Wars").

In 1985, the United States demonstrated its conventional ASAT capabilities by launching an ASM-135 [ASAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASM-135_ASAT#Test_launches "ASM-135 ASAT") from an [F-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-15_Eagle "F-15 Eagle") to shoot down the [Solwind P78-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solwind "Solwind"), an American research satellite, from its 555-kilometre (345 mi) orbit.

Launch of an interceptor derived from [Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ballistic_Missile_Defence_Programme "Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme") for ASAT test on March 27, 2019

The People's Republic of China successfully tested (see [2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test "2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test")) a ballistic missile-launched anti-satellite weapon on January 11, 2007. This resulted in harsh criticism from the United States of America, Britain, and Japan.

The U.S. developed an interceptor missile, the [SM-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIM-161_Standard_Missile_3 "RIM-161 Standard Missile 3"), testing it by hitting ballistic test targets while they were in space. On February 21, 2008, the U.S. used an SM-3 missile to destroy a spy satellite, [USA-193](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA-193 "USA-193"), while it was 247 kilometers (133 [nautical miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile "Nautical mile")) above the Pacific Ocean.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-DoD-Navy-20080220-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-9)

Japan fields the U.S.-made SM-3 missile, and there have been plans to base the land-based version in Romania and Vietnam.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In March 2019, India shot down a satellite orbiting in a [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") using an [ASAT missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASAT_missile "ASAT missile") during an operation code named [Mission Shakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Shakti "Mission Shakti"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-10) thus making its way to the list of space warfare nations,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-11) establishing the [Defense Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Space_Agency "Defence Space Agency") the following month, followed by its first-ever simulated space warfare exercise on July 25 which would inform a joint military space doctrine.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-12)

In July 2019, [Emmanuel Macron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron "Emmanuel Macron") "called for a space high command to protect" France's satellites. This was followed by a plan released by military officials. French Defense Minister, [Florence Parly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Parly "Florence Parly"), announced a space weapons program that would move the country's space surveillance strategy towards active protection of its assets in space, e.g., satellites. The projects outlined include: patrolling [nano-satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_satellite#Nanosatellites "Small satellite") swarms, ground-based laser systems to blind spying satellites, and machine guns mounted on satellites.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-13)

[Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink "Starlink"), [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX")'s large low Earth orbit satellite constellation, [was extensively used for warfare following Russia's invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War "Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War") after the country's previous satcom provider Viasat [were cyberattacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viasat_hack "Viasat hack") in the first few days of the invasion.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:28-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-15) Starlink was used for defense and attacks on Russian positions, with Starlink terminals being namely strapped on [strike drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_warfare "Drone warfare") and [sea drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_surface_vehicle "Unmanned surface vehicle").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:11-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:51-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:33-18) SpaceX vowed and acted against the use of their Starlink service for active warfare,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:38-19) while Russia launched cyberattacks against Starlink and threatened of striking Starlink satellites directly in retaliation.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:11-16)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-20)

On October 31, 2023, as part of the [Gaza war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war"), [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel")[intercepted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis "Red Sea crisis") a [Houthi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement "Houthi movement")[ballistic missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile "Ballistic missile") with its [Arrow 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_2 "Arrow 2") missile defense system. According to Israeli officials, the interception occurred above Earth's atmosphere above the [Negev Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev_Desert "Negev Desert"), making it the first instance of space combat in history.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-22)

On November 21, 2024, as part of the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine"), Russia launched a new [Oreshnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreshnik_(missile) "Oreshnik (missile)")[intermediate-range ballistic missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate-range_ballistic_missile "Intermediate-range ballistic missile"), striking [Dnipro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnipro "Dnipro").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-c0773-23) Ukraine's air force initially claimed an [intercontinental ballistic missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile "Intercontinental ballistic missile") (range greater than 5,500 km) was used, and Ukrainian media initially reported it was an [RS-26 Rubezh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-26_Rubezh "RS-26 Rubezh") ICBM with range 5,800 km. The US and Russia confirmed it was [intermediate-range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate-range_ballistic_missile "Intermediate-range ballistic missile") (3,000–5,500 km),[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:02-24) but the Pentagon stated it was based on the RS-26 ICBM. It was fired from the [Astrakhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrakhan_Oblast "Astrakhan Oblast") region 700 km away. Analysts stated the missile used a [multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle "Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle") (MIRV), likely marking their first use in combat.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-r0172-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-d1732-26) The night attack was reported to see six sequential vertical flashes, each comprising a cluster of up to six individual projectiles.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-i831-27) UN spokesperson [Stéphane Dujarric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Dujarric "Stéphane Dujarric") called the use of the intermediate-range weapon "concerning and worrying".[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-c07722-28)

As of 2025, space situational awareness is generally limited between countries.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:022-29): 269  Countries rely on doctrinal statements, media reports, international treaties and codes of conduct, and the like to signal their approaches to the development and use of counterspace capabilities.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:022-29): 269

A counterspace attack is one which inhibits an adversary's ability to use space for civilian purposes or national security purposes.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:022-29): 244

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Trident_II_missile_image.jpg/250px-Trident_II_missile_image.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trident_II_missile_image.jpg)

A [Trident missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_missile "Trident missile") launched from a [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy")[_Vanguard_-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard-class_submarine "Vanguard-class submarine")[ballistic missile submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile_submarine "Ballistic missile submarine")

In the late 1970s and through the 1980s, the Soviet Union and the United States theorized, designed and in some cases tested a variety of weaponry designed for warfare in outer space. Space warfare was seen primarily as an extension of [nuclear warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare "Nuclear warfare"), and many theoretical systems were based around the destruction or defense of ground and sea-based [missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_missile "Guided missile"). Space-based missiles were not attempted due to the [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty "Outer Space Treaty"), which banned the use, testing or storage of [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon") outside the Earth's atmosphere. When the U.S. gained "interest in utilizing space-based lasers for ballistic missile defense", two facts emerged. One being that the ballistic missiles are fragile and two, chemical lasers project missile killing energy (3,000 kilometers). This meant that lasers could be put into space to intercept a [ballistic missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile "Ballistic missile").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-30)

Systems proposed ranged from measures as simple as ground and space-based anti-missiles to [railguns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun "Railgun"), space based lasers, orbital mines and similar weaponry. Deployment of these systems was seriously considered in the mid-1980s under the banner of the [Strategic Defense Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative "Strategic Defense Initiative") announced by [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan") in 1983, using the term "evil empire" to describe the Soviets (hence the popular nickname "Star Wars").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-31) If the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War") had continued, many of these systems could potentially have seen deployment: the United States developed working railguns, and a laser that could destroy missiles at range, though the power requirements, range, and firing cycles of both were impractical. Weapons like the space-based laser was rejected, not just by the government, but by universities, moral thinkers, and religious people because it would have increased the waging of the arms race and questioned the United States' role in the Cold War.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-32)

With the end of the Cold War and continued development of satellite and electronics technology, attention was focused on space as a supporting theatre for conventional warfare. Currently, military operations in space primarily concern either the vast tactical advantages of satellite-based [surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_satellite "Spy satellite"), [communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite"), and [positioning systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System "Global Positioning System") or mechanisms used to deprive an opponent of said tactical advantages.

Accordingly, most space-borne proposals which would traditionally be considered "weapons" (a communications or reconnaissance satellite may be useful in warfare but isn't generally classified as a weapon) are designed to jam, sabotage, and outright destroy enemy satellites, and conversely to protect friendly satellites against such attacks. To this end, the US (and presumably other countries) is researching groups of small, highly mobile satellites called "microsats" (about the size of a refrigerator) and "picosats" (approximately 1 cubic foot (≈27 litres) in volume) nimble enough to maneuver around and interact with other orbiting objects to repair, sabotage, hijack, or simply collide with them. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Kinetic bombardment

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_warfare&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Kinetic bombardment")]

Kinetic weapons collide with their targets.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:022-29): 244  In the context of space warfare, kinetic weapons could include missiles launched from earth (direct ascent weapons) or co-orbital weapons fired by satellites or other spacecraft in orbit.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:022-29): 244

A theorized use involves the extension of conventional weaponry into orbit for deployment against ground targets. Though international treaties ban the deployment of nuclear missiles outside the atmosphere, other categories of weapons are largely unregulated. Traditional ground-based weapons are generally not useful in orbital environments, and few if any would survive [re-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-entry "Re-entry") even if they were, but as early as the 1950s, the United States has toyed with [kinetic bombardment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment "Kinetic bombardment"), i.e. orbiting magazines of non-explosive projectiles to be dropped onto hardened targets from [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit").

Kinetic weapons have always been widespread in conventional warfare—bullets, arrows, swords, clubs, etc.—but the energy a projectile would gain while falling from orbit would make such a weapon rival all but the most powerful explosives.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] A direct hit would presumably destroy all but the most hardened targets without the need for nuclear weapons.

Such a system would involve a 'spotter' satellite, which would identify targets from orbit with high-power sensors, and a nearby 'magazine' satellite to de-orbit a long, needle-like [tungsten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten "Tungsten") dart onto it with a small rocket motor or dropping a large rock from orbit (such as an asteroid, cf. [Ivan's hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan%27s_hammer "Ivan's hammer")).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] This would be more useful against a larger but less hardened target (such as a city). Though a common device in science fiction, there is no publicly available evidence that any such systems have actually been deployed by any nation.

A [USAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAF "USAF")[Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing "Boeing")[YAL-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAL-1 "YAL-1") airborne laser

Weapon systems that fall under this category include [lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser"), [linear particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator "Linear particle accelerator") or [particle-beam based weaponry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-beam_weapon "Particle-beam weapon"), [microwaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") and [plasma-based weaponry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_weapon "Plasma weapon"). [Particle beams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_beam "Particle beam") involve the acceleration of charged or neutral particles in a stream towards a target at extremely high velocities, the impact of which creates a reaction causing immense damage. Most of these weapons are theoretical or impractical to implement currently, aside from lasers which have been used to blind satellites[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:0-33) and are starting to be used in terrestrial warfare. That said, directed-energy weapons are more practical and more effective in a vacuum (i.e. space) than in the Earth's atmosphere, as in the atmosphere the particles of air interfere with and disperse the directed energy. Nazi Germany had a project for such a weapon, considered a [wunderwaffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunderwaffe "Wunderwaffe"), the [sun gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_gun "Sun gun"), which would have been an orbital [concave mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_mirror "Concave mirror") able to concentrate the sun's energy on a ground target.

In the context of space-based deployment, directed-energy weapons can be distinguished as either “high-powered” or “dazzler.” High-powered satellite-operated lasers are intended to deal irreversible damage to the sensitive parts, mainly optics, on satellites and have the advantage of being difficult to attribute to an actor. Though, it is difficult to confirm the success of an attack. Dazzlers are not intended to deal irreversible damage but rather disable a target satellite. It maintains the same advantages and disadvantages as the high-powered variant. Though such systems not yet functional, the US [Defense Intelligence Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Agency "Defense Intelligence Agency") notes that several actors, including the United States, PRC, Russia, and France, are actively pursuing these capabilities.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:0-33)

Practical considerations
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_warfare&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Practical considerations")]

Space warfare is likely to be done at far larger distances and speeds than combat on Earth. The vast distances pose big challenges for targeting and tracking, as even light requires a few seconds to cover hundreds of thousands of kilometers. For example, if trying to fire on a target at the distance of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") from the Earth, one sees the position of the target slightly more than a second earlier. Thus even a laser would need ~1.28 seconds, meaning a laser-based weapon system would need to lead a target's apparent position by 1.28×2 = 2.56 seconds. A projectile from a railgun recently tested by the US Navy would take over 18 hours to cross that distance, if it travels in a straight line at a constant velocity of 5.8 km/s along its entire trajectory.

Three factors make engaging targets in space very difficult. First, the vast distances mean that an error of even a fraction of a degree in the [firing solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firing_solution "Firing solution") can mean a miss by thousands of kilometers. Second, spaceflight involves tremendous speeds by terrestrial standards—a [geostationary satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit "Geostationary orbit") moves at 3.07 km/s, and objects in [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") move at ~8 km/s. Third, though distances are huge, targets remain relatively small. The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station"), currently the largest artificial object in Earth orbit, measures slightly over 100m at its largest span. Other satellites can be vastly smaller, e.g., [Quickbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickbird "Quickbird") measures only 3.04m. [External ballistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_ballistics "External ballistics") for stationary terrestrial targets is enormously complicated—some of the earliest [analog computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_I_Fire_Control_Computer "Mark I Fire Control Computer") were used to calculate firing solutions for naval artillery, as the problems were already beyond manual solutions in any reasonable time—and targeting objects in space is far harder. And, though not a problem for orbital kinetic weapons, any directed energy weapon would need huge amounts of electricity. So far the most practical batteries are [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_battery "Lithium battery"), and the most practical means of generating electricity in space is [photovoltaic modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_module "Photovoltaic module"), which are currently only up to 30% efficient,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-spectrolab14-34) and fuel cells, which have limited fuel. Current technology might not be practical for powering effective lasers, particle beams, and railguns in space. In the context of the [Strategic Defense Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative "Strategic Defense Initiative"), the [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory") in the United States worked on a project for expandable space-based x-ray lasers powered by a nuclear explosion, [Project Excalibur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Excalibur "Project Excalibur"), a project canceled in 1992 for lack of results.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-dies-35) SDI projects included [Zenith Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith_Star "Zenith Star"), using the Alpha chemical laser.

General [William L. Shelton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_L._Shelton "William L. Shelton") has said that in order to protect against attacks, Space Situational Awareness is much more important than additional hardening or armoring of satellites.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-36) The [Air Force Space Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Space_Command "Air Force Space Command") has indicated that their defensive focus will be on "Disaggregated Space Architectures".[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-37)

Anti-satellite attacks, especially ones with kinetic [kill vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_vehicle "Kill vehicle"), can form [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") which can stay in orbit for many years and could interfere with future space activity or in a worst case trigger [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome "Kessler syndrome").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-aviationweek1-38) In the worst-case scenario of Kessler syndrome, collisions among debris and space objects become self-sustaining, although this scenario would require a vast amount of debris and a long time period.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:022-29): 245

In January 2007 [China did a satellite knock out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test "2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test") whose detonation alone caused more than 40,000 new chunks of debris with a diameter > 1 cm and a sudden increase in the total amount of debris in orbit.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-39) The PRC is reported to be developing "soft-kill" techniques such as jamming and vision kills that do not generate much debris.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-40)

### Risk to other activities

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_warfare&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Risk to other activities")]

Space warfare creates risks to other activities, including risks to human beings in orbit, risks to commercial space activity, and creating difficulties for launching payloads to higher orbits.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:022-29): 244

### Political considerations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_warfare&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Political considerations")]

Countries which engage in space warfare would presumably face reputational costs for violating the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:022-29): 244–245

Possible warfare over space
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_warfare&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Possible warfare over space")]

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Challenges_Security_Space_2022.jpg/250px-Challenges_Security_Space_2022.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Challenges_Security_Space_2022.jpg)

Counterspace Threat Continuum

Most of the world's communications systems rely heavily on the presence of satellites in orbit around Earth. Protecting these assets might seriously motivate nations dependent upon them to consider deploying more space-based weaponry, especially in conflicts involving advanced countries with access to space.

Since 2017, the [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force") has run an annual [military exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise "Military exercise") called "Space Flag" at [Peterson Space Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterson_Space_Force_Base "Peterson Space Force Base"), which involves a [red team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team "Red team") simulating attacks on U.S. satellites.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-41)

[Robert Zubrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zubrin "Robert Zubrin"), [aerospace engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering") and advocate for [human exploration of Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_exploration_of_Mars "Human exploration of Mars"), stated that [anti-satellite weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon "Anti-satellite weapon") capabilities of nations increases, [space infrastructures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_infrastructure "Space infrastructure") must be able to defend itself using other satellites that can destroy such weapons. Or else, he states, [satellite-based navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation "Satellite navigation"), [communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite") and [reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance_satellite "Reconnaissance satellite") capabilities would be severely limited and easily influenced by adversaries.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-:13-42): 63–66

The modern incarnations of the [ASM-135 ASAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASM-135_ASAT#Test_launches "ASM-135 ASAT") program are the so-called direct-ascent anti-satellite weapons. These weapons are usually either [ballistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile "Ballistic missile") or [anti-ballistic interceptor missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ballistic_missile "Anti-ballistic missile"), which ascend directly from Earth to intercept their target and have been adapted to the anti-satellite role. To date, four countries have demonstrated their ability to launch these weapons, the USA, the PRC, India, and Russia, but so far none have conducted such an attack on another country’s satellites.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-43)

Direct-ascent [ASATs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon "Anti-satellite weapon") leverage existing technologies and launch platforms to neutralize both space-based and ground-based targets. This option tends to be highly destructive and indiscriminate as any attack will produce [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris"), which can indiscriminately affect other satellites in similar orbits. While this option comes with the benefit of leveraging existing technologies and a certain element of surprise, as an attack cannot be detected until a missile has exited its silo, there are significant downsides. Firstly, there is the cost disparity of using an [ICBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile "Intercontinental ballistic missile") or [ABM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ballistic_missile "Anti-ballistic missile") to kill a small and inexpensive satellite. Additionally, these missiles are not designed to send payloads out to geocentric orbit, as such they can only affect targets in low earth orbit and only in a target area centered around the static location of the missile itself.

Co-orbital systems come with a few potential kill mechanisms: in guided kinetic vehicles, like the [Multiple Kill Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Kill_Vehicle "Multiple Kill Vehicle"), or in the form of a satellite that can release a kinetic interceptor or a cloud of debris. The first co-orbital system, [Istrebitel Sputnikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istrebitel_Sputnikov "Istrebitel Sputnikov"), was developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and reportedly utilized one of these mechanisms.

There are allegations that Russia continues to test co-orbital ASAT weapons as recently as 2020. In 2020 the [U.S. State Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State") claimed that a Russian satellite, Cosmos-2519, exhibited behavior “inconsistent” with its intended mission. While in orbit, [Kosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_(satellite) "Kosmos (satellite)")-2519 deployed a smaller satellite, which Russian state media claimed: “conducted autonomous flight, a change in orbit, and a satellite inspection before returning to the base station”.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-44) Another incident back in 2019 involved two Russian satellites, Kosmos 2542 and 2543, one of which appeared to begin following a U.S. national security satellite.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-45) Such “inspector” satellites can be armed with lasers to provide non-destructive interference or deadly kinetic interceptors.

While these co-orbital systems provide more utility when compared to more direct and destructive options, their advantages are contingent on being maneuverable and inconspicuous. Given the increasing paranoia surrounding co-orbital anti-satellite, it is hard to believe that the major players in space will fail to notice the deployment of “research” satellites.

Space warfare in science fiction
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_warfare&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Space warfare in science fiction")]

Space warfare is a staple of [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction"), where it is shown with a wide range of realism and plausibility. Fictional space warfare includes anticipated future technology and tactics, and fantasy- or history-based scenarios in a scifi setting. Some portray a space military as like an [air force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force "Air force"); others depict a more [naval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy "Navy") framework. Still others suggest forces more like [space marine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_marine "Space marine"): highly mobile forces doing interplanetary and [interstellar war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_war "Interstellar war") but most of the conflict happens in terrestrial environments. The main sub-genres of the [Space warfare in science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare_in_science_fiction "Space warfare in science fiction") thematic genre are [space opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera "Space opera"), [Military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_science_fiction "Military science fiction") and [Space Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Western "Space Western"). Though [sword and planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_and_planet "Sword and planet") stories like [Finisterre universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finisterre_universe "Finisterre universe") by [C. J. Cherryh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._J._Cherryh "C. J. Cherryh") might be considered, they rarely feature such technologies. These three genres often intertwine and have themes that are common to all. Written Space Westerns are often based directly on existing established scifi space opera franchises with [expanded universes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_universe "Expanded universe") like [Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_expanded_universe "Star Wars expanded universe") and Star Trek,[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-46) including _[Warhammer 40,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer\_40,000 "Warhammer 40,000")_: the most popular space opera military [miniature wargame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_wargaming "Miniature wargaming") which spawned successful [spin-off media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000#Spin-off_games_and_other_media "Warhammer 40,000"): [novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Warhammer_40,000_novels "List of Warhammer 40,000 novels"), [video-games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Games_Workshop_video_games "List of Games Workshop video games") and on-going live adaption based on books by [Dan Abnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Abnett "Dan Abnett").[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_warfare#cite_note-47)

Both kinetic and [directed energy weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_energy_weapons "Directed energy weapons") are often seen, along with various military space vessels. [E. E. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Smith "E. E. Smith")'s _[Lensman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lensman "Lensman")_ is an early example, which also inspired the term [space opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera "Space opera") due to the grandiose scale of the stories. [Orson Scott Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card "Orson Scott Card")'s _[Ender's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s\_Game\_(series) "Ender's Game (series)")_ series is a notable example in that it makes a conjecture as to what sort of tactics and training would be needed for war in outer space. Other scifi authors have also delved into the tactics of space combat, such as [David Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weber "David Weber") in his _[Honorverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorverse "Honorverse")_ series, and [Larry Niven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Niven "Larry Niven") and [Jerry Pournelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle "Jerry Pournelle") in their _[Mote in God's Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mote\_in\_God%27s\_Eye "Mote in God's Eye")_ series. A more recent example is [Alastair Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Reynolds "Alastair Reynolds")' [Revelation Space universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation_Space_universe "Revelation Space universe"), which explores combat at [relativistic speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). [Robert A. Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein "Robert A. Heinlein")'s _[Starship Troopers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship\_Troopers "Starship Troopers")_ is perhaps one of the best-known and earliest explorations of the "[space marine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_marine "Space marine")" idea.

Space-based vehicular combat is portrayed in many movies and video games, most notably _[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Wars "Star Wars")_, [Stargate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate "Stargate"), _[Halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo\_(series) "Halo (series)")_, _[Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent\_(video\_game) "Descent (video game)")_, _[Gundam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam "Gundam")_, _[Macross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macross "Macross")_, _[Babylon 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon\_5 "Babylon 5")_, and _[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Trek "Star Trek")_. Games such as the _[Homeworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld "Homeworld")_ series have interesting concepts for space warfare, such as 3D battle formations, plasma-based projectors that get their energy from a ship's propulsion system, and automated uncrewed space combat vehicles. Other series, such as _Gundam_, prominently show vehicular combat in and among many near future concepts, such as [O'Neill cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_habitat "O'Neill habitat").

Fictional galaxies with space warfare are far too many to list, but popular examples include _Star Trek_ (in all of its forms), _Star Wars_, _Halo_, _[Stargate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate "Stargate")_, _Warhammer 40,000_, _[Babylon 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon\_5 "Babylon 5")_, _[Buck Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck\_Rogers "Buck Rogers")_, _[Flash Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash\_Gordon "Flash Gordon")_, _[Battlestar Galactica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar\_Galactica "Battlestar Galactica")_, _[Mass Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass\_Effect "Mass Effect")_, _[Freespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freespace "Freespace")_ and many [comic book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book "Comic book") franchises. Video games often touch the subject; the _[Wing Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing\_Commander\_(video\_game) "Wing Commander (video game)")_ franchise is a prototypical example. Few games try to simulate realistic distance and speed, though _[Independence War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-War\_(Independence\_War) "I-War (Independence War)")_ and _[Frontier: Elite II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier:\_Elite\_II "Frontier: Elite II")_ both do, as does the board game _[Attack Vector: Tactical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack\_Vector:\_Tactical "Attack Vector: Tactical")_.

Many authors have either used a [galaxy-spanning fictional empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_empire "Galactic empire") as background or written about the growth and/or decline of such an empire. Said empire's capital is often a core world, such as a planet relatively close to a galaxy's supermassive black hole. Characterization can vary wildly from malevolent forces attacking sympathetic victims to apathetic bureaucracies to more reasonable entities focused on social progress, and anywhere in between. Scifi writers generally posit some form of [faster-than-light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light "Faster-than-light") drive in order to facilitate [interstellar war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_war "Interstellar war"). Writers such as [Larry Niven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Niven "Larry Niven") have developed plausible interplanetary conflict based on human colonization of the [asteroid belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt "Asteroid belt") and outer planets via technologies using currently known physics.
