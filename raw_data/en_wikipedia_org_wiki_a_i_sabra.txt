He died December 18, 2013. Sabra provided English translation and commentary for Books I-III [ 1 ] of Ibn al-Haytham 's seven book Kitab al-Manazir ( Book of Optics ), written in Arabic in the 11th century.

Sabra received his undergraduate degree at the University of Alexandria . He then studied philosophy of science with Karl Popper at the University of London , where he received a PhD in 1955 for a thesis on optics in the 17th century. He taught at the University of Alexandria 1955–62, at the Warburg Institute 1962–72, and at Harvard University from 1972 until he retired in 1996.

In his article on "The Appropriation and Subsequent Naturalization of Greek Science in Medieval Islam", he argued, against the theories of Pierre Duhem , that Islamic cultures did not passively receive and preserve ancient Greek science, but actively "appropriated" and modified it.

[ 2 ] In 2005 he was awarded the Sarton Medal for lifetime achievement in the history of science by the History of Science Society .
