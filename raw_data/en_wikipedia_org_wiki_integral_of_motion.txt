However, it is a mathematical constraint , the natural consequence of the equations of motion , rather than a physical constraint (which would require extra constraint forces ).  Common examples include energy , linear momentum , angular momentum and the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector (for inverse-square force laws ).

Applications [ edit ] Constants of motion are useful because they allow properties of the motion to be derived without solving the equations of motion .  In fortunate cases, even the trajectory of the motion can be derived as the intersection of isosurfaces corresponding to the constants of motion.  For example, Poinsot's construction shows that the torque-free rotation of a rigid body is the intersection of a sphere (conservation of total angular momentum) and an ellipsoid (conservation of energy), a trajectory that might be otherwise hard to derive and visualize.  Therefore, the identification of constants of motion is an important objective in mechanics .

Methods for identifying constants of motion [ edit ] There are several methods for identifying constants of motion.

The simplest but least systematic approach is the intuitive ("psychic") derivation, in which a quantity is hypothesized to be constant (perhaps because of experimental data ) and later shown mathematically to be conserved throughout the motion.

The Hamilton–Jacobi equations provide a commonly used and straightforward method for identifying constants of motion, particularly when the Hamiltonian adopts recognizable functional forms in orthogonal coordinates .

Another approach is to recognize that a conserved quantity corresponds to a symmetry of the Lagrangian .

Noether's theorem provides a systematic way of deriving such quantities from the symmetry.  For example, conservation of energy results from the invariance of the Lagrangian under shifts in the origin of time , conservation of linear momentum results from the invariance of the Lagrangian under shifts in the origin of space ( translational symmetry ) and conservation of angular momentum results from the invariance of the Lagrangian under rotations .  The converse is also true; every symmetry of the Lagrangian corresponds to a constant of motion, often called a conserved charge or current .

A quantity A {\displaystyle A} is a constant of the motion if its total time derivative is zero 0 = d A d t = ∂ ∂ A ∂ ∂ t + { A , H } , {\displaystyle 0={\frac {dA}{dt}}={\frac {\partial A}{\partial t}}+\{A,H\},} which occurs when A {\displaystyle A} 's Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian equals minus its partial derivative with respect to time [ 1 ] ∂ ∂ A ∂ ∂ t = − − { A , H } .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial A}{\partial t}}=-\{A,H\}.} Another useful result is Poisson's theorem , which states that if two quantities A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} are constants of motion, so is their Poisson bracket { A , B } {\displaystyle \{A,B\}} .

A system with n degrees of freedom, and n constants of motion, such that the Poisson bracket of any pair of constants of motion vanishes, is known as a completely integrable system . Such a collection of constants of motion are said to be in involution with each other. For a closed system ( Lagrangian not explicitly dependent on time), the energy of the system is a constant of motion (a conserved quantity ).

In quantum mechanics [ edit ] An observable quantity Q will be a constant of motion if it commutes with the Hamiltonian , H , and it does not itself depend explicitly on time.  This is because d d t ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | Q | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ = − − 1 i ℏ ℏ ⟨ ψ ψ | [ H , Q ] | ψ ψ ⟩ + ⟨ ψ ψ | d Q d t | ψ ψ ⟩ {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\langle \psi |Q|\psi \rangle =-{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\left\langle \psi \right|\left[H,Q\right]\left|\psi \right\rangle +\left\langle \psi \right|{\frac {dQ}{dt}}\left|\psi \right\rangle \,} where [ H , Q ] = H Q − − Q H {\displaystyle [H,Q]=HQ-QH\,} is the commutator relation.

Derivation [ edit ] Say there is some observable quantity Q which depends on position, momentum and time, Q = Q ( x , p , t ) {\displaystyle Q=Q(x,p,t)} And also, that there is a wave function which obeys Schrödinger's equation i ℏ ℏ ∂ ∂ ψ ψ ∂ ∂ t = H ψ ψ .

{\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial t}}=H\psi .} Taking the time derivative of the expectation value of Q requires use of the product rule , and results in d d t ⟨ Q ⟩ = d d t ⟨ ψ ψ | Q | ψ ψ ⟩ = ( d d t ⟨ ψ ψ | ) Q | ψ ψ ⟩ + ⟨ ψ ψ | d Q d t | ψ ψ ⟩ + ⟨ ψ ψ | Q ( d d t | ψ ψ ⟩ ) = − − 1 i ℏ ℏ ⟨ H ψ ψ | Q | ψ ψ ⟩ + ⟨ ψ ψ | d Q d t | ψ ψ ⟩ + 1 i ℏ ℏ ⟨ ψ ψ | Q | H ψ ψ ⟩ = − − 1 i ℏ ℏ ⟨ ψ ψ | H Q | ψ ψ ⟩ + ⟨ ψ ψ | d Q d t | ψ ψ ⟩ + 1 i ℏ ℏ ⟨ ψ ψ | Q H | ψ ψ ⟩ = − − 1 i ℏ ℏ ⟨ ψ ψ | [ H , Q ] | ψ ψ ⟩ + ⟨ ψ ψ | d Q d t | ψ ψ ⟩ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {d}{dt}}\left\langle Q\right\rangle &={\frac {d}{dt}}\left\langle \psi \right|Q\left|\psi \right\rangle \\[1ex]&=\left({\frac {d}{dt}}\left\langle \psi \right|\right)Q\left|\psi \right\rangle +\left\langle \psi \right|{\frac {dQ}{dt}}\left|\psi \right\rangle +\left\langle \psi \right|Q\left({\frac {d}{dt}}\left|\psi \right\rangle \right)\\[1ex]&=-{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\left\langle H\psi \right|Q\left|\psi \right\rangle +\left\langle \psi \right|{\frac {dQ}{dt}}\left|\psi \right\rangle +{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\left\langle \psi \right|Q\left|H\psi \right\rangle \\[1ex]&=-{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\left\langle \psi \right|HQ\left|\psi \right\rangle +\left\langle \psi \right|{\frac {dQ}{dt}}\left|\psi \right\rangle +{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\left\langle \psi \right|QH\left|\psi \right\rangle \\[1ex]&=-{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\left\langle \psi \right|\left[H,Q\right]\left|\psi \right\rangle +\left\langle \psi \right|{\frac {dQ}{dt}}\left|\psi \right\rangle \end{aligned}}} So finally, d d t ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | Q | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ = − − 1 i ℏ ℏ ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | [ H , Q ] | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ + ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | d Q d t | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\langle \psi |Q|\psi \rangle ={\frac {-1}{i\hbar }}\langle \psi |\left[H,Q\right]|\psi \rangle +\langle \psi |{\frac {dQ}{dt}}|\psi \rangle \,} Comment [ edit ] For an arbitrary state of a Quantum Mechanical system, if H and Q commute,  i.e. if [ H , Q ] = 0 {\displaystyle \left[H,Q\right]=0} and Q is not explicitly dependent on time, then d d t ⟨ ⟨ Q ⟩ ⟩ = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\langle Q\rangle =0} But if ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian, then even if [ H , Q ] ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \left[H,Q\right]\neq 0} it is still the case that d d t ⟨ ⟨ Q ⟩ ⟩ = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\langle Q\rangle =0} provided Q is independent of time.

Derivation [ edit ] d d t ⟨ ⟨ Q ⟩ ⟩ = − − 1 i ℏ ℏ ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | [ H , Q ] | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ = − − 1 i ℏ ℏ ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | ( H Q − − Q H ) | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\langle Q\rangle =-{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\langle \psi |\left[H,Q\right]|\psi \rangle =-{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\langle \psi |\left(HQ-QH\right)|\psi \rangle } Since H | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ = E | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle H|\psi \rangle =E|\psi \rangle \,} then d d t ⟨ ⟨ Q ⟩ ⟩ = − − 1 i ℏ ℏ ( E ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | Q | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ − − E ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | Q | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {d}{dt}}\langle Q\rangle &=-{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\left(E\langle \psi |Q|\psi \rangle -E\langle \psi |Q|\psi \rangle \right)\\[1ex]&=0\end{aligned}}} This is the reason why eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are also called stationary states.

Relevance for quantum chaos [ edit ] In general, an integrable system has constants of motion other than the energy. By contrast, energy is the only constant of motion in a non-integrable system ; such systems are termed chaotic. In general, a classical mechanical system can be quantized only if it is integrable; as of 2025, there is no known consistent method for quantizing chaotic dynamical systems.

Integral of motion [ edit ] A constant of motion may be defined in a given force field as any function of phase-space coordinates (position and velocity, or position and momentum) and time that is constant throughout a trajectory. A subset of the constants of motion are the integrals of motion , or first integrals , defined as any functions of only the phase-space coordinates that are constant along an orbit. Every integral of motion is a constant of motion, but the converse is not true because a constant of motion may depend on time.

[ 2 ] Examples of integrals of motion are the angular momentum vector, L = x × × v {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {x} \times \mathbf {v} } , or a Hamiltonian without time dependence, such as H ( x , v ) = 1 2 v 2 + Φ Φ ( x ) {\textstyle H(\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {v} )={\frac {1}{2}}v^{2}+\Phi (\mathbf {x} )} . An example of a function that is a constant of motion but not an integral of motion would be the function C ( x , v , t ) = x − − v t {\displaystyle C(x,v,t)=x-vt} for an object moving at a constant speed in one dimension.

Dirac observables [ edit ] In order to extract physical information from gauge theories , one either constructs gauge invariant observables or fixes a gauge. In a canonical language, this usually means either constructing functions which Poisson-commute on the constraint surface with the gauge generating first class constraints or to fix the flow of the latter by singling out points within each gauge orbit . Such gauge invariant observables are thus the `constants of motion' of the gauge generators and referred to as Dirac observables.
