For the usage in astronomy, see mean radius (astronomy) .

In applied sciences , the equivalent radius (or mean radius ) is the radius of a circle or sphere with the same perimeter, area, or volume of a non-circular or non-spherical object. The equivalent diameter (or mean diameter ) ( D {\displaystyle D} ) is twice the equivalent radius.

Perimeter equivalent [ edit ] Measurement of tree circumference, the tape calibrated to show diameter, at breast height. The tape assumes a circular shape.

The perimeter of a circle of radius R is 2 π π R {\displaystyle 2\pi R} . Given the perimeter of a non-circular object P , one can calculate its perimeter-equivalent radius by setting P = 2 π π R eq {\displaystyle P=2\pi R_{\text{eq}}} or, alternatively: R eq = P 2 π π {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}={\frac {P}{2\pi }}} For example, a square of side L has a perimeter of 4 L {\displaystyle 4L} . Setting that perimeter to be equal to that of a circle imply that R eq = 2 L π π ≈ ≈ 0.6366 L {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}={\frac {2L}{\pi }}\approx 0.6366L} Applications: US hat size is the circumference of the head, measured in inches, divided by pi , rounded to the nearest 1/8 inch. This corresponds to the 1D mean diameter.

[ 1 ] Diameter at breast height is the circumference of tree trunk , measured at height of 4.5 feet, divided by pi. This corresponds to the 1D mean diameter. It can be measured directly by a girthing tape .

[ 2 ] Area equivalent [ edit ] The area-equivalent radius of a 2D object is the radius of a circle with the same area as the object Cross sectional area of a trapezoidal open channel, red highlights the wetted perimeter , where water is in contact with the channel. The hydraulic diameter is the equivalent circular configuration with the same circumference as the wetted perimeter.

The area of a circle of radius R is π π R 2 {\displaystyle \pi R^{2}} . Given the area of a non-circular object A , one can calculate its area-equivalent radius by setting A = π π R eq 2 {\displaystyle A=\pi R_{\text{eq}}^{2}} or, alternatively: R eq = A π π {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}={\sqrt {\frac {A}{\pi }}}} Often the area considered is that of a cross section .

For example, a square of side length L has an area of L 2 {\displaystyle L^{2}} . Setting that area to be equal that of a circle imply that R eq = 1 π π L ≈ ≈ 0.3183 L {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}={\sqrt {\frac {1}{\pi }}}L\approx 0.3183L} Similarly, an ellipse with semi-major axis a {\displaystyle a} and semi-minor axis b {\displaystyle b} has mean radius R eq = a ⋅ ⋅ b {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}={\sqrt {a\cdot b}}} .

For a circle, where a = b {\displaystyle a=b} , this simplifies to R eq = a {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}=a} .

Applications: The hydraulic diameter is similarly defined as 4 times the cross-sectional area of a pipe A , divided by its "wetted" perimeter P . For a circular pipe of radius R , at full flow, this is D H = 4 π π R 2 2 π π R = 2 R {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}={\frac {4\pi R^{2}}{2\pi R}}=2R} as one would expect. This is equivalent to the above definition of the 2D mean diameter. However, for historical reasons, the hydraulic radius is defined as the cross-sectional area of a pipe A , divided by its wetted perimeter P , which leads to D H = 4 R H {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}=4R_{\text{H}}} , and the hydraulic radius is half of the 2D mean radius.

[ 3 ] In aggregate classification, the equivalent diameter is the "diameter of a circle with an equal aggregate sectional area", which is calculated by D = 2 A π π {\displaystyle D=2{\sqrt {\frac {A}{\pi }}}} . It is used in many digital image processing programs.

[ 4 ] Volume equivalent [ edit ] Further information: Mean radius (astronomy) and Equivalent spherical diameter A sphere (top), rotational ellipsoid (left) and triaxial ellipsoid (right) The volume of a sphere of radius R is 4 3 π π R 3 {\displaystyle {\frac {4}{3}}\pi R^{3}} . Given the volume of a non-spherical object V , one can calculate its volume-equivalent radius by setting V = 4 3 π π R eq 3 {\displaystyle V={\frac {4}{3}}\pi R_{\text{eq}}^{3}} or, alternatively: R eq = 3 V 4 π π 3 {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}={\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {3V}{4\pi }}}} For example, a cube of side length L has a volume of L 3 {\displaystyle L^{3}} . Setting that volume to be equal that of a sphere imply that R eq = 3 4 π π 3 L ≈ ≈ 0.6204 L {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}={\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {3}{4\pi }}}L\approx 0.6204L} Similarly, a tri-axial ellipsoid with axes a {\displaystyle a} , b {\displaystyle b} and c {\displaystyle c} has mean radius R eq = a ⋅ ⋅ b ⋅ ⋅ c 3 {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}={\sqrt[{3}]{a\cdot b\cdot c}}} .

[ 5 ] The formula for a rotational ellipsoid is the special case where a = b {\displaystyle a=b} . Likewise, an oblate spheroid or rotational ellipsoid with axes a {\displaystyle a} and c {\displaystyle c} has a mean radius of R eq = a 2 ⋅ ⋅ c 3 {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}={\sqrt[{3}]{a^{2}\cdot c}}} .

[ 6 ] For a sphere, where a = b = c {\displaystyle a=b=c} , this simplifies to R eq = a {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}=a} .

Applications: For planet Earth , which can be approximated as an oblate spheroid with radii 6 378 .1 km and 6 356 .8 km , the 3D mean radius is R = 6378.1 2 ⋅ ⋅ 6356.8 3 = 6371.0 km {\displaystyle R={\sqrt[{3}]{6378.1^{2}\cdot 6356.8}}=6371.0{\text{ km}}} .

[ 6 ] Other equivalences [ edit ] Surface-area equivalent radius [ edit ] See also: authalic radius The surface area of a sphere of radius R is 4 π π R 2 {\displaystyle 4\pi R^{2}} . Given the surface area of a non-spherical object A , one can calculate its surface area-equivalent radius by setting 4 π π R eq 2 = A {\displaystyle 4\pi R_{\text{eq}}^{2}=A} or equivalently R eq = A 4 π π {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}={\sqrt {\frac {A}{4\pi }}}} For example, a cube of length L has a surface area of 6 L 2 {\displaystyle 6L^{2}} .  A cube therefore has an surface area-equivalent radius of R eq = 6 L 2 4 π π = 0.6910 L {\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}={\sqrt {\frac {6L^{2}}{4\pi }}}=0.6910L} Curvature-equivalent radius [ edit ] An osculating circle The osculating circle and osculating sphere define curvature -equivalent radii at a particular point of tangency for plane figures and solid figures, respectively.
