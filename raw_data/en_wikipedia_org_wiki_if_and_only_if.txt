In [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and related fields such as [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), "**if and only if**" (often shortened as "**iff**") is paraphrased by the [biconditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconditional "Biconditional"), a [logical connective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective "Logical connective")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-1) between statements. The biconditional is true in two cases, where either both statements are true or both are false. The connective is [biconditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconditional "Biconditional") (a statement of **material equivalence**),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-2) and can be likened to the standard [material conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional "Material conditional") ("only if", equal to "if ... then") combined with its reverse ("if"); hence the name. The result is that the truth of either one of the connected statements requires the truth of the other (i.e. either both statements are true, or both are false), though it is controversial whether the connective thus defined is properly rendered by the English "if and only if"—with its pre-existing meaning. For example, _P if and only if Q_ means that _P_ is true whenever _Q_ is true, and the only case in which _P_ is true is if _Q_ is also true, whereas in the case of _P if Q_, there could be other scenarios where _P_ is true and _Q_ is false.

In writing, phrases commonly used as alternatives to P "if and only if" Q include: _Q is [necessary and sufficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary\_and\_sufficient\_conditions#Simultaneous\_necessity\_and\_sufficiency "Necessary and sufficient conditions") for P_, _for P it is necessary and sufficient that Q_, _P is equivalent (or materially equivalent) to Q_ (compare with [material implication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional "Material conditional")), _P precisely if Q_, _P precisely (or exactly) when Q_, _P exactly in case Q_, and _P just in case Q_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-3) Some authors regard "iff" as unsuitable in formal writing;[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-4) others consider it a "borderline case" and tolerate its use.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-5) In [logical formulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_(mathematical_logic) "Formula (mathematical logic)"), logical symbols, such as ![Image 1: {\displaystyle \leftrightarrow }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/046b918c43e05caf6624fe9b676c69ec9cd6b892) and ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/64812e13399c20cf3ce94e049d3bb2d85f26abcf),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-:2-6) are used instead of these phrases; see [§Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#Notation) below.

It is equivalent to that produced by the [XNOR gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNOR_gate "XNOR gate"), and opposite to that produced by the [XOR gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate "XOR gate").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-9)

The corresponding logical symbols are "![Image 21: {\displaystyle \leftrightarrow }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/046b918c43e05caf6624fe9b676c69ec9cd6b892)", "![Image 22: {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/64812e13399c20cf3ce94e049d3bb2d85f26abcf)",[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-:2-6) and ![Image 23: {\displaystyle \equiv }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c5c34250859b6f6d2a77b4e8a2ceaa90638076d),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-10) and sometimes "iff". These are usually treated as equivalent. However, some texts of [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic") (particularly those on [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic"), rather than [propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic")) make a distinction between these, in which the first, ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \leftrightarrow }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/046b918c43e05caf6624fe9b676c69ec9cd6b892), is used as a symbol in logic formulas, while ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/64812e13399c20cf3ce94e049d3bb2d85f26abcf) or ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \equiv }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c5c34250859b6f6d2a77b4e8a2ceaa90638076d) is used in reasoning about those logic formulas (e.g., in [metalogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalogic "Metalogic")). In [Łukasiewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_%C5%81ukasiewicz "Jan Łukasiewicz")'s [Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation "Polish notation"), it is the prefix symbol ![Image 27: {\displaystyle E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-11)

Another term for the [logical connective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective "Logical connective"), i.e., the symbol in logic formulas, is [exclusive nor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_nor "Exclusive nor").

In [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX "TeX"), "if and only if" is shown as a long double arrow: ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \iff }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff942842a50b24e7585cc42c5b50c34650e3aa99) via command \iff or \Longleftrightarrow.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-12)

In most [logical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_system "Logical system"), one [proves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory "Proof theory") a statement of the form "P iff Q" by proving either "if P, then Q" and "if Q, then P", or "if P, then Q" and "if not-P, then not-Q". Proving these pairs of statements sometimes leads to a more natural proof, since there are not obvious conditions in which one would infer a biconditional directly. An alternative is to prove the [disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunction "Disjunction") "(P and Q) or (not-P and not-Q)", which itself can be inferred directly from either of its disjuncts—that is, because "iff" is [truth-functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth-function "Truth-function"), "P iff Q" follows if P and Q have been shown to be both true, or both false.

### Origin of iff and pronunciation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=If_and_only_if&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Origin of iff and pronunciation")]

Usage of the abbreviation "iff" first appeared in print in [John L. Kelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L._Kelley "John L. Kelley")'s 1955 book _General Topology_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-13) Its invention is often credited to [Paul Halmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Halmos "Paul Halmos"), who wrote "I invented 'iff,' for 'if and only if'—but I could never believe I was really its first inventor."[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-Higham1998-14)

It is somewhat unclear how "iff" was meant to be pronounced. In current practice, the single 'word' "iff" is almost always read as the four words "if and only if". However, in the preface of _General Topology_, Kelley suggests that it should be read differently: "In some cases where mathematical content requires 'if and only if' and [euphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphony "Euphony") demands something less I use Halmos' 'iff'". The authors of one discrete mathematics textbook suggest:[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-15) "Should you need to pronounce iff, really [hang on to the 'ff'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_gemination "Consonant gemination") so that people hear the difference from 'if'", implying that "iff" could be pronounced as [ɪfː].

### Usage in definitions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=If_and_only_if&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Usage in definitions")]

Conventionally, [definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions "Definitions") are "if and only if" statements; some texts — such as Kelley's _General Topology_ — follow this convention, and use "if and only if" or _iff_ in definitions of new terms.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-16) However, this usage of "if and only if" is relatively uncommon and overlooks the linguistic fact that the "if" of a definition is interpreted as meaning "if and only if". The majority of textbooks, research papers and articles (including English Wikipedia articles) follow the linguistic convention of interpreting "if" as "if and only if" whenever a mathematical definition is involved (as in "a topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-17) Moreover, in the case of a [recursive definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition#recursive_definitions "Definition"), the _only if_ half of the definition is interpreted as a sentence in the metalanguage stating that the sentences in the definition of a predicate are the _only sentences_ determining the extension of the predicate.

In terms of Euler diagrams
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=If_and_only_if&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: In terms of Euler diagrams")]

*   [![Image 29: A is a proper subset of B. A number is in A only if it is in B; a number is in B if it is in A.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Example_of_A_is_a_proper_subset_of_B.svg/250px-Example_of_A_is_a_proper_subset_of_B.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Example_of_A_is_a_proper_subset_of_B.svg "A is a proper subset of B. A number is in A only if it is in B; a number is in B if it is in A.")

_A_ is a proper subset of _B_. A number is in _A_ only if it is in _B_; a number is in _B_ if it is in _A_.

*   [![Image 30: C is a subset but not a proper subset of B. A number is in B if and only if it is in C, and a number is in C if and only if it is in B.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Example_of_C_is_no_proper_subset_of_B.svg/250px-Example_of_C_is_no_proper_subset_of_B.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Example_of_C_is_no_proper_subset_of_B.svg "C is a subset but not a proper subset of B. A number is in B if and only if it is in C, and a number is in C if and only if it is in B.")

_C_ is a subset but not a proper subset of _B_. A number is in _B_ if and only if it is in _C_, and a number is in _C_ if and only if it is in _B_.

[Euler diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram "Euler diagram") show logical relationships among events, properties, and so forth. "P only if Q", "if P then Q", and "P→Q" all mean that P is a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset"), either proper or improper, of Q. "P if Q", "if Q then P", and Q→P all mean that Q is a proper or improper subset of P. "P if and only if Q" and "Q if and only if P" both mean that the sets P and Q are identical to each other.

_Iff_ is used outside the field of logic as well. Wherever logic is applied, especially in [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") discussions, it has the same meaning as above: it is an abbreviation for _if and only if_, indicating that one statement is both [necessary and sufficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions "Necessary and sufficient conditions") for the other. This is an example of [mathematical jargon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_jargon "Mathematical jargon") (although, as noted above, _if_ is more often used than _iff_ in statements of definition).

The elements of _X_ are _all and only_ the elements of _Y_ means: "For any _z_ in the [domain of discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse "Domain of discourse"), _z_ is in _X_ if and only if _z_ is in _Y_."

When "if" means "if and only if"
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=If_and_only_if&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: When \"if\" means \"if and only if\"")]

In their _[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_Intelligence:\_A\_Modern\_Approach "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach")_, [Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell "Stuart J. Russell") and [Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig "Peter Norvig") note (page 282),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-Russell_Norvig_1995_2020-18) in effect, that it is often more natural to express _if and only if_ as _if_ together with a "database (or logic programming) semantics". They give the example of the English sentence "Richard has two brothers, Geoffrey and John".

In a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database "Database") or [logic program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming "Logic programming"), this could be represented simply by two sentences:

Brother(Richard, Geoffrey).Brother(Richard, John).
The database semantics interprets the database (or program) as containing _all_ and _only_ the knowledge relevant for problem solving in a given domain. It interprets _only if_ as expressing in the metalanguage that the sentences in the database represent the _only_ knowledge that should be considered when drawing conclusions from the database.

In [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic") (FOL) with the standard semantics, the same English sentence would need to be represented, using _if and only if_, with _only if_ interpreted in the object language, in some such form as:

![Image 31: {\displaystyle \forall }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bfc1a1a9c4c0f8d5df989c98aa2773ed657c5937) X(Brother(Richard, X) iff X = Geoffrey or X = John).Geoffrey ≠ John.
Compared with the standard semantics for FOL, the database semantics has a more efficient implementation. Instead of reasoning with sentences of the form:

_conclusion iff conditions_
it uses sentences of the form:

_conclusion if conditions_
to [reason forwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_chaining "Forward chaining") from _conditions_ to _conclusions_ or [backwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_chaining "Backward chaining") from _conclusions_ to _conditions_.

The database semantics is analogous to the legal principle [expressio unius est exclusio alterius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressio_unius_est_exclusio_alterius "Expressio unius est exclusio alterius") (the express mention of one thing excludes all others). Moreover, it underpins the application of logic programming to the representation of legal texts and legal reasoning.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if#cite_note-19)
