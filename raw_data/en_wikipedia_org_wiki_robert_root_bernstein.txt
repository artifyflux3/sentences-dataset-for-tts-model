In 1981, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship , commonly known as a "genius grant".

He has also researched and consulted on creativity for more than fifteen years. Among other books, he has authored Sparks of Genius: The Thirteen Thinking Tools of the World's Most Creative People , Discovering: Inventing and Solving Problems at the Frontiers of Scientific Knowledge , and Rethinking AIDS: The Tragic Cost of Premature Consensus.

In Rethinking AIDS , Root-Bernstein postulated that factors in addition to HIV may contribute to AIDS . Root-Bernstein is a former member of the Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis , a group of AIDS denialists .

Root-Bernstein asserts that HIV, while involved in the development of AIDS, may be no more important than an accumulation of co-factors such as a history of poor nutrition, lack of hygiene, intravenous drug use, anal intercourse, as well as various infections and lifestyle diseases. In its April 2004 issue, POZ published a quote it attributed to Root-Bernstein: "Both the camp that says HIV is a pussycat and the people who claim AIDS is all HIV are wrong ... The denialists make claims that are clearly inconsistent with existing studies. When I check the existing studies, I don't agree with the interpretation of the data, or, worse, I can't find the studies [at all]." [ 1 ] [ unreliable source?
