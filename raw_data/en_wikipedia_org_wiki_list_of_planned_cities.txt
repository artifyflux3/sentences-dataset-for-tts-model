Most of these were, indeed, railway towns, founded after surveying and planning by the powerful railway companies during construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway , Canada's first transcontinental line, or the Canadian National Railway , but this initial start generally only provided one or two streets with a few lots set out, from which the cities grew unplanned.
