Bipolar disorder NOS is sometimes referred to as subthreshold bipolar disorder.

[ 1 ] Classification [ edit ] BD-NOS is a mood disorder and one of four subtypes on the bipolar spectrum, which also includes bipolar I disorder , bipolar II disorder , and cyclothymia .

[ 1 ] BD-NOS was a classification in the DSM-IV and has since been changed to Bipolar "Other Specified" and "Unspecified" in the 2013 released DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). BD-NOS is a disorder which creates intense mood instability which causes bouts of depression, hypomania, and mania, and occasionally mood stability.

Diagnosis [ edit ] Bipolar disorder is difficult to diagnose.

[ 2 ] If a person displays some symptoms of bipolar disorder but not others, the clinician may diagnose bipolar NOS.  The diagnosis of bipolar NOS is indicated when there is a rapid change (days) between manic and depressive symptoms and can also include recurring episodes of hypomania .  Bipolar NOS may be diagnosed when it is difficult to tell whether bipolar is the primary disorder due to another general medical condition, such as a substance use disorder. A diagnosis of this condition can be challenging and is often imprecise.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Treatment [ edit ] Individual approaches to treatment are recommended, usually involving a combination of mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics .

[ 5 ] Psychotherapy may be beneficial and should be started early.

[ 5 ] Epidemiology [ edit ] The prevalence of BD-NOS is 1.4%.
