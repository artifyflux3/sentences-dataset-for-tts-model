Nancy Cartwright, Lady Hampshire FBA , FAcSS (born 24 June 1944) [ 2 ] is an American philosopher of science . She is a professor of philosophy at the University of California at San Diego and the University of Durham . Currently, she is the past president of the Division for Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science and Technology (DLMPST) of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science and Technology under the International Science Council (ISC).

Education and career [ edit ] Cartwright earned her BSc from the University of Pittsburgh in mathematics and her Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Illinois at Chicago (Congress Circle campus). Her thesis was on the concept of mixture in quantum mechanics. Before taking her current appointments, she taught at the University of Maryland , Stanford University and the London School of Economics . She has held visiting appointments at the University of Oslo , Princeton University , Caltech , the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Cambridge and UCLA . She is currently Tsing Hua Honorary Distinguished Chair Professor at the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan and visiting research fellow at Ca' Foscari University in Venice. She co-founded the Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science (CPNSS) at the LSE and the Centre for Humanities Engaging Science and Society (CHESS) at the University of Durham .

Cartwright has mentored several students in England and the United States who have gone on to become professional philosophers of science, including Naomi Oreskes , Mauricio Suarez , Roman Frigg , Jeremy Howick , Peter Menzies , and Hasok Chang . She was also a supervisor of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi , a subsequent source of controversy.

[ 3 ] Cartwright was married to the philosopher Stuart Hampshire until his death in 2004. She was also previously married to the philosopher Ian Hacking . She has two daughters, Emily and Sophie Hampshire Cartwright, and two granddaughters, Lucy Charlton and Tabitha Emily Cartwright Spray.

[ 4 ] Philosophical work [ edit ] Cartwright's approach to the philosophy of science is associated with the " Stanford School " of Patrick Suppes , John Dupré , Peter Galison and Ian Hacking . It is characterized by an emphasis on scientific practice as opposed to abstract scientific theories. Cartwright has made important contributions to debates on laws of nature , causation and causal inference , scientific models in the natural and social sciences, objectivity and the unity of science . Her recent work focuses on evidence and its use in informing policy decisions.

Carl Hoefer describes Cartwright's philosophy in the following terms: [ 5 ] Nancy Cartwright's philosophy of science is, in her view, a form of empiricism but empiricism in the style of Neurath and Mill , rather than of Hume or Carnap . Her concerns are not with the problems of skepticism , induction , or demarcation ; she is concerned with how actual science achieves the successes it does, and what sort of metaphysical and epistemological presuppositions are needed to understand that success.

Cartwright, like many working scientists themselves, takes a rather pragmatic/realist stance toward observations and interventions made by scientists and engineers and particularly toward their connections to causality: Scientists see impurities causing signal loss in a cable, and they stimulate an inverted population, causing it to lase. Given these starting points, there can be no question of a skeptical attitude toward causation , in either singular or generic form. The fundamental role (or better, roles) played by causation in scientific practice is undeniable; what Cartwright does, then, is reconfigure empiricism from the ground up based on this insight. In the reconfiguration process, many mainstays of the received view of science take a beating; especially [...] the fundamentality of laws of nature .

Honors and awards [ edit ] Cartwright, c1990s Cartwright served as the president of the Philosophy of Science Association (2009–10), [ 6 ] as vice-president (2007–8) and president (2008–9) of the Pacific Division of the American Philosophical Association , [ 7 ] and was elected to be president of the Division for Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science and Technology from 2020 to 2023.

[ 10 ] She has received honorary degrees from Southern Methodist University and the University of St Andrews as well as a MacArthur Fellowship .

[ 14 ] The lectures were published in 2019 alongside additional essays under the title Nature, the Artful Modeler: Lectures on Laws, Science, How Nature Arranges the World and How We Can Arrange It Better .
