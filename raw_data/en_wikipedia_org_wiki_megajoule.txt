The **joule** ( [_JOOL_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"), or [_JOWL_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"); symbol: **J**) is the unit of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") in the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-1) In terms of [SI base units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_units "SI base units"), one joule corresponds to one [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram")-[metre squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre") per [second squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second")(1 J = 1 kg⋅m 2⋅s−2). One joule is equal to the amount of [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") done when a force of one [newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) "Newton (unit)") displaces a [body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_(physics) "Body (physics)") through a distance of one [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre") in the direction of that force. It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") of one [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere") passes through a [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance "Electrical resistance and conductance") of one [ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm "Ohm") for one second. It is named after the English physicist [James Prescott Joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule "James Prescott Joule") (1818–1889).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-4)

According to the [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures") the joule is defined as "the work done when the point of application of 1 [MKS unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_units "MKS units") of force [newton] moves a distance of 1 metre in the direction of the force."[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-5)

One joule is also equivalent to any of the following:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-7)

*   The work required to move an [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") of one [coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb "Coulomb") through an [electrical potential difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage") of one volt, or one coulomb-volt (C⋅V). This relationship can be used to define the volt.
*   The work required to produce one watt of [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics) "Power (physics)") for one second, or one watt-second (W⋅s) (compare [kilowatt-hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour "Kilowatt-hour"), which is 3.6 megajoules). This relationship can be used to define the watt.

The joule is named after [James Prescott Joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule "James Prescott Joule"). As with every [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") unit named after a person, its symbol starts with an [upper case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_case "Upper case") letter (J), but when written in full, it follows the rules for capitalisation of a [common noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_noun "Common noun"); i.e., _joule_ becomes capitalised at the beginning of a sentence and in titles but is otherwise in lower case.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-8)

The [CGS system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGS_system "CGS system") had been declared official in 1881, at the first [International Electrical Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrical_Congress "International Electrical Congress"). The [erg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg "Erg") was adopted as its unit of energy in 1882. [Wilhelm Siemens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Siemens "Carl Wilhelm Siemens"), in his inauguration speech as chairman of the [British Association for the Advancement of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science "British Association for the Advancement of Science") (23 August 1882) first proposed the _joule_ as unit of [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat"), to be derived from the electromagnetic units [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere") and [ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm "Ohm"), in cgs units equivalent to 10 7 erg. The naming of the unit in honour of [James Prescott Joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule "James Prescott Joule") (1818–1889), at the time retired and aged 63, followed the recommendation of Siemens:

> Such a heat unit, if found acceptable, might with great propriety, I think, be called the Joule, after the man who has done so much to develop the dynamical theory of heat.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-9)

At the second International Electrical Congress, on 31 August 1889, the joule was officially adopted alongside the [watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt") and the _quadrant_ (later renamed to [henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_(unit) "Henry (unit)")).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-10) Joule died in the same year, on 11 October 1889. At the fourth congress (1893), the "international ampere" and "international ohm" were defined, with slight changes in the specifications for their measurement, with the "international joule" being the unit derived from them.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-11)

In 1935, the [International Electrotechnical Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission "International Electrotechnical Commission") (as the successor organisation of the International Electrical Congress) adopted the "[Giorgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Giorgi "Giovanni Giorgi") system", which by virtue of assuming a defined value for the [magnetic constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_constant "Magnetic constant") also implied a redefinition of the joule. The Giorgi system was approved by the [International Committee for Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures "International Committee for Weights and Measures") in 1946. The joule was now no longer defined based on electromagnetic unit, but instead as the unit of [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") performed by one unit of force (at the time not yet named [newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) "Newton (unit)")) over the distance of 1 [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre"). The joule was explicitly intended as the unit of energy to be used in both electromagnetic and mechanical contexts.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-12) The ratification of the definition at the ninth [General Conference on Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures "General Conference on Weights and Measures"), in 1948, added the specification that the joule was also to be preferred as the unit of [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat") in the context of [calorimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorimetry "Calorimetry"), thereby officially deprecating the use of the [calorie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie "Calorie").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-13) This is the definition declared in the modern [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") in 1960.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-14)

The definition of the joule as J=kg⋅m 2⋅s−2 has remained unchanged since 1946, but the joule as a derived unit has inherited changes in the definitions of the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") (in 1960 and 1967), the [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre") (in 1983) and the [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram") ([in 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_revision_of_the_SI "2019 revision of the SI")).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-15)

One joule represents (approximately):

*   The typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1/60 s (~16.6667[ms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond "Millisecond"), [basal metabolic rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate "Basal metabolic rate")); about 5,000[kJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilojoule "Kilojoule") (1,200[kcal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie "Calorie")) / day.
*   The amount of electricity required to run a 1[W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt") device for 1[s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second").
*   The energy required to accelerate a 1[kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram") mass at 1[m/s 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second_squared "Metre per second squared") through a distance of 1[m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre").
*   The [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") of a 2[kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram")[mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") travelling at 1[m/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second "Metre per second"), or a 1[kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram") mass travelling at 1.41[m/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second "Metre per second").
*   The energy required to lift an apple up 1 m, assuming the apple has a mass of 101.97 g.
*   The [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat") required to raise the temperature of 0.239 g of water from 0°C to 1°C.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-16)
*   The [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") of a 50 kg human moving very slowly (0.2 m/s or 0.72 km/h).
*   The kinetic energy of a 56 g tennis ball moving at 6 m/s (22 km/h).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-17)
*   The food energy (kcal) in slightly more than half of an ordinary-sized sugar crystal (0.102[mg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milligram "Milligram")/crystal).

Newton-metre and torque
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joule&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Newton-metre and torque")]

In [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), the concept of [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") (in some direction) has a close analogue in the concept of [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque") (about some angle):[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-35)

| Linear | Angular |
| --- | --- |
| Force | Torque |
| [Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") | [Moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia "Moment of inertia") |
| Displacement | Angle |

A result of this similarity is that the SI unit for torque is the [newton-metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-metre "Newton-metre"), which works out [algebraically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") to have the same [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis") as the joule, but they are not interchangeable. The [General Conference on Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures "General Conference on Weights and Measures") has given the unit of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") the name _joule_, but has not given the unit of torque any special name, hence it is simply the newton-metre (N⋅m) – a compound name derived from its constituent parts.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-BIPM2-36) The use of newton-metres for torque but joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunication.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-BIPM2-36)

The distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)") quantity – the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") of a force [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") and a displacement vector. By contrast, torque is a vector – the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") of a force vector and a distance vector. Torque and energy are related to one another by the equation[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]![Image 6: {\displaystyle E=\tau \theta \,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5c17780b00a1e8e7e1706205dd69357162e7ce29)

where _E_ is energy, _τ_ is (the [vector magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#Euclidean_vector_space "Magnitude (mathematics)") of) torque, and _θ_ is the angle swept (in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian")). Since plane angles are dimensionless, it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

A **watt-second** (symbol **W s** or **W⋅s**) is a [derived unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_unit "Derived unit") of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") equivalent to the joule.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-37) The watt-second is the energy equivalent to the power of one [watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt") sustained for one [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"). While the watt-second is equivalent to the joule in both units and meaning, there are some contexts in which the term "watt-second" is used instead of "joule", such as in the rating of photographic [electronic flash units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(photography) "Flash (photography)").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule#cite_note-38)

Southampton. pp.1–33. pp.6–7: The unit of heat has hitherto been taken variously as the heat required to raise a pound of water at the freezing-point through 1°Fahrenheit or Centigrade, or, again, the heat necessary to raise a kilogramme of water 1°Centigrade. The inconvenience of a unit so entirely arbitrary is sufficiently apparent to justify the introduction of one based on the electro-magnetic system, viz. the heat generated in one second by the current of an Ampère flowing through the resistance of an Ohm. In absolute measure its value is 10 7 C.G.S. units, and, assuming Joule's equivalent as 42,000,000, it is the heat necessary to raise 0.238 grammes of water 1°Centigrade, or, approximately, the 1⁄1000 th part of the arbitrary unit of a pound of water raised 1°Fahrenheit and the 1⁄4000 th of the kilogramme of water raised 1°Centigrade. Such a heat unit, if found acceptable, might with great propriety, I think, be called the Joule, after the man who has done so much to develop the dynamical theory of heat.

A derived unit can often be expressed in different ways by combining base units with derived units having special names. Joule, for example, may formally be written newton metre, or kilogram metre squared per second squared. This, however, is an algebraic freedom to be governed by common sense physical considerations; in a given situation some forms may be more helpful than others. In practice, with certain quantities, preference is given to the use of certain special unit names, or combinations of unit names, to facilitate the distinction between different quantities having the same dimension.
