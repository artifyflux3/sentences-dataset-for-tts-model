In 2023, SpaceX launched 96 Falcon family vehicles—91 Falcon 9 and five Falcon Heavy rockets. It surpassed both the company's own single-year launch record of 61 and the global annual record of 64 launches, coming close to its previously announced goal of 100 Falcon launches in the year.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The company's payload delivery capacity also rose, with approximately 1,200 tonnes (2,600,000 lb) sent to orbit.

[ 5 ] It included six space tugs , also known as orbital transfer vehicles (OTV), which are two of D-Orbit 's ION Satellite Carriers , Epic Aerospace 's Chimera LEO 1 , Momentus 's Vigoride -5, Skykraft 's OTV and Launcher 's Orbiter SN1.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Orbiter SN1 failed shortly after deployment from Falcon and before deploying payloads. One of the payloads, EWS RROCI failed to deploy from Falcon 9 and the satellite re-entered with the upper stage.

[ 8 ] This was not a SpaceX failure as brokered dispensers and deployers are used on Transporter missions.

[ 9 ] 196 January 10, 2023 04:50 [ 10 ] F9 B5 B1076‑2 Cape Canaveral , SLC‑40 OneWeb 16 (40 satellites) 6,000 kg (13,000 lb) Polar LEO OneWeb Success Success ( LZ‑1 ) Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine , OneWeb suspended launches on Soyuz rockets.

[ 11 ] In March 2022, OneWeb announced that they had signed an agreement with SpaceX to resume satellite launches.

[ 12 ] This flight, the 16th of the OneWeb program and the second on a SpaceX rocket, carried 40 satellites.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] FH 5 January 15, 2023 22:56 [ 16 ] Falcon Heavy B5 B1070 (core) Kennedy , LC‑39A USSF-67 ( CBAS-2 & LDPE-3A ) ~3,750 kg (8,270 lb) GEO USSF Success No attempt B1064‑2 (side) Success ( LZ‑2 ) B1065‑2 (side) Success ( LZ‑1 ) First launch of Phase 2 US Air Force contract. US$316 million cost for the fiscal year of 2022, for the first flight, [ 17 ] mostly includes the cost of an extended payload fairing, upgrades to the company's West Coast launch pad at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California , and a vertical integration facility required for NRO missions, while the launching price does not increase.

[ 18 ] SpaceX deliberately expended the center core, which thus lacked grid fins and landing gear, while the two side-boosters were recovered at Landing Zones 1 and 2 , and it was the fourth second stage featuring Falcon long coast mission-extension kit as the mission requirements are same as the USSF-44 mission.

[ 19 ] 197 January 18, 2023 12:24 [ 20 ] F9 B5 B1077‑2 Cape Canaveral , SLC‑40 USA-343 (GPS-III SV06) 4,352 kg (9,595 lb) MEO USSF Success Success ( JRTI ) Global Positioning System navigation satellite, sixth GPS Block III satellite to be launched, named after Amelia Earhart .

[ 40 ] A fairing half on this mission was flown and recovered for a record 8th time.

[ 41 ] This launch marked a new pad turnaround record for SpaceX, launching 5 days, 3 hours and 38 minutes after the previous mission from SLC-40.

[ 42 ] 204 February 17, 2023 19:12 [ 39 ] F9 B5 B1063‑9 Vandenberg , SLC‑4E Starlink : Group 2-5 (51 satellites) 15,900 kg (35,100 lb) LEO SpaceX Success Success ( OCISLY ) Launch of 51 Starlink v1.5 satellites to a 570 km (350 mi) orbit at an inclination of 70° to expand internet constellation.

[ 45 ] This option could be used for launching Inmarsat-6B.

[ 46 ] In February 2022, Inmarsat confirmed Inmarsat-6 F2 will launch on a Falcon 9 rocket.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] The satellite reached the supersynchronous geostationary transfer orbit of 387 km × 41,592 km (240 mi × 25,844 mi) inclined at 27°.

[ 49 ] 206 February 27, 2023 23:13 [ 50 ] F9 B5 B1076‑3 Cape Canaveral , SLC‑40 Starlink : Group 6-1 (21 satellites) ~15,300 kg (33,700 lb) LEO SpaceX Success Success ( ASOG ) Launch of 21 Starlink v2 mini satellites to a 530 km (330 mi) orbit at an inclination of 43° to expand internet constellation.

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] This mission marked the debut of the v2 mini satellites, a smaller version of the planned v2 satellites, which are to launch on the future Starship. The v2 mini is 2.4 times the mass of its v1.5 predecessor but provides four times the data capacity.

[ 54 ] Unlike the v1.5, the tension rods that hold the v2 mini satellites together during launch, remain attached to the Falcon 9 second stage after deployment, reducing orbital debris.

[ 55 ] This flight marked the 100th consecutive landing success of a Falcon 9 booster since February 16, 2021.

Despite the landing being initially successful, the booster later tipped over during transit due to rough seas, high winds and waves, the stage was unable to be secured to the deck for recovery and later tipped over and was destroyed in transit. SpaceX has already equipped newer Falcon boosters with upgraded landing legs that have the capability to self-level and mitigate this type of issue.

SpaceX set a new record for the shortest time between two Falcon launches at 2 hours and 54 minutes. The previous record time was 4 hours and 12 minutes, set between the Starlink Group 2-8 and SES-18 & SES-19 missions on March 17, 2023.

Notable Launches [ edit ] Falcon 9 On April 15, 2023, Transporter 7 (F9-217) became the First Falcon 9 Block 5 launch to use a shortened second-stage nozzle.

On September 4, 2023, while launching Starlink Group 6-12 (F9-253), the Falcon 9 family broke the record for successful launches in a year (61) set by the R7 family in 1980 and matched by the Falcon 9 family the previous year.

On September 16, 2023, while launching Starlink Group 6-16 (F9-256), the Falcon 9 family broke the record for launches in a year (irrespective of launch outcome) (64) set by the R7 family in 1980 and matched by the Falcon 9 family the previous year.

Falcon Heavy The sixth flight of the Falcon Heavy (FH-6) launching ViaSat 3 F1 Americas was the first Falcon Heavy launch to expend the core and both side boosters.

Over half (five out of nine) of the Falcon Heavy launches by the end of 2023 had been launched that calendar year.

Reuse B1058 became the first booster to be recovered for the 16 th (F9-238) on July 10, 2023, 17 th (F9-257) on September 20, 2023, and 18 th (F9-269) on November 4, 2023. It was also the first booster to launch and land for a 19 th (F9-283) time before tipping over and being destroyed in transit to Port Canaveral.

SpaceX announced that fairing halves were being launched for the 8 th time on February 12, 2023 (F9-203), the 9 th time on May 4, 2023 (F9-221), the 10 th time on June 23, 2023 (F9-235), the 11 th time on August 11, 2023 (F9-246), the 12 th time on September 20, 2023 (F9-257), the 13 th time on November 4, 2023 (F9-269), and the 14 th time on December 3, 2023 (F9-279), Launch Cadence and Pad Turnaround SpaceX's monthly launch cadence for the Falcon 9 family reached eight launches per month for the first time in March, nine in May, and ten in September.

The shortest time between two Falcon 9 family launches set on 5 October 2022 at 7 hours and 10 minutes was reduced to 2 hours and 54 minutes by the end of the year.

The record for pad turnaround for SLC-40 of eight days set in April 2022 was reduced to 3 days, 21 hours, and 41 minutes with the August 7, 2023 launch of Starliner Group 6-8 (F9-244).
