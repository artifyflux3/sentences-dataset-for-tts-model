Strong mesocyclones show up as adjacent areas of yellow and blue (on other radars, bright red and bright green), and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado.

Starting in the mid-1900s, mobile radar vehicles were being used for academic and military research. In the late 1900s, mobile doppler weather radars were designed and created with the goal to study atmospheric phenomena.

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

( June 2024 ) Mobile doppler weather radars have been used on dozens of scientific and academic research projects from their invention in the late 1900s.

[ 1 ] One problems facing meteorological researchers was the fact that mesonets and other ground-based observation methods were being deployed too slow in order to accurately measure and study high-impact atmospheric phenomena.

[ 1 ] In 1993, the Electra Doppler Radar (ELDORA) system was created, consisting of a dual-beam radar mounted on top of a Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft.

[ 2 ] The system was designed to provide high-resolution measurements of characteristics of very large storms when ground-based radar cannot.

[ 3 ] Between 1994-1995, the first Doppler on Wheels was constructed and was deployed for the first time at the end of the VORTEX1 Project.

[ 1 ] The Doppler on Wheels led to several scientific breakthroughs and theories regarding tornadoes.

[ 1 ] The Doppler on Wheels also led to the “first tornado wind maps, measurements of an axial downdraft and lofted debris, multiple vortices, winds versus damage and surface measurement intercomparisons, winds as low as 3–4 m (9.8–13.1 ft) above the ground level and low-level inflow , 3D ground-based velocity track display (GBVTD) vector wind field retrievals, rapid evolution of debris over varying land use and terrain, documentation of cyclonic/ anticyclonic tornado pairs and documentation of varied and complex tornado wind field structures including multiple wind field maxima and multiple vortex mesocyclones , downward propagation of vorticity and an extensive climatology of tornado intensity and size revealing, quantitatively, that tornadoes are much more intense and larger than indicated by damage surveys.” [ 1 ] In 2011, Howard Bluestein , a research professor at the University of Oklahoma , led a team to develop the Rapid X-band Polarimetric Radar (RaXPol).

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] In 2013, researchers published to the American Meteorological Society that RaXPol was created because “the need for rapidly scanning weather radars for observing fast-changing weather phenomena such as convective storms, microbursts, small-scale features in hurricanes, and the process of convective development has been well established” throughout history.

[ 4 ] This included publications by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 1983, [ 7 ] research by several scientists published in 2001, [ 8 ] and published research by the U.S. federal government in 2012.

[ 9 ] The United States Department of Defense gave the University of Oklahoma over $5 million dollars (2019 USD) in the development of new mobile radars, which were set to be used by the United States Navy .

[ 10 ] In 2023, the University of Oklahoma, along with the National Severe Storms Laboratory developed and deployed the first ever mobile phased array radar (HORUS).

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] List of notable observations [ edit ] See also: Tornado records § Highest winds observed in a tornado Several tornadoes throughout the last few decades have been observed by various mobile radars. However, only the most notable ones are used for academic research and subsequently published.

[ 13 ] This is a list of known tornadoes which were observed by mobile radars.

This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources .

1990–1999 [ edit ] Official rating Date Location Minimum peak wind speed Maximum peak wind speed Highest confirmed peak wind speed F4 April 26, 1991 Ceres, Oklahoma 268 mph (431 km/h) 280 mph (450 km/h) 280 mph (450 km/h) A University of Oklahoma chase team headed by Howard Bluestein utilized mobile doppler weather radar to analyze the tornado. The radar measured peak winds of 120–125 m/s (270–280 mph; 430–450 km/h) between 150–190 m (490–620 ft) above the surface.

[ 13 ] At the time, this represented the strongest winds ever measured by radar, including the first measurements of F5 intensity winds.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] F2 June 2, 1995 Dimmitt, Texas 95 m/s (210 mph; 340 km/h) — 95 m/s (210 mph; 340 km/h) A Doppler on Wheels vehicle recorded a peak ground-relative wind speed of 95 m/s (210 mph; 340 km/h). Peak velocity differences (ΔV) recorded at an altitude of around 60 meters reached 139 m/s (310 mph; 500 km/h).

[ 16 ] F2 June 8, 1995 McLean, Texas 35 m/s (78 mph; 130 km/h) — 35 m/s (78 mph; 130 km/h) F2 — — — F0 — — — F4 — — 92 m/s (210 mph; 330 km/h) F0 — — — A cyclic supercell near McLean, Texas produced five tornadoes, all of which were observed by ELDORA aircraft. The F4 tornado was recorded to have 92 m/s (210 mph; 330 km/h) winds.

[ 17 ] F4 May 30, 1998 Spencer, South Dakota 234 mph (377 km/h) 264 mph (425 km/h) 264 mph (425 km/h) A Doppler on Wheels recorded winds of 264 mph (425 km/h) "well below" 50 metres (160 ft) above the ground level, "perhaps as low as 5–10 metres (16–33 ft) above the radar level".

[ 18 ] [ 13 ] The Doppler on Wheels also recorded a confirmed five-second wind speed average of 112 m/s (250 mph; 400 km/h).

[ 18 ] F4 May 3, 1999 Mulhall, Oklahoma 246 mph (396 km/h) 299 mph (481 km/h) 257 mph (414 km/h) A Doppler on Wheels documented the largest-ever-observed core flow circulation with a distance of 1,600 m (5,200 ft) between peak velocities on either side of the tornado, and a roughly 7 km (4.3 mi) width of peak wind gusts exceeding 43 m/s (96 mph), making the Mulhall tornado the largest tornado ever measured quantitatively.

[ 19 ] The DOW measured a complex multi-vortex structure, [ 20 ] with several vortices containing winds of up to 115 m/s (260 mph) rotating around the tornado. The 3D structure of the tornado has been analyzed in a 2005 article in the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences by Wen-Chau Lee and Joshua Wurman .

[ 21 ] In 2024, it was published that the radar did measure winds of approximately 257 mph (414 km/h) approximately 30 m (98 ft) above the radar level.

[ 13 ] F5 May 3, 1999 Bridge Creek, Oklahoma 281 mph (452 km/h) 321 mph (517 km/h) 321 mph (517 km/h) In 2007, Joshua Wurman along with other researchers, published that a Doppler on Wheels recorded 135 m/s (300 mph; 490 km/h) approximately 32 metres (105 ft) above the radar level.

[ 22 ] [ 13 ] In 2021, Wurman along with other researchers, revised the data using improved techniques and published that the Doppler on Wheels actually recorded 321 miles per hour (517 km/h) in the tornado.
