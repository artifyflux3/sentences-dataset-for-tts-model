Qatar is a peninsula on the northeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula , facing mainland Saudi Arabia to the south and surrounded elsewhere by the Persian Gulf . A strait separates Qatar from the island kingdom of Bahrain .

Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation was a private zoological park and conservation centre founded by Saud bin Muhammed Al Thani to provide sanctuary for various rare species. It also served as a successful breeding centre for international breeding programmes, working with global zoos and organizations, for endangered animals such as the addra gazelle , addax , beira and dibatag (small antelopes ), beisa and Arabian oryx , the golden-headed lion tamarin , the North African ostrich , the Northeast African cheetah , Nubian ibex , and Lear's and Spix's macaws , in addition to many other rare birds. The centre also bred several rare varieties of Encephalartos ( cycads ). As of 2018, it seems the animals at the preserve have been relocated to other facilities outside of Qatar, following the death of the Sheikh.
