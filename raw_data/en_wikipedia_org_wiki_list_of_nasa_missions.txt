There are over 80 currently active science missions.

[ 1 ] X-Plane program [ edit ] Main article: List of X-planes Since 1945, NACA (NASA's predecessor) and, since January 26, 1958, NASA has conducted the X-Plane Program.  The program was originally intended to create a family of experimental aircraft not intended for production beyond the limited number of each design built solely for flight research.

[ 2 ] The first X-Plane, the Bell X-1 , was the first rocket-powered airplane to break the sound barrier on October 14, 1947.

[ 3 ] X-Planes have set numerous milestones since then, both crewed and unpiloted.

[ 4 ] Human spaceflight [ edit ] Main article: Human spaceflight Discovery STS-120 launch, October 23, 2007 Astronauts Andrew Feustel (right) and Michael Fincke , outside the ISS during the STS-134 mission's third spacewalk .

Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt standing next to a boulder at Taurus-Littrow.

Astronaut Peter Wisoff on a robotic arm, 1993 NASA has successfully launched over 200 crewed flights. Three have ended in failure, causing the death of the entire crew: Apollo 1 (which never launched) in 1967 lost three crew members, STS-51-L ( the Challenger disaster ) in 1986, and STS-107 ( the Columbia disaster ) in 2003.

Program Start date First crewed flight End date No. of crewed missions launched Notes Mercury program 1958 1961 1963 6 First U.S. crewed program Gemini program 1961 1965 1966 10 Program used to practice space rendezvous and EVAs Apollo program 1960 1968 1972 11 [a] Landed first humans on the Moon Skylab 1964 1973 1974 3 First American space station Apollo–Soyuz Test Project 1971 1975 1975 1 Joint with Soviet Union Space Shuttle program 1972 1981 2011 135 [b] First missions in which a spacecraft was reused Shuttle-Mir program 1993 1995 1998 11 [c] Russian partnership International Space Station 1993 1998 Ongoing 65 Joint with Roscosmos , CSA , ESA , and JAXA ; Americans flew on Russian Soyuz after 2011 retirement of Space Shuttle Commercial Crew Program 2011 2020 Ongoing 8 Current program to shuttle Americans to the ISS Artemis program 2017 2025 (planned) Ongoing 0 Current program to bring humans to the Moon again Notes: Apollo 1 was unlaunched due to a fire during testing that killed the astronauts, and is not counted here.

One Space Shuttle mission ended with the destruction of the vehicle and death of the entire crew before reaching orbit.

The Shuttle-Mir missions were all Space Shuttle missions, and are also counted under the Space Shuttle program missions in the table.

Early Obama administration review [ edit ] Further information: Constellation program In May 2009, the Obama administration announced the launch of an independent review of planned U.S. human space flight activities with the goal of ensuring that the nation is on a vigorous and sustainable path to achieving its boldest aspirations in space. The review was conducted by a panel of experts led by Norman Augustine , the former CEO of Lockheed Martin , who served on the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology under both Democrat and Republican presidents.

[ 5 ] The " Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans " was to examine ongoing and planned National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) development activities, as well as potential alternatives and present options for advancing a safe, innovative, affordable, and sustainable human space flight program in the years following Space Shuttle retirement. The panel worked closely with NASA and sought input from the United States Congress , the White House , the public, industry, and international partners as it developed its options. It presented its results on October 22, 2009.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] In February 2010, Obama announced his proposal to cancel the Constellation program as part of his reform program. Constellation was officially canceled by the NASA Budget Authorization Act on October 11, 2010.

Future [ edit ] Further information: Artemis program NASA brought the Orion spacecraft back to life from the defunct Constellation program and successfully test-launched the first capsule on December 5, 2014, aboard EFT-1 .  After a near-perfect flight traveling 3,600 miles (5,800 km) above Earth, the spacecraft was recovered for study.  NASA plans to use the Orion crew vehicle to send humans to deep space locations such as the Moon and Mars starting in the 2020s.  Orion will be powered by NASA's new heavy-lift vehicle, the Space Launch System (SLS), which is currently under development.

Artemis I was the first flight of the SLS and was launched as a test of the completed Orion and SLS system.

[ 9 ] During the mission, an uncrewed Orion capsule spent 10 days in a distant retrograde 60,000 kilometers (37,000 mi) orbit around the Moon before returning to Earth.

[ 10 ] Artemis II , the first crewed mission of the program, will launch four astronauts in 2025 [ 11 ] on a free-return flyby of the Moon at a distance of 8,900 kilometers (5,500 mi).

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] After Artemis II, the Power and Propulsion Element of the Lunar Gateway and three components of an expendable lunar lander are planned to be delivered on multiple launches from commercial launch service providers .

[ 15 ] Artemis III is planned to launch in 2026 [ 16 ] aboard an SLS Block 1 rocket and will use the minimalist Gateway and expendable lander to achieve the first crewed lunar landing of the program. The flight is planned to touch down on the lunar south pole region, with two astronauts staying there for about one week.

And before NASA sends astronauts to the moon in 2024, the agency will first have to launch five aspects of the lunar Gateway, all of which will be commercial vehicles that launch separately and join each other in lunar orbit. First, a power and propulsion element will launch in 2022. Then, the crew module will launch (without a crew) in 2023. In 2024, during the months leading up to the crewed landing, NASA will launch the last critical components: a transfer vehicle that will ferry landers from the Gateway to a lower lunar orbit, a descent module that will bring the astronauts to the lunar surface, and an ascent module that will bring them back up to the transfer vehicle, which will then return them to the Gateway.

Under the NASA plan, a mission to land on the moon would take place during the third launch of the Space Launch System. Astronauts, including the first woman to walk on the moon, Mr. Bridenstine said, would first stop at the orbiting lunar outpost. They would then take a lander to the surface near its south pole, where frozen water exists within the craters.
