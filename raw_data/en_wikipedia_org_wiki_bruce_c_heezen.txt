Bucher Medal (1977) Scientific career Fields Geology , Oceanography Institutions Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory Bruce Charles Heezen ( / ˈ h eɪ z ən / ; April 11, 1924 – June 21, 1977) was an American geologist.

[ 1 ] He worked with oceanographic cartographer Marie Tharp at Columbia University to map the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the 1950s.

Biography [ edit ] Heezen was born in Vinton, Iowa . An only child, he moved at age six with his parents to Muscatine, Iowa , where he graduated from high school in 1942. He received his B.A. from the University of Iowa in 1947. He received his M.A. in 1952 and a Ph.D in 1957 from Columbia University .

Painting of the Mid-Ocean Ridges by Heinrich Berann (1977) based on the scientific profiles of Marie Tharp and Bruce Heezen Heezen collaborated extensively with cartographer Marie Tharp . He interpreted their joint work on the Mid-Atlantic ridge and the East Pacific Rise as supporting S. Warren Carey 's Expanding Earth Theory , developed in the 1950s, [ 2 ] but under Tharp's influence "eventually gave up the idea of an expanding earth for a form of continental drift in the mid-1960s." Tharp was Heezen's assistant while he was a graduate student and he gave her the task of drafting seafloor profiles.

[ 3 ] When she showed Heezen that her plotting of the North Atlantic revealed a rift valley, Heezen initially dismissed it as "girl talk." [ 4 ] Eventually they discovered that not only was there a North Atlantic rift valley, but a mountain range with a central valley that spanned the earth.

[ 4 ] They also realized that the oceanic earthquakes they had been separately plotting fell within the rift, a revolutionary theory at the time.

[ 3 ] He presented this mid-ocean rift and earthquake theory as his own work at Princeton in 1957.

[ 4 ] At that lecture, preeminent geologist Harry Hess [ 5 ] told Heezen, "Young man, you have shaken the foundations of geology!" [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Although Marie Tharp was later recognized and credited for her work on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, it was Heezen who, at the time in 1956, put out and received credit for the discovery that was made, leaving off Tharp's name.

Heezen died of a heart attack in 1977 while on a research cruise to study the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Iceland aboard the NR-1 submarine .

[ 6 ] Honors and awards [ edit ] 1964: Henry Bryant Bigelow Medal in Oceanography awarded by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution [ 7 ] 1973: Cullum Geographical Medal awarded by the American Geographical Society [ 8 ] 1977: Walter H. Bucher Medal awarded by the American Geophysical Union [ 9 ] The Oceanographic Survey Ship USNS Bruce C. Heezen was christened in honor of him in 1999.

[ 10 ] Heezen Canyon is a large underwater canyon in the NW Atlantic, on the edge of the continental shelf .

[ 11 ] Heezen Glacier in Antarctica was named after him in 1977.
