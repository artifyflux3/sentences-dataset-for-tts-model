45007061 Links Journal homepage Online access Online archive The Educational Psychologist is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal published by Routledge on behalf of Division 15 (Educational Psychology) of the American Psychological Association . It was established in 1963 and the current co-editors are Jeffrey A. Greene ( University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ) and Lisa Linnenbrink-Garcia ( Michigan State University ). The journal publishes conceptual, theoretical, and review articles (including meta-analyses), rather than empirical studies , on all aspects of educational psychology and learning in formal and informal educational environments.

It is considered one of the "big five" educational psychology journals (along with Cognition and Instruction , Journal of Educational Psychology , Educational Psychology Review , and Contemporary Educational Psychology ).

[ 1 ] According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal has a two-year impact factor of 8.209 and a five-year impact factor of 11.302 (as of June 2022), making it one of the top-ranked journals in educational research and educational psychology.

[ 2 ] The journal practices double-blind peer review (since at least 1979 [ 3 ] ).
