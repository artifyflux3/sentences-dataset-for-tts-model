The agency was terminated and succeeded by the National Aerospace Development Administration in 2013 after the Law on Space Development was passed in the 7th session of the 12th Supreme People's Assembly.

History [ edit ] Very little information on it is publicly available. It is known to have been founded sometime in the 1980s, [ 1 ] and most likely is connected to the Artillery Guidance Bureau of the Korean People's Army .

Operations [ edit ] The KCST was responsible for all operations concerning space exploration and construction of satellites. On 12 March 2009, North Korea signed the Outer Space Treaty and the Registration Convention , [ 2 ] after a previous declaration of preparations for a new satellite launch .

Facilities [ edit ] Unha-3 Rocket on 8 April 2012 in Sohae The KCST operated the Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground and Sohae Satellite Launching Station rocket launching sites, Paektusan-1 and Unha launchers, Kwangmyŏngsŏng satellites .

South Korea and the United States accused North Korea of using these facilities and the rockets as a cover for a military ballistic missile testing program.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Sohae Satellite Launching Station built from the 2000s to 2010s with a launch pad completed in 2011.

Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground built from the 2000s to 2010s with a launch pad completed in 2011.

Projects [ edit ] The DPRK twice announced that it had launched satellites: Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1 on 31 August 1998 and Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2 on 5 April 2009. The US and South Korea predicted that the launches would in actuality be military ballistic missile tests, but later confirmed that they had followed orbital launch trajectories.

In 2009, the DPRK announced more ambitious future space projects including its own crewed space flights and development of a crewed partially reusable launch vehicle.

[ 5 ] Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 was launched on 13 April 2012 and ended in failure shortly after launch.

[ 6 ] A follow-up attempt the following December, Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2 entered polar orbit as confirmed by various countries.

Launch history [ edit ] This is a list of satellites launched.
