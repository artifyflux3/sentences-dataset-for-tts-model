Founded in 1909 by the Queensland parliament, UQ is one of the six sandstone universities , an informal designation of the oldest university in each state.

[ 13 ] UQ is also a founding member of edX , Australia's leading Group of Eight and the international research-intensive Association of Pacific Rim Universities .

[ 14 ] The main St Lucia campus occupies much of the riverside inner suburb of St Lucia , southwest of the Brisbane central business district . Other UQ campuses and facilities are located throughout Queensland, the largest of which are the Gatton campus and the Herston campus, notably including the Mayne Medical School . UQ's overseas establishments include UQ North America office in Washington D.C., and the UQ- Ochsner Clinical School in Louisiana , United States.

The university offers associate, bachelor, master, doctoral, and higher doctorate degrees through a college, a graduate school, and six faculties. UQ incorporates over one hundred research institutes and centres offering research programs, such as the Institute for Molecular Bioscience , Boeing Research and Technology Australia Centre, [ 15 ] the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology , and the UQ Dow Centre for Sustainable Engineering Innovation.

[ 16 ] Recent notable research of the university include pioneering the invention of the HPV vaccine that prevents cervical cancer , developing a COVID-19 vaccine that was in human trials, [ 17 ] and the development of high-performance superconducting MRI magnets for portable scanning of human limbs .

[ 18 ] UQ counts two Nobel laureates ( Peter C. Doherty and John Harsanyi ), over a hundred Olympians winning numerous gold medals, [ 19 ] and 117 Rhodes Scholars [ 20 ] among its alumni and former staff. UQ's alumni also include University of California, San Francisco Chancellor Sam Hawgood , the first female Governor-General of Australia Dame Quentin Bryce , former President of King's College London Ed Byrne , member of United Kingdom's Prime Minister Council for Science and Technology Max Lu , Oscar and Emmy awards winner Geoffrey Rush , triple Grammy Award winner Tim Munro , former CEO and chairman of Dow Chemical Andrew N. Liveris , and current director of multiple organisations including IBM .

History [ edit ] Foundation of the university [ edit ] See also: Old Government House, Queensland § Last resident governor ; and The Mayne Inheritance The University of Queensland's former main campus According to the Queensland Government's Heritage Register's History section: [ 21 ] Proposals for a university in Queensland began in the 1870s. A Royal Commission in 1874, chaired by Sir Charles Lilley , recommended the immediate establishment of a university. Those against a university argued that technical rather than academic education was more important in an economy dominated by primary industry. Those in favour of the university, in the face of this opposition, distanced themselves from Oxford and Cambridge and proposed instead a model derived from the mid-western states of the U.S.A . A second Royal Commission in 1891 recommended the inclusion of five faculties in a new university; Arts, Law, Medicine, Science, and Applied Science. Education generally was given a low priority in Queensland's budgets, and in a colony with a literacy rate of 57% in 1861, primary education was the first concern well ahead of secondary and technical education. The government, despite the findings of the Royal Commissions, was unwilling to commit funds to the establishment of a university.

[ 21 ] The four founding Professors of the University of Queensland, 1911. From left to right: Professor John Lundie Michie (classics), Professor Alexander James Gibson (engineering), Professor Henry James Priestley (mathematics and physics), Professor Bertram Dillon Steele (chemistry).

In 1893, the Queensland University Extension Movement was begun by a group of private individuals who organised public lecture courses in adult education, hoping to excite wider community support for a university in Queensland. In 1894, 245 students were enrolled in the extension classes and the lectures were described as practical and useful. In 1906 the University Extension Movement staged the University Congress , a forum for interested delegates to promote the idea of a university. Opinion was mobilised, a fund was started and a draft Bill for a Queensland University was prepared. Stress was laid on the practical aspects of university education and its importance for the commerce of Queensland. The proceedings of the Congress were forwarded to Premier [of Queensland] Kidston . In October 1906, sixty acres in Victoria Park were gazetted for university purposes.

[ 21 ] A group of Queensland University students in 1912 The University of Queensland was established by an Act of State Parliament on 10 December 1909 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Queensland's separation from the colony of New South Wales . The Act allowed for the university to be governed by a senate of 20 men and Sir William MacGregor , the incoming Governor, was appointed the first chancellor with RH Roe as the vice-chancellor.

Old Government House ... [then Government House] in George Street was set aside for the university following the departure of the governor to the Bardon residence, Fernberg ..., sparking the first debates about the best location for the university.

[ 21 ] In 1910 the first teaching faculties were created. These included Engineering, Classics, Mathematics[,] and Chemistry. In December of the same year, the Senate appointed the first four professors; BD Steele in chemistry, JL Michie in classics, H. Priestley in mathematics and A Gibson in engineering. In 1911 the first students enrolled.

[ 21 ] The university's first classes in the Government House were held in 1911 with 83 commencing students and Sir William MacGregor is the first chancellor (with RH Roe as vice-chancellor). The University of Queensland began to award degrees to its first group of graduating students in 1914.

[ 22 ] 1920s to 1990s [ edit ] Construction of the Forgan Smith Building began in 1938.

The development of the university was delayed by World War I , but after the first world war the university enrolments for education and research took flight as demand for higher education increased in Australia. Thus, in the early 1920s the growing university had to look for a more spacious campus as its original site in George Street, Brisbane , had limited room for expansion.

[ 13 ] In 1927, James O'Neil Mayne and his sister, Mary , provided a grant of approximately £50,000 to the Brisbane City Council to acquire 274 acres (111 ha) of land in St Lucia and provided it to the University of Queensland as its permanent home. In the same year, the pitch drop experiment was started by Thomas Parnell . The experiment has been described as the world's oldest and continues to this day.

[ 23 ] Lack of finance delayed development of the St Lucia campus. Hence, the construction of the university's first building in St Lucia only began in 1938. It was later named the Forgan Smith Building, after the premier of the day and it was completed in 1939. During World War II, the Forgan Smith Building was used as a military base and it served first as advanced headquarters for the Allied Land Forces in the South West Pacific.

[ 24 ] The first Doctor of Science was awarded in 1942.

[ 25 ] The first PhD was awarded in 1952.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] 1990s to present day [ edit ] In 1990, Australia reorganised its higher education system by abolishing the binary system of universities and colleges of advanced education. Under this transition, the university merged with Queensland Agricultural College, to establish the new UQ Gatton campus. In 1999, UQ Ipswich began operation as one of the completely web-enabled campuses in Australia.

[ 13 ] [ 28 ] In 2010, The University of Queensland was a recipient of the Queensland Greats Awards .

[ 29 ] In May 2013, UQ joined edX , an international consortium of massive open online courses ( MOOCs ). From May 2014, the initial four UQx courses cover hypersonics, tropical coastal ecosystems, biomedical imaging and the science of everyday thinking.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] UQ has its main campus in the suburb of St Lucia in Brisbane, bordered by a meander in the Brisbane River to the north, east, and south. UQ's main campus has been recognised for its beauty by a number of sources.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] Its other campuses include Gatton , Herston and Dutton Park (formerly the Pharmacy Australia Centre of Excellence).

St Lucia campus [ edit ] UQ St Lucia Sunset over the University of Queensland's St Lucia Campus In 1927, the land on which the St Lucia campus is built was resumed by the Brisbane City Council using money donated by James O'Neil Mayne and his sister Mary Emelia Mayne to replace the less spacious city campus. The city campus is now home to the Gardens Point campus of the Queensland University of Technology . Construction of the new university at St Lucia began in 1937.

[ 35 ] Great Court [ edit ] Main article: Great Court, University of Queensland At its centre is the heritage-listed Great Court – a 2.5 hectares (6.2 acres) open area surrounded by Helidon sandstone buildings with grotesques of great academics and historic scenes, floral and faunal motifs and crests of universities and colleges from around the world.

[ 35 ] This central semi-circular quadrangle features a connected arcade so students could reach any section under cover. The Great Court was added to the Queensland Heritage Register in 2002.

[ 36 ] Museums [ edit ] UQ Art Museum – James and Mary Emelia Mayne Centre UQ St Lucia [ 37 ] The University of Queensland Art Museum is located in the James and Mary Emelia Mayne Centre on the St Lucia campus. The Art Museum was established in the Forgan Smith Tower in 1976 to house the artworks collected by The University of Queensland since the 1940s, relocating to its present site in 2004. Today, with more than 4,400 artworks, the University's Art Collection is Queensland's second largest public art collection.

[ 38 ] The university also houses the R.D. Milns Antiquities Museum [ 39 ] in the Michie building (bldg 9, level 2) which contains Queensland's only publicly accessible collection of antiquities from ancient Rome, Greece, Egypt and the Near East. The museum supports research and teaching at the university.

[ 40 ] The UQ Anthropology Museum (also in the Michie Building on level 1) contains a significant collection of ethnographic material. It is also open to the public.

[ 41 ] Gatton campus [ edit ] Main article: University of Queensland Gatton Campus The UQ Gatton Campus covers 1068 ha at Lawes , near the town of Gatton, Queensland , about 90 kilometres (56 mi) west of Brisbane on the Warrego Highway. The campus was opened in 1897 next to the site of the Queensland Agricultural College which was then amalgamated with UQ in 1990.

[ 13 ] UQ Gatton is the core campus for research, learning and teaching activities and facilities in agriculture, animals, veterinary science and the environment.

[ 42 ] In 2008 the Centre for Advanced Animal Science (CAAS) was opened at the Gatton campus – a collaborative venture between UQ and the Queensland Government .

[ 43 ] Herston campus [ edit ] UQ Mayne Medical School , Herston campus UQ Mayne Medical School and the Queensland Institute of Medical Research is the core campus for clinical health teaching and research.

[ 47 ] Dutton Park campus [ edit ] UQ's Dutton Park campus was officially announced by Professor Deborah Terry AC in 2023, [ 48 ] rebranding the site of the pre-existing Pharmacy Australia Centre of Excellence [PACE]. The campus is the home to the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, the Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences, the Dutton Park Health Sciences Library, and the Cornwall Street Medical Center (UQ Health Care).

[ 49 ] The campus is located in Woolloongabba, adjoining the PA Hospital and the Translational Research Institute, within the Boggo Road Innovation Precinct.

Former Ipswich campus [ edit ] In 2014, UQ sold the Ipswich Campus to the University of Southern Queensland , believing that this regional teaching campus would be better used by USQ.

[ 50 ] The campus was made up of nearly 20 buildings and more than 5001 students on nearly 25 hectares (62 acres).

[ 51 ] Courses offered included: arts, business, medicine and social sciences as well as Interaction design . It is located near central Ipswich, Queensland , just south of the CBD. Nearby landmarks include Limestone Park, Workshops Rail Museum and RAAF Base Amberley .

The site dates back to 1878 with the opening of the Ipswich branch of the Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum . Operations continued until 1910 when it became the Ipswich Hospital for the Insane.

[ 51 ] In 1938 it was renamed the Ipswich Mental Hospital and in 1964 it was renamed again as the Ipswich Special Hospital. It was finally named the Challinor Centre in 1968 in honour of Henry Challinor , the ship's surgeon on the Fortitude . From 1968 to 1997 the Challinor Centre served as an institution for people with intellectual disabilities . In late 1997 the Challinor Centre began its first stage of transformation as the new UQ Ipswich campus.

[ 51 ] Satellite teaching and research centres [ edit ] UQ has other research and education facilities not directly attached to its four campuses. These locations are primarily for research, which cannot be undertaken in the campus locales but also represent buildings which established pre-eminence in education before the creation of the current campuses.

The Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) of The University of Queensland Sustainable Minerals Institute is at a former silver and lead mine at Finney's Hill in Indooroopilly .

[ 53 ] Acquired in 1951 by the School of Mining Engineering under the leadership of Frank T. M. White , Foundation Professor (appointed 1950), this mine (formerly Finney's Hill United Silver Mines Limited) then became known as the Queensland University Experimental Mine. It promptly became an integral part of the teaching and research capacity of the School, [ 54 ] which in 1952 expanded to become the Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] JKMRC, incorporating the Experimental Mine, was officially established as a University Centre in 1970, with a goal to develop practical technical solutions for large-scale mining and minerals industry challenges.

[ 58 ] It is named after Julius Kruttschnitt , the chairman of Mount Isa Mines and a board member of the university's Faculty of Engineering.

[ 138 ] Student suspensions [ edit ] Further information: Drew Pavlou § Suspension from the University of Queensland On 29 May 2020, the UQ disciplinary board issued a two-year suspension to activist Drew Pavlou for alleged bullying, discrimination and harassment of university students and staff.

[ 139 ] Pavlou has contested the reasoning describing in a statement released on Twitter that his suspension was "to silence [him] for [his] political activism", something denied by both the university, and the disciplinary and appeals boards.

[ 140 ] [ 141 ] Pavlou has admitted to swearing at other students on Facebook and an online university forum.

[ 142 ] An appeal to the UQ Senate Disciplinary Appeals Committee resulted in the committee endorsing two counts of serious misconduct, however reducing the suspension from two years to one semester.

[ 143 ] In June 2020, Pavlou launched a second lawsuit in the Supreme Court seeking A$ 3.5 million in damages from the university for alleged defamation and a breach of contract.

[ 144 ] In September 2020, the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission declined a request by Pavlou to investigate UQ Chancellor Peter Varghese and former Vice-Chancellor Peter Høj , citing that there was "insufficient evidence to suggest anyone who was subject of the complaint had engaged in corrupt conduct.

[ 145 ] Sexual assaults [ edit ] Between 2011 and 2016 there were 38 reported cases of sexual assault and harassment on campus, resulting in 1 expulsion and 2 one-week suspensions. This included a report in 2015 where a staff member "filmed someone in the shower".

[ 146 ] These figures are lower than the 2017 Australian Human Rights Commission report on sexual assault and harassment.

[ 147 ] The vice-chancellor responded "there is no place for sexual assault or sexual harassment at UQ. Such behaviour is never the victim’s fault, and it will not be tolerated here" and introduced a number of new initiatives to address sexual assault problems.

( August 2020 ) The University of Queensland's investment portfolio is a subject of ongoing debate. A fossil fuel divestment campaign began in 2013, led by the student group Fossil Free UQ and supported by the climate advocacy group 350.org . The goal of the campaign is "to freeze all new investments and phase out all current investments in coal, petroleum and gas over the next five years because fossil fuels drive climate change ".

[ 149 ] [ better source needed ] On 18 April 2016, students occupied the Vice-Chancellory stating, 'We are asking the university to remove investment from the top 200 most polluting companies in the world' and calling for greater transparency regarding University investments.

[ 150 ] [ 151 ] The sit-in resulted in communication with the Vice-Chancellor in May 2016.

[ 152 ] In October 2016, Fossil Free QUT provided a report to the University Senate. For the period July 2015 to June 2016 direct fossil fuel companies comprised an average of 3.82% of UQ's $169.2m investment portfolio.

[ 153 ] The University Senate voted not to divest from fossil fuels citing, 'that divestment would make no real difference'.

[ 153 ] [ 154 ] In September 2013, 350.org Australia released a report 'Exposing The Ties' to show 'shows how key decision makers at some of the country's leading tertiary institutions including the University of Queensland, University of Newcastle and University of New South Wales are non-executive directors or former employees of fossil fuel companies including AGL , BHP and Rio Tinto .' [ 155 ] [ citation not found ] This showed The University of Queensland received $31 million from the Australian Coal Association Research Program (ACARP) and the University's Senate includes three non-executive directors of Senex Energy , Metro Mining and Queensland Investment Corporation , (owner of Epic Energy and Lochard Energy) and a former Queensland Resources Council board member and recipient of the Queensland Resources Council Medal.

[ 155 ] Seven of the twenty-two members of the senate for UQ have interests in the fossil fuel industry, having ties with fossil fuel companies previously or currently.

[ 156 ] [ citation not found ] In October 2017, ten students occupied the Chancellor's Office deeming the 2016 Senate vote on divestment illegitimate due to conflicts of interest.

[ 156 ] The students were removed by the Queensland Police Service .

In 2020, when the Prime Minister Scott Morrison was visiting, fifty students protested at the university, damaging university's property and the prime minister's car. Some students came close to the prime minister and used a blowhorn with sirens.

[ 3 ] Additionally, classes didn't commence until 14 March 1911 and the current site was purchased in 1926.
