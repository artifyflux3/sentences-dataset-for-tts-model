The University of Queensland's former main campus

According to the Queensland Government's Heritage Register's History section:[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-HeritageRegister-22)

> Proposals for a university in Queensland began in the 1870s. A [Royal Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission "Royal Commission") in 1874, chaired by Sir [Charles Lilley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lilley "Charles Lilley"), recommended the immediate establishment of a university. Those against a university argued that technical rather than academic education was more important in an economy dominated by primary industry. Those in favour of the university, in the face of this opposition, distanced themselves from [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University "Oxford University") and [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University "Cambridge University") and proposed instead a model derived from the mid-western states of the [U.S.A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"). A second Royal Commission in 1891 recommended the inclusion of five faculties in a new university; Arts, Law, Medicine, Science, and Applied Science. Education generally was given a low priority in Queensland's budgets, and in a colony with a literacy rate of 57% in 1861, [primary education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education "Primary education") was the first concern well ahead of [secondary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education "Secondary education") and [technical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education "Tertiary education") education. The government, despite the findings of the Royal Commissions, was unwilling to commit funds to the establishment of a university.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-HeritageRegister-22)

> 
> 
> In 1893, the Queensland University Extension Movement was begun by a group of private individuals who organised public lecture courses in adult education, hoping to excite wider community support for a university in Queensland. In 1894, 245 students were enrolled in the extension classes and the lectures were described as practical and useful. In 1906 the University Extension Movement staged the University [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress "Congress"), a forum for interested delegates to promote the idea of a university. Opinion was mobilised, a fund was started and a draft [Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_(law) "Bill (law)") for a Queensland University was prepared. Stress was laid on the practical aspects of university education and its importance for the commerce of Queensland. The proceedings of the Congress were forwarded to [Premier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Queensland "Premier of Queensland") [of Queensland] [Kidston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kidston "William Kidston"). In October 1906, sixty acres in [Victoria Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park,_Brisbane "Victoria Park, Brisbane") were gazetted for university purposes.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-HeritageRegister-22)

> The University of Queensland was established by an [Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament "Act of Parliament") of [State Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Queensland "Parliament of Queensland") on 10 December 1909 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Queensland's separation from the colony of [New South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales "New South Wales"). The Act allowed for the university to be governed by a senate of 20 men and Sir [William MacGregor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_MacGregor "William MacGregor"), the incoming Governor, was appointed the first chancellor with [RH Roe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Heber_Roe "Reginald Heber Roe") as the vice-chancellor. [Old Government House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Government_House,_Queensland "Old Government House, Queensland") ... [then Government House] in [George Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Street,_Brisbane "George Street, Brisbane") was set aside for the university following the departure of the governor to the [Bardon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardon,_Queensland "Bardon, Queensland") residence, _[Fernberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government\_House,\_Brisbane "Government House, Brisbane")_..., sparking the first debates about the best location for the university.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-HeritageRegister-22)
> 
> 
> In 1910 the first teaching faculties were created. These included Engineering, Classics, Mathematics[,] and Chemistry. In December of the same year, the Senate appointed the first four professors; [BD Steele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertram_Dillon_Steele "Bertram Dillon Steele") in chemistry, [JL Michie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lundie_Michie "John Lundie Michie") in classics, [H. Priestley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Priestley_(mathematician) "Henry Priestley (mathematician)") in mathematics and [A Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_James_Gibson "Alexander James Gibson") in engineering. In 1911 the first students enrolled.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-HeritageRegister-22)

The university's first classes in the Government House were held in 1911 with 83 commencing students and Sir William MacGregor is the first chancellor (with [RH Roe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Heber_Roe "Reginald Heber Roe") as vice-chancellor). The University of Queensland began to award degrees to its first group of graduating students in 1914.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-23)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Construction_of_Forgan_Smith.jpg/250px-Construction_of_Forgan_Smith.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Construction_of_Forgan_Smith.jpg)

Construction of the Forgan Smith Building began in 1938.

The development of the university was delayed by [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), but after the first world war the university enrolments for education and research took flight as demand for higher education increased in Australia. Thus, in the early 1920s the growing university had to look for a more spacious campus as its original site in George Street, [Brisbane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane "Brisbane"), had limited room for expansion.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-history-14) In 1927, James O'Neil Mayne and his sister, [Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Emelia_Mayne "Mary Emelia Mayne"), provided a grant of approximately £50,000 to the [Brisbane City Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council "Brisbane City Council") to acquire 274 acres (111 ha) of land in St Lucia and provided it to the University of Queensland as its permanent home. In the same year, the [pitch drop experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment "Pitch drop experiment") was started by [Thomas Parnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Parnell_(scientist) "Thomas Parnell (scientist)"). The experiment has been described as the world's oldest and continues to this day.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-woe-24) Lack of finance delayed development of the St Lucia campus. Hence, the construction of the university's first building in St Lucia only began in 1938. It was later named the Forgan Smith Building, after the [premier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiers_of_Queensland "Premiers of Queensland") of the day and it was completed in 1939. During World War II, the Forgan Smith Building was used as a military base and it served first as advanced headquarters for the Allied Land Forces in the South West Pacific.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-history-14)

The first Doctor of Science was awarded in 1942.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-26) The first PhD was awarded in 1952.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-27)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-28)

### 1990s to present day

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Queensland&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 1990s to present day")]

In 1990, Australia reorganised its higher education system by abolishing the binary system of universities and colleges of advanced education. Under this transition, the university merged with Queensland Agricultural College, to establish the new UQ [Gatton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatton,_Queensland "Gatton, Queensland") campus. In 1999, UQ [Ipswich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich,_Queensland "Ipswich, Queensland") began operation as one of the completely web-enabled campuses in Australia.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-history-14)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-29)

In 2010, The University of Queensland was a recipient of the [Queensland Greats Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Greats_Awards "Queensland Greats Awards").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-30)

In May 2013, UQ joined [edX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdX "EdX"), an international consortium of massive open online courses ([MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOOCs "MOOCs")). From May 2014, the initial four UQx courses cover hypersonics, tropical coastal ecosystems, biomedical imaging and the science of everyday thinking.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-31)

Sunset over the University of Queensland's St Lucia Campus

In 1927, the land on which the [St Lucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Lucia,_Queensland "St Lucia, Queensland") campus is built was resumed by the [Brisbane City Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council "Brisbane City Council") using money donated by James O'Neil Mayne and his sister [Mary Emelia Mayne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Emelia_Mayne "Mary Emelia Mayne") to replace the less spacious city campus. The city campus is now home to the [Gardens Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardens_Point,_Brisbane "Gardens Point, Brisbane") campus of the [Queensland University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_University_of_Technology "Queensland University of Technology"). Construction of the new university at St Lucia began in 1937.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-look-36)

At its centre is the [heritage-listed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage-listed "Heritage-listed") Great Court – a 2.5 hectares (6.2 acres) open area surrounded by [Helidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helidon,_Queensland "Helidon, Queensland")[sandstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone "Sandstone") buildings with [grotesques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grotesque#In_architecture "Grotesque") of great academics and historic scenes, floral and faunal [motifs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(visual_arts) "Motif (visual arts)") and crests of universities and colleges from around the world.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-look-36) This central semi-circular quadrangle features a connected arcade so students could reach any section under cover. The Great Court was added to the [Queensland Heritage Register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Heritage_Register "Queensland Heritage Register") in 2002.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-37)

### Former Ipswich campus

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Queensland&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Former Ipswich campus")]

In 2014, UQ sold the Ipswich Campus to the [University of Southern Queensland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_Queensland "University of Southern Queensland"), believing that this regional teaching campus would be better used by USQ.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-51)

The campus was made up of nearly 20 buildings and more than 5001 students on nearly 25 hectares (62 acres).[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-ipswich-52) Courses offered included: arts, business, medicine and social sciences as well as [Interaction design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design "Interaction design"). It is located near central [Ipswich, Queensland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich,_Queensland "Ipswich, Queensland"), just south of the CBD. Nearby landmarks include Limestone Park, [Workshops Rail Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshops_Rail_Museum "Workshops Rail Museum") and [RAAF Base Amberley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Amberley "RAAF Base Amberley").

The site dates back to 1878 with the opening of the Ipswich branch of the [Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woogaroo_Lunatic_Asylum "Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum"). Operations continued until 1910 when it became the Ipswich Hospital for the Insane.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-ipswich-52) In 1938 it was renamed the [Ipswich Mental Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_Mental_Hospital "Ipswich Mental Hospital") and in 1964 it was renamed again as the Ipswich Special Hospital. It was finally named the Challinor Centre in 1968 in honour of [Henry Challinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Challinor "Henry Challinor"), the ship's surgeon on the [_Fortitude_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortitude_(1842_ship) "Fortitude (1842 ship)"). From 1968 to 1997 the Challinor Centre served as an institution for people with [intellectual disabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disabilities "Intellectual disabilities"). In late 1997 the Challinor Centre began its first stage of transformation as the new UQ Ipswich campus.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-ipswich-52)

### Satellite teaching and research centres

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Queensland&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Satellite teaching and research centres")]

UQ has other research and education facilities not directly attached to its four campuses. These locations are primarily for research, which cannot be undertaken in the campus locales but also represent buildings which established pre-eminence in education before the creation of the current campuses.

### Relationship with the Confucius Institute

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Queensland&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Relationship with the Confucius Institute")]

Apparent links with the [Confucius Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius_Institute "Confucius Institute"), a Chinese government-supported international education partnership program, have been controversial for UQ. The university offers 13 courses co-funded by the institute, mainly around Chinese arts, media and language. Critics of these courses have claimed Chinese government influence on the course content, while UQ has contested that they have been developed by university academics without external contribution.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-141)

### Student suspensions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Queensland&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Student suspensions")]

On 29 May 2020, the UQ disciplinary board issued a two-year suspension to activist [Drew Pavlou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Pavlou "Drew Pavlou") for alleged bullying, discrimination and harassment of university students and staff.[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-142) Pavlou has contested the reasoning describing in a statement released on [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") that his suspension was "to silence [him] for [his] political activism", something denied by both the university, and the disciplinary and appeals boards.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-143)[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-144) Pavlou has admitted to swearing at other students on Facebook and an online university forum.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-145) An appeal to the UQ Senate Disciplinary Appeals Committee resulted in the committee endorsing two counts of serious misconduct, however reducing the suspension from two years to one semester.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-146)

In June 2020, Pavlou launched a second lawsuit in the Supreme Court seeking A$3.5 million in damages from the university for alleged defamation and a breach of contract.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-147) In September 2020, the [Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Corruption_Commission "Crime and Corruption Commission") declined a request by Pavlou to investigate UQ Chancellor [Peter Varghese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Varghese "Peter Varghese") and former Vice-Chancellor [Peter Høj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_H%C3%B8j "Peter Høj"), citing that there was "insufficient evidence to suggest anyone who was subject of the complaint had engaged in corrupt conduct.[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-148)

Between 2011 and 2016 there were 38 reported cases of sexual assault and harassment on campus, resulting in 1 expulsion and 2 one-week suspensions. This included a report in 2015 where a staff member "filmed someone in the shower".[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-foi_sexual_assault-149) These figures are lower than the 2017 [Australian Human Rights Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission "Australian Human Rights Commission") report on sexual assault and harassment.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-150) The vice-chancellor responded "there is no place for sexual assault or sexual harassment at UQ. Such behaviour is never the victim’s fault, and it will not be tolerated here" and introduced a number of new initiatives to address sexual assault problems.[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-151)

The University of Queensland's investment portfolio is a subject of ongoing debate. A [fossil fuel divestment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel_divestment "Fossil fuel divestment") campaign began in 2013, led by the student group Fossil Free UQ and supported by the climate advocacy group [350.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350.org "350.org"). The goal of the campaign is "to freeze all new investments and phase out all current investments in coal, petroleum and gas over the next five years because fossil fuels drive [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change")".[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-152)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_]

On 18 April 2016, students occupied the Vice-Chancellory stating, 'We are asking the university to remove investment from the top 200 most polluting companies in the world' and calling for greater transparency regarding University investments.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-153)[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-154) The sit-in resulted in communication with the Vice-Chancellor in May 2016.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-155)

In October 2016, Fossil Free QUT provided a report to the University Senate. For the period July 2015 to June 2016 direct fossil fuel companies comprised an average of 3.82% of UQ's $169.2m investment portfolio.[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-UQ_News-156) The University Senate voted not to divest from fossil fuels citing, 'that divestment would make no real difference'.[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-UQ_News-156)[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-157)

Seven of the twenty-two members of the senate for UQ have interests in the fossil fuel industry, having ties with fossil fuel companies previously or currently.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-4ZZZ_Brisbane_102.1FM-159)[_[citation not found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Harvard\_citation\_documentation#Wikilink\_to\_citation\_does\_not\_work "Template:Harvard citation documentation")_]

In October 2017, ten students occupied the Chancellor's Office deeming the 2016 Senate vote on divestment illegitimate due to conflicts of interest.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-4ZZZ_Brisbane_102.1FM-159) The students were removed by the [Queensland Police Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service "Queensland Police Service").

In 2020, when the Prime Minister Scott Morrison was visiting, fifty students protested at the university, damaging university's property and the prime minister's car. Some students came close to the prime minister and used a blowhorn with sirens. [[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland#cite_note-160)
