This article is about mechanics. For other fields, see [Degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom "Degrees of freedom").

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), the number of **degrees of freedom** (**DOF**) of a [mechanical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_system "Mechanical system") is the number of independent [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter") required to completely specify its configuration or state. That number is an important property in the analysis of systems of bodies in [mechanical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering"), [structural engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineering "Structural engineering"), [aerospace engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering"), [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics"), and other fields.

As an example, the position of a single railcar (engine) moving along a track has one degree of freedom because the position of the car can be completely specified by a single number expressing its distance along the track from some chosen origin. A train of rigid cars connected by hinges to an engine still has only one degree of freedom because the positions of the cars behind the engine are constrained by the shape of the track.

For a second example, an automobile with a very stiff suspension can be considered to be a rigid body traveling on a plane (a flat, two-dimensional space). This body has three independent degrees of freedom consisting of two components of translation (which together specify its position) and one angle of rotation (which specifies its orientation). Skidding or [drifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_(motorsports) "Drifting (motorsports)") is a good example of an automobile's three independent degrees of freedom.

The position and [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") of a rigid body in space are defined by three components of [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(physics) "Translation (physics)") and three components of [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation"), which means that the body has six degrees of freedom.

To ensure that a mechanical device's degrees of freedom neither underconstrain nor overconstrain it, its design can be managed using the [exact constraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_constraint "Exact constraint") method.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)#cite_note-1)

Motions and dimensions
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Motions and dimensions")]

The position of an _n_-dimensional [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") is defined by the [rigid transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_transformation "Rigid transformation"), [_T_]=[_A_,_d_], where _d_ is an _n_-dimensional translation and _A_ is an _n_×_n_ rotation matrix, which has _n_ translational degrees of freedom and _n_(_n_−1)/2 rotational degrees of freedom. The number of rotational degrees of freedom comes from the dimension of the rotation group[SO(n)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(n) "SO(n)").

A non-rigid or deformable body may be thought of as a collection of many minute particles (infinite number of DOFs), this is often approximated by a finite DOF system. When motion involving large displacements is the main objective of study (e.g. for analyzing the motion of satellites), a deformable body may be approximated as a rigid body (or even a particle) in order to simplify the analysis.

The degree of freedom of a system can be viewed as the minimum number of coordinates required to specify a configuration. Applying this definition, we have:

1.   For a single particle in a plane two coordinates define its location so it has two degrees of freedom;
2.   A single particle in space requires three coordinates so it has three degrees of freedom;
3.   Two particles in space have a combined six degrees of freedom;
4.   If two particles in space are constrained to maintain a constant distance from each other, such as in the case of a diatomic molecule, then the six coordinates must satisfy a single constraint equation defined by the distance formula. This reduces the degree of freedom of the system to five, because the distance formula can be used to solve for the remaining coordinate once the other five are specified.

Mnemonics to remember angle names

A single [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") has at most six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) _3T3R_ consisting of three translations _3T_ and three rotations _3R_.

See also [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles").

For example, the motion of a ship at sea has the six degrees of freedom of a rigid body, and is described as:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)#cite_note-2)

**Translation and rotation:**

1.   **Walking** (or **surging**): Moving forward and backward;
2.   **Strafing** (or **swaying**): Moving left and right;
3.   **Elevating** (or **heaving**): Moving up and down;
4.   **Roll rotation**: Pivots side to side;
5.   **Pitch rotation**: Tilts forward and backward;
6.   **Yaw rotation**: Swivels left and right;

For example, the trajectory of an airplane in flight has three degrees of freedom and its attitude along the trajectory has three degrees of freedom, for a total of six degrees of freedom.

*   For rolling in flight and ship dynamics, see [roll (aviation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll_(aviation) "Roll (aviation)") and [roll (ship motion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll_(ship_motion) "Roll (ship motion)"), respectively. 
    *   An important derivative is the roll rate (or roll velocity), which is the angular speed at which an aircraft can change its roll attitude, and is typically expressed in degrees per second.

*   For pitching in flight and ship dynamics, see [pitch (aviation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(aviation) "Pitch (aviation)") and [pitch (ship motion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(ship_motion) "Pitch (ship motion)"), respectively.
*   For yawing in flight and ship dynamics, see [yaw (aviation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw_(aviation) "Yaw (aviation)") and [yaw (ship motion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw_(ship_motion) "Yaw (ship motion)"), respectively. 
    *   One important derivative is the yaw rate (or yaw velocity), the angular speed of yaw rotation, measured with a [yaw rate sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw_rate_sensor "Yaw rate sensor").
    *   Another important derivative is the yawing moment, the angular momentum of a yaw rotation, which is important for [adverse yaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_yaw "Adverse yaw") in aircraft dynamics.

Physical constraints may limit the number of degrees of freedom of a single rigid body. For example, a block sliding around on a flat table has 3 DOF _2T1R_ consisting of two translations _2T_ and 1 rotation _1R_. An XYZ positioning robot like [SCARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCARA "SCARA") has 3 DOF _3T_ lower mobility.

The mobility formula counts the number of parameters that define the configuration of a set of rigid bodies that are constrained by joints connecting these bodies.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)#cite_note-Uicker2003-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)#cite_note-4)

Consider a system of _n_ rigid bodies moving in space has 6 _n_ degrees of freedom measured relative to a fixed frame. In order to count the degrees of freedom of this system, include the fixed body in the count of bodies, so that mobility is independent of the choice of the body that forms the fixed frame. Then the degree-of-freedom of the unconstrained system of _N_=_n_+1 is

![Image 4: {\displaystyle M=6n=6(N-1),\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/060c09e1a98f61ea856913c5a01a966802b96697)
because the fixed body has zero degrees of freedom relative to itself.

Joints that connect bodies in this system remove degrees of freedom and reduce mobility. Specifically, hinges and sliders each impose five constraints and therefore remove five degrees of freedom. It is convenient to define the number of constraints _c_ that a joint imposes in terms of the joint's freedom _f_, where _c_=6−_f_. In the case of a hinge or slider, which are one degree of freedom joints, have _f_=1 and therefore _c_=6−1=5.

The result is that the mobility of a system formed from _n_ moving links and _j_ joints each with freedom _f_ _i_, _i_=1,...,j, is given by

![Image 5: {\displaystyle M=6n-\sum _{i=1}^{j}\ (6-f_{i})=6(N-1-j)+\sum _{i=1}^{j}\ f_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5abdc7b32d115f1e2d550d0a7b7e7f28f34929a5)
Recall that _N_ includes the fixed link.

There are two important special cases: (i) a simple open chain, and (ii) a simple closed chain. A single open chain consists of _n_ moving links connected end to end by _n_ joints, with one end connected to a ground link. Thus, in this case _N_=_j_+1 and the mobility of the chain is

![Image 6: {\displaystyle M=\sum _{i=1}^{j}\ f_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb9d4a69c98159b45e07397ff9ced27bf22d7c8c)
For a simple closed chain, _n_ moving links are connected end-to-end by _n_+1 joints such that the two ends are connected to the ground link forming a loop. In this case, we have _N_=_j_ and the mobility of the chain is

![Image 7: {\displaystyle M=\sum _{i=1}^{j}\ f_{i}-6}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2fd9fe21b127b586d6a4e2218895b165d83db3d)
An example of a simple open chain is a serial robot manipulator. These robotic systems are constructed from a series of links connected by six one degree-of-freedom revolute or prismatic joints, so the system has six degrees of freedom.

An example of a simple closed chain is the RSSR spatial four-bar linkage. The sum of the freedom of these joints is eight, so the mobility of the linkage is two, where one of the degrees of freedom is the rotation of the coupler around the line joining the two S joints.

### Planar and spherical movement

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Planar and spherical movement")]

It is common practice to design the [linkage system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_(mechanical) "Linkage (mechanical)") so that the movement of all of the bodies are constrained to lie on parallel planes, to form what is known as a _planar linkage_. It is also possible to construct the linkage system so that all of the bodies move on concentric spheres, forming a _spherical linkage_. In both cases, the degrees of freedom of the links in each system is now three rather than six, and the constraints imposed by joints are now _c_=3−_f_.

In this case, the mobility formula is given by

![Image 8: {\displaystyle M=3(N-1-j)+\sum _{i=1}^{j}\ f_{i},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6f8284fe173a531a18790ecc7e6286acc8f8dcc)
and the special cases become

*   planar or spherical simple open chain, ![Image 9: {\displaystyle M=\sum _{i=1}^{j}\ f_{i},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6c55d7f2a070708c5420565eb568d26840a83ee1)
*   planar or spherical simple closed chain, ![Image 10: {\displaystyle M=\sum _{i=1}^{j}\ f_{i}-3.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/60d462e0d050ab64520847a1a0ccbd4d8d42217c)

An example of a planar simple closed chain is the planar [four-bar linkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-bar_linkage "Four-bar linkage"), which is a four-bar loop with four one degree-of-freedom joints and therefore has mobility _M_=1.

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Robot_arm_model_1.png/330px-Robot_arm_model_1.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Robot_arm_model_1.png)

An [articulated robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulated_robot "Articulated robot") with six DOF in a kinematic chain

A system with several bodies would have a combined DOF that is the sum of the DOFs of the bodies, less the internal constraints they may have on relative motion. A [mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(engineering) "Mechanism (engineering)") or [linkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_(mechanical) "Linkage (mechanical)") containing a number of connected rigid bodies may have more than the degrees of freedom for a single rigid body. Here the term _degrees of freedom_ is used to describe the number of parameters needed to specify the spatial pose of a linkage. It is also defined in context of the configuration space, task space and workspace of a robot.

A specific type of linkage is the open [kinematic chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematic_chain "Kinematic chain"), where a set of rigid links are connected at [joints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint "Joint"); a joint may provide one DOF (hinge/sliding), or two (cylindrical). Such chains occur commonly in [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics"), [biomechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics "Biomechanics"), and for [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellites "Satellites") and other space structures. A human arm is considered to have seven DOFs. A shoulder gives pitch, yaw, and roll, an elbow allows for pitch, and a wrist allows for pitch, yaw and roll. Only 3 of those movements would be necessary to move the hand to any point in space, but people would lack the ability to grasp things from different angles or directions. A robot (or object) that has mechanisms to control all 6 physical DOF is said to be [holonomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holonomic_(robotics)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Holonomic (robotics) (page does not exist)"). An object with fewer controllable DOFs than total DOFs is said to be non-holonomic, and an object with more controllable DOFs than total DOFs (such as the human arm) is said to be redundant. Although keep in mind that it is not redundant in the human arm because the two DOFs; wrist and shoulder, that represent the same movement; roll, supply each other since they can't do a full 360. The degree of freedom are like different movements that can be made.

In mobile robotics, a car-like robot can reach any position and orientation in 2-D space, so it needs 3 DOFs to describe its pose, but at any point, you can move it only by a forward motion and a steering angle. So it has two control DOFs and three representational DOFs; i.e. it is non-holonomic. A fixed-wing aircraft, with 3–4 control DOFs (forward motion, roll, pitch, and to a limited extent, yaw) in a 3-D space, is also non-holonomic, as it cannot move directly up/down or left/right.

A summary of formulas and methods for computing the degrees-of-freedom in mechanical systems has been given by Pennestri, Cavacece, and Vita.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)#cite_note-5)

In [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering")_degrees of freedom_ is often used to describe the number of directions in which a [phased array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array "Phased array")[antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio) "Antenna (radio)") can form either [beams or nulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming "Beamforming"). It is equal to one less than the number of elements contained in the array, as one element is used as a reference against which either constructive or destructive interference may be applied using each of the remaining antenna elements. [Radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar") practice and communication link practice, with beam steering being more prevalent for radar applications and null steering being more prevalent for interference suppression in communication links.
