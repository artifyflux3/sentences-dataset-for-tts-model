Machine translation, like DeepL or Google Translate , is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the English Wikipedia.

Consider adding a topic to this template: there are already 377 articles in the main category , and specifying |topic= will aid in categorization.

Do not translate text that appears unreliable or low-quality. If possible, verify the text with references provided in the foreign-language article.

You must provide copyright attribution in the edit summary accompanying your translation by providing an interlanguage link to the source of your translation. A model attribution edit summary is Content in this edit is translated from the existing Chinese Wikipedia article at [[:zh:舱外活动列表 (2025年之后)]]; see its history for attribution.

This list contains all spacewalks performed since the beginning of 2025 where an astronaut has fully, or partially left the spacecraft.

[ 1 ] Since 1981, NASA has measured spacewalk duration from when the suits went to internal power until the start of airlock re-pressurization.

Roscosmos and China have always used the time from hatch opening to hatch closure.

[ 1 ] These charts typically follow the agency's measurements of spacewalk duration, because those figures tend to be the most readily available, as they are most often provided by the agency.

2025–2029 spacewalks [ edit ] Spacewalk beginning and ending times are given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

2025 spacewalks [ edit ] # Start date/time Duration End time Spacecraft Crew Remarks 480 16 January 13:01 6 hours 19:01 Expedition 72 ISS Quest Nick Hague Sunita Williams Hague and Williams ventured outside and replaced the Rate Gyro Assembly Gyroscope 2 on the S0 Truss, replaced the retro reflectors on IDA 3 , installed shields on NICER to patch holes in the light shades, relocated the C2V2 cables out of the way so the astronauts and Canadarm 2 could access the worksite, tested a tool on the AMS jumpers, and photographed the AMS jumpers so they can be de-mated on a future spacewalk. As part of a get-ahead task, they inspected an ammonia vent line on Unity and inspected a foot restraint located near the Z1 Radio Antenna . This spacewalk was originally supposed to be performed by Andreas Mogensen and Loral O'Hara during Expedition 70 , but it was delayed indefinitely due to a radiator leak on Nauka .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] 481 20 January 08:55 8 hours, 17 minutes 17:12 Shenzhou 19 TSS Wentian Cai Xuzhe Song Lingdong Tasks included installation of space debris protection devices and inspections of the exterior of the TSS .

[ 4 ] 482 30 January 12:43 5 hours, 26 minutes 18:09 Expedition 72 ISS Quest Sunita Williams Barry Wilmore Wilmore and Williams successfully removed a faulty radio communications unit, although the time needed for this meant that other tasks that were scheduled for the spacewalk weren't accomplished. Williams broke the record for the woman to have spent the most on EVA, with a total of 62 hours and 6 minutes, and now ranks fourth amongst all spacewalkers.

[ 5 ] 483 1 May 13:05 5 hours, 44 minutes 18:49 Expedition 73 ISS Quest Anne McClain Nichole Ayers McClain and Ayers relocated a communications antenna, installed a mounting bracket for a future Roll Out Solar Array , installed a jumper cable to provide power from the P6 truss to the Russian Orbital Segment and removed bolts from a micrometeoroid cover.

[ 6 ] 484 26 June 07:00 6 hours, 29 minutes 13:29 Shenzhou 20 TSS Wentian Chen Dong Chen Zhongrui Tasks included installation of more space debris protection devices and inspections of the exterior, fixing damages to the TSS . They added foot restraints and EVA interface adapters on portable work platform for future EVAs.
