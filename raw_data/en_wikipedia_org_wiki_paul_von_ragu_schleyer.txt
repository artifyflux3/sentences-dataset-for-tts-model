Crans , Peter Schreiner , Clémence Corminboeuf , Michelle Coote Paul von Ragué Schleyer (February 27, 1930 – November 21, 2014) was an American physical organic chemist whose research is cited with great frequency. A 1997 survey indicated that Dr. Schleyer was, at the time, the world's third most cited chemist, with over 1100 technical papers produced.

[ 1 ] He was Eugene Higgins Professor of Chemistry at Princeton University , professor and co-director of the Institute for Organic Chemistry (Institut für organische Chemie) at the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg in Germany , and later Graham Perdue Professor of Chemistry at the University of Georgia in Athens , Georgia . He published twelve books in the fields of lithium chemistry, ab initio molecular orbital theory and carbonium ions . He was past president of the World Association of Theoretically Oriented Chemists , a fellow of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science and editor-in-chief of the Encyclopedia of Computational Chemistry .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Early life [ edit ] Born on February 27, 1930, in Cleveland , Ohio , Schleyer graduated as the valedictorian from his class at Cleveland West Technical High School in 1947. Schleyer received his A.B.

degree from Princeton University in 1951 magna cum laude . He then earned his Ph.D. degree from Harvard University in 1957, where he worked under physical organic chemist Paul Doughty Bartlett .

[ 2 ] Princeton University years [ edit ] Schleyer began teaching at Princeton in 1954 and became Eugene Higgins Professor of Chemistry there. Working within the Frick Laboratory on the Princeton campus, Schleyer was energetic both as a teacher and a researcher. While at Princeton, Schleyer married Inga Venema in 1969. During his Princeton years, Schleyer was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship , Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, a J.J.

Guggenheim Fellowship , and a Humboldt Special Fellowship. At Princeton he was always present in his combination laboratory/office until late in the evening.

[ according to whom?

] Synopsis of research and publications [ edit ] Several of his twelve monographs are collaborations with Nobel Laureates J.A. Pople , H.C. Brown and G.A. Olah . In his research, Schleyer has made contributions in the area of synthesis of adamantane and other cage molecules by rearrangement mechanisms. He also discovered new types of hydrogen bonding . Schleyer also identified solvolysis mechanisms, including reactive intermediates.

As a pioneer in the field of computational chemistry , Schleyer identified a number of new molecular structures, especially related to lithium chemistry and electron deficient systems. He has further contributed to a gamut of topics in organometallic chemistry, physical organic chemistry , inorganic chemistry and other theoretical chemical fields. His research as of 2006 was rejuvenating interest in aromaticity and investigating planar hypercoordination of carbon .

Honors [ edit ] Beyond the fellowships noted above, Schleyer received numerous prestigious honors including: University of Lyon , France Dr.

Honoris Causa , (1971) Bavarian Academy of Sciences , Fellow (1984) German Chemical Society Adolf-von-Baeyer-Prize (1986) American Chemical Society James Flack Norris Award in Physical Organic Chemistry (1987) Hungarian Chemical Society (1987) Heisenberg Medal (1987) World Association of Theoretically Oriented Chemists , President (1987) Royal Society of Chemistry , London , Christopher K.
