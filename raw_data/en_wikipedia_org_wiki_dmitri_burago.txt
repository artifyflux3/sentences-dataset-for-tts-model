He is the son of the celebrated Geometer and Russian mathematician Yuri Dmitrievich Burago , with whom he also published well known book on metric geometry. Burago studied at 45th Physics-Mathematics School . Burago received his doctorate in 1994 at Saint Petersburg State University under the supervision of Anatoly Vershik .

[ 1 ] He was at the Steklov Institute in Saint Petersburg and is now a professor at Pennsylvania State University 's Center for Dynamical Systems and Geometry.

In 1992, he was awarded the prize of the Saint Petersburg Mathematical Society . In 1998, he was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.

[ 2 ] In 2014, he was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize with Yuri Burago and Sergei Vladimirovich Ivanov for their book A course in metric geometry .
