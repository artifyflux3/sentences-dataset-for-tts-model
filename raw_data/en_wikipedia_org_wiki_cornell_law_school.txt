Boardman Hall, the old Cornell Law College building, c.

1910 History [ edit ] Entrance to Myron Taylor Hall, Cornell Law's principal building for instruction 19th century [ edit ] The Law Department at Cornell opened in 1887 in Morrill Hall with Judge Douglass Boardman as its first dean. At that time, admission did not require even a high school diploma. In 1917, two years of undergraduate education were required for admission, and in 1924, it became a graduate degree program.

[ 5 ] The department was renamed the Cornell Law School in 1925. In 1890, George Washington Fields graduated, one of the first law school graduates of color in the United States.

[ 6 ] In 1893, Cornell had its first female graduate, Mary Kennedy Brown. Future Governor, Secretary of State, and Chief Justice of the United States, Charles Evans Hughes , was a professor of law at Cornell from 1891 to 1893, and after returning to legal practice he continued to teach at the law school as a special lecturer from 1893 to 1895.  Hughes Hall, one of the law school's central buildings, is named in his honor.

In 1892, the school moved into Boardman Hall, which was constructed specifically for legal instruction. The school moved from Boardman Hall (now the site of Olin Library) to its present-day location at Myron Taylor Hall in 1932. The law school building, an ornate, Gothic structure, was the result of a donation by Myron Charles Taylor , a former CEO of US Steel , and a member of the Cornell Law class of 1894.

20th century [ edit ] Hughes Hall was built as an addition to Myron Taylor Hall and completed in 1963.  It was also funded by a gift from Taylor. Another addition to Myron Taylor Hall, the Jane M.G. Foster wing, was completed in 1988 and added more space to the library. Foster was a member of the class of 1918, an editor of the Cornell Law Review (then Cornell Law Quarterly ), and an Order of the Coif graduate.

In 1948, Cornell Law School established a program of specialization in international affairs and also started awarding LL.B. degrees.  In 1968, the school began to publish the Cornell International Law Journal .

In 1991, the school established the Berger International Legal Studies Program. In 1994, the school established a partnership with the University of Paris I law faculty to establish a Paris-based Summer Institute of International and Comparative Law.

21st century [ edit ] From 1999 to 2004 the school hosted the Feminism and Legal Theory Project . In 2006, the school established its second summer law institute in Suzhou, China. The Clarke Program in East Asian Law and Culture was established in 2002.

Hughes Hall after 2017 renovations In June 2012, the school embarked on a multi-year, multi-phase expansion and renovation. The first phase created additional classroom space underground, adjacent to Myron Taylor Hall along College Avenue. The second phase included the removal and digitization of printed materials from the library stacks so that the space could be converted into additional classroom and student space. The third phase involved converting Hughes Hall into office space.

[ 7 ] As a result, Myron Taylor Hall saw the addition of 40,000 square feet of underground classroom space. The renovation of Hughes Hall was completed in 2017.

[ 8 ] Academics [ edit ] Interior of Cornell Law School quad Degree programs [ edit ] Cornell has offered LL.M and J.S.D degrees since 1928.

In addition, Cornell has joint program arrangements with universities abroad to prepare students for international licensure: Joint program with University of Paris (La Sorbonne) (JD/Master en Droit) Joint program with Humboldt University of Berlin (JD/M.LL.P) Joint program with Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris (JD/Master in Global Business Law) The JD/Master en Droit lasts four years and prepares graduates for admission to the bar in the United States and France. The JD/M.LL.P is three years old and conveys a mastery of German and European law and practices. The JD/Master in Global Business Law lasts three years.

[ 16 ] Along with consideration of the quality of an applicant's academic record and LSAT scores, the full-file-review admissions process places a heavy emphasis on an applicant's statement, letters of recommendation, community and extracurricular involvement, and work experience. The application also invites a statement on diversity and a short note on why an applicant particularly wants to attend Cornell. The law school values applicants who have done their research and have particular interests or goals that would be served by attending the school versus one of its peer institutions.
