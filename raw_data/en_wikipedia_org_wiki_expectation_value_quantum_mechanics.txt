It can be thought of as an average of all the possible outcomes of a measurement as weighted by their likelihood, and as such it is not the most probable value of a measurement; indeed the expectation value may have zero probability of occurring (e.g. measurements which can only yield integer values may have a non-integer mean), like the expected value from statistics. It is a fundamental concept in all areas of quantum physics .

Operational definition [ edit ] Consider an operator A {\displaystyle A} . The expectation value is then ⟨ ⟨ A ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | A | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle A\rangle =\langle \psi |A|\psi \rangle } in Dirac notation with | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } a normalized state vector.

Formalism in quantum mechanics [ edit ] In quantum theory, an experimental setup is described by the observable A {\displaystyle A} to be measured, and the state σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } of the system. The expectation value of A {\displaystyle A} in the state σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } is denoted as ⟨ ⟨ A ⟩ ⟩ σ σ {\displaystyle \langle A\rangle _{\sigma }} .

Mathematically, A {\displaystyle A} is a self-adjoint operator on a separable complex Hilbert space . In the most commonly used case in quantum mechanics, σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } is a pure state , described by a normalized [ a ] vector ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } in the Hilbert space. The expectation value of A {\displaystyle A} in the state ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } is defined as ⟨ ⟨ A ⟩ ⟩ ψ ψ = ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | A | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle \langle A\rangle _{\psi }=\langle \psi |A|\psi \rangle .} 1 If dynamics is considered, either the vector ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } or the operator A {\displaystyle A} is taken to be time-dependent, depending on whether the Schrödinger picture or Heisenberg picture is used. The evolution of the expectation value does not depend on this choice, however.

If A {\displaystyle A} has a complete set of eigenvectors ϕ ϕ j {\displaystyle \phi _{j}} , with eigenvalues a j {\displaystyle a_{j}} so that A = ∑ ∑ j a j | ϕ ϕ j ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ ϕ ϕ j | , {\displaystyle A=\sum _{j}a_{j}|\phi _{j}\rangle \langle \phi _{j}|,} then ( 1 ) can be expressed as [ 1 ] ⟨ ⟨ A ⟩ ⟩ ψ ψ = ∑ ∑ j a j | ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | ϕ ϕ j ⟩ ⟩ | 2 .

{\displaystyle \langle A\rangle _{\psi }=\sum _{j}a_{j}|\langle \psi |\phi _{j}\rangle |^{2}.} 2 This expression is similar to the arithmetic mean , and illustrates the physical meaning of the mathematical formalism: The eigenvalues a j {\displaystyle a_{j}} are the possible outcomes of the experiment, [ b ] and their corresponding coefficient | ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | ϕ ϕ j ⟩ ⟩ | 2 {\displaystyle |\langle \psi |\phi _{j}\rangle |^{2}} is the probability that this outcome will occur; it is often called the transition probability .

A particularly simple case arises when A {\displaystyle A} is a projection , and thus has only the eigenvalues 0 and 1. This physically corresponds to a "yes-no" type of experiment. In this case, the expectation value is the probability that the experiment results in "1", and it can be computed as ⟨ ⟨ A ⟩ ⟩ ψ ψ = ‖ ‖ A | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ ‖ ‖ 2 .

{\displaystyle \langle A\rangle _{\psi }=\|A|\psi \rangle \|^{2}.} 3 In quantum theory, it is also possible for an operator to have a non-discrete spectrum, such as the position operator X {\displaystyle X} in quantum mechanics. This operator has a completely continuous spectrum , with eigenvalues and eigenvectors depending on a continuous parameter, x {\displaystyle x} . Specifically, the operator X {\displaystyle X} acts on a spatial vector | x ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |x\rangle } as X | x ⟩ ⟩ = x | x ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle X|x\rangle =x|x\rangle } .

[ 2 ] In this case, the vector ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } can be written as a complex-valued function ψ ψ ( x ) {\displaystyle \psi (x)} on the spectrum of X {\displaystyle X} (usually the real line). This is formally achieved by projecting the state vector | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } onto the eigenvalues of the operator, as in the discrete case ψ ψ ( x ) ≡ ≡ ⟨ ⟨ x | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\textstyle \psi (x)\equiv \langle x|\psi \rangle } . It happens that the eigenvectors of the position operator form a complete basis for the vector space of states, and therefore obey a completeness relation in quantum mechanics : ∫ ∫ | x ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ x | d x ≡ ≡ I {\displaystyle \int |x\rangle \langle x|\,dx\equiv \mathbb {I} } The above may be used to derive the common, integral expression for the expected value ( 4 ), by inserting identities into the vector expression of expected value, then expanding in the position basis: ⟨ ⟨ X ⟩ ⟩ ψ ψ = ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | X | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | I X I | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ = ∬ ∬ ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | x ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ x | X | x ′ ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ x ′ | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ d x d x ′ = ∬ ∬ ⟨ ⟨ x | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ ∗ ∗ x ′ ⟨ ⟨ x | x ′ ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ x ′ | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ d x d x ′ = ∬ ∬ ⟨ ⟨ x | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ ∗ ∗ x ′ δ δ ( x − − x ′ ) ⟨ ⟨ x ′ | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ d x d x ′ = ∫ ∫ ψ ψ ( x ) ∗ ∗ x ψ ψ ( x ) d x = ∫ ∫ x ψ ψ ( x ) ∗ ∗ ψ ψ ( x ) d x = ∫ ∫ x | ψ ψ ( x ) | 2 d x {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\langle X\rangle _{\psi }&=\langle \psi |X|\psi \rangle =\langle \psi |\mathbb {I} X\mathbb {I} |\psi \rangle \\&=\iint \langle \psi |x\rangle \langle x|X|x'\rangle \langle x'|\psi \rangle dx\ dx'\\&=\iint \langle x|\psi \rangle ^{*}x'\langle x|x'\rangle \langle x'|\psi \rangle dx\ dx'\\&=\iint \langle x|\psi \rangle ^{*}x'\delta (x-x')\langle x'|\psi \rangle dx\ dx'\\&=\int \psi (x)^{*}x\psi (x)dx=\int x\psi (x)^{*}\psi (x)dx=\int x|\psi (x)|^{2}dx\end{aligned}}} Where the orthonormality relation of the position basis vectors ⟨ ⟨ x | x ′ ⟩ ⟩ = δ δ ( x − − x ′ ) {\displaystyle \langle x|x'\rangle =\delta (x-x')} , reduces the double integral to a single integral. The last line uses the modulus of a complex valued function to replace ψ ψ ∗ ∗ ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi ^{*}\psi } with | ψ ψ | 2 {\displaystyle |\psi |^{2}} , which is a common substitution in quantum-mechanical integrals.

The expectation value may then be stated, where x is unbounded, as the formula ⟨ ⟨ X ⟩ ⟩ ψ ψ = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ x | ψ ψ ( x ) | 2 d x .

{\displaystyle \langle X\rangle _{\psi }=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }\,x\,|\psi (x)|^{2}\,dx.} 4 A similar formula holds for the momentum operator , in systems where it has continuous spectrum.

All the above formulas are valid for pure states σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } only. Prominently in thermodynamics and quantum optics , also mixed states are of importance; these are described by a positive trace-class operator ρ ρ = ∑ ∑ i p i | ψ ψ i ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ i | {\textstyle \rho =\sum _{i}p_{i}|\psi _{i}\rangle \langle \psi _{i}|} , the statistical operator or density matrix . The expectation value then can be obtained as ⟨ ⟨ A ⟩ ⟩ ρ ρ = Trace ⁡ ⁡ ( ρ ρ A ) = ∑ ∑ i p i ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ i | A | ψ ψ i ⟩ ⟩ = ∑ ∑ i p i ⟨ ⟨ A ⟩ ⟩ ψ ψ i .

{\displaystyle \langle A\rangle _{\rho }=\operatorname {Trace} (\rho A)=\sum _{i}p_{i}\langle \psi _{i}|A|\psi _{i}\rangle =\sum _{i}p_{i}\langle A\rangle _{\psi _{i}}.} 5 General formulation [ edit ] In general, quantum states σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } are described by positive normalized linear functionals on the set of observables, mathematically often taken to be a C*-algebra . The expectation value of an observable A {\displaystyle A} is then given by ⟨ ⟨ A ⟩ ⟩ σ σ = σ σ ( A ) .

{\displaystyle \langle A\rangle _{\sigma }=\sigma (A).} 6 If the algebra of observables acts irreducibly on a Hilbert space , and if σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } is a normal functional , that is, it is continuous in the ultraweak topology , then it can be written as σ σ ( ⋅ ⋅ ) = Tr ⁡ ⁡ ( ρ ρ ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle \sigma (\cdot )=\operatorname {Tr} (\rho \;\cdot )} with a positive trace-class operator ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } of trace 1. This gives formula ( 5 ) above. In the case of a pure state , ρ ρ = | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | {\displaystyle \rho =|\psi \rangle \langle \psi |} is a projection onto a unit vector ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } . Then σ σ = ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | ⋅ ⋅ ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \sigma =\langle \psi |\cdot \;\psi \rangle } , which gives formula ( 1 ) above.

A {\displaystyle A} is assumed to be a self-adjoint operator . In the general case, its spectrum will neither be entirely discrete nor entirely continuous. Still, one can write A {\displaystyle A} in a spectral decomposition , A = ∫ ∫ a d P ( a ) {\displaystyle A=\int a\,dP(a)} with a projection-valued measure P {\displaystyle P} . For the expectation value of A {\displaystyle A} in a pure state σ σ = ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | ⋅ ⋅ ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \sigma =\langle \psi |\cdot \,\psi \rangle } , this means ⟨ ⟨ A ⟩ ⟩ σ σ = ∫ ∫ a d ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | P ( a ) ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ , {\displaystyle \langle A\rangle _{\sigma }=\int a\;d\langle \psi |P(a)\psi \rangle ,} which may be seen as a common generalization of formulas ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) above.

In non-relativistic theories of finitely many particles (quantum mechanics, in the strict sense), the states considered are generally normal [ clarification needed ] . However, in other areas of quantum theory, also non-normal states are in use: They appear, for example. in the form of KMS states in quantum statistical mechanics of infinitely extended media, [ 3 ] and as charged states in quantum field theory .

[ 4 ] In these cases, the expectation value is determined only by the more general formula ( 6 ).

Example in configuration space [ edit ] As an example, consider a quantum mechanical particle in one spatial dimension, in the configuration space representation. Here the Hilbert space is H = L 2 ( R ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}=L^{2}(\mathbb {R} )} , the space of square-integrable functions on the real line. Vectors ψ ψ ∈ ∈ H {\displaystyle \psi \in {\mathcal {H}}} are represented by functions ψ ψ ( x ) {\displaystyle \psi (x)} , called wave functions . The scalar product is given by ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ 1 | ψ ψ 2 ⟩ ⟩ = ∫ ∫ ψ ψ 1 ∗ ∗ ( x ) ψ ψ 2 ( x ) d x {\textstyle \langle \psi _{1}|\psi _{2}\rangle =\int \psi _{1}^{\ast }(x)\psi _{2}(x)\,dx} . The wave functions have a direct interpretation as a probability distribution: ρ ρ ( x ) d x = ψ ψ ∗ ∗ ( x ) ψ ψ ( x ) d x {\displaystyle \rho (x)dx=\psi ^{*}(x)\psi (x)dx} gives the probability of finding the particle in an infinitesimal interval of length d x {\displaystyle dx} about some point x {\displaystyle x} .

As an observable, consider the position operator Q {\displaystyle Q} , which acts on wavefunctions ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } by ( Q ψ ψ ) ( x ) = x ψ ψ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle (Q\psi )(x)=x\psi (x).} The expectation value, or mean value of measurements, of Q {\displaystyle Q} performed on a very large number of identical independent systems will be given by ⟨ ⟨ Q ⟩ ⟩ ψ ψ = ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | Q | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ψ ψ ∗ ∗ ( x ) x ψ ψ ( x ) d x = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ x ρ ρ ( x ) d x .

{\displaystyle \langle Q\rangle _{\psi }=\langle \psi |Q|\psi \rangle =\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }\psi ^{\ast }(x)\,x\,\psi (x)\,dx=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }x\,\rho (x)\,dx.} The expectation value only exists if the integral converges, which is not the case for all vectors ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } . This is because the position operator is unbounded , and ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } has to be chosen from its domain of definition .

In general, the expectation of any observable can be calculated by replacing Q {\displaystyle Q} with the appropriate operator. For example, to calculate the average momentum, one uses the momentum operator in configuration space , p = − − i ℏ ℏ d d x {\textstyle \mathbf {p} =-i\hbar \,{\frac {d}{dx}}} . Explicitly, its expectation value is ⟨ ⟨ p ⟩ ⟩ ψ ψ = − − i ℏ ℏ ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ψ ψ ∗ ∗ ( x ) d ψ ψ ( x ) d x d x .

{\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {p} \rangle _{\psi }=-i\hbar \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }\psi ^{\ast }(x)\,{\frac {d\psi (x)}{dx}}\,dx.} Not all operators in general provide a measurable value. An operator that has a pure real expectation value is called an observable and its value can be directly measured in experiment.

For non-normalized vectors, ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } has to be replaced with ψ ψ / ‖ ‖ ψ ψ ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \psi /\|\psi \|} in all formulas.
