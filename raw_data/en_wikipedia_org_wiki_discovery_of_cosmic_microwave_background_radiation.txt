 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

The **discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation** constitutes a major development in modern [physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology"). In 1964, American physicist [Arno Allan Penzias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Allan_Penzias "Arno Allan Penzias") and radio-astronomer [Robert Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Woodrow_Wilson "Robert Woodrow Wilson") discovered the [cosmic microwave background (CMB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background"), estimating its temperature as 3.5 K, as they experimented with the [Holmdel Horn Antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmdel_Horn_Antenna "Holmdel Horn Antenna").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-PenziasWilson65CMB-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-NYT-20230905-2) The new measurements were accepted as important evidence for a hot early Universe ([Big Bang theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_theory "Big Bang theory")) and as evidence against the rival [steady state theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state_theory "Steady state theory")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-Dicke65-3) as theoretical work around 1950[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-4) showed the need for a CMB for consistency with the [simplest relativistic universe models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric "Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric"). In 1978, Penzias and Wilson were awarded the [Nobel Prize for Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_for_Physics "Nobel Prize for Physics") for their joint measurement. There had been a prior measurement of the cosmic background radiation (CMB) by [Andrew McKellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McKellar "Andrew McKellar") in 1941 at an effective temperature of 2.3 K using [CN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical "Cyano radical") stellar absorption lines observed by W. S. Adams.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-McKellar-5) Although no reference to the CMB is made by McKellar, it was not until much later[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-Thaddeus1972-6) after the Penzias and Wilson measurements, that the significance of this earlier measurement was understood.

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Bell_Labs_Horn_Antenna_Crawford_Hill_NJ.jpg/250px-Bell_Labs_Horn_Antenna_Crawford_Hill_NJ.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bell_Labs_Horn_Antenna_Crawford_Hill_NJ.jpg)

Bell Labs' Horn Antenna on Crawford Hill in Holmdel NJ – In 1964 while using the Horn Antenna, Penzias and Wilson stumbled on the microwave background radiation that permeates the universe.

By the middle of the 20th century, [cosmologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmologist "Cosmologist") had developed two different theories to explain the creation of the universe. Some supported the [steady-state theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady-state_theory "Steady-state theory"), which states that the universe has always existed and will continue to survive without noticeable change. Others believed in the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") theory, which states that the universe was created in a massive explosion-like event billions of years ago ([later determined to be approximately 13.8 billion years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe "Age of the universe")).

In 1941, Andrew McKellar used W. S. Adams' spectroscopic observations of [CN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical "Cyano radical") absorption lines in the spectrum of a B type star to measure a blackbody background temperature of 2.3 K. McKellar referred to his detection as a "'rotational' temperature of interstellar molecules", without reference to a cosmological interpretation, stating that the temperature "will have its own, perhaps limited, significance".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-McKellar-5)

Over two decades later, working at a [Bell Telephone Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Telephone_Laboratories "Bell Telephone Laboratories") facility atop [Crawford Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawford_Hill "Crawford Hill") in [Holmdel, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmdel,_New_Jersey "Holmdel, New Jersey"), in 1964, [Arno Penzias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Allan_Penzias "Arno Allan Penzias") and [Robert Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Woodrow_Wilson "Robert Woodrow Wilson") were experimenting with a supersensitive, 6 meter (20 ft) [horn antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_antenna "Horn antenna") originally built to detect [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave") bounced off [Echo balloon satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_satellite "Echo satellite").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-NYT-20230905-2) To measure these faint radio waves, they had to eliminate all recognizable [interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference "Electromagnetic interference") from their receiver. They removed the effects of [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar") and [radio broadcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_broadcasting "Radio broadcasting"), and suppressed interference from the heat in the receiver itself by cooling it with liquid [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium") to −269°C (−452.20°F), only 4 K above [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero "Absolute zero").

When Penzias and Wilson reduced their data, they found a low, steady, mysterious [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics) "Noise (electronics)") that persisted in their receiver. This residual noise was 100 times more intense than they had expected, was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. They were certain that the radiation they detected on a wavelength of 7.35 centimetres (4,080 MHz) did not come from the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), or [our galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way"). After thoroughly checking their equipment, removing some [pigeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae "Columbidae") nesting in the antenna and cleaning out the accumulated [droppings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces "Feces"), the noise remained. Both concluded that this noise was coming from outside our own galaxy—although they were not aware of any [radio source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source "Astronomical radio source") that would account for it.

At that same time, [Robert H. Dicke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Dicke "Robert H. Dicke"), [Jim Peebles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._E._Peebles "P. J. E. Peebles"), and [David Wilkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Todd_Wilkinson "David Todd Wilkinson"), [astrophysicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysicist "Astrophysicist") at [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University") just 60 km (37 mi) away, were preparing to search for [microwave radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_radiation "Microwave radiation") in this region of the spectrum. Dicke and his colleagues reasoned that the Big Bang must have scattered not only the matter that condensed into galaxies, but also must have released a tremendous blast of radiation. With the proper instrumentation, this radiation should be detectable, albeit as microwaves, due to a massive [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift").

When his friend [Bernard F. Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_F._Burke "Bernard F. Burke"), a professor of physics at [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT"), told Penzias about a preprint paper he had seen by Jim Peebles on the possibility of finding radiation left over from an explosion that filled the universe at the beginning of its existence, Penzias and Wilson began to realize the significance of what they believed was a new discovery. The characteristics of the radiation detected by Penzias and Wilson fit exactly the radiation predicted by Robert H. Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton University. Penzias called Dicke at Princeton, who immediately sent him a copy of the still-unpublished Peebles paper. Penzias read the paper and called Dicke again and invited him to Bell Labs to look at the horn antenna and listen to the background noise. Dicke, Peebles, Wilkinson and P. G. Roll interpreted this radiation as a signature of the Big Bang.

To avoid potential conflict, they decided to publish their results jointly. Two notes were rushed to the [Astrophysical Journal Letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_Journal_Letters "Astrophysical Journal Letters"). In the first, Dicke and his associates outlined the importance of cosmic background radiation as substantiation of the Big Bang Theory.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-Dicke65-3) In a second note, jointly signed by Penzias and Wilson titled, "A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 Megacycles per Second," they reported the existence of a 3.5 K residual background noise, remaining after accounting for a sky absorption component of 2.3 K and a 0.9 K instrumental component, and attributed a "possible explanation" as that given by Dicke in his companion letter.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-PenziasWilson65CMB-1)

In 1978, Penzias and Wilson were awarded the [Nobel Prize for Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_for_Physics "Nobel Prize for Physics") for their joint detection. They shared the prize with [Pyotr Kapitsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Kapitsa "Pyotr Kapitsa"), who won it for unrelated work.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-NobelPrize1978-7) In 2019, Jim Peebles was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics, “for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology”.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation#cite_note-NobelPrize2019-8)
