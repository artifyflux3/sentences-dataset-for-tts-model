Internet hunting is the practice of hunting via remotely controlled firearms that can be aimed and shot using online webcams . The first internet hunting website, Live-Shot.com, was created in 2005 by John Lockwood, who saw it as a way to provide an authentic hunting experience for disabled persons.

[ 1 ] According to the Humane Society , the operation consisted of "a fenced pen stocked with animals [where Lockwood] set up a tripod with a camera and a firearm".

[ 2 ] Almost as soon as internet hunting was introduced in the U.S. state of Texas , strong opposition to the practice developed among pro-gun and pro-hunting organizations, including the National Rifle Association and Safari Club International , as well as among animal rights and environmental groups. The majority of hunters do not consider the practice to be hunting, as it does not conform to the rules of a " fair chase ".

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] As of August 2008, forty U.S. states had enacted laws or regulations to ban internet hunting.

[ 4 ] These bans were supported by a Humane Society campaign, and according to the organization, internet hunting is no longer being practiced.

[ 3 ] Critics say internet hunting never existed as a viable industry, making much of the legislation curtailing it "a testament to public alarm over internet threats and the gilded life of legislation that nobody opposes".

[ 5 ] Advocates see the legislation as a proactive measure that may yet curb the practice, which could easily spring up in states or other countries where it is not prohibited.
