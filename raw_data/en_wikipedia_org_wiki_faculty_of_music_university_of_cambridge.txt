The Faculty of Music was established in 1947, and has this since grown into an academic centre covering all the aspects of study and research in music.

[ 1 ] The most recent Research Assessment Exercise (2008) judged research at the Faculty to be in the highest possible category (4*) for 45% of the faculty member's research output.

[ 2 ] According to The Guardian's University Guide 2013, the Faculty has the highest ratio of staff to students in any of the top-10 institutions in the country where one can study music in the UK.
