[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The work was supervised by a board of editors which included the historian Edith Johnston .

It was published as a nine-volume set in 2009 by Cambridge University Press in collaboration with the Royal Irish Academy (RIA), and contained about 9,000 entries.

[ 1 ] The 2009 version of the dictionary was also published online via a digital subscription and was predominantly used by academics, researchers, and civil servants. An online version is now open access , having been launched on 17 March 2021 (St. Patrick's Day), and new entries are added to that version periodically. Funding is from the Higher Education Authority , Department of Foreign Affairs , and Dublin City Council Libraries.

[ 2 ] The biographies range from 200-15,000 words in length, with about 11,000 entries in total as of March 2021.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] For subjects to be eligible for inclusion, they must be deceased for at least five years and must either be born on the island of Ireland or have had a significant career there.
