That is, a preclosure operator obeys only three of the four Kuratowski closure axioms .

Definition [ edit ] A preclosure operator on a set X {\displaystyle X} is a map [ ] p {\displaystyle [\ \ ]_{p}} [ ] p : P ( X ) → → P ( X ) {\displaystyle [\ \ ]_{p}:{\mathcal {P}}(X)\to {\mathcal {P}}(X)} where P ( X ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(X)} is the power set of X .

{\displaystyle X.} The preclosure operator has to satisfy the following properties: [ ∅ ∅ ] p = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle [\varnothing ]_{p}=\varnothing \!} (Preservation of nullary unions ); A ⊆ ⊆ [ A ] p {\displaystyle A\subseteq [A]_{p}} (Extensivity); [ A ∪ ∪ B ] p = [ A ] p ∪ ∪ [ B ] p {\displaystyle [A\cup B]_{p}=[A]_{p}\cup [B]_{p}} (Preservation of binary unions).

The last axiom implies  the following: 4.

A ⊆ ⊆ B {\displaystyle A\subseteq B} implies [ A ] p ⊆ ⊆ [ B ] p {\displaystyle [A]_{p}\subseteq [B]_{p}} .

Topology [ edit ] A set A {\displaystyle A} is closed (with respect to the preclosure) if [ A ] p = A {\displaystyle [A]_{p}=A} .  A set U ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle U\subset X} is open (with respect to the preclosure) if its complement A = X ∖ ∖ U {\displaystyle A=X\setminus U} is closed. The collection of all open sets generated by the preclosure operator is a topology ; [ 1 ] however, the above topology does not capture the notion of convergence associated to the operator, one should consider a pretopology , instead.

[ 2 ] Examples [ edit ] Premetrics [ edit ] Given d {\displaystyle d} a premetric on X {\displaystyle X} , then [ A ] p = { x ∈ ∈ X : d ( x , A ) = 0 } {\displaystyle [A]_{p}=\{x\in X:d(x,A)=0\}} is a preclosure on X .

{\displaystyle X.} Sequential spaces [ edit ] The sequential closure operator [ ] seq {\displaystyle [\ \ ]_{\text{seq}}} is a preclosure operator. Given a topology T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} with respect to which the sequential closure operator is defined, the topological space ( X , T ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {T}})} is a sequential space if and only if the topology T seq {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}_{\text{seq}}} generated by [ ] seq {\displaystyle [\ \ ]_{\text{seq}}} is equal to T , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}},} that is, if T seq = T .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}_{\text{seq}}={\mathcal {T}}.} See also [ edit ] Eduard Čech References [ edit ] ^ Eduard Čech, Zdeněk Frolík, Miroslav Katětov, Topological spaces Prague: Academia, Publishing House of the Czechoslovak Academy of
