The existence of the exponential map is one of the primary reasons that Lie algebras are a useful tool for studying Lie groups.

The ordinary exponential function of mathematical analysis is a special case of the exponential map when G {\displaystyle G} is the multiplicative group of positive real numbers (whose Lie algebra is the additive group of all real numbers). The exponential map of a Lie group satisfies many properties analogous to those of the ordinary exponential function, however, it also differs in many important respects.

Definitions [ edit ] Let G {\displaystyle G} be a Lie group and g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} be its Lie algebra (thought of as the tangent space to the identity element of G {\displaystyle G} ). The exponential map is a map exp : : g → → G {\displaystyle \exp \colon {\mathfrak {g}}\to G} which can be defined in several different ways. The typical modern definition is this: Definition : The exponential of X ∈ ∈ g {\displaystyle X\in {\mathfrak {g}}} is given by exp ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) = γ γ ( 1 ) {\displaystyle \exp(X)=\gamma (1)} where γ γ : : R → → G {\displaystyle \gamma \colon \mathbb {R} \to G} is the unique one-parameter subgroup of G {\displaystyle G} whose tangent vector at the identity is equal to X {\displaystyle X} .

It follows easily from the chain rule that exp ⁡ ⁡ ( t X ) = γ γ ( t ) {\displaystyle \exp(tX)=\gamma (t)} . The map γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } , a group homomorphism from ( R , + ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,+)} to G {\displaystyle G} , may be constructed as the integral curve of either the right- or left-invariant vector field associated with X {\displaystyle X} . That the integral curve exists for all real parameters follows by right- or left-translating the solution near zero.

We have a more concrete definition in the case of a matrix Lie group . The exponential map coincides with the matrix exponential and is given by the ordinary series expansion: exp ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) = ∑ ∑ k = 0 ∞ ∞ X k k !

= I + X + 1 2 X 2 + 1 6 X 3 + ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle \exp(X)=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {X^{k}}{k!}}=I+X+{\frac {1}{2}}X^{2}+{\frac {1}{6}}X^{3}+\cdots } , where I {\displaystyle I} is the identity matrix . Thus, in the setting of matrix Lie groups, the exponential map is the restriction of the matrix exponential to the Lie algebra g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} of G {\displaystyle G} .

Comparison with Riemannian exponential map [ edit ] If G {\displaystyle G} is compact, it has a Riemannian metric invariant under left and right translations, then the Lie-theoretic exponential map for G {\displaystyle G} coincides with the exponential map of this Riemannian metric .

For a general G {\displaystyle G} , there will not exist a Riemannian metric invariant under both left and right translations. Although there is always a Riemannian metric invariant under, say, left translations, the exponential map in the sense of Riemannian geometry for a left-invariant metric will not in general agree with the exponential map in the Lie group sense. That is to say, if G {\displaystyle G} is a Lie group equipped with a left- but not right-invariant metric, the geodesics through the identity will not be one-parameter subgroups of G {\displaystyle G} [ citation needed ] .

Other definitions [ edit ] Other equivalent definitions of the Lie-group exponential are as follows: It is the exponential map of a canonical left-invariant affine connection on G , such that parallel transport is given by left translation. That is, exp ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) = γ γ ( 1 ) {\displaystyle \exp(X)=\gamma (1)} where γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is the unique geodesic with the initial point at the identity element and the initial velocity X (thought of as a tangent vector).

It is the exponential map of a canonical right-invariant affine connection on G . This is usually different from the canonical left-invariant connection, but both connections have the same geodesics (orbits of 1-parameter subgroups acting by left or right multiplication) so give the same exponential map.

The Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence also gives the definition: for X ∈ ∈ g {\displaystyle X\in {\mathfrak {g}}} , the mapping t ↦ ↦ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( t X ) {\displaystyle t\mapsto \exp(tX)} is the unique Lie group homomorphism ( R , + ) → → G {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,+)\to G} corresponding to the Lie algebra homomorphism R → → g {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \to {\mathfrak {g}}} , t ↦ ↦ t X .

{\displaystyle t\mapsto tX.} The exponential map is characterized by the differential equation d d t exp ⁡ ⁡ ( t X ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( t X ) ⋅ ⋅ X {\textstyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\exp(tX)=\exp(tX)\cdot X} , where the right side uses the translation mapping g = T e G → → T g G , X ↦ ↦ g ⋅ ⋅ X {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}=T_{e}G\to T_{g}G,\ X\mapsto g\cdot X} for g = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( t X ) {\displaystyle g=\exp(tX)} . In the one-dimensional case, this is equivalent to exp ′ ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) {\displaystyle \exp '(x)=\exp(x)} .

Examples [ edit ] The unit circle centered at 0 in the complex plane is a Lie group (called the circle group ) whose tangent space at 1 can be identified with the imaginary line in the complex plane, { i t : t ∈ ∈ R } .

{\displaystyle \{it:t\in \mathbb {R} \}.} The exponential map for this Lie group is given by i t ↦ ↦ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( i t ) = e i t = cos ⁡ ⁡ ( t ) + i sin ⁡ ⁡ ( t ) , {\displaystyle it\mapsto \exp(it)=e^{it}=\cos(t)+i\sin(t),\,} that is, the same formula as the ordinary complex exponential .

More generally, for complex torus [ 1 ] : 8 X = C n / Λ Λ {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {C} ^{n}/\Lambda } for some integral lattice Λ Λ {\displaystyle \Lambda } of rank n {\displaystyle n} (so isomorphic to Z n {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{n}} ) the torus comes equipped with a universal covering map π π : C n → → X {\displaystyle \pi :\mathbb {C} ^{n}\to X} from the quotient by the lattice. Since X {\displaystyle X} is locally isomorphic to C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} as complex manifolds , we can identify it with the tangent space T 0 X {\displaystyle T_{0}X} , and the map π π : T 0 X → → X {\displaystyle \pi :T_{0}X\to X} corresponds to the exponential map for the complex Lie group X {\displaystyle X} .

In the quaternions H {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} } , the set of quaternions of unit length form a Lie group (isomorphic to the special unitary group SU (2) ) whose tangent space at 1 can be identified with the space of purely imaginary quaternions, { i t + j u + k v : t , u , v ∈ ∈ R } .

{\displaystyle \{it+ju+kv:t,u,v\in \mathbb {R} \}.} The exponential map for this Lie group is given by w := ( i t + j u + k v ) ↦ ↦ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( i t + j u + k v ) = cos ⁡ ⁡ ( | w | ) 1 + sin ⁡ ⁡ ( | w | ) w | w | .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {w} :=(it+ju+kv)\mapsto \exp(it+ju+kv)=\cos(|\mathbf {w} |)1+\sin(|\mathbf {w} |){\frac {\mathbf {w} }{|\mathbf {w} |}}.\,} This map takes the 2-sphere of radius R inside the purely imaginary quaternions to { s ∈ ∈ S 3 ⊂ ⊂ H : Re ⁡ ⁡ ( s ) = cos ⁡ ⁡ ( R ) } {\displaystyle \{s\in S^{3}\subset \mathbf {H} :\operatorname {Re} (s)=\cos(R)\}} , a 2-sphere of radius sin ⁡ ⁡ ( R ) {\displaystyle \sin(R)} (cf.

Exponential of a Pauli vector ). Compare this to the first example above.

Let V be a finite dimensional real vector space and view it as a Lie group under the operation of vector addition. Then Lie ⁡ ⁡ ( V ) = V {\displaystyle \operatorname {Lie} (V)=V} via the identification of V with its tangent space at 0, and the exponential map exp : Lie ⁡ ⁡ ( V ) = V → → V {\displaystyle \operatorname {exp} :\operatorname {Lie} (V)=V\to V} is the identity map, that is, exp ⁡ ⁡ ( v ) = v {\displaystyle \exp(v)=v} .

In the split-complex number plane z = x + y ȷ ȷ , ȷ ȷ 2 = + 1 , {\displaystyle z=x+y\jmath ,\quad \jmath ^{2}=+1,} the imaginary line { ȷ ȷ t : t ∈ ∈ R } {\displaystyle \lbrace \jmath t:t\in \mathbb {R} \rbrace } forms the Lie algebra of the unit hyperbola group { cosh ⁡ ⁡ t + ȷ ȷ sinh ⁡ ⁡ t : t ∈ ∈ R } {\displaystyle \lbrace \cosh t+\jmath \ \sinh t:t\in \mathbb {R} \rbrace } since the exponential map is given by ȷ ȷ t ↦ ↦ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ȷ ȷ t ) = cosh ⁡ ⁡ t + ȷ ȷ sinh ⁡ ⁡ t .

{\displaystyle \jmath t\mapsto \exp(\jmath t)=\cosh t+\jmath \ \sinh t.} Properties [ edit ] Elementary properties of the exponential [ edit ] For all X ∈ ∈ g {\displaystyle X\in {\mathfrak {g}}} , the map γ γ ( t ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( t X ) {\displaystyle \gamma (t)=\exp(tX)} is the unique one-parameter subgroup of G {\displaystyle G} whose tangent vector at the identity is X {\displaystyle X} . It follows that: exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ( t + s ) X ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( t X ) exp ⁡ ⁡ ( s X ) {\displaystyle \exp((t+s)X)=\exp(tX)\exp(sX)\,} exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − X ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) − − 1 .

{\displaystyle \exp(-X)=\exp(X)^{-1}.\,} More generally: exp ⁡ ⁡ ( X + Y ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) exp ⁡ ⁡ ( Y ) , if [ X , Y ] = 0 {\displaystyle \exp(X+Y)=\exp(X)\exp(Y),\quad {\text{if }}[X,Y]=0} .

[ 2 ] The preceding identity does not hold in general; the assumption that X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} commute is important.

The image of the exponential map always lies in the identity component of G {\displaystyle G} .

The exponential near the identity [ edit ] The exponential map exp : : g → → G {\displaystyle \exp \colon {\mathfrak {g}}\to G} is a smooth map . Its differential at zero, exp ∗ ∗ : : g → → g {\displaystyle \exp _{*}\colon {\mathfrak {g}}\to {\mathfrak {g}}} , is the identity map (with the usual identifications).

It follows from the inverse function theorem that the exponential map, therefore, restricts to a diffeomorphism from some neighborhood of 0 in g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} to a neighborhood of 1 in G {\displaystyle G} .

[ 3 ] It is then not difficult to show that if G is connected, every element g of G is a product of exponentials of elements of g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} : [ 4 ] g = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( X 1 ) exp ⁡ ⁡ ( X 2 ) ⋯ ⋯ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( X n ) , X j ∈ ∈ g {\displaystyle g=\exp(X_{1})\exp(X_{2})\cdots \exp(X_{n}),\quad X_{j}\in {\mathfrak {g}}} .

Globally, the exponential map is not necessarily surjective. Furthermore, the exponential map may not be a local diffeomorphism at all points. For example, the exponential map from s o {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}} (3) to SO(3) is not a local diffeomorphism; see also cut locus on this failure. See derivative of the exponential map for more information.

Surjectivity of the exponential [ edit ] In these important special cases, the exponential map is known to always be surjective: G is connected and compact, [ 5 ] G is connected and nilpotent (for example, G connected and abelian), or G = G L n ( C ) {\displaystyle G=GL_{n}(\mathbb {C} )} .

[ 6 ] For groups not satisfying any of the above conditions, the exponential map may or may not be surjective.

The image of the exponential map of the connected but non-compact group SL 2 ( R ) is not the whole group. Its image consists of C -diagonalizable matrices with eigenvalues either positive or with modulus 1, and of non-diagonalizable matrices with a repeated eigenvalue 1, and the matrix − − I {\displaystyle -I} . (Thus, the image excludes matrices with real, negative eigenvalues, other than − − I {\displaystyle -I} .) [ 7 ] Exponential map and homomorphisms [ edit ] Let ϕ ϕ : : G → → H {\displaystyle \phi \colon G\to H} be a Lie group homomorphism and let ϕ ϕ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \phi _{*}} be its derivative at the identity. Then the following diagram commutes : [ 8 ] In particular, when applied to the adjoint action of a Lie group G {\displaystyle G} , since Ad ∗ ∗ = ad {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ad} _{*}=\operatorname {ad} } , we have the useful identity: [ 9 ] A d exp ⁡ ⁡ X ( Y ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( a d X ) ( Y ) = Y + [ X , Y ] + 1 2 !

[ X , [ X , Y ] ] + 1 3 !

[ X , [ X , [ X , Y ] ] ] + ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle \mathrm {Ad} _{\exp X}(Y)=\exp(\mathrm {ad} _{X})(Y)=Y+[X,Y]+{\frac {1}{2!}}[X,[X,Y]]+{\frac {1}{3!}}[X,[X,[X,Y]]]+\cdots } .

Logarithmic coordinates [ edit ] Given a Lie group G {\displaystyle G} with Lie algebra g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} , each choice of a basis X 1 , … … , X n {\displaystyle X_{1},\dots ,X_{n}} of g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} determines a coordinate system near the identity element e for G , as follows. By the inverse function theorem , the exponential map exp : N → → ∼ ∼ U {\displaystyle \operatorname {exp} :N{\overset {\sim }{\to }}U} is a diffeomorphism from some neighborhood N ⊂ ⊂ g ≃ ≃ R n {\displaystyle N\subset {\mathfrak {g}}\simeq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} of the origin to a neighborhood U {\displaystyle U} of e ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle e\in G} . Its inverse: log : U → → ∼ ∼ N ⊂ ⊂ R n {\displaystyle \log :U{\overset {\sim }{\to }}N\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is then a coordinate system on U . It is called by various names such as logarithmic coordinates, exponential coordinates or normal coordinates. See the closed-subgroup theorem for an example of how they are used in applications.

Remark : The open cover { U g | g ∈ ∈ G } {\displaystyle \{Ug|g\in G\}} gives a structure of a real-analytic manifold to G such that the group operation ( g , h ) ↦ ↦ g h − − 1 {\displaystyle (g,h)\mapsto gh^{-1}} is real-analytic.
