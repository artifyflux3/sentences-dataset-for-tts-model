Citizenship Canadian Alma mater Princeton University Scientific career Fields Representation theory Automorphic forms Geometric combinatorics Structure of algebraic groups Institutions University of British Columbia Doctoral advisor Goro Shimura William Allen Casselman (born November 27, 1941) is an American Canadian mathematician who works in representation theory and automorphic forms . He is a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia .

[ 1 ] He is closely connected to the Langlands program and has been involved in posting all of the work of Robert Langlands on the internet.

[ 2 ] Career [ edit ] Casselman did his undergraduate work at Harvard College where his advisor was Raoul Bott and received his Ph.D from Princeton University in 1966 where his advisor was Goro Shimura . He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1974, 1983, and 2001.

[ 3 ] He emigrated to Canada in 1971 and is a professor emeritus in mathematics at the University of British Columbia .

[ 1 ] Research [ edit ] Casselman specializes in representation theory , automorphic forms , geometric combinatorics , and the structure of algebraic groups . He has an interest in mathematical graphics [ 4 ] and has been the graphics editor of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society since January, 2001.

[ 5 ] Awards [ edit ] In 2012, he became one of the inaugural fellows of the American Mathematical Society .
