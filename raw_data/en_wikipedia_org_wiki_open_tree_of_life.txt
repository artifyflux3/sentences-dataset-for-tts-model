[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The first draft, including 2.3 million species, was released in September 2015.

[ 4 ] The Interactive graph allows the user to zoom in to taxonomic classifications, phylogenetic trees, and information about a node. Clicking on a species will return its source and reference taxonomy.

The tree of life at the node Eukaryota Approach [ edit ] The project uses a supertree approach to generate a single phylogenetic tree (served at tree.opentreeoflife.org [ 5 ] ) from a comprehensive taxonomy and a curated set of published phylogenetic estimates.

The taxonomy is a combination of several large classifications produced by other projects; it is created using a software tool called "smasher".

[ 6 ] The resulting taxonomy is called an Open Tree Taxonomy (OTT) and can be browsed on-line.

[ 7 ] History [ edit ] The project was started in June 2012 with a three-year NSF award to researchers at ten universities. In 2015, a two-year supplemental award was made to researchers at three institutions.
