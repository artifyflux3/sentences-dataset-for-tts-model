Marian ; FIN : 506 ; also known as the Roma family ) is a collisional asteroid family located in the inner parts of the intermediate asteroid belt , near the 1:3 Kirkwood gap . The family consist of several thousand  stony S-type asteroids . It is named after its parent body and lowest numbered member, the asteroid 170 Maria .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] : 23 It is also known as the Roma family , named after its alternative parent body, 472 Roma .

[ 3 ] The family was initially identified by Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama in 1918.

[ 1 ] Asteroids in this family typically have a semi-major axis between 2.52−2.62 AU , and an inclination of 12 to 17 ° .

[ 4 ] Members [ edit ] The family consists of 2940 known members based on the HCM method . Its largest members are the asteroids 170 Maria and 472 Roma .

[ 2 ] : 23 A complete synthetic HCM-listing for all members can be obtained by using the Ferret Interactive Search .

Instead, it may have been spalled off from 6 Hebe , or its parent body.
