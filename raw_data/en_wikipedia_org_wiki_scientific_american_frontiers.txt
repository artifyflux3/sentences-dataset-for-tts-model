of episodes 96 Production Production company Chedd-Angier Production Company Original release Network PBS Release October 1, 1990 ( 1990-10-01 ) – April 13, 2005 ( 2005-04-13 ) Scientific American Frontiers is an American documentary television series that aired on PBS from October 1, 1990, to April 13, 2005. The show is a companion program to the Scientific American magazine, and primarily covers new technology and discoveries in science and medicine. The Chedd-Angier Production Company, which had recently produced Discover: The World of Science , [ 1 ] produced the show for PBS. Frontiers typically aired once every two to four weeks.

Hosts [ edit ] The show premiered on October 1, 1990, with MIT professor Woodie Flowers hosting until the spring of 1993.

[ 2 ] Actor Alan Alda became the permanent host from the fall season of 1993 and continued until the show ended in 2005.

[ 3 ] The show was also billed as Alan Alda in Scientific American Frontiers .

[ 4 ] In one segment, Alda became car sick while driving an experimental, virtual reality vehicle. In 2005, in his memoir, Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: and Other Things I've Learned , Alda recalls his intestines becoming strangulated while in the mountains of Chile for the show, an incident in which he nearly died due to the remote location.

Format [ edit ] Most programs include three short documentaries, but some shows follow a different pattern. Some young viewers of the program later appeared as adult guests in later series, stating that the program inspired them to continue their scientific pursuits. The shows are now available online at the Chedd-Angier website.
