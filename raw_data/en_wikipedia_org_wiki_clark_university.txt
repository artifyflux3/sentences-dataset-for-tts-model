Founded in 1887 with a large endowment from its namesake Jonas Gilman Clark , a prominent businessman, Clark was one of the first modern research universities in the United States.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Originally an all-graduate institution, Clark's first undergraduates entered in 1902 and women were first enrolled in 1942.

[ 9 ] The university offers 46 majors, minors, and concentrations in the humanities , social sciences , natural sciences , and engineering and allows students to design specialized majors and engage in pre-professional programs.

[ 10 ] It is a member of the Higher Education Consortium of Central Massachusetts , which enables students to cross-register at other Worcester institutions including the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the College of the Holy Cross .

Clark is classified among "R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity".

[ 11 ] It was a founding member of the Association of American Universities , but departed in 1999. The university competes intercollegiately in 17 NCAA Division III varsity sports as the Clark Cougars and is a part of the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference . Clark faculty, alumni, and affiliates have included business executives and inventors of the wind chill factor and the birth control pill .

[ 12 ] History [ edit ] Founding and early history [ edit ] On January 17, 1887, successful American businessman Jonas Gilman Clark announced his intention to found and endow a university in the city of Worcester, filing a petition in the Massachusetts Legislature requesting a charter for Clark University.

[ 13 ] An Act of Incorporation was duly enacted by the legislature and signed by the governor on March 31 of that same year. Clark University was to incorporate the best features of universities in continental Europe and America, particularly Cornell University and Johns Hopkins .

[ 14 ] Clark was a friend of Leland Stanford and was inspired by the plans for Stanford University , as well as Cornell and Johns Hopkins. Clark founded the university with an endowment of one million dollars, and later added another million dollars because he feared the university might someday face a lack of funds.

[ 15 ] Opening on October 2, 1889, Clark was the first all-graduate university in the United States, with departments in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology.

[ 16 ] Faculty of the "Psychological" department in 1893 includes Franz Boas (seated, second from left) and president G. Stanley Hall (seated, middle).

Edmund Sanford is seated to the right of Hall.

G. Stanley Hall was appointed the first president of Clark University in 1888. He had been a professor of psychology and pedagogy at Johns Hopkins University , which had been founded just a few years prior and was quickly becoming a model of the modern research university . Hall spent seven months in Europe visiting other universities and recruiting faculty. He became the founder of the American Psychological Association and earned the first PhD in psychology in the United States at Harvard. Clark has played a prominent role in the development of psychology as a distinguished discipline in the United States ever since.

Franz Boas , founder of American cultural anthropology and adviser for the first PhD in anthropology which was granted at Clark in 1891, [ 17 ] taught at Clark from 1888 until 1892 when he resigned in a dispute with President Hall over academic freedom and joined the faculty of Columbia University .

Albert A. Michelson , the first American to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics , best known for his involvement in the Michelson–Morley experiment , which measured the speed of light, was a professor from 1889 to 1892 before becoming head of the physics department at the University of Chicago .

The use of many of these buildings has changed since this postcard was printed around the middle of the 20th century Jonas G. Clark died in 1900, leaving gifts to the university and campus library, but reserving half of his estate for the foundation of an undergraduate college. This had been strongly opposed by President Hall in years past, but Clark College opened in 1902, managed independently of Clark University. Clark College and Clark University had different presidents until Hall's retirement in 1920. Clark University began admitting women after Clark's death, and the first female PhD in psychology was awarded in 1908. Early PhD students in psychology were ethnically diverse, with several early graduates being Japanese. In 1920, Francis Sumner became the first African American to earn a PhD in psychology.

[ 18 ] Clark University, along with Stanford and Johns Hopkins, was one of the fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities , an organization of universities with the most prestigious profiles in research and graduate education, and was one of only three New England universities, along with Harvard and Yale , to be a founding member.

[ 19 ] Clark withdrew its membership in 1999, citing a conflict with its mission.

[ 20 ] Clark Lectures [ edit ] Group photo 1909 in front of Clark University. Front row: Sigmund Freud , G. Stanley Hall , Carl Jung ; back row: Abraham A. Brill , Ernest Jones , Sándor Ferenczi .

In order to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Clark's opening, President Hall invited a number of leading thinkers to the university.

[ 21 ] Among them was Sigmund Freud who, accompanied by Carl Jung , delivered his five famous "Clark Lectures" there over the course of five days in September 1909, introducing psychoanalysis to an American audience.

[ 22 ] This was Freud's only visit to the United States. Clark granted Freud an honorary degree, which hangs in the Sigmund Freud House in Vienna, Austria. It was one of the few official distinctions Freud received during his lifetime.

[ 23 ] Later history [ edit ] In the 1920s Robert Goddard , a pioneer of rocketry, considered one of the founders of space and missile technology, was chairman of the Physics Department.

[ 24 ] The Robert H. Goddard Library is named for him.

The Graduate School of Management (GSOM) was founded in 1982. In 1997, Clark announced the first PhD program in Holocaust Studies in the United States. This after the university convinced Debórah Dwork to leave Yale University and become Clark's first professor of Holocaust studies in the prior year.

[ 25 ] 2000s [ edit ] The Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise was established in fall 2007 due to a founding gift from two Clark alumni, William '76 and Jane '75 Mosakowski.

[ 26 ] U.S. Secretary of State and former senator and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke at Clark University on February 4, 2008, to an audience of approximately 3,500 in the Kneller Athletic Center.

[ 27 ] In March 2009, Clark University convened a first-of-its-kind National Conference on Liberal Education and Effective Practice, co-sponsored by Clark's Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise and the Association of American Colleges and Universities .

[ 28 ] In April 2009, then-President John Bassett denied Clark University Students for Palestinian Rights, a student group, permission to bring Norman Finkelstein to speak about the " Gaza Massacre " (2008–2009 Gaza War) because Finkelstein "would invite controversy and not dialogue or understanding". He also cited a conflict in scheduling regarding a conference on Holocaust and Genocide Studies presented by the university in the same month.

[ 29 ] However, following protests, which included a public protest in the center of campus, a petition campaign and outreach by alumni, students and faculty, Basset reversed his decision and allowed Finkelstein to speak on April 27, the last day of classes for the semester. Finkelstein spoke to around 400 students, faculty and community members in Atwood Hall.

[ 30 ] In April 2010, Clark University received the largest gift in its 123-year history, a $14.2 million offering from the late head of Hanover Insurance , one of the nation's biggest property and casualty insurers. The gift from John Adam is intended to strengthen Clark's graduate programs in education, promote college-readiness among minority students and bolster its research profile related to urban education. This donation created the Adams Education Fund, which will enhance Clark's nationally recognized model for urban secondary education and reform, teacher-training, and community education partnerships.

[ 31 ] On July 1, 2010, former provost David Angel became the ninth president of Clark, succeeding John Bassett, who went on to become president of Heritage University , located on the Yakama Indian Reservation in Toppenish, Washington .

[ 32 ] Clark University has an ongoing renovation project that will cover several buildings. In the summer of 2010, overhauls occurred in Bullock and Wright Hall dormitories.

[ 33 ] In summer 2012, Clark University underwent more renovations. The city of Worcester allowed the university to close Downing Street to unite the campus.

[ 34 ] The area was landscaped to become a pedestrian plaza. Johnson and Sanford halls were united to become the Johnson Sanford Center featuring new social, study, and multimedia spaces. The project included addition of an outdoor roof terrace and an elevator to all levels.

[ 35 ] The university has recently begun a project called LEEP to connect students and the world of academia to practical experience.

[ 36 ] Alumni and Student Engagement Center Summer 2016 saw the completion of a new Alumni and Student Engagement Center building, extending the campus across Main Street. The facility is a mixed-use building containing administrative offices, lecture halls, meeting rooms, and some retail space, and features a modern architectural look and a rooftop solar array.

[ 37 ] In 2022, graduate students at the university organized as Clark University Graduate Workers United, a chapter of Teamsters Local 170. An NLRB-overseen election resulted in a 100–7 vote in favor of unionization, after which the union and university entered into negotiations.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] On October 3, 2022, the graduate workers' union began an indefinite strike over wages, benefits, and working conditions that continued until that Friday, October 7, when the union and the university announced a tentative agreement on a contract.

[ 40 ] On the following Wednesday, October 13, the union unanimously ratified the contract, which took effect immediately.

[ 41 ] Campus [ edit ] Jonas Clark Hall, the main academic facility for undergraduate students Atwood Hall, the largest lecture hall on campus Harrington House, the home of Clark presidents Lasry Center for Bioscience The campus is located on Main Street in the Main South neighborhood about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of downtown Worcester and 40 miles (64 km) west of Boston . The campus is compact, with most of the major buildings located within the space of a single city block.

[ 42 ] The center of campus is known as the Green. The Green is a hub for student activity, and is where most Clarkies spend their time during the warm months. It is the location of Spree Day, the welcome back BBQ, several clubs' events and graduation. The buildings surrounding The Green include Atwood Hall, Jefferson Academic Center, Higgins University Center, Jonas Clark Hall, and the Goddard Library.

Administrative offices are housed in small buildings along Woodland Street, as is the president's house. The new Shaich Family Alumni and Student Engagement Center, named in honor of a $5 million gift from the family of alumnus Ron Shaich, is across Main Street and houses meeting spaces and offices.

[ 43 ] Academic facilities [ edit ] Jonas Clark Hall, built in 1887, was Clark University's first building. It occupies the center of campus and houses the economics, psychology and education departments. Located in the basement of Jonas Clark Hall is the university's cogeneration plant which allows the university to recycle waste heat from electrical generation into hot water, heat, and steam. It was updated in 2013 to a more efficient 2.0 kWh natural gas engine.

[ 44 ] Estabrook Hall, located on Woodland Street, is the second oldest building on Clark's campus. Originally constructed as a dormitory, it now functions as the language center and the music center. The upper floors are primarily home to classrooms and offices for the Language, Literature, and Culture department, which includes Spanish, French, German, Latin, and Hebrew.

[ 45 ] The bottom floor and basement are practice rooms and music halls.

The Jefferson Academic Center houses various social science departments including Women's Studies, Geography, History, Geographical Information Sciences, Political Science, and Sociology.

Atwood Hall, attached to the Jefferson Academic Center, is the primary theater on campus and seats 658.

[ 46 ] Atwood Hall originally served as the chapel for the university, and in recent decades has been the scene for several notable concerts and speeches. The Grateful Dead (1967 and 1969), the Jimi Hendrix Experience (1968), Janis Joplin (1969), and Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band (1974) have all played here.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] A March 15, 1968, concert by the Jimi Hendrix Experience was professionally recorded and released in 1999 as Live at Clark University . In 1963, student D'Army Bailey invited Malcolm X to speak here.

Noam Chomsky spoke here on the topic of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Arab Spring April 12, 2011.

[ 49 ] It was the first-ever lecture given on a Spree Day at Clark. On October 16, 2014, President Bill Clinton spoke in Atwood as a supporter of Martha Coakley 's run for Governor of Massachusetts.

[ citation needed ] The Lasry Center for Bioscience (named for hedge fund manager Marc Lasry and his wife Cathy, both alumni) houses the biology department. It received a LEED Gold certification for its energy efficiency.

The Little Center is the alternate performing arts venue, with its largest room, the Michelson Theater seating 120.

[ 50 ] The Academic Commons, also known as the AC, acts as a study area and lounge for the students, and incorporates a Sodexo coffeehouse named Jazzmans, a quiet study area, a computer room, and the Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprises. The Goddard Library is upstairs from the Academic Commons and houses more than 375,000 volumes.

[ 51 ] Libraries [ edit ] Libraries Robert H. Goddard Library Traina Center for the Arts, located in the former Downing Street School Carlson Hall Clark University has 4 libraries.

Kasperson Research Library, which focuses on environmental research The Fuller Resource Library at the Traina Center for the Arts, with performing arts media in its collection Athletic facilities [ edit ] The Kneller Athletic Center houses the basketball courts, swimming pool, racquet ball courts, handball courts, and the James and Ada B. Bickman Fitness Center which was opened in 1995 and completely renovated in 2013. Major campus events, such as International Gala, the fall concert, and first year orientation are usually held in the Kneller as the basketball courts are the largest rooms on campus and can accommodate the entire student body. The Thomas M. '62 and Joan E. '60 Dolan Field House opened in May 2003 at which time the Russ Granger Athletic Fields and Corash Tennis Courts around it were reconfigured and renovated.

[ 53 ] The Boys and Girls Club Track and Field opened in October 2016.

Housing [ edit ] Bullock Hall Students entering Clark must live on campus for the first two years unless their primary address is within 25 miles (40 km) of campus. The residence halls at Clark are organized by those who live there: First Year Experience halls (Dana, Hughes, Bullock, and Wright) Mixed class halls (Johnson-Sanford Center) Single sex hall (Dodd—female and non-binary only) Suite-style and apartment-style halls (Maywood and Blackstone) Clark owns apartments that, while outside of the main campus area, exclusively house Clark students.

The first Clark "residence halls" (Wright and Bullock) opened in 1959. Before that time, Estabrook Hall was the men's dormitory and small women's dorms stood in the current location of Little Center and Bullock Hall. Blackstone, the newest of the halls, opened in 2007.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] As of fall 2007, gender blind/neutral housing is an option at Clark, meaning that students of different genders can room together.

[ 56 ] Clark University released its Climate Action Plan December 15, 2009, detailing strategies for the university to reduce its carbon footprint while strengthening many of its existing sustainability practices. The plan sets two goals with respect to climate neutrality: First is an interim goal of reducing emissions to 20 percent below 2005-levels by 2015. The second goal is to achieve climate neutrality (net zero greenhouse gas emissions) by the year 2030.

[ 71 ] Clark University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education .

[ 72 ] In recent years, Clark has received widespread media coverage for its "Fifth-Year Free" program. Under Clark's BA/MA program with the fifth year free, undergraduates who maintain a B+ average are eligible for tuition-free enrollment in its one-year graduate programs, meaning that they can get a Master of Arts degree for the price of a bachelor's degree. Students apply to master's degree programs in their junior year, begin meeting requirements in their senior year and typically complete those requirements in the fifth year. Bachelor's degrees are granted en route to the master's degree.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] Student life [ edit ] Student body composition as of April 16, 2023 Race and ethnicity [ 89 ] Total White 62% Hispanic 10% Foreign national 9% Asian 7% Black 5% Other [ a ] 7% Economic diversity Low-income [ b ] 35% Affluent [ c ] 65% Student body [ edit ] As of fall 2019, Clark's student body comprised 2,349 undergraduates and 1,149 graduate and professional students.

[ 4 ] International students make up 11.5% of undergraduates.

[ 4 ] In addition, 21% of the undergraduate student body is classified as ALANA (Asian-, Latino-, African-, and Native-American) and 61% of undergraduates are female.

[ 4 ] Residential life [ edit ] The majority of the undergraduate student body, 66%, lives on campus.

[ 71 ] Clark requires undergraduates to do so for their first two years, with first-years being assigned housing based on their responses to a Housing Preferences Form.

[ 90 ] Once first-years have been assigned housing, a seniority system, whereby seniors have the first choice of spaces left, juniors have the second, and sophomores the third, ensures that seniors and juniors are usually able to live on campus if they wish to. Nonetheless, some choose to live in off-campus apartments in the immediate neighborhood of Clark, along with the graduate students outside the 1% that live on campus.

[ 71 ] Student organizations [ edit ] There are more than 130 student clubs and organizations at Clark.

[ 90 ] All these are headed by the Clark Undergraduate Student Council which disseminates more than $750,000 in budgets to the various clubs and their events.

Media and publications [ edit ] The Scarlet is Clark University's student newspaper. It is published weekly and has four sections: News, Opinions, Living Arts, and Sports.

[ 91 ] Clark's literary magazine, Caesura , is published annually and features artwork, poetry, prose, essays, and creative non-fiction submitted by undergraduate and graduate students.

[ 92 ] STIR Magazine , Clark's life, culture, and style magazine was founded by Diana Levine as a student project in 2004.

STIR began with a three-person staff and in black and white, and now has about 30 core students who contribute to its production in full color.

[ 93 ] The Scholarly Undergraduate Research Journal ( SURJ ) is Clark's student-run undergraduate research journal. It publishes undergraduate academic work and is intended to provide undergraduates with "experiences in the peer review and academic publication processes." [ 94 ] Peer reviewers consist of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty.

The Freudian Slip, is a satire/humor publication founded in 2015. It publishes semi-weekly satirical articles about local and worldwide events. It is also the first university publication published exclusively online.

[ 95 ] There is also a student-run internet radio station, Radio of Clark University (ROCU), with over 100 student DJs.

[ 96 ] Events [ edit ] Spree Day originated in 1903 to coincide with St. Patrick's Day.

[ 97 ] It is traditional to not tell first-year students about Spree Day. Instead, the Senior class awakens the first-years by running through the quads outside of the residence halls banging pots and pans.

While Spree Day is a day of recreation, Clark University also holds the Academic Spree Day annually during Spring semester. This academic event is when Clark undergraduates present their research and creative work.

[ 98 ] Clark and the community [ edit ] In 1985, the university engaged in a partnership with community groups and business organizations to revitalize Clark neighborhoods. Its efforts in the University Park Partnership program include refurbishing dilapidated or abandoned homes, reselling them to area residents, and subsidizing mortgages for new home buyers.

In 1997, Clark opened a secondary public school, the University Park Campus School (UPCS), that is also a professional development school for Clark's teacher education program. Because of its long hours and demanding curricula, UPCS has been lauded as a model for collaboration between a university and an urban district. Students are able to attend Clark University free of charge upon graduation, provided they meet certain residency and admissions requirements. In the May 16, 2005, issue of Newsweek , UPCS was named the 68th best high school in the nation. UPCS was featured in a page-one story entitled "Town-grown triumph: In poorest part of Worcester, Clark helps put children on path to college" of the November 22, 2007, edition of The Boston Globe .

[ 99 ] The UPCS collaborative is one of several sponsored by Clark's Jacob Hiatt Center for Urban Education focused on urban teacher education and school reform.

Research [ edit ] Clark has seven research institutes and centers.

The William and Jane Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise seeks to improve through the successful mobilization of use-inspired research the effectiveness of government and other institutions in addressing social concerns. The institute focuses on important social issues, including focal areas such as education reform, environmental sustainability, access to healthcare, human development, well-being and global change.

[ 26 ] The George Perkins Marsh Institute conducts collaborative, interdisciplinary research on human-environment relationships and the human dimensions of global environmental change.

[ 100 ] The Strassler Family Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies an interdisciplinary center, founded in 1998, [ 101 ] which focuses on the causes and effects of Holocausts and Genocides around the world.
