The system is time-invariant if and only if y 2 ( t ) = y 1 ( t – t 0 ) for all time t , for all real constant t 0 and for all input x 1 ( t ) .

In control theory , a time-invariant ( TI ) system has a time-dependent system function that is not a direct function of time. Such systems are regarded as a class of systems in the field of system analysis . The time-dependent system function is a function of the time-dependent input function . If this function depends only indirectly on the time-domain (via the input function, for example), then that is a system that would be considered time-invariant. Conversely, any direct dependence on the time-domain of the system function could be considered as a "time-varying system".

Mathematically speaking, "time-invariance" of a system is the following property: [ 4 ] : p. 50 Given a system with a time-dependent output function ⁠ y ( t ) {\displaystyle y(t)} ⁠ , and a time-dependent input function ⁠ x ( t ) {\displaystyle x(t)} ⁠ , the system will be considered time-invariant if a time-delay on the input ⁠ x ( t + δ δ ) {\displaystyle x(t+\delta )} ⁠ directly equates to a time-delay of the output ⁠ y ( t + δ δ ) {\displaystyle y(t+\delta )} ⁠ function. For example, if time ⁠ t {\displaystyle t} ⁠ is "elapsed time", then "time-invariance" implies that the relationship between the input function ⁠ x ( t ) {\displaystyle x(t)} ⁠ and the output function ⁠ y ( t ) {\displaystyle y(t)} ⁠ is constant with respect to time ⁠ t : {\displaystyle t:} ⁠ y ( t ) = f ( x ( t ) , t ) = f ( x ( t ) ) .

{\displaystyle y(t)=f(x(t),t)=f(x(t)).} In the language of signal processing , this property can be satisfied if the transfer function of the system is not a direct function of time except as expressed by the input and output.

In the context of a system schematic, this property can also be stated as follows, as shown in the figure to the right: If a system is time-invariant then the system block commutes with an arbitrary delay.

If a time-invariant system is also linear , it is the subject of linear time-invariant theory (linear time-invariant) with direct applications in NMR spectroscopy , seismology , circuits , signal processing , control theory , and other technical areas.

Nonlinear time-invariant systems lack a comprehensive, governing theory.

Discrete time-invariant systems are known as shift-invariant systems . Systems which lack the time-invariant property are studied as time-variant systems .

Simple example [ edit ] To demonstrate how to determine if a system is time-invariant, consider the two systems: System A: y ( t ) = t x ( t ) {\displaystyle y(t)=tx(t)} System B: y ( t ) = 10 x ( t ) {\displaystyle y(t)=10x(t)} Since the System Function y ( t ) {\displaystyle y(t)} for system A explicitly depends on t outside of x ( t ) {\displaystyle x(t)} , it is not time-invariant because the time-dependence is not explicitly a function of the input function.

In contrast, system B's time-dependence is only a function of the time-varying input x ( t ) {\displaystyle x(t)} . This makes system B time-invariant .

The Formal Example below shows in more detail that while System B is a Shift-Invariant System as a function of time, t , System A is not.

Formal example [ edit ] A more formal proof of why systems A and B above differ is now presented. To perform this proof, the second definition will be used.

System A: Start with a delay of the input x d ( t ) = x ( t + δ δ ) {\displaystyle x_{d}(t)=x(t+\delta )} y ( t ) = t x ( t ) {\displaystyle y(t)=tx(t)} y 1 ( t ) = t x d ( t ) = t x ( t + δ δ ) {\displaystyle y_{1}(t)=tx_{d}(t)=tx(t+\delta )} Now delay the output by δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } y ( t ) = t x ( t ) {\displaystyle y(t)=tx(t)} y 2 ( t ) = y ( t + δ δ ) = ( t + δ δ ) x ( t + δ δ ) {\displaystyle y_{2}(t)=y(t+\delta )=(t+\delta )x(t+\delta )} Clearly y 1 ( t ) ≠ ≠ y 2 ( t ) {\displaystyle y_{1}(t)\neq y_{2}(t)} , therefore the system is not time-invariant.

System B: Start with a delay of the input x d ( t ) = x ( t + δ δ ) {\displaystyle x_{d}(t)=x(t+\delta )} y ( t ) = 10 x ( t ) {\displaystyle y(t)=10x(t)} y 1 ( t ) = 10 x d ( t ) = 10 x ( t + δ δ ) {\displaystyle y_{1}(t)=10x_{d}(t)=10x(t+\delta )} Now delay the output by δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } y ( t ) = 10 x ( t ) {\displaystyle y(t)=10x(t)} y 2 ( t ) = y ( t + δ δ ) = 10 x ( t + δ δ ) {\displaystyle y_{2}(t)=y(t+\delta )=10x(t+\delta )} Clearly y 1 ( t ) = y 2 ( t ) {\displaystyle y_{1}(t)=y_{2}(t)} , therefore the system is time-invariant.

More generally, the relationship between the input and output is y ( t ) = f ( x ( t ) , t ) , {\displaystyle y(t)=f(x(t),t),} and its variation with time is d y d t = ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ t + ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ x d x d t .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} x}{\mathrm {d} t}}.} For time-invariant systems, the system properties remain constant with time, ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ t = 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}=0.} Applied to Systems A and B above: f A = t x ( t ) ⟹ ⟹ ∂ ∂ f A ∂ ∂ t = x ( t ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle f_{A}=tx(t)\qquad \implies \qquad {\frac {\partial f_{A}}{\partial t}}=x(t)\neq 0} in general, so it is not time-invariant, f B = 10 x ( t ) ⟹ ⟹ ∂ ∂ f B ∂ ∂ t = 0 {\displaystyle f_{B}=10x(t)\qquad \implies \qquad {\frac {\partial f_{B}}{\partial t}}=0} so it is time-invariant.

Abstract example [ edit ] We can denote the shift operator by T r {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} _{r}} where r {\displaystyle r} is the amount by which a vector's index set should be shifted. For example, the "advance-by-1" system x ( t + 1 ) = δ δ ( t + 1 ) ∗ ∗ x ( t ) {\displaystyle x(t+1)=\delta (t+1)*x(t)} can be represented in this abstract notation by x ~ ~ 1 = T 1 x ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {x}}_{1}=\mathbb {T} _{1}{\tilde {x}}} where x ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {x}}} is a function given by x ~ ~ = x ( t ) ∀ ∀ t ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle {\tilde {x}}=x(t)\forall t\in \mathbb {R} } with the system yielding the shifted output x ~ ~ 1 = x ( t + 1 ) ∀ ∀ t ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle {\tilde {x}}_{1}=x(t+1)\forall t\in \mathbb {R} } So T 1 {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} _{1}} is an operator that advances the input vector by 1.

Suppose we represent a system by an operator H {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} } . This system is time-invariant if it commutes with the shift operator, i.e., T r H = H T r ∀ ∀ r {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} _{r}\mathbb {H} =\mathbb {H} \mathbb {T} _{r}\forall r} If our system equation is given by y ~ ~ = H x ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {y}}=\mathbb {H} {\tilde {x}}} then it is time-invariant if we can apply the system operator H {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} } on x ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {x}}} followed by the shift operator T r {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} _{r}} , or we can apply the shift operator T r {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} _{r}} followed by the system operator H {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} } , with the two computations yielding equivalent results.

Applying the system operator first gives T r H x ~ ~ = T r y ~ ~ = y ~ ~ r {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} _{r}\mathbb {H} {\tilde {x}}=\mathbb {T} _{r}{\tilde {y}}={\tilde {y}}_{r}} Applying the shift operator first gives H T r x ~ ~ = H x ~ ~ r {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} \mathbb {T} _{r}{\tilde {x}}=\mathbb {H} {\tilde {x}}_{r}} If the system is time-invariant, then H x ~ ~ r = y ~ ~ r {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} {\tilde {x}}_{r}={\tilde {y}}_{r}} See also [ edit ] Finite impulse response Sheffer sequence State space (controls) Signal-flow graph LTI system theory Autonomous system (mathematics) References [ edit ] ^ Bessai, Horst J.
