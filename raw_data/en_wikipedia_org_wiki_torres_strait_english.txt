Torres Strait English (called by its speakers T.I. English )  is a dialect of the English language spoken by the people of various backgrounds (indigenous Torres Strait Islanders , Malay, Filipino, European, Japanese, etc.) born and raised on Thursday Island and neighbouring islands in Torres Strait, North Queensland , Australia . It is distinct from Torres Strait Creole , though most locals speak both the creole and English. Quite a few locals are also speakers of General Australian English .

Its main phonological characteristic is the retention of English [iː] and [uː] where Australian English has [əi] and [əu] (for example, wheel [ˈwiːl] rather than [ˈwəil] , fool [ˈfuːl] rather than [ˈfəul] ), while where grammar and the like are concerned, Torres Strait English shows a certain amount of post-Creole characteristics, such as the phrase You for [adjective] (e.g.

You for style!

) for the English You look/are really [adjective] ( You are a real show-off!

, alt.

You are real cool!

), and the almost mandatory use of second personal pronouns in the imperative.  Other characteristics of T.I. English follow general non-standard dialects of English such as the use of done for did , run for ran , come for came (i.e. a four-way verb system of present-past-infinitive—ing-form for all verbs), and oncet for once .  This is a non-rhotic accent , like Australian and New Zealand dialects.

T.I. English is not a post-creole form, but rather an independent development from the English of the early European settlers, most of whom were from various parts of the world.  Relatively few were native-born White Australians.  The input dialects were British of various types including Irish, Jamaican and others.  Substratum languages include Malay, Japanese, Chinese, Jamaican Creole, Samoan, Brokan and so on.
