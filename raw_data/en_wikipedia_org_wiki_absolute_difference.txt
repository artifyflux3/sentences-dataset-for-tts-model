The absolute difference of two real numbers x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} is given by | x − − y | {\displaystyle |x-y|} , the absolute value of their difference . It describes the distance on the real line between the points corresponding to x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} , and is a special case of the L p distance for all 1 ≤ ≤ p ≤ ≤ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle 1\leq p\leq \infty } . Its applications in statistics include the absolute deviation from a central tendency .

Properties [ edit ] Absolute difference has the following properties: For x ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle x\geq 0} , | x − − 0 | = x {\displaystyle |x-0|=x} (zero is the identity element on non-negative numbers) [ 1 ] For all x {\displaystyle x} , | x − − x | = 0 {\displaystyle |x-x|=0} (every element is its own inverse element ) [ 1 ] | x − − y | ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle |x-y|\geq 0} (non-negativity) [ 2 ] | x − − y | = 0 {\displaystyle |x-y|=0} if and only if x = y {\displaystyle x=y} (nonzero for distinct arguments).

[ 2 ] | x − − y | = | y − − x | {\displaystyle |x-y|=|y-x|} ( symmetry or commutativity ).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] | x − − z | ≤ ≤ | x − − y | + | y − − z | {\displaystyle |x-z|\leq |x-y|+|y-z|} (the triangle inequality ); [ 2 ] [ 3 ] equality holds if and only if x ≤ ≤ y ≤ ≤ z {\displaystyle x\leq y\leq z} or x ≥ ≥ y ≥ ≥ z {\displaystyle x\geq y\geq z} .

Because it is non-negative, nonzero for distinct arguments, symmetric, and obeys the triangle inequality, the real numbers form a metric space with the absolute difference as its distance, the familiar measure of distance along a line.

[ 4 ] It has been called "the most natural metric space", [ 5 ] and "the most important concrete metric space".

[ 2 ] This distance generalizes in many different ways to higher dimensions, as a special case of the L p distances for all 1 ≤ ≤ p ≤ ≤ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle 1\leq p\leq \infty } , including the p = 1 {\displaystyle p=1} and p = 2 {\displaystyle p=2} cases ( taxicab geometry and Euclidean distance , respectively). It is also the one-dimensional special case of hyperbolic distance .

Instead of | x − − y | {\displaystyle |x-y|} , the absolute difference may also be expressed as max ( x , y ) − − min ( x , y ) .

{\displaystyle \max(x,y)-\min(x,y).} Generalizing this to more than two values, in any subset S {\displaystyle S} of the real numbers which has an infimum and a supremum , the absolute difference between any two numbers in S {\displaystyle S} is less or equal then the absolute difference of the infimum and supremum of S {\displaystyle S} .

The absolute difference takes non-negative integers to non-negative integers. As a binary operation that is commutative but not associative, with an identity element on the non-negative numbers, the absolute difference gives the non-negative numbers (whether real or integer) the algebraic structure of a commutative magma with identity.

[ 1 ] Applications [ edit ] The absolute difference is used to define the relative difference , the absolute difference between a given value and a reference value divided by the reference value itself.

[ 6 ] In the theory of graceful labelings in graph theory , vertices are labeled by natural numbers and edges are labeled by the absolute difference of the numbers at their two vertices. A labeling of this type is graceful when the edge labels are distinct and consecutive from 1 to the number of edges.

[ 7 ] As well as being a special case of the L p distances, absolute difference can be used to define Chebyshev distance (L ∞ ), in which the distance between points is the maximum or supremum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.

[ 8 ] In statistics, the absolute deviation of a sampled number from a central tendency is its absolute difference from the center, the average absolute deviation is the average of the absolute deviations of a collection of samples, and least absolute deviations is a method for robust statistics based on minimizing the average absolute deviation.
