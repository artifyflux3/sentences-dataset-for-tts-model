**Linda Siobhan Sparke** is a British astronomer known for her research on the structure and dynamics of [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy"). She is a professor emerita of astronomy at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison "University of Wisconsin–Madison"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-em-1) and Explorers Program Scientist in the [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") Astrophysics Division.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-legacy-2)

Education and career
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linda_Sparke&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Education and career")]

Sparke was born in London, and read mathematics as an undergraduate at the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-em-1)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-nasa-3) She completed a Ph.D. in astronomy in 1981 from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley"); her dissertation was _Swirling Gas Flows in Elliptical Galaxies_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-diss-4)

After postdoctoral research at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study "Institute for Advanced Study"), the University of Cambridge, and the [Kapteyn Astronomical Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapteyn_Astronomical_Institute "Kapteyn Astronomical Institute"), she became a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-nasa-3) She retired in 2010 to become a professor emeritus,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-em-1) served as a program manager at the [National Science Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation "National Science Foundation") for two years,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-legacy-2) and became research program manager in astrophysics at NASA[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-fnn-5) and later Explorers Program Scientist at NASA.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-legacy-2)

With [John Gallagher III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gallagher_III "John Gallagher III"), Sparke is the author of the undergraduate textbook _Galaxies in the Universe: an Introduction_ (Cambridge University Press, 2000; 2nd ed., 2006).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-gu-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-chambliss-7)

Sparke was elected as a [Fellow of the American Physical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_Physical_Society_Fellows_(1998%E2%80%932010) "List of American Physical Society Fellows (1998–2010)") in 2002, after a nomination from the APS Division of Astrophysics. The fellowship citation noted her "studies of the structure and dynamics of galaxies, using orbital motions to probe both time-steady and time-varying gravitational potentials, and the distribution of dark matter".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-fa-8) In 2020 she was named a Fellow of the [American Astronomical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society "American Astronomical Society") (AAS), as one of 200 Legacy Fellows named to start the AAS Fellows program.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-legacy-2)

Her book _Galaxies in the Universe: an Introduction_ won the [Chambliss Astronomical Writing Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambliss_Astronomical_Writing_Award "Chambliss Astronomical Writing Award") of the [American Astronomical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society "American Astronomical Society") in 2008.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-nasa-3)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sparke#cite_note-chambliss-7)
