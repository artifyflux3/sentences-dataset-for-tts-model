She is a professor emerita of astronomy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison , [ 1 ] and Explorers Program Scientist in the NASA Astrophysics Division.

[ 2 ] Education and career [ edit ] Sparke was born in London, and read mathematics as an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge .

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] She completed a Ph.D. in astronomy in 1981 from the University of California, Berkeley ; her dissertation was Swirling Gas Flows in Elliptical Galaxies .

[ 4 ] After postdoctoral research at the Institute for Advanced Study , the University of Cambridge, and the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute , she became a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

[ 3 ] She retired in 2010 to become a professor emeritus, [ 1 ] served as a program manager at the National Science Foundation for two years, [ 2 ] and became research program manager in astrophysics at NASA [ 5 ] and later Explorers Program Scientist at NASA.

[ 2 ] Book [ edit ] With John Gallagher III , Sparke is the author of the undergraduate textbook Galaxies in the Universe: an Introduction (Cambridge University Press, 2000; 2nd ed., 2006).

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Recognition [ edit ] Sparke was elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2002, after a nomination from the APS Division of Astrophysics. The fellowship citation noted her "studies of the structure and dynamics of galaxies, using orbital motions to probe both time-steady and time-varying gravitational potentials, and the distribution of dark matter".

[ 8 ] In 2020 she was named a Fellow of the American Astronomical Society (AAS), as one of 200 Legacy Fellows named to start the AAS Fellows program.

[ 2 ] Her book Galaxies in the Universe: an Introduction won the Chambliss Astronomical Writing Award of the American Astronomical Society in 2008.
