20,000 [ 2 ] (2023) Parent Pearson plc Website pearson .com Pearson Education , known since 2011 as simply Pearson , is the educational publishing and services subsidiary of the international corporation Pearson plc . The subsidiary was formed in 1998, when Pearson plc acquired Simon & Schuster 's educational business and combined it with Pearson's existing education company Addison-Wesley Longman .

[ 1 ] Pearson Education was restyled as simply Pearson in 2011.

[ 3 ] In 2016, the diversified parent corporation Pearson plc rebranded to focus entirely on education publishing and services; [ 4 ] as of 2023, Pearson Education is Pearson plc's main subsidiary.

[ 5 ] In 2019, Pearson Education began phasing out the prominence of its hard-copy textbooks in favor of digital textbooks, which cost the company far less, and can be updated frequently and easily.

[ 6 ] As of 2023, Pearson Education has testing/teaching centers in over 55 countries worldwide; the UK and the U.S. have the most centers.

[ 5 ] The headquarters of parent company Pearson plc are in London, England.

[ 5 ] Pearson Education's U.S. headquarters were in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey until the headquarters were closed at the end of 2014.

[ 7 ] Most of Pearson Education's printing is done by third-party suppliers.

[ 5 ] Company history [ edit ] Following the British government's acquisition and nationalization of several of Pearson 's aviation, fuel, and energy divisions in the early 1940s, [ 8 ] [ 9 ] the diversified multinational conglomerate entered the education market.

[ 10 ] It acquired the textbook publisher Longman in 1968.

[ 10 ] In the late 1980s and 1990s, Pearson plc divested further from a number of its industries and acquired more educational publishing companies, and its education publishing operations became steadily larger and more significant.

[ 8 ] [ 11 ] In 1988, Pearson plc purchased Addison-Wesley , the sixth-largest publisher of textbooks in the U.S., [ 12 ] and merged it with Pearson's educational books subsidiary Longman to create Addison-Wesley Longman.

[ 13 ] [ 11 ] In 1996, it acquired HarperCollins Educational Publishing and merged it with Addison-Wesley Longman.

[ 14 ] Marjorie Scardino , who was CEO of Pearson plc from 1997 to 2013, increasingly focused the conglomerate on education and on making education acquisitions.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] In 1998, Pearson plc purchased the education division of Simon & Schuster , which included Prentice Hall , Allyn & Bacon , [ 17 ] [ 18 ] and parts of Macmillan Inc.

including the Macmillan name.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Later in 1998, it merged Simon & Schuster's educational business with Addison Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education .

[ 1 ] Pearson Education sold and divested most of its Simon & Schuster divisions in 1999.

[ 21 ] It sold Silver Burdett Ginn Religion, a Catholic publishing division it operated under the Scott Foresman imprint, to RCL Benziger in 2007.

[ 24 ] According to the company, as of 2023, it delivers numerous skills tests and certification tests electronically in over 180 countries.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] Pearson Education was rebranded as simply Pearson in 2011, [ 3 ] and split into Pearson North America and Pearson International.

[ 27 ] A restructuring announced in 2013 combined Pearson North America and Pearson International into one Pearson company [ 28 ] organised around three global lines of business: School, Higher Education, and Professional.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Following the sale of its financial news publications Financial Times and The Economist in 2015, Pearson plc rebranded in January 2016 to focus solely on education, and the corporation adopted a new logo.

[ 4 ] The logo is the unconventional symbol known as the interrobang (‽), a combination of a question mark and an exclamation point, and the logo is meant to convey a "combination of excitement, curiosity and individuality" [ 4 ] and "the excitement and fun of learning".

[ 31 ] In 2019, Pearson announced it would begin the process of phasing out the publishing of printed textbooks, in a plan to move into a more digital first strategy.

[ 6 ] E-textbooks will be updated frequently, while printed books will be updated less often.

[ 6 ] Students wanting printed books will need to rent them.

[ 6 ] As of 2019, the firm received more than half of its annual revenues from digital sales, [ 6 ] and the US accounted for 20 percent of Pearson's annual revenue coming from courseware.

[ 6 ] In 2019, Pearson sold its US K-12 courseware business to the private equity firm Nexus Capital Management, [ 32 ] [ 33 ] which rebranded it as Savvas Learning Company.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] In 2019, Pearson also sold its remaining 25% stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann .

[ 36 ] In 2022, Pearson Education announced that they intended to sell their digital textbooks as NFTs , in order to profit from secondhand sales.

[ 47 ] In 2001, the Pearson Technology Group and O'Reilly Media LLC formed a joint partnership called Safari Books Online , to offer a web-based electronic library of technical and business books from InformIT's imprint partners and O'Reilly Media .

[ 48 ] The InformIT Network offers access to this service via its web sites.

[ 51 ] In 2006, Pearson School Systems, a division of Pearson Education, acquired PowerSchool, a student information system, from Apple ; terms of the deal were not disclosed.

[ 53 ] In 2007, the company developed the youth-oriented online quest game Poptropica , through its Family Education Network. In 2015, Pearson's Family Education Network, along with Poptropica, were sold to the London-based investment group Sandbox Partners.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] In 2019, Cogmed was transferred back to the original founders.

[ 59 ] In 2016, Pearson acquired StatCrunch , a statistical analysis tool created by Webster West in 1997. Pearson had already been the primary distributor of StatCrunch for several years.

[ 60 ] Partnerships [ edit ] In 2007, Pearson partnered with four other higher-education publishers to create CourseSmart , a company developed to sell college textbooks in eTextbook format on a common platform.

[ 61 ] In 2011, Pearson obtained a five-year, $32 million contract with the New York State Department of Education to design tests for students in grades 3–8.

[ 62 ] Que Publishing, a publishing imprint of Pearson based out of Seattle, partnered with AARP in 2014 to develop and add to a series of technology books for seniors.

[ 63 ] The series, which includes My iPad For Seniors, and My Social Media for Seniors, are large-print and colourful.

[ 63 ] Criticism [ edit ] See also: Pearson plc § Criticism Errors in tests [ edit ] In the spring of 2012, tests that Pearson designed for the NYSED were found to contain over 30 errors, which caused controversy. One of the most prominent featured a passage about a talking pineapple on the 8th Grade ELA test (revealed to be based on Daniel Pinkwater 's The Story of the Rabbit and the Eggplant , with the eggplant changed into a pineapple). After public outcry, the NYSED announced it would not count the questions in scoring.

[ 64 ] Other errors included a miscalculated question on the 8th Grade Mathematics test regarding astronomical units , a 4th grade math question with two possible correct answers, errors in the 6th grade ELA scoring guide, and over twenty errors on foreign-language math tests.
