It existed in its initial form from 1970 until 1996, when most of it became Kahurangi National Park . Since then, the remainder of the forest park has been made up of many disparate and unconnected areas around the perimeter of the national park.

History [ edit ] Beginning in 1920, forest parks were gazetted north of the Buller River . In the end, there were thirteen separate forest parks. The northernmost eight of those parks were gazetted as the North-west Nelson Forest Park in 1970.

[ 1 ] The North-west Nelson Forest Park covered approximately 360,000 ha (890,000 acres) of land. The forest park was managed by the New Zealand Forest Service . In 1970, many of the tracks in the park were overgrown. The Forest Service started on a programme of work to promote recreation in the park, including cutting new tracks and building huts.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In 1987, the Forest Service was amalgamated with other organisations and became the Department of Conservation , which took over the management of the state forests.

[ 4 ] From the 1970s, mining companies explored within the forest park and that led to public requests to give the area the higher protection of a national park .

[ 1 ] The proposal that created most concern was Coronado Global Resources' application to bulldoze a track to the Mount Arthur Tablelands.

[ 5 ] Much of the forest park plus parts of Mt Owen and Matiri State Forests became Kahurangi National Park in 1996.

[ 1 ] Around 60 land parcels of the North-west Nelson Forest Park were excluded from Kahurangi National Park for a variety of reasons. These include hydro stations, grazing leases, sphagnum moss gathering areas, and mining operations or interests.

[ 1 ] As a result, remaining areas of North-west Nelson Forest Park are highly fragmented.

[ 6 ] The largest of those excluded parcels is the Taitapu Block, some 28,000 ha (69,000 acres) surrounding Lake Otuhie south of Mangarakau , as it was subject to a Waitangi claim .
