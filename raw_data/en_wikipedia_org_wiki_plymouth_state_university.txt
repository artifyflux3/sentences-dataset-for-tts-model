As of fall 2020, Plymouth State University enrolls 4,491 students (3,739 undergraduate students and 752 graduate students).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The school was founded as Plymouth Normal School in 1871. Since that time, it has evolved to a teachers college, a state college, and finally to a state university in 2003. PSU is part of the University System of New Hampshire .

History [ edit ] The current Plymouth State University traces its origins to 1871, when the state of New Hampshire acquired the Holmes Plymouth Academy to become a teachers college, the "Plymouth Normal School". The school would go through two more name changes over the subsequent century, becoming the "Plymouth Teachers College" in 1939 and the "Plymouth State College" in 1963. In between these name changes in 1948, the school expanded its curriculum to include graduate degrees. The college gained university status from the state in 2003, thus adopting its current name, "Plymouth State University".

[ 4 ] Academics [ edit ] Undergraduate demographics as of Fall 2023 [ 5 ] Race and ethnicity Total White 79% Two or more races 6% Hispanic 5% Unknown 5% Black 2% International student 2% Asian 1% Economic diversity Low-income [ a ] 27% Affluent [ b ] 73% The university offers BA, BFA, BS, MA, MAT, MBA, MS, and MEd degrees, the Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies (CAGS), and the Doctor of Education (EdD) in Learning, Leadership, and Community. Plymouth State is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education , the New Hampshire Postsecondary Education Commission, and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). Program-specific accreditations include the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE) for athletic training; Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) for undergraduate and graduate degrees; the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) for social work; the Society of Public Health Education and the American Association of Health Education (SOPHE/AAHE) for health education; and the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) for the Master of Education in Counselor Education, including mental health counseling and school counseling concentrations.

The university currently has 19 academic departments. Within each department there are several different study options and degree programs. The most popular majors at Plymouth State are business and education. Other popular majors include physical education, health education, art, social science, psychology, and communication studies. In 2011, Plymouth State University added a BS in nursing degree to its list of available programs of study.

[ 6 ] Beginning in fall of 2017, the university switched to a "cluster model" with seven interdisciplinary areas instead of academic departments or colleges. The clusters are: Arts and technology Education, democracy and social change Exploration and discovery Health and human enrichment Innovation and entrepreneurship Justice and security Tourism, environment and sustainable development The cluster approach is designed to encourage collaboration and communication in the application of solving problems and innovating for the digital age.

[ 7 ] The cluster model is championed by university president Donald Birx who was hired in 2015 after creating cluster models at other colleges and universities at which he previously worked.

[ 8 ] Facilities [ edit ] Rounds Hall Ellen Reed House Rounds Hall, with its iconic clock tower, was built in 1890 and named for Principal Charles Collins Rounds, who, as enrollment grew, strongly advocated for construction of a new classroom building. Today, Rounds Hall houses the university's education departments. An annual tradition called Pumpkins on Rounds has been ongoing since 1975.

In spring 1923, Plymouth Normal School opened Samuel Read Hall Dormitory, named after a teacher educator who taught at Holmes Plymouth Academy in the late 1830s. The facility is now focused on human and environmental health.

Built in 1974, Hyde Hall is named for Plymouth State's 10th president, Harold E. Hyde, whose 26-year tenure from 1951 to 1977 was a period of growth for the institution in both number of students and in campus facilities. Today, Hyde Hall is home to academic programs.

Boyd Science Center is the heart of scientific research and study at PSU. The building, named for longtime science professor Robert L. Boyd, is also home to the Mark Sylvestre Planetarium and the Judd Gregg Meteorology Institute, a resource for students in PSU's undergraduate and graduate meteorology degree programs, the only such programs in New Hampshire.

The Enterprise Center at Plymouth (ECP) opened in 2013 as a collaboration between the university and the Grafton County Economic Development Council. The ECP serves as a business incubator and accelerator, assisting start-ups and existing businesses with professional services and resources.

Built in 1916 and renovated in 2006, Mary Lyon Hall is named after Mary Lyon (1797–1849), an American pioneer in women's education. In 2012, Mary Lyon Hall was added to the New Hampshire State Register of Historic Places .

[ 9 ] Mary Lyon is home to PSU's international programs as well as the Center for Student Success, which offers academic support programs, undergraduate advising, global education resources, and career services.

The center of student life on campus, the HUB, is a multi-function building. The HUB is home to student-run and professional offices. The HUB is also home to the Daily Paws Cafe, the Union Grille, and university offices. A PSU annual tradition called First Fire is held in the HUB Fireplace Lounge each fall and students come out to collect their unique First Fire Mug.

Built in 1956 and named for longtime Plymouth State president Ernest Silver, Silver Hall served as a physical education center, a music and theater teaching and performance facility, and an assembly hall. The Silver Center for the Arts supports PSU students of the performing arts. 
The Silver Center is also the home of the New Hampshire Music Festival, which performs classical and pops concerts in the Hanaway Theater and chamber music concerts in Smith Recital Hall. The festival begins the week after the July 4th holiday and runs through the middle of August.

In the early twentieth century, the Draper & Maynard Building was home to premier sporting goods manufacturer Draper & Maynard Sporting Goods Company. It is home to PSU's Department of the Arts. The first floor of the building houses the university's MakerSpace. The fourth floor is currently under construction and will soon feature several labs for the university's program in Electromechanic Technology and Robotics (EMTR). Many professional players received their equipment from D&M such as Babe Ruth.

Lamson Library and Learning Commons opened in September 2006. It is the largest publicly accessible library in central/northern New Hampshire and second largest overall after Dartmouth College.

[ 10 ] Resources include open technology labs, [ 11 ] the Spinelli Archives and Special Collections, [ 12 ] and the Writing Center.

[ 13 ] Residential halls and apartment buildings [ edit ] Most first-year students will reside in double or triple rooms in one of the university's traditional residence halls: Belknap, Geneva Smith, Grafton, Mary Lyon, and Pemigewasset. Newly admitted Upper Division students and graduate students are eligible to request housing in the White Mountain Apartments, Langdon Woods, and Merrill Place.

[ 14 ] Most notably, Langdon Woods was the first college dormitory building in New Hampshire to receive LEED Gold accrediation and is one of the more energy efficient dorms in the country.
