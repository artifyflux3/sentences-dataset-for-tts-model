His major composition was a large Arabic medical compendium, Kitab al-Hawi fi ‘ilm al-tadawi (The Comprehensive Book on the Art of Curing), whose title often caused confusion with the better-known Kitab al-Hawi (The Comprehensive Book) written four centuries earlier by Rhazes . The treatise cites by name many earlier medical authorities, including Hippocrates and Galen , as well as Arabic writers. Little else is known of his life.
