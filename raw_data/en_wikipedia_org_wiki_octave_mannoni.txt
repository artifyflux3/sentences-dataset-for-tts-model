Life [ edit ] After spending more than twenty years in Madagascar , Mannoni returned to France after World War II where he, inspired by Lacan , published several psychoanalytic books and articles. In 1964, he followed Lacan into the École Freudienne de Paris , where he remained (with his wife Maud Mannoni ) a loyal supporter to the end.

[ 1 ] Work [ edit ] Arguably his most well-known work, Prospero and Caliban: The Psychology of Colonization , deals with colonization and the psychology of the colonizer and the colonized. Mannoni saw the colonizer, with his "Prospero complex" as one in regressive flight from a father complex , using splitting and the scapegoating of the colonized to evade personal problems; [ 2 ] the colonized as hiding resentment behind dependency.

[ 3 ] The book was later criticized by writers such as Frantz Fanon for underestimating the socio-materialistic roots of the colonial encounter.

[ 4 ] Fanon also criticized Mannoni for characterizing French racism as taking place only in its colonies. Fanon argued that racism was built into the French metropole , and that Mannoni's failure to recognize this was a major weakness of his theory..

[ 5 ] Nevertheless, it was to influence a generation of Shakespeare directors like Jonathan Miller , [ 6 ] who considered that Mannoni "saw Caliban and Ariel as different forms of black response to white paternalism".

[ 7 ] Another of Mannoni's well-known works was "Clefs pour l'imaginaire ou l'Autre Scène", Seuil, 1969.
