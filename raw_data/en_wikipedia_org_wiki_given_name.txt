Diagram of naming conventions, using [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "John F. Kennedy") as an example. "First names" can also be called given names, forenames, or, in some places at some times, Christian names; "last names" can also be called family names or [surnames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname "Surname"). This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.

The sarcophagus at [Riddarholm Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddarholm_Church "Riddarholm Church") in Sweden of [Queen Desideria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Desideria "Queen Desideria"), an official name given to [Désirée Clary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9e_Clary "Désirée Clary") not at birth but when she was elected [Crown Princess of Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_princess_of_Sweden "Crown princess of Sweden") in 1810.

A **given name** (also known as a **forename** or **first name**) is the part of a [personal name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name "Personal name")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-grigg-1991-1) that identifies a person, potentially with a [middle name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_name "Middle name") as well, and differentiates that person from the other members of a group (typically a [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family "Family") or [clan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan "Clan")) who have a common [surname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname "Surname"). The term _given name_ refers to a [name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name "Name") usually bestowed at or close to the time of birth, usually by the parents of the newborn. A _[Christian name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian\_name "Christian name")_ is the first name which is given at [baptism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism "Baptism"), in Christian custom.

In informal situations, given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-grigg-1991-1) In more formal situations, a person's surname is more commonly used. In Western culture, the idioms "[on a first-name basis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/on_a_first-name_basis#English "wikt:on a first-name basis")" and "being on first-name terms" refer to the familiarity inherent in addressing someone by their given name.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-grigg-1991-1)

By contrast, a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or [_gentile_ name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentile_name "Gentile name")) is normally inherited and shared with other members of one's immediate family.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-2)[Regnal names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regnal_name "Regnal name") and [religious or monastic names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_name "Religious name") are special given names bestowed upon someone receiving a crown or entering a religious order; such a person then typically becomes known chiefly by that name.

The order _given name – family name_, commonly known as _Western name order_, is used throughout most [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") countries and in countries that have cultures predominantly influenced by European culture, including [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") and [South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America"); [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India "North India"), [East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India "East India"), [Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_India "Central India") and [West India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_India "Western India"); [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand"), and the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines").

The order _family name – given name_, commonly known as _Eastern name order_, is primarily used in [East Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia "East Asia") (for example in [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan"), [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea "Korea"), [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan "Taiwan"), [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore "Singapore"), and [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam "Vietnam"), among others, and by [Malaysian Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese "Malaysian Chinese")), as well as in [Southern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India "South India") and [North-Eastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India "Northeast India") parts of [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), and as a standard in [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary "Hungary"). This order is also used to various degrees and in specific contexts in other European countries, such as [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria "Austria") and adjacent areas of [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") (that is, [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria "Bavaria")),[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-3) and in [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"), [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium "Belgium"), [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece") and [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"),[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] possibly because of the influence of bureaucracy, which commonly puts the family name before the given name. In China and Korea, [part of the given name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_name "Generation name") may be shared among all members of a given generation within a family and extended family or families, in order to differentiate those generations from other generations.

The order _given name – father's family name – mother's family name_ is commonly used in several [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language")-speaking countries to acknowledge the families of both parents.

The order _given name – mother's family name – father's family name_ is commonly used in [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language")-speaking countries to acknowledge the families of both parents. Today, people in Spain and Uruguay can rearrange the order of their names legally to this order.

The order _given name – father's given name – grandfather's given name_ (often referred to as _triple name_) is the official naming order used in [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") countries (for example [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia"), [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq") and [United Arab Emirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates "United Arab Emirates")).

In many [Western cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture"), people often have multiple given names. Most often the first one in sequence is the one that a person goes by, although exceptions are not uncommon, such as in the cases of [John Edgar Hoover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edgar_Hoover "John Edgar Hoover") (J. Edgar) and [Dame Mary Barbara Hamilton Cartland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Mary_Barbara_Hamilton_Cartland "Dame Mary Barbara Hamilton Cartland") (Barbara). The given name might also be used in compound form, as in, for example, [John Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_(given_name) "John Paul (given name)") or a hyphenated style like [Bengt-Arne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengt-Arne_Wallin "Bengt-Arne Wallin"). A [middle name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_name "Middle name") might be part of a compound given name or might be, instead, a [maiden name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_name "Maiden name"), a [patronymic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic "Patronymic"), or a [baptismal name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptismal_name "Baptismal name").

In England, it was unusual for a person to have more than one given name until the seventeenth century when Charles James Stuart ([King Charles I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England "Charles I of England")) was baptised with two names. That was a French fashion, which spread to the English aristocracy, following the royal example, then spread to the general population and became common by the end of the eighteenth century.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-Coates-4)

Some double-given names for women were used at the start of the eighteenth century but were used together as a unit: Anna Maria, Mary Anne and Sarah Jane. Those became stereotyped as the typical names of servants and so became unfashionable in the nineteenth century.

Double names remain popular in the [Southern United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-5)

Double names are also common among [Vietnamese names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_names "Vietnamese names") to make repeated name in the family. For example, Đặng Vũ Minh Anh and Đặng Vũ Minh Ánh, are two sisters with the given names Minh Anh and Minh Ánh.

Sometimes, a given name is used as just an initial, especially in combination with the middle initial (such as with [H. G. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells "H. G. Wells")), and more rarely as an initial while the middle name is not one (such as with [L. Ron Hubbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard "L. Ron Hubbard")).

A child's given name or names are usually chosen by the parents soon after birth. If a name is not assigned at birth, one may be given at a [naming ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_ceremony "Naming ceremony"), with family and friends in attendance. In most jurisdictions, a child's name at birth is a matter of public record, inscribed on a [birth certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_certificate "Birth certificate"), or its equivalent. In Western cultures, people normally retain the same given name throughout their lives. However, in some cases these names may be changed by following legal processes or by repute. People may also change their names when immigrating from one country to another with different naming conventions.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-6)

In certain jurisdictions, a government-appointed registrar of births may refuse to register a name for the reasons that it may cause a child harm, that it is considered offensive, or if it is deemed impractical. In France, the agency can refer the case to a local judge. Some jurisdictions, such as Sweden, restrict the spelling of names.[[note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-8) In Denmark, one does not need to register a given name for the child until the child is six months old, and in some cases, one can even wait a little longer than this before the child gets an official name.

Origins and meanings
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Given_name&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Origins and meanings")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Yohanan_name_evolution.svg/500px-Yohanan_name_evolution.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yohanan_name_evolution.svg)

_[John](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/John#English "wikt:John")_, a name of Hebrew origin, is very popular in the Western World, and has given many variants depending on the language: _[Shaun](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Shaun#English "wikt:Shaun")_, _[Eoin](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Eoin#Irish "wikt:Eoin")_, _[Ian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ian#English "wikt:Ian")_, _[Juan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Juan#English "wikt:Juan")_, _[Ivan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ivan#English "wikt:Ivan")_, and _[Yahya](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Yahya#English "wikt:Yahya")_.

Parents may choose a name because of its meaning. This may be a personal or familial meaning, such as giving a child the name of an admired person, or it may be an example of [nominative determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_determinism "Nominative determinism"), in which the parents give the child a name that they believe will be lucky or favourable for the child. Given names most often derive from the following categories:

*   Aspirational personal traits (external and internal). For example, the male names: 
    *   Clement ("merciful");[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-9)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-10) as popularised by [Pope Clement I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_I "Pope Clement I") (88–98), saint, and his many papal successors of that name;
    *   Augustus ("consecrated, holy"[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-11)), first popularised by the first Roman Emperor; later (as Augustine) by two saints;
    *   English examples include numerous female names such as [Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith "Faith"), [Prudence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence "Prudence"), [Amanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda "Amanda") (Latin: worthy of love); Blanche (white (pure));

*   Occupations, for example [George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_(given_name) "George (given name)") means "earth-worker", _i.e._, "farmer".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-12)
*   Circumstances of birth, for example: 
    *   [Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_(name) "Thomas (name)") meaning "twin";
    *   _[Quintus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus "Quintus")_ (Latin: "fifth"), which was traditionally given to the fifth male child.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-13)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-14)

*   Objects, for example [Peter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_(name) "Peter (name)") means "rock" and [Edgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar "Edgar") means "rich spear".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-15)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-16)
*   Physical characteristics, for example [Calvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_(given_name) "Calvin (given name)") means "bald".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-17)
*   Variations on another name, especially to change the sex of the name ([Pauline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_(name) "Pauline (name)"), Georgia) or to adapt from another language (for instance, the names [Francis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_(given_name) "Francis (given name)") or [Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco "Francisco") that come from the name [Franciscus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscus "Franciscus") meaning "[Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks "Franks") or Frenchman").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-18)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-19)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-20)
*   Surnames, Such names can honour other branches of a family, where the surname would not otherwise be passed down (e.g., the mother's maiden surname). Modern examples include: 
    *   Winston,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-21)
    *   [Harrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_(name) "Harrison (name)"),[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-22)
    *   [Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_(name) "Ross (name)").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-23)

*   Many were adopted from the 17th century in England to show respect to notable ancestry, usually given to nephews or male grandchildren of members of the great families concerned, from which the usage spread to general society. This was regardless of whether the family name concerned was in danger of dying out, for example with Howard, a family with many robust male lines over history. Notable examples include 
    *   Howard, from the Howard family, Dukes of Norfolk;
    *   Courtenay, from the surname of the Earls of Devon;
    *   Trevor, from the Welsh chieftain Tudor Trevor, lord of Hereford;[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-24)
    *   Clifford, from the Barons Clifford;
    *   Digby, from the family of Baron Digby/Earl of Bristol;
    *   Shirley (originally a man's forename), from the Shirley family, Earls Ferrer;
    *   Percy, from the Percy Earls and Dukes of Northumberland;
    *   Lindsay, from that noble Scottish family, Earls of Crawford;
    *   Graham, from that noble Scottish family, Dukes of Montrose;
    *   Eliot, from the Eliot family, Earls of St Germans;
    *   Herbert, from the Herbert family, Earls of Pembroke;
    *   Russell, from the Russell family, Earls and Dukes of Bedford;
    *   Stanley, from the Stanley family, Earls of Derby;
    *   Vernon, Earl of Shipbrook
    *   Dillon, the Irish family of Dillon, Viscount Dillon

*   Places, for example [Brittany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany "Brittany")[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-25) and [Lorraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Lorraine "Duchy of Lorraine").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-26)
*   Time of birth, for example, day of the week, as in [Kofi Annan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan "Kofi Annan"), whose given name means "born on Friday",[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-27) or the holiday on which one was born, for example, the name [Natalie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_(given_name) "Natalie (given name)") meaning "born on [Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas "Christmas") day" in Latin[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-28) (Noel (French "Christmas"), a name given to males born at Christmas); also [April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_(given_name) "April (given name)"), [May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_(given_name) "May (given name)"), or [June](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_(given_name) "June (given name)").
*   Combination of the above, for example the [Armenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_language "Armenian language") name Sirvart means "love rose".[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-29)

In many cultures, given names are reused, especially [to commemorate ancestors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namesake "Namesake") or those who are particularly admired, resulting in a limited repertoire of names that sometimes vary by [orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography").

The most familiar example of this, to Western readers, is the use of [Biblical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical "Biblical") and [saints'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint "Saint") names in most of the Christian countries (with Ethiopia, in which names were often ideals or abstractions—Haile Selassie, "power of the Trinity"; Haile Miriam, "power of Mary"—as the most conspicuous exception). However, the name [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_(name) "Jesus (name)") is considered [taboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo "Taboo") or [sacrilegious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrilege "Sacrilege") in some parts of the [Christian world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_world "Christian world"), though this taboo does not extend to the cognate [Joshua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua "Joshua") or related forms which are common in many languages even among Christians. In some Spanish-speaking countries, the name Jesus is considered a normal given name.

Similarly, the name [Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_the_mother_of_Jesus "Mary, the mother of Jesus"), now popular among Christians, particularly [Roman Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church"), was considered too holy for secular use until about the 12th century. In countries that particularly venerated Mary, this remained the case much longer; in Poland, until the arrival in the 17th century of French queens named Marie.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-30)

Most common given names in English (and many other European languages) can be grouped into broad categories based on their origin:

*   **[Hebrew names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_name "Hebrew name")**, most often from the Bible, are very common in, or are elements of names used in historically Christian countries. [Some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophoric_name "Theophoric name") have elements meaning "God", especially "[Eli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_(name) "Eli (name)")". Examples: [Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(given_name) "Michael (given name)"), [Joshua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua "Joshua"), [Daniel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_(biblical_figure) "Daniel (biblical figure)"), [Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_(Hebrew_Bible) "Joseph (Hebrew Bible)"), [David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David "David"), [Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_(name) "Adam (name)"), [Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel "Samuel"), [Elizabeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_(given_name) "Elizabeth (given name)"), [Hannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_(given_name) "Hannah (given name)") and [Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_(given_name) "Mary (given name)"). There are also a handful of names in use derived from the **[Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_language "Aramaic language")**, particularly the names of prominent figures in the New Testament—such as [Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Apostle "Thomas the Apostle"), [Martha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha "Martha") and [Bartholomew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew "Bartholomew"). 
    *   All of the [Semitic peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_people "Semitic people") of history and the present day use at least some names constructed like these in Hebrew (and the ancient Hebrews used names not constructed like these—such as [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses "Moses"), probably an Egyptian name related to the names of [Pharaohs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh "Pharaoh") like Thutmose and Ahmose). The Muslim world is the best-known example (with names like Saif-al-din, "sword of the faith", or Abd-Allah, "servant of God"), but even the Carthaginians had similar names: cf. Hannibal, "the grace of god" (in this case not the Abrahamic deity God, but the deity—probably [Melkart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melkart "Melkart")—whose title is normally left untranslated, as [Baal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal "Baal")).

*   **[Germanic names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_names "Germanic names")** are characteristically warlike; roots with meanings like "glory", "strength", and "will" are common. The "-[bert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_(name) "Bert (name)")" element common in many such names comes from _beraht_, which means "[bright](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bright "wikt:bright")". Examples: [Robert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert "Robert"), [Edward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward "Edward"), [Roger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger "Roger"), [Richard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard "Richard"), Albert, Carl, Alfred, Rosalind, Emma, Emmett, [Eric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric "Eric") and [Matilda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_(name) "Matilda (name)").
*   **French** forms of **[Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages "Germanic languages")** names. Since the [Norman conquest of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England "Norman conquest of England"), many English-given names of [Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages "Germanic languages") origin are used in their [French forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_name "French name"). Examples: [Charles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles "Charles"), [Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_(given_name) "Henry (given name)"), [William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William "William").
*   **[Slavic names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_names "Slavic names")** may be of peaceful character, the compounds being derived from the word [roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics) "Root (linguistics)") meaning "to protect", "to love", "peace", "to praise [gods]", or "to give". Examples: [Milena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milena_(name) "Milena (name)"), [Vesna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesna_(name) "Vesna (name)"), [Bohumil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohumil "Bohumil"), [Dobromir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobromir_(given_name) "Dobromir (given name)"), [Svetlana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana "Svetlana"), [Vlastimil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlastimil "Vlastimil"). Other names have a warlike character and are built of words meaning "fighter", "war", or "anger". Examples: [Casimir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir "Casimir"), [Vladimir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_(name) "Vladimir (name)"), [Sambor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambor_(disambiguation) "Sambor (disambiguation)"), [Wojciech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech "Wojciech") and [Zbigniew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew "Zbigniew"). Many of them derive from the root word "slava" ("glory"): [Boleslav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boleslaus "Boleslaus"), [Miroslav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_(given_name) "Miroslav (given name)"), [Vladislav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav "Vladislav"), [Radoslav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radoslav_(disambiguation) "Radoslav (disambiguation)"), [Slavomir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavomir "Slavomir") and [Stanislav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_(given_name) "Stanislav (given name)"). Those derived from root word "mir" ("world, peace") are also popular: [Casimir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir "Casimir"), [Slavomir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavomir "Slavomir"), [Radomir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radomir_(given_name) "Radomir (given name)"), [Vladimir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_(name) "Vladimir (name)"), [Miroslav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_(given_name) "Miroslav (given name)"), Jaczemir.
*   **[Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages "Celtic languages")** names are sometimes [anglicised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicisation "Anglicisation") versions of [Celtic forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_language "Celtic language"), but the original form may also be used. Examples: [Alan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_(name) "Alan (name)"), [Brian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian "Brian"), [Brigid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigid "Brigid"), Mórag, Ross, [Logan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_(given_name) "Logan (given name)"), [Ciarán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciar%C3%A1n "Ciarán"), [Jennifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_(given_name) "Jennifer (given name)"), and [Seán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_(name)#Evolution_of_the_name_John "John (name)"). These names often have origins in Celtic words, as Celtic versions of the names of internationally known [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity")[saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint "Saint"), as names of [Celtic mythological figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_mythology "Celtic mythology"), or simply as long-standing names whose ultimate etymology is unclear.
*   **[Greek names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_names "Greek names")** may be derived from the history and mythology of [Classical Antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Antiquity "Classical Antiquity") or be derived from the [New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament") and early Christian traditions. Such names are often, but not always, anglicised. Examples: [Helen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_(given_name) "Helen (given name)"), [Stephen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen "Stephen"), [Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander "Alexander"), [Andrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew "Andrew"), [Peter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_(name) "Peter (name)"), [Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_(given_name) "Gregory (given name)"), [George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_(given_name) "George (given name)"), [Christopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_(name) "Christopher (name)"), [Margaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_(name) "Margaret (name)"), [Nicholas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas "Nicholas"), [Jason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_(name) "Jason (name)"), [Timothy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_(name) "Timothy (name)"), [Chloe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe "Chloe"), [Zoë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_(name) "Zoe (name)"), [Katherine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_(given_name) "Katherine (given name)"), [Penelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope "Penelope") and [Theodore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_(given_name) "Theodore (given name)").
*   **[Latin names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions "Roman naming conventions")** can also be adopted unchanged, or modified; in particular, the inflected element can be dropped, as often happens in borrowings from Latin to English. Examples: [Laura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_(name) "Laura (name)"), [Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(name) "Victoria (name)"), [Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_(given_name) "Mark (given name)") (Latin _[Marcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus\_(name) "Marcus (name)")_), [Justin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_(given_name) "Justin (given name)") (Latin _Justinus_), [Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_(name) "Paul (name)") (Lat. _Paulus_), Julius, [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(given_name) "Julia (given name)"), Cecilia, [Felix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_(name) "Felix (name)"), [Vivian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_(personal_name) "Vivian (personal name)"), [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(name) "Pascal (name)") (not a traditional-type Latin name, but the adjective-turned-name _paschalis_, meaning 'of Easter' (_Pascha_)).
*   **Word names** come from English vocabulary words. Feminine names of this sort—in more languages than English, and more cultures than Europe alone—frequently derive from nature, flowers, birds, colours, or [gemstones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone "Gemstone"). Examples include [Jasmine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine "Jasmine"), [Lavender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender "Lavender"), [Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn "Dawn"), [Daisy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteraceae "Asteraceae"), [Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose "Rose"), [Iris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(plant) "Iris (plant)"), [Petunia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petunia "Petunia"), [Rowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan "Rowan"), [Jade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade "Jade"), and [Violet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_(plant) "Violet (plant)"). Male names of this sort are less common—examples like [Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_(given_name) "Hunter (given name)") and [Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer "Fischer"), or names associated with strong animals, such as [Bronco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronco "Bronco") and [Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf "Wolf"). (This is more common in some other languages, such as Northern Germanic and Turkish).
*   **Trait names** most conspicuously include the Christian virtues, mentioned above, and normally used as feminine names (such as the [three Christian virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_virtues "Theological virtues")—[Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_in_Christianity "Faith in Christianity"), [Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_(virtue) "Hope (virtue)"), and [Charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_(virtue) "Charity (virtue)")).
*   **[Diminutives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive")** are sometimes used to distinguish between two or more people with the same given name. In English, [Robert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert "Robert") may be changed to "Robbie" or Thomas changed to "Tommy". In German the names [Hänsel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_(name)#Evolution_of_the_name_John "John (name)") and [Gretel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_(name)#Name_Margaret_in_other_languages "Margaret (name)") (as in the famous [fairy tale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_%26_Gretel "Hansel & Gretel")) are the diminutive forms of Johann and Margarete. Examples: [Vicky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(name) "Victoria (name)"), [Cindy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_(given_name) "Cindy (given name)"), Tommy, [Abby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail "Abigail"), [Allie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_(name) "Alison (name)").
*   **Shortened names** (see [nickname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickname "Nickname")) are generally nicknames of a longer name, but they are instead given as a person's entire given name. For example, a man may simply be named "Jim", and it is not short for [James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_(name) "James (name)"). Examples: Beth, Ben, Zach, Tom.
*   **Feminine variations** exist for many masculine names, often in multiple forms. Examples: [Charlotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_(given_name) "Charlotte (given name)"), [Stephanie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie "Stephanie"), [Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(name) "Victoria (name)"), [Philippa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa "Philippa"), [Jane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_(given_name) "Jane (given name)"), [Jacqueline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_(name) "Jacqueline (name)"), [Josephine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_(name) "Josephine (name)"), [Danielle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle "Danielle"), [Paula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_(given_name) "Paula (given name)"), [Pauline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_(name) "Pauline (name)"), [Patricia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia "Patricia"), [Francesca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca "Francesca").

Frequently, a given name has versions in many languages. For example, the biblical name _[Susanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna\_(disciple) "Susanna (disciple)")_ also occurs in its original [biblical Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hebrew_language "Biblical Hebrew language") version, _Shoshannah_, its Spanish and Portuguese version _Susana_, its French version, _Suzanne_, its Polish version, _Zuzanna_, or its Hungarian version, _Zsuzsanna_ .

Despite the uniformity of [Chinese surnames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_surname "Chinese surname"), some [Chinese given names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_given_name "Chinese given name") are fairly original because [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character "Chinese character") can be combined extensively. Unlike European languages, with their Biblical and Greco-Roman heritage, the [Chinese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language") does not have a particular set of words reserved for given names: any combination of Chinese characters can theoretically be used as a given name. Nonetheless, a number of popular characters commonly recur, including "Strong" ([伟](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BC%9F "wikt:伟"), _Wěi_), "Learned" ([文](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%96%87 "wikt:文"), _Wén_), "Peaceful" ([安](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AE%89 "wikt:安"), _Ān_), and "Beautiful" ([美](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E "wikt:美"), _Měi_). Despite China's increasing urbanization, several names such as "Pine" ([松](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%9D%BE "wikt:松"), _Sōng_) or "[Plum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum_tree "Plum tree")" ([梅](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%A2%85 "wikt:梅"), _Méi_) also still reference nature.

Most Chinese given names are two characters long and—despite the examples above—the two characters together may mean nothing at all. Instead, they may be selected to include particular sounds, [tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_tones "Chinese tones"), or [radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_characters) "Radical (Chinese characters)"); to balance the [Chinese elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_elements_(China) "Five elements (China)") of a child's [birth chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_astrology "Chinese astrology"); or to honor a [generation poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_poem "Generation poem") handed down through the family for centuries. Traditionally, it is considered an [affront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_taboo "Naming taboo"), not an honor, to have a newborn named after an older relative and so full names are rarely passed down through a family in the manner of American English _Seniors,_ _Juniors_, _III_, etc. Similarly, it is considered disadvantageous for the child to bear a name already made famous by someone else through [romanizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese "Romanization of Chinese"), where a common name like [Liu Xiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiang_(disambiguation) "Liu Xiang (disambiguation)") may be borne by tens of thousands.

[Korean names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_names "Korean names") and [Vietnamese names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_names "Vietnamese names") are often simply conventions derived from [Classical Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Chinese "Classical Chinese") counterparts.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Many female [Japanese names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_names "Japanese names") end in _-ko_ ([子](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AD%90 "wikt:子")), usually meaning "child" on its own. However, the character when used in given names can have a feminine (adult) connotation.

In many Westernised Asian locations, many Asians also have an unofficial or even registered Western (typically English) given name, in addition to their Asian given name. This is also true for Asian students at colleges in countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia as well as among international businesspeople. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Most names in English are traditionally masculine (Hugo, James, Harold) or feminine (Daphne, Charlotte, Jane), but there are [unisex names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisex_name "Unisex name") as well, such as [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_(name) "Jordan (name)"), [Jamie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie "Jamie"), [Jesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_(given_name) "Jesse (given name)"), [Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_(given_name) "Morgan (given name)"), Leslie/[Lesley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesley_(disambiguation) "Lesley (disambiguation)"), [Joe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_(name) "Joseph (name)")/[Jo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_(given_name) "Jo (given name)"), [Jackie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_(given_name) "Jackie (given name)"), [Pat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_(disambiguation) "Pat (disambiguation)"), Dana, Alex, [Chris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris "Chris")/[Kris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_(name) "Kris (name)"), [Randy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy "Randy")/[Randi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randi "Randi"), [Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_(given_name) "Lee (given name)"), etc. Often, use for one gender is predominant. Also, a particular spelling is often more common for either men or women, even if the pronunciation is the same.

Many culture groups, past and present, did not or do not gender their names strongly; thus, many or all of their names are unisex. On the other hand, in many languages including most [Indo-European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages "Indo-European languages") (but not English), gender is inherent in the grammar. Some countries have laws preventing [unisex names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisex_names "Unisex names"), requiring parents to give their children sex-specific names.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-31) Names may have different gender connotations from country to country or language to language.

Within [anthroponymic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroponymic "Anthroponymic") classification, names of human males are called _andronyms_ (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") ἀνήρ / man, and ὄνυμα [ὄνομα] / name),[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoom19966-32) while names of human females are called _gynonyms_ (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") γυνή / woman, and ὄνυμα [ὄνομα] / name).[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBarolini200591,_98-33)

The popularity (frequency) distribution of given names typically follows a [power law distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%E2%80%93Mandelbrot_law "Zipf–Mandelbrot law").

Since about 1800 in England and Wales and in the U.S., the popularity distribution of given names has been shifting so that the most popular names are losing popularity. For example, in England and Wales, the most popular female and male names given to babies born in 1800 were Mary and John, with 24% of female babies and 22% of male babies receiving those names, respectively.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-34) In contrast, the corresponding statistics for England and Wales in 1994 were Emily and James, with 3% and 4% of names, respectively. Not only have Mary and John gone out of favour in the English-speaking world, but the overall distribution of names has also changed significantly over the last 100 years for females, but not for males. This has led to an increasing amount of diversity for female names.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-35)

Education, ethnicity, religion, class and political ideology affect parents' choice of names. Politically conservative parents choose common and traditional names, while politically liberal parents may choose the names of literary characters or other relatively obscure cultural figures.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-36) Devout members of religions often choose names from their religious scriptures. For example, Hindu parents may name a daughter [Saanvi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saanvi "Saanvi") after the goddess, Jewish parents may name a boy [Isaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac "Isaac") after one of the earliest ancestral figures, and Muslim parents may name a boy [Mohammed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_(name) "Mohammed (name)") after [the prophet Mohammed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad "Muhammad").

There are many tools parents can use to choose names, including books, websites and applications. An example is the Baby Name Game that uses the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system "Elo rating system") to rank parents preferred names and help them select one.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-Baby_Name_Game-37)

### Influence of popular culture

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Given_name&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Influence of popular culture")]

[Popular culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture "Popular culture") appears to have an influence on naming trends, at least in the United States and United Kingdom. Newly famous celebrities and public figures may influence the popularity of names. For example, in 2004, the names "Keira" and "Kiera" (anglicisation of Irish name Ciara) respectively became the 51st and 92nd most popular girls' names in the UK, following the rise in popularity of British actress [Keira Knightley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley "Keira Knightley").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-38) In 2001, the use of Colby as a boys' name for babies in the United States jumped from 233rd place to 99th, just after [Colby Donaldson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_Donaldson "Colby Donaldson") was the runner-up on _[Survivor: The Australian Outback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor:\_The\_Australian\_Outback "Survivor: The Australian Outback")_.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Also, the female name "Miley" which before was not in the top 1000 was 278th most popular in 2007, following the rise to fame of singer-actress [Miley Cyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miley_Cyrus "Miley Cyrus") (who was named Destiny at birth).[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-ssa-39)

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Influence_of_TV_series_on_given_names.svg/500px-Influence_of_TV_series_on_given_names.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Influence_of_TV_series_on_given_names.svg)

Influence of TV series on given names in England and Wales from 1996 to 2021.

Characters from fiction also seem to influence naming. After the name [Kayla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayla_(name) "Kayla (name)") was used for [a character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayla_Brady "Kayla Brady") on the American [soap opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera "Soap opera")_[Days of Our Lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days\_of\_Our\_Lives "Days of Our Lives")_, the name's popularity increased greatly. The name [Tammy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_(given_name) "Tammy (given name)"), and the related [Tamara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamara_(given_name) "Tamara (given name)") became popular after the movie _[Tammy and the Bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy\_and\_the\_Bachelor "Tammy and the Bachelor")_ came out in 1957. Some names were established or spread by being used in literature. Notable examples include [Pamela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_(name) "Pamela (name)"), invented by Sir [Philip Sidney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Sidney "Philip Sidney") for a pivotal character in his epic prose work, _[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Countess\_of\_Pembroke%27s\_Arcadia "The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia")_; [Jessica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_(given_name) "Jessica (given name)"), created by William Shakespeare in his play _[The Merchant of Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Merchant\_of\_Venice "The Merchant of Venice")_; [Vanessa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_(name) "Vanessa (name)"), created by [Jonathan Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift "Jonathan Swift"); [Fiona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona "Fiona"), a character from [James Macpherson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Macpherson "James Macpherson")'s spurious cycle of [Ossian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossian "Ossian") poems; [Wendy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy "Wendy"), an obscure name popularised by [J. M. Barrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie "J. M. Barrie") in his play _[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter\_Pan,\_or\_The\_Boy\_Who\_Wouldn%27t\_Grow\_Up "Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up")_; and [Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_(name) "Madison (name)"), a character from the movie _[Splash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splash\_(film) "Splash (film)")_. [Lara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_(name) "Lara (name)") and [Larissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larissa_(given_name) "Larissa (given name)") were rare in America before the appearance of _[Doctor Zhivago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor\_Zhivago\_(1965\_film) "Doctor Zhivago (1965 film)"),_ and have become fairly common since.

Songs can influence the naming of children. Jude jumped from 814th most popular male name in 1968 to 668th in 1969, following the release of [the Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles "The Beatles")' "[Hey Jude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Jude "Hey Jude")". Similarly, [Layla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layla "Layla") charted as 969th most popular in 1972 after the [Eric Clapton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton "Eric Clapton") song. It had not been in the top 1,000 before.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-ssa-39) Kayleigh became a particularly popular name in the United Kingdom following the release of a song by the British rock group [Marillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marillion "Marillion"). Government statistics in 2005 revealed that 96% of Kayleighs were born after 1985, the year in which Marillion released "[Kayleigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayleigh "Kayleigh")". [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Popular culture figures need not be admirable in order to influence naming trends. For example, Peyton came into the top 1000 as a female given name for babies in the United States for the first time in 1992 (at #583), immediately after it was featured as the name of an evil nanny in the film _[The Hand That Rocks the Cradle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Hand\_That\_Rocks\_the\_Cradle\_(1992\_film) "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992 film)")_.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-ssa-39) On the other hand, historical events can influence child-naming. For example, the given name [Adolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf "Adolf") has fallen out of use since the end of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") in 1945.

In contrast with this anecdotal evidence, a comprehensive study of Norwegian first name datasets[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-40) shows that the main factors that govern first name dynamics are [endogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous "Endogenous"). Monitoring the popularity of 1,000 names over 130 years, the authors have identified only five cases of [exogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogenous "Exogenous") effects, three of them are connected to the names given to the babies of the Norwegian royal family.

### 20th century African-American names

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Given_name&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 20th century African-American names")]

Since the civil rights movement of 1950–1970, [African-American names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_names "African-American names") given to children have strongly mirrored sociopolitical movements and philosophies in the African-American community. Since the 1970s neologistic (creative, inventive) practices have become increasingly common and the subject of academic study.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#cite_note-41)

["The Times"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times "The Times"). In the last century and well into the present one, grown-up British people, with rare exceptions, addressed each other by their surnames. What we now call first names (then Christian names) were very little used outside the family. Men who became friends would drop the Mr and use their bare surnames as a mark of intimacy: e.g. [Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes "Sherlock Holmes") and [Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Watson "Dr. Watson"). First names were only generally used for, and among, children. Today we have gone to the other extreme. People tend to be on first-name terms from the moment of introduction, and surnames are often hardly mentioned. Moreover, first names are relentlessly abbreviated, particularly in the media: Susan becomes [Sue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Lawley "Sue Lawley"), Terrence [Terry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Wogan "Terry Wogan") and Robert [Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Holness "Bob Holness") not only to friends and relations, but to millions who know these people only as faces and/or voices. quoted in [Burchfield, R.
