He was also the Head of the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics , and a professor at the Tri-Institutional MD–PhD Program (the other two institutions being the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Weill Cornell Medicine ).

[ 4 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Allis was born and raised in Cincinnati , Ohio . His father was a city planner and his mother an elementary school teacher .

[ 5 ] He entered the University of Cincinnati in 1969, majoring in biology . He had his first experience of basic research in his senior (or fourth) year of Bachelor of Science . The experience attracted him to research, and he went to Indiana University Bloomington for graduate studies.

[ 6 ] He graduated with an MSc in 1975 and a PhD three years later, under the supervision of Anthony Mahowald .

[ 4 ] [ 6 ] Career [ edit ] Allis undertook a postdoctoral fellowship in the University of Rochester after obtaining his PhD .

[ 6 ] In 1981, he joined the Baylor College of Medicine as an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Department of Cell Biology , and was promoted to associate professor in 1986 and full professor in 1989.

[ 4 ] He joined the Department of Biology at Syracuse University College of Arts and Sciences in 1990.

[ 7 ] Allis returned to the University of Rochester in 1995, and became the Marie Curran Wilson and Joseph Chamberlain Wilson Professor of Biology two years later.

[ 8 ] In 1998, Allis went to the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at the University of Virginia School of Medicine .

[ 9 ] He joined the Rockefeller University in 2003 as the Joy and Jack Fishman Professor and Head of the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics .

[ 4 ] Allis had been treated for cancer.

[ 3 ] He died January 8, 2023, at a hospital in Seattle , Washington .

[ 3 ] Research [ edit ] Scholia has a profile for Charles David Allis (Q1064064) .

Allis was known for his research of histone modifications and their relation to chromatin structure. He started working on Tetrahymena , a ciliated unicellular eukaryote .

Tetrahymena is an ideal candidate to study histone acetylation due to its dual nucleus . It has a larger macronucleus that is transcriptionally active and somatic , and a smaller micronucleus that is transcriptionally silent and germline .

[ 10 ] Chromatin biology at the time was not a popular topic; nor was the use of ciliated organisms.

[ 6 ] In 1996, his group isolated the histone acetyltransferase p55 from Tetrahymena , an enzyme that acetylates histones , and found the enzyme was homologous to Gcn5p, a known transcriptional co-activator in yeast .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] This was the first time that histone acetyltransferases were connected to DNA transcription activation , [ 13 ] verifying Vincent Allfrey's hypothesis in the 1960s that histone acetylation regulates transcription.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Following this seminal report, Allis continued studying histone acetylation, discovering more histone acetyltransferases, including TAF1 (part of the transcription factor TF II D needed to initiate transcription).

[ 16 ] Allis also branched off to researching histone phosphorylation and histone methylation . He linked histone phosphorylation to mitosis and mitogen stimulation, [ 17 ] [ 18 ] and established a synergistic relationship between histone phosphorylation and acetylation.

[ 19 ] He also determined the role of methylation at lysine 9 of histone H3 , [ 20 ] identified SET domain -containing proteins as histone methyltransferase , [ 21 ] and found that histone ubiquitylation regulates histone methylation.

[ 22 ] In 2000, Allis and Brian Strahl proposed the " histone code hypothesis", which states that DNA transcription is largely regulated by histone modifications .

[ 23 ] Later, Allis (together with Thomas Jenuwein ) explicitly associated the histone code with epigenetics , [ 24 ] and recognized the clinical significance of histone modifications, especially in cancers .

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] In more recent years, his attention turned to "oncohistones", which are histones with mutations that distort normal histone modifications, leading to cancers.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Honors and awards [ edit ] Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2001) [ 29 ] Dickson Prize in Medicine (2002) [ 30 ] Massry Prize (2003) [ 31 ] Wiley Prize in Biomedical Sciences (2004) [ 32 ] Member of the National Academy of Sciences (2005) [ 33 ] Distinguished Alumnus Award, University of Cincinnati College of Arts and Sciences (2007) [ 34 ] Gairdner Foundation International Award (2007) [ 35 ] American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology - Merck Award (2008) [ 36 ] Lewis S.
