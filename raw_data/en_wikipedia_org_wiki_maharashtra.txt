It is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, the Indian states of Karnataka and Goa to the south, Telangana to the southeast and Chhattisgarh to the east, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh to the north, and the Indian union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the northwest.

[ 19 ] Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India, the third most populous country subdivision in South Asia and the fourth-most populous in the world.

The region that encompasses the modern state has a history going back many millennia. Notable dynasties that ruled the region include the Asmakas , the Mauryas , the Satavahanas , the Western Satraps , the Abhiras , the Vakatakas , the Chalukyas , the Rashtrakutas , the Western Chalukyas , the Seuna Yadavas , the Khaljis , the Tughlaqs , the Bahamanis and the Mughals . In the early nineteenth century, the region was divided between the Dominions of the Peshwa in the Maratha Confederacy and the Nizamate of Hyderabad .

After two wars and the proclamation of the Indian Empire, the region became a part of the Bombay Province , the Berar Province and the Central Provinces of India under direct British rule and the Deccan States Agency under Crown suzerainty. Between 1950 and 1956, the Bombay Province became the Bombay State in the Indian Union, and Berar, the Deccan states and the Gujarat states were merged into the Bombay State. Aspirations of a separate state for Marathi-speaking peoples were pursued by the United Maharashtra Movement ; their advocacy eventually borne fruit on 1 May 1960, when the State of Bombay was bifurcated into the modern states of Maharasthra and Gujarat .

The state is divided into 6 divisions and 36 districts .

Mumbai is the capital of Maharashtra due to its historical significance as a major trading port and its status as India's financial hub , housing key institutions and a diverse economy . Additionally, Mumbai's well-developed infrastructure and cultural diversity make it a suitable administrative center for the state, and the most populous urban area in India, with Nagpur serving as the winter capital.

[ 20 ] The Godavari and Krishna are the state's two major rivers, and forests cover 16.47% of the state's geographical area.

The economy of Maharashtra is the largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹ 42.5 trillion (US$500 billion) and GSDP per capita of ₹ 335,247 (US$4,000); [ 21 ] it is the single-largest contributor to India's economy , being accountable for 14% of all-India nominal GDP .

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] The service sector dominates the state's economy, accounting for 69.3% of the value of the output of the country. Although agriculture accounts for 12% of the state GDP, it employs nearly half the population of the state.

Maharashtra is one of the most industrialised states in India. The state's capital, Mumbai, is India's financial and commercial capital.

[ 25 ] The Bombay Stock Exchange , India's largest stock exchange and the oldest in Asia, is located in the city, as is the National Stock Exchange , which is the second-largest stock exchange in India and one of world's largest derivatives exchanges . The state has played a significant role in the country's social and political life and is widely considered a leader in terms of agricultural and industrial production , trade and transport, and education.

[ 26 ] Maharashtra is the ninth-highest ranking among Indian states in the human development index .

[ 27 ] The state is home to seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites : Ajanta Caves , Ellora Caves , Elephanta Caves , Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus), the Victorian Gothic and Art Deco Ensembles of Mumbai , the Maratha Military Landscapes of India (shared with Tamil Nadu) and the Western Ghats , a heritage site made up of 39 individual properties of which four are in Maharashtra.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] Etymology Pre-independence era writers state that the term "Maharashtra" was derived from "the country of Mahars ". Irawati Karve also noted that Mahars were found in all regions of Maharashtra.

[ 30 ] The modern Marathi language evolved from Maharashtri Prakrit , [ 31 ] and the word Marhatta (later used for the Marathas ) is found in the Jain Maharashtrian literature. The term Maharashtra along with Maharashtrian, Marathi, and Maratha may have derived from the same root. However, their exact etymology is uncertain.

[ 32 ] Another theory among the linguistic scholars is that the words Maratha and Maharashtra ultimately derived from a combination of Mahā and Rāṣṭrikā , [ 32 ] [ 33 ] the name of a tribe or dynasty of chiefs ruling in the Deccan region.

[ 34 ] An alternate theory states that the term is derived from mahā ("great") and ratha / rathi (" chariot "/"charioteer"), which refers to a skilful northern fighting force that migrated southward into the area.

[ 34 ] [ 33 ] In the Harivamsa , the Yadava kingdom called Anaratta is described as mostly inhabited by the Abhiras (Abhira-praya-manusyam). The Anartta country and its inhabitants were called Surastra and the Saurastras, probably after the Rattas (Rastras) akin to the Rastrikas of Asoka's rock Edicts, now known as Maharastra and the Marattas .

[ 35 ] An alternative theory states that the term derives from the word mahā ("great") and rāṣṭra ("nation/dominion").

[ 36 ] However, this theory is somewhat controversial among modern scholars who believe it to be the Sanskritised interpretation of later writers.

[ 32 ] History Main articles: History of Maharashtra , Maratha Empire , and Samyukta Maharashtra Movement See also: Chronology of statehood of Maharashtra Numerous Late Harappan or Chalcolithic sites belonging to the Jorwe culture ( c.

1300 –700 BCE) have been discovered throughout the state.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] The largest settlement discovered of the culture is at Daimabad , which had a mud fortification during this period, as well as an elliptical temple with fire pits.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] In the Late Harappan period there was a large migration of people from Gujarat to northern Maharashtra.

[ 41 ] Maharashtra was ruled by Maurya Empire in the fourth and third centuries BCE. Around 230 BCE, Maharashtra came under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty which ruled it for the next 400 years.

[ 42 ] The rule of Satavahanas was followed by that of Western Satraps , Gupta Empire , Gurjara-Pratihara , Vakataka , Kadambas , Chalukya Empire , Rashtrakuta Dynasty , and Western Chalukya and the Yadava Dynasty . The Buddhist Ajanta Caves in present-day Aurangabad display influences from the Satavahana and Vakataka styles. The caves were possibly excavated during this period.

[ 43 ] The Chalukya dynasty ruled the region from the sixth to the eighth centuries CE, and the two prominent rulers were Pulakeshin II , who defeated the north Indian Emperor Harsha , and Vikramaditya II , who defeated the Arab invaders in the eighth century. The Rashtrakuta dynasty ruled Maharashtra from the eighth to the tenth century.

[ 44 ] The Arab traveller Sulaiman al Mahri described the ruler of the Rashtrakuta dynasty Amoghavarsha as "one of the four great kings of the world".

[ 45 ] Shilahara dynasty began as vassals of the Rashtrakuta dynasty which ruled the Deccan plateau between the eighth and tenth centuries. From the early 11th century to the 12th century, the Deccan Plateau, which includes a significant part of Maharashtra, was dominated by the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty .

[ 46 ] Several battles were fought between the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty in the Deccan Plateau during the reigns of Raja Raja Chola I , Rajendra Chola I , Jayasimha II , Someshvara I , and Vikramaditya VI .

[ 47 ] In the early 14th century, the Yadava dynasty , which ruled most of present-day Maharashtra, was overthrown by the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji . Later, Muhammad bin Tughluq conquered parts of the Deccan, and temporarily shifted his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad in Maharashtra. After the collapse of the Tughluqs in 1347, the local Bahmani Sultanate of Gulbarga took over, governing the region for the next 150 years.

[ 48 ] After the break-up of the Bahamani sultanate in 1518, Maharashtra split into five Deccan Sultanates : Nizamshah of Ahmednagar , Adilshah of Bijapur , Qutubshah of Golkonda , Bidarshah of Bidar and Imadshah of Elichpur. These kingdoms often fought with each other. United, they decisively defeated the Vijayanagara Empire of the south in 1565.

[ 49 ] The present area of Mumbai was ruled by the Sultanate of Gujarat before its capture by Portugal in 1535 and the Faruqi dynasty ruled the Khandesh region between 1382 and 1601 before finally getting annexed in the Mughal Empire .

Malik Ambar , the regent of the Nizamshahi dynasty of Ahmednagar from 1607 to 1626, [ 50 ] increased the strength and power of Murtaza Nizam Shah II and raised a large army.Ambar is said to have introduced the concept of guerrilla warfare in the Deccan region.

[ 51 ] Malik Ambar assisted Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in Delhi against his stepmother, Nur Jahan , who wanted to enthrone her son-in-law.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] Both Shivaji 's grandfather, Maloji and father Shahaji served under Ambar.

[ 54 ] In the early 17th century, Shahaji Bhosale , an ambitious local general who had served the Ahmadnagar Sultanate , the Mughals and Adil Shah of Bijapur at different periods throughout his career, attempted to establish his independent rule.

[ 55 ] This attempt was unsuccessful, but his son Shivaji succeeded in establishing the Maratha Empire .

[ 56 ] Shortly after Shivaji's death in 1680, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb launched a campaign to conquer Maratha territories as well as the Adilshahi and Govalkonda kingdoms.

[ 57 ] This campaign, better known as Mughal–Maratha Wars , was a strategic defeat for Mughals. Aurangzeb failed to fully conquer Maratha territories, and this campaign had a ruinous effect on Mughal Treasury and Army.

[ 58 ] Shortly after Aurangzeb's death in 1707, Marathas under Peshwa Bajirao I and the generals that he had promoted such as Ranoji Shinde and Malharrao Holkar started conquering Mughal Territories in the north and western India, and by 1750s they or their successors had confined the Mughals to city of Delhi.

[ 59 ] After their defeat at the hand of Ahmad Shah Abdali 's Afghan forces in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Maratha suffered a setback. However, they soon reclaimed the lost territories and ruled central and north India including Delhi until the end of the eighteenth century. The Marathas also developed a potent Navy circa in the 1660s, which at its peak under the command of Kanhoji Angre , dominated the territorial waters of the western coast of India from Mumbai to Savantwadi .

[ 60 ] It resisted the British , Portuguese , Dutch , and Siddi naval ships and kept a check on their naval ambitions. Charles Metcalfe, British Civil servant and later Acting Governor-General, said in 1806: [ 61 ] India contains no more than two great powers, British and Maratha, and every other state acknowledges the influence of one or the other. Every inch that we recede will be occupied by them.

The British East India Company slowly expanded areas under its rule during the 18th century. The Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–1818) led to the end of the Maratha Empire and the East India Company took over the empire.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] The Maratha Navy dominated till around the 1730s, was in a state of decline by the 1770s and ceased to exist by 1818.

[ 64 ] The British governed western Maharashtra as part of the Bombay Presidency , which spanned an area from Karachi in Pakistan to northern Deccan. A number of the Maratha states persisted as princely states , retaining autonomy in return for acknowledging British suzerainty . The largest princely states in the territory were Nagpur , Satara and Kolhapur State ; Satara was annexed to the Bombay Presidency in 1848, and Nagpur was annexed in 1853 to become Nagpur Province , later part of the Central Provinces .

Berar , which had been part of the Nizam of Hyderabad's kingdom, was occupied by the British in 1853 and annexed to the Central Provinces in 1903.

[ 65 ] However, a large region called Marathwada remained part of the Nizam's Hyderabad State throughout the British period. The British ruled Maharashtra region from 1818 to 1947 and influenced every aspect of life for the people of the region. They brought several changes to the legal system, [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] built modern means of transport including roads [ 69 ] and Railways, [ 70 ] [ 71 ] took various steps to provide mass education, including that for previously marginalised classes and women, [ 72 ] established universities based on western system and imparting education in science, technology, [ 73 ] and western medicine, [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] standardised the Marathi language, [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] and introduced mass media by utilising modern printing technologies.

[ 81 ] The 1857 war of independence had many Marathi leaders, though the battles mainly took place in northern India. The modern struggle for independence started taking shape in the late 1800s with leaders such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak , Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade , Gopal Krishna Gokhale , Pherozeshah Mehta and Dadabhai Naoroji evaluating the company rule and its consequences.

Jyotirao Phule was the pioneer of social reform in the Maharashtra region in the second half of the 19th century. His social work was continued by Shahu, Raja of Kolhapur and later by B. R. Ambedkar . After the partial autonomy given to the states by the Government of India Act 1935 , B. G. Kher became the first chief minister of the Congress party-led government of tri-lingual Bombay Presidency.

[ 82 ] The ultimatum to the British during the Quit India Movement was given in Mumbai and culminated in the transfer of power and independence in 1947.

[ citation needed ] After Indian independence, princely states and Jagirs of the Deccan States Agency were merged into Bombay State , which was created from the former Bombay Presidency in 1950.

[ 83 ] In 1956, the States Reorganisation Act reorganised the Indian states along linguistic lines, and Bombay Presidency State was enlarged by the addition of the predominantly Marathi -speaking regions of Marathwada ( Aurangabad Division ) from erstwhile Hyderabad state and Vidarbha region from the Central Provinces and Berar . The southernmost part of Bombay State was ceded to Mysore . In the 1950s, Marathi people strongly protested against bilingual Bombay state under the banner of Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti .

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] The notable leaders of the samiti included Keshavrao Jedhe , S.M. Joshi , Shripad Amrit Dange , Pralhad Keshav Atre and Gopalrao Khedkar . The key demand of the samiti called for a Marathi speaking state with Mumbai as its capital.

[ 86 ] In the Gujarati speaking areas of the state, a similar Mahagujarat Movement demanded a separate Gujarat state comprising majority Gujarati areas. After many years of protests, which saw 106 deaths among the protestors, and electoral success of the samiti in 1957 elections, the central government led by Prime minister Nehru split Bombay State into two new states of Maharashtra and Gujarat on 1 May 1960.

[ 87 ] The state continues to have a dispute with Karnataka regarding the region of Belgaum and Karwar .

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] The Government of Maharashtra was unhappy with the border demarcation of 1957 and filed a petition to the Ministry of Home affairs of India.

[ 90 ] Maharashtra claimed 814 villages, and 3 urban settlements of Belagon, Karwar and Nippani , all part of then Bombay Presidency before freedom of the country.

[ 91 ] A petition by Maharashtra in the Supreme Court of India, staking a claim over Belagon, is currently pending.

The State lies between 15°35' N to 22°02' N latitude and 72°36' E to 80°54' E longitude. It occupies the western and central part of the country and has a coastline stretching 840 kilometres (520 mi) [ 93 ] along the Arabian Sea .

[ 94 ] The dominant physical feature of the state is its plateau character, which is separated from the Konkan coastline by the mountain range of the Western Ghats, which runs parallel to the coast from north to south. The Western Ghats , also known as the Sahyadri Range, has an average elevation of 1,200 metres (3,900 ft); its slopes gently descending towards the east and southeast.

[ 95 ] The Western Ghats (or the Sahyadri Mountain range) provide a physical barrier to the state on the west, while the Satpura Hills along the north and Bhamragad-Chiroli-Gaikhuri ranges on the east serve as its natural borders.

[ 96 ] This state's expansion from North to South is 720 km (450 mi) and East to West is 800 km (500 mi). To the west of these hills lie the Konkan coastal plains, 50–80 km (31–50 mi) in width. To the east of the Ghats lies the flat Deccan Plateau . The main rivers of the state are the Krishna , and its tributary, Bhima , the Godavari, and its main tributaries, Manjara , and Wardha - Wainganga and the Tapi , and its tributary Purna .

[ 94 ] [ 97 ] Maharashtra is divided into five geographic regions. Konkan is the western coastal region, between the Western Ghats and the sea.

[ 98 ] Khandesh is the north region lying in the valley of the Tapti, Purna river.

[ 97 ] Nashik , Malegaon Jalgaon , Dhule and Bhusawal are the major cities of this region.

[ 99 ] Desh is in the centre of the state.

[ 100 ] Marathwada , which was a part of the princely state of Hyderabad until 1956, is located in the southeastern part of the state.

[ 94 ] [ 101 ] Aurangabad and Nanded are the main cities of the region.

[ 102 ] Vidarbha is the easternmost region of the state, formerly part of the Central Provinces and Berar.

[ 103 ] The state has limited area under irrigation, low natural fertility of soils, and large areas prone to recurrent drought. Due to this the agricultural productivity of Maharashtra is generally low as compared to the national averages of various crops. Maharashtra has been divided in to nine agro-climatic zones on the basis of annual rainfall soil types, vegetation and cropping pattern.

[ 104 ] Further information: Manas Rural Development Institute Climate Dried up Godavari River at Puntamba , Ahmadnagar district, after a poor monsoon season Maharashtra experiences a tropical wet and dry climate with hot, rainy, and cold weather seasons. Some areas more inland experience a hot semi arid climate, due to a rain shadow effect caused by the Western Ghats.

[ 105 ] The month of March marks the beginning of the summer and the temperature rises steadily until June. In the central plains, summer temperatures rise to between 40 °C or 104.0 °F and 45 °C or 113.0 °F. May is usually the warmest and January the coldest month of the year. The winter season lasts until February with lower temperatures occurring in December and January. On the Deccan plateau that lies on eastern side of the Sahyadri mountains, the climate is drier, however, dew and hail often occur, depending on seasonal weather.

[ 106 ] The rainfall patterns in the state vary by the topography of different regions. The state can be divided into four meteorological regions, namely coastal Konkan, Western Maharashtra, Marathwada, and Vidarbha.

[ 107 ] The southwest monsoon usually arrives in the last week of June and lasts till mid-September. Pre-monsoon showers begin towards the middle of June and post-monsoon rains occasionally occur in October. The highest average monthly rainfall is during July and August. In the winter season, there may be a little rainfall associated with western winds over the region. The Konkan coastal area, west of the Sahyadri Mountains receives very heavy monsoon rains with an annual average of more than 3,000 millimetres (120 in). However, just 150 km (93 mi) to the east, in the rain shadow of the mountain range, only 500–700 mm/year will fall, and long dry spells leading to drought are a common occurrence. Maharashtra has many of the 99 Indian districts identified by the Indian Central water commission as prone to drought.

[ 108 ] The average annual rainfall in the state is 1,181 mm (46.5 in) and 75% of it is received during the southwest monsoon from June–to September. However, under the influence of the Bay of Bengal, eastern Vidarbha receives good rainfall in July, August, and September.

[ 109 ] Thane, Raigad , Ratnagiri , and Sindhudurg districts receive heavy rains of an average of 2,000 to 2,500 mm or 80 to 100 in and the hill stations of Matheran and Mahabaleshwar over 5,000 mm (200 in). Contrariwise, the rain shadow districts of Nashik , Pune , Ahmednagar , Dhule , Jalgaon , Satara , Sangli , Solapur , and parts of Kolhapur receive less than 1,000 mm (39 in) annually. In winter, a cool dry spell occurs, with clear skies, gentle air breeze, and pleasant weather that prevails from October to February, although the eastern Vidarbha region receives rainfall from the north-east monsoon.

[ 110 ] Flora and fauna A Bengal tiger in Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve The state has three crucial biogeographic zones, namely Western Ghats , Deccan Plateau , and the West coast . The Ghats nurture endemic species, Deccan Plateau provides for vast mountain ranges and grasslands while the coast is home to littoral and swamp forests. Flora of Maharashtra is heterogeneous in composition. In 2012 the recorded thick forest area in the state was 61,939 km 2 (23,915 sq mi) which was about 20.13% of the state's geographical area.

[ 111 ] There are three main Public Forestry Institutions (PFIs) in the Maharashtra state: the Maharashtra Forest Department (MFD), the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) and the Directorate of Social Forestry (SFD).

[ 112 ] The Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board, constituted by the Government of Maharashtra in January 2012 under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is the nodal body for the conservation of biodiversity within and outside forest areas in the State.

[ 113 ] [ 114 ] Maharashtra is ranked second among the Indian states in terms of the recorded forest area. Recorded Forest Area (RFA) in the state is 61,579 sq mi (159,489 km 2 ) of which 49,546 sq mi (128,324 km 2 ) is reserved forests, 6,733 sq mi (17,438 km 2 ) is protected forest and 5,300 sq mi (13,727 km 2 ) is unclassed forests. Based on the interpretation of IRS Resourcesat-2 LISS III satellite data of the period Oct 2017 to Jan 2018, the State has 8,720.53 sq mi (22,586 km 2 ) under Very Dense Forest(VDF), 20,572.35 sq mi (53,282 km 2 ) under Moderately Dense Forest (MDF) and 21,484.68 sq mi (55,645 km 2 ) under Open Forest (OF). According to the Champion and Seth classification , Maharashtra has five types of forests: [ 115 ] Southern Tropical Semi-Evergreen forests: These are found in the western ghats at a height of 400–1,000 m (1,300–3,300 ft).

[ 183 ] Later in 2019, the BJP and Shiv Sena alliance fought the assembly elections together but the alliance broke down after the election over the post of the chief minister.

Uddhav Thackeray of Shiv Sena then formed an alternative governing coalition under his leadership with his erstwhile opponents from NCP, INC, and several independent members of the legislative assembly.

[ 184 ] [ 185 ] Thackeray served as the 19th Chief minister of Maharashtra of the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition until June 2022.

[ 192 ] BJP leader, Devendra Fadnavis was given the post of Deputy Chief Minister in the new government.

[ 192 ] Uddhav Thackeray filed a lawsuit in Supreme Court of India claiming that Eknath Shinde and his group's actions meant that they were disqualified under Anti-defection law , with Eknath Shinde claiming that he has not defected, but rather represents the true Shiv Sena party.

[ 193 ] [ 194 ] The Supreme court delivered its verdict in May 2023. In its verdict the five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme court ruled that the Maharashtra governor and assembly speaker did not act as per the law.

[ 201 ] In the 2024 Loksabha  elections , the INDIA grouping which includes the Mahavikas aghadi won a resounding victory with the majority of the state Loksabha seats, however in the Vidhan sabha elections held  November 2024 had the opposite result with the  Mahayuti coalition of BJP, Shivsena (Shinde), and NCP (Ajit Pawar) winning 80% of the Vidhan sabha seats.

[ 202 ] [ 203 ] In December 2024, Devendra Phadnavis became the chief minister of the mahayuti government with Eknath Shinde, and Ajit Pawar being appointed as deputy chief ministers. Election analysts have credited the Ladki Bahin Yojana that made cash transfers to women before the election as attracting a larger number of female voters to  opt for the Mahayuti. Other factors cited by analysts including greater participation by the RSS in ground level campaigning, continued popularity of Narendra Modi, and dog-whistle call for Hindu unity using slogans such as Batenge to katenge (divided we fall).
