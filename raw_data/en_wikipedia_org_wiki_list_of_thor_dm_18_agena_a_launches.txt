The rockets used the Douglas -built Thor first stage and the Lockheed -built Agena second stages. They are thus cousins of the more-famous Thor-Deltas, which founded the Delta rocket family. The first attempted launch of a Thor-Agena was in January 1959. The first successful launch was on 28 February 1959, launching Discoverer 1 . It was the first two-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit.
