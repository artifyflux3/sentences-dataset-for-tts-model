The asteroid is notable for reflecting about 60% of the light that hits it, making it one of the brightest near-earth asteroids ever seen.

[ 3 ] Discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey on 12 October 2015, it was observed with several ground-based telescopes.

[ 2 ] Radar observations were also made using the Arecibo Observatory as it passed 128,000 kilometers (80,000 miles) from the Earth.

[ 3 ] Observations suggest its surface composition is similar to Aubrite meteorites, a rare class of high- albedo differentiated meteorites.

[ 2 ] The albedo and radar polarization ratio suggest 2015 TC 25 belongs to the E-type asteroids , and comparison of its spectral and dynamical properties suggest it may have broke off of the 70-kilometer diameter E-type asteroid 44 Nysa .

[ 2 ] 2015 TC 25 is also notable for its rather short rotation period of only about 2 minutes, which, combined with its low surface gravity makes it very difficult for 2015 TC 25 to retain a regolith layer. Its surface therefore most likely resembles a bare rock.
