All of the Warrior athletic teams compete at the Division I level. Men's and women's ice hockey compete in the Hockey East conference, and football competes as an FCS Independent , while the remaining teams are members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference .

[ 3 ] The college's combination of academic and athletic success has garnered Merrimack the #4 ranking in the country among NCAA Division II schools in the Top 100 Collegiate Power Rankings that are published by the National College Scouting Association. Merrimack finished 96th in the overall NCSA Power Rankings across all three NCAA divisions.

During the 2019–20 season Merrimack began their four-year transition from Division II to Division I and became a full Division I member in the 2023–24 season, making Merrimack eligible for all NCAA tournaments.

[ 4 ] In 2024, the school announced it would join the MAAC , and the football team would become an FCS independent.

History [ edit ] Highlights of Merrimack athletic history include four national championships: the 1978 men's hockey team won the Division II men's ice hockey championship ; the 1994 women's softball team won the Division II Women's College World Series ; and men's lacrosse won the 2018 and 2019 National Title .

In 2012, Merrimack men's tennis became Northeast-10 champions, led by senior captains Max Eppley and Sean Pahler, and first-year head coach Sean Tully. This was Merrimack's first-ever men's tennis championship.

[ 5 ] In 2019 the college announced they would move up to Division I and join the NEC . The men's basketball team won the NEC regular season in just their first year. Many of the other programs also had success in their first couple of seasons, showing the school could compete at the DI level.
