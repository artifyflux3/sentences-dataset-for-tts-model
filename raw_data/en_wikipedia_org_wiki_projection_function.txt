{\displaystyle \mathrm {proj} _{j}({\vec {x}})=x_{j}.} [ 1 ] A function that sends an element x {\displaystyle x} to its equivalence class under a specified equivalence relation E , {\displaystyle E,} [ 2 ] or, equivalently, a surjection from a set to another set.

[ 3 ] The function from elements to equivalence classes is a surjection, and every surjection corresponds to an equivalence relation under which two elements are equivalent when they have the same image. The result of the mapping is written as [ x ] {\displaystyle [x]} when E {\displaystyle E} is understood, or written as [ x ] E {\displaystyle [x]_{E}} when it is necessary to make E {\displaystyle E} explicit.
