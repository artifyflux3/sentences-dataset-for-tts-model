It is transient in the decay chain of primordial uranium-238 and is the immediate decay product of radium-226 . Radon-222 was first observed in 1899, and was identified as an isotope of a new element several years later. In 1957, the name radon , formerly the name of only radon-222, became the name of the element. Owing to its gaseous nature and high radioactivity, radon-222 is one of the leading causes of lung cancer .

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] Following the 1898 discovery of radium through chemical analysis of radioactive ore, Marie and Pierre Curie observed a new radioactive substance emanating from radium in 1899 that was strongly radioactive for several days.

[ 4 ] Around the same time, Ernest Rutherford and Robert B. Owens observed a similar (though shorter-lived) emission from thorium compounds.

[ 5 ] German physicist Friedrich Ernst Dorn extensively studied these emanations in the early 1900s and attributed them to a new gaseous element, radon. In particular, he studied the product in the uranium series , radon-222, which he called radium emanation .

[ 6 ] In the early 20th century, the element radon was known by several different names. Chemist William Ramsay , who extensively studied the element's chemical properties, suggested the name niton , and Rutherford originally suggested emanation . At that time, radon only referred to the isotope 222 Rn, whereas the names actinon and thoron denoted 219 Rn and 220 Rn, respectively.

[ 7 ] In 1957, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) promoted the name radon to refer to the element rather than just 222 Rn; this was done under a new rule concerning isotope naming conventions.

[ 7 ] This decision was controversial because it was believed to give undue credit to Dorn's identification of radon-222 over Rutherford's identification of radon-220, and the historical use of the name radon created confusion as to whether the element or the isotope 222 Rn was being discussed.

[ 7 ] Decay properties [ edit ] The decay chain of uranium-238, known as the uranium series or radium series, of which radon-222 is a member.

Radon-222 is generated in the uranium series from the alpha decay of radium-226, which has a half-life of 1600 years. Radon-222 itself alpha decays to polonium-218 with a half-life of approximately 3.82 days, making it the most stable isotope of radon.

[ 1 ] Its final decay product is stable lead-206 .

In theory, 222 Rn is capable of double beta decay to 222 Ra, and depending on the mass measurement, single beta decay to 222 Fr may also be allowed.

[ 8 ] [ a ] These decay modes have been searched for, yielding lower partial half-life limits of 8 years for both transitions. If the beta decay of 222 Rn is possible, it is predicted to have a very low decay energy (24 ± 21 keV ) and thus a half-life on the order of 10 5 years, also resulting in a very low branching probability relative to alpha decay.

[ 8 ] The last edition of Atomic Mass Evaluation [ 2 ] gives even lower value of the decay energy (−6 ± 8) keV ; thus the single beta decay is, probably, forbidden kinematically.

Occurrence and hazards [ edit ] Main article: Health effects of radon All radon isotopes are hazardous owing to their radioactivity, gaseous nature, chemical inertness, and radioactivity of their decay products (progeny). Radon-222 is especially dangerous because its longer half-life allows it to permeate soil and rocks, where it is produced in trace quantities from decays of uranium-238, and concentrate in buildings and uranium mines . This contrasts with the other natural isotopes that decay far more quickly (half-lives less than 1 minute) and thus do not contribute significantly to radiation exposure.

[ 9 ] At higher concentrations, gaseous 222 Rn may be inhaled and decay before exhalation, which leads to a buildup of its daughters 218 Po and 214 Po in the lungs, whose high-energy alpha and gamma radiation damages cells. Extended periods of exposure to 222 Rn and its progeny ultimately induce lung cancer.

[ 9 ] Alternatively, radon may enter the body through contaminated drinking water or through the decay of ingested radium [ 3 ] – making radon diffusion one of the greatest dangers of radium.

[ 10 ] Thus, 222 Rn is a carcinogen ; in fact, it is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States after cigarette smoking , [ 3 ] with over 20,000 deaths per year attributed to radon-induced lung cancer.

[ 9 ] [ 11 ] See also [ edit ] Isotopes of radon Notes [ edit ] ^ AME2020 gives 222 Rn a lower mass than 222 Fr (the available energy is (−6 ± 8) keV ), [ 1 ] [ 2 ] which would forbid single beta decay, though it is possible within the given error margin and is explicitly predicted by Belli et al.
