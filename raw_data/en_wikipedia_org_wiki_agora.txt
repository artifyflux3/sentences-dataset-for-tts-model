The agora ( / ˈ æ ɡ ə r ə / ; Ancient Greek : ἀγορά , romanized: agorá , meaning "market" in Modern Greek ) was a central public space in ancient Greek city-states . The literal meaning of the word "agora" is "gathering place" or "assembly". The agora was the center of the athletic, artistic, business, social, spiritual, and political life in the city.

[ 1 ] The Ancient Agora of Athens is the best-known example.

Origins [ edit ] Bronze Roman medal (45 mm, 45.6 g) showing Caracalla 's portrait and the emperor being greeted by city's citizens in the Agora during his visit to Laodicea ad Lycum (216/217 AD), in front of a two-columned temple with soldiers lined up on both sides.

Early in Greek history (10th–4th centuries BC), free-born citizens would gather in the agora for military duty or to hear statements of the ruling king or council. Later, the agora also served as a marketplace , where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods amid arcades . This attracted artisans who built workshops nearby.

[ 2 ] [ better source needed ] From these twin functions of the agora as a political and a commercial spot came the two Greek verbs ἀγοράζω , agorázō , "I shop", and ἀγορεύω , agoreúō , "I speak in public".

[ 3 ] Ancient Agora of Athens [ edit ] Main article: Ancient Agora of Athens The Athenian agora today The Ancient Agora of Athens was situated beneath the northern slope of the Acropolis . The Ancient Agora was the primary meeting ground for Athenians, where members of democracy congregated affairs of the state, where business was conducted, a place to hang out, and watch performers and listen to famous philosophers . The importance of the Athenian agora revolved around religion. The agora was a very sacred place, in which holiness is laid out in the architecture of the ground upon which it lay. The layout of the agora was centered around the Panathenaic Way, a road that ran through the middle of Athens and to the main gate of the city, Dipylon .

[ 4 ] This road was considered tremendously sacred, serving as a travel route for the Panathenaic festival , which was held in honor of the goddess Athena every four years. The agora was also famously known for housing the Temple of Hephaestus , the Greek god of metalworking and craftsmen. This temple is still in great condition to this day. Other temples priorly standing in the agora include honor for Zeus , Athena , Apollo , and Ares .

[ 5 ] Location and constituents [ edit ] The reconstructed Stoa of Attalos The agora was usually located in the middle of a city or near the harbor. Agoras were built of colonnades , or rows of long columns, and contained stoae , also known as a long open walkway below the colonnades.

[ 6 ] They were beautifully decorated with fountains, trees, and statues. When the Athenian agora was rebuilt after the Greco-Persian Wars , colonnades and stoae were not incorporated.

[ 7 ] Phobia [ edit ] The term agoraphobia denotes a phobic condition in which the sufferer becomes anxious in unfamiliar environments – for instance, places where they perceive that they have little control. Such anxiety may be triggered by wide-open spaces, crowds, or public situations, and the psychological term derives from the agora as a large and open gathering place.
