A satellite orbiting Earth has a [tangential velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed#Tangential_speed "Speed") and an inward [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration").

**Orbital mechanics** or **astrodynamics** is the application of [ballistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics "Ballistics") and [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics") to [rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket"), [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite"), and other [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"). The motion of these objects is usually calculated from [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") and the [law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"). Astrodynamics is a core discipline within [space-mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration "Space exploration") design and control.

Celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"), including both spacecraft and natural [astronomical bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") such as [star systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system "Star system"), [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), [moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite"), and [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet"). Orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft [trajectories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory"), including [orbital maneuvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuver "Orbital maneuver"), [orbital plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy) "Orbital plane (astronomy)") changes, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of [propulsive maneuvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion "Spacecraft propulsion").

[General relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") is a more exact theory than Newton's laws for calculating orbits, and it is sometimes necessary to use it for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations (e.g. orbits near the Sun).

Until the rise of [space travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight") in the twentieth century, there was little distinction between orbital and celestial mechanics. At the time of [Sputnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik "Sputnik"), the field was termed 'space dynamics'.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodynamics#cite_note-1) The fundamental techniques, such as those used to solve the [Keplerian problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keplerian_problem "Keplerian problem") (determining position as a function of time), are therefore the same in both fields. Furthermore, the history of the fields is almost entirely shared.

[Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") was the first to successfully model planetary orbits to a high degree of accuracy, publishing [his laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion") in 1609. [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") published more general laws of celestial motion in the first edition of _[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_ (1687), which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a [parabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola") path from three observations.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodynamics#cite_note-2) This was used by [Edmund Halley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Halley "Edmund Halley") to establish the orbits of various comets, including [that which bears his name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet "Halley's Comet"). Newton's method of successive approximation was formalised into an analytic method by [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler "Euler") in 1744, whose work was in turn generalised to elliptical and hyperbolic orbits by [Johann Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Lambert "Johann Heinrich Lambert") in 1761–1777.

Another milestone in orbit determination was [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss")'s assistance in the "recovery" of the dwarf planet [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet) "Ceres (dwarf planet)") in 1801. [Gauss's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_method "Gauss's method") was able to use just three observations (in the form of pairs of [right ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension "Right ascension") and [declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination "Declination")), to find the six [orbital elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements "Orbital elements") that completely describe an orbit. The theory of orbit determination has subsequently been developed to the point where today it is applied in GPS receivers as well as the tracking and cataloguing of newly observed [minor planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_planet "Minor planet"). Modern orbit determination and prediction are used to operate all types of satellites and space probes, as it is necessary to know their future positions to a high degree of accuracy.

[Astrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodynamics "Astrodynamics") was developed by astronomer [Samuel Herrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Herrick_(astronomer) "Samuel Herrick (astronomer)") beginning in the 1930s. He consulted the rocket scientist [Robert Goddard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Goddard "Robert Goddard") and was encouraged to continue his work on space navigation techniques, as Goddard believed they would be needed in the future. Numerical techniques of astrodynamics were coupled with new powerful computers in the 1960s, and humans were ready to travel to the Moon and return.

Practical techniques
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_mechanics&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Practical techniques")]

The following rules of thumb are useful for situations approximated by [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") under the standard assumptions of astrodynamics outlined below. The specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet, but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations, such as orbits of small bodies around a star such as the Sun.

*   [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion"): 
    *   Orbits are [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"), with the heavier body at one [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry) "Focus (geometry)") of the ellipse. A special case of this is a circular orbit (a circle is a special case of ellipse) with the planet at the center.
    *   A line drawn from the planet to the satellite sweeps out _equal areas in equal times_ no matter which portion of the orbit is measured.
    *   The square of a satellite's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the planet.

*   Without applying force (such as firing a rocket engine), the period and shape of the satellite's orbit will not change.
*   A satellite in a low orbit (or a low part of an elliptical orbit) moves more quickly with respect to the surface of the planet than a satellite in a higher orbit (or a high part of an elliptical orbit), due to the stronger gravitational attraction closer to the planet.
*   If thrust is applied at only one point in the satellite's orbit, it will return to that same point on each subsequent orbit, though the rest of its path will change. Thus one cannot move from one circular orbit to another with only one brief application of thrust.
*   From a circular orbit, thrust applied in a direction opposite to the satellite's motion changes the orbit to an elliptical one; the satellite will descend and reach the lowest orbital point (the [periapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapse "Periapse")) at 180 degrees away from the firing point; then it will ascend back. The period of the resultant orbit will be less than that of the original circular orbit. Thrust applied in the direction of the satellite's motion creates an elliptical orbit with its highest point ([apoapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoapse "Apoapse")) 180 degrees away from the firing point. The period of the resultant orbit will be longer than that of the original circular orbit.

The consequences of the rules of orbital mechanics are sometimes counter-intuitive. For example, if two spacecrafts are in the same circular orbit and wish to dock, the trailing craft cannot simply fire its engines to accelerate towards the leading craft. This will change the shape of its orbit, causing it to gain altitude and slow down relative to the leading craft, thus moving away from the target. The [space rendezvous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous "Space rendezvous") before docking normally takes multiple precisely calculated engine firings in multiple orbital periods, requiring hours or even days to complete.

To the extent that the standard assumptions of astrodynamics do not hold, actual trajectories will vary from those calculated. For example, simple [atmospheric drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_drag "Atmospheric drag") is another complicating factor for objects in [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit").

These rules of thumb are decidedly inaccurate when describing two or more bodies of similar mass, such as a [binary star system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star_system "Binary star system") (see [n-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem "N-body problem")). [Celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics") uses more general rules applicable to a wider variety of situations. Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which can be mathematically derived from Newton's laws, hold strictly only in describing the motion of two gravitating bodies in the absence of non-gravitational forces; they also describe parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories. In the close proximity of large objects like stars the differences between [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") and [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") also become important.

Laws of astrodynamics
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_mechanics&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Laws of astrodynamics")]

The fundamental laws of astrodynamics are [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation") and [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion"), while the fundamental mathematical tool is [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus").

In a Newtonian framework, the laws governing orbits and trajectories are in principle [time-symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry "T-symmetry").

Standard assumptions in astrodynamics include non-interference from outside bodies, negligible mass for one of the bodies, and negligible other forces (such as from the solar wind, atmospheric drag, etc.). More accurate calculations can be made without these simplifying assumptions, but they are more complicated. The increased accuracy often does not make enough of a difference in the calculation to be worthwhile.

[Kepler's laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion") may be derived from Newton's laws, when it is assumed that the orbiting body is subject only to the gravitational force of the central attractor. When an engine thrust or propulsive force is present, Newton's laws still apply, but Kepler's laws are invalidated. When the thrust stops, the resulting orbit will be different but will once again be described by Kepler's laws which have been set out above. The three laws are:

1.   The [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") of every [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") is an [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") with the Sun at one of the [foci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry) "Focus (geometry)").
2.   A [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(mathematics) "Line (mathematics)") joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
3.   The [squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(algebra) "Square (algebra)") of the [orbital periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period") of planets are directly [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)") to the [cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_(arithmetic) "Cube (arithmetic)") of the [semi-major axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_axis "Semi-major axis") of the orbits.

The formula for an [escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity "Escape velocity") is derived as follows. The [specific energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_energy "Specific energy") (energy per unit [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass")) of any space vehicle is composed of two components, the [specific potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_potential_energy "Specific potential energy") and the [specific kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_kinetic_energy "Specific kinetic energy"). The specific potential energy associated with a planet of [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass")_M_ is given by

![Image 2: {\displaystyle \epsilon _{p}=-{\frac {GM}{r}}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/202b055da77c9098fcf10efbafbd8d3e8831088d)
where _G_ is the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant") and _r_ is the distance between the two bodies;

while the [specific kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_kinetic_energy "Specific kinetic energy") of an object is given by

![Image 3: {\displaystyle \epsilon _{k}={\frac {v^{2}}{2}}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59e8a2472663da0d206d548f893e777fa127e62e)
where _v_ is its Velocity;

and so the total [specific orbital energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy "Specific orbital energy") is

![Image 4: {\displaystyle \epsilon =\epsilon _{k}+\epsilon _{p}={\frac {v^{2}}{2}}-{\frac {GM}{r}}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b1c53fb8edbcce07bce53e3c770b3bb2bc332421)
Since [energy is conserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy"), ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \epsilon }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3837cad72483d97bcdde49c85d3b7b859fb3fd2) cannot depend on the distance, ![Image 6: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538), from the center of the central body to the space vehicle in question, i.e. _v_ must vary with _r_ to keep the specific orbital energy constant. Therefore, the object can reach infinite ![Image 7: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538) only if this quantity is nonnegative, which implies

![Image 8: {\displaystyle v\geq {\sqrt {\frac {2GM}{r}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/51957d7cceb3906a1a858dd4f77810771ff7014d)
The escape velocity from the Earth's surface is about 11 km/s, but that is insufficient to send the body an infinite distance because of the gravitational pull of the Sun. To escape the Solar System from a location at a distance from the Sun equal to the distance Sun–Earth, but not close to the Earth, requires around 42 km/s velocity, but there will be "partial credit" for the Earth's orbital velocity for spacecraft launched from Earth, if their further acceleration (due to the propulsion system) carries them in the same direction as Earth travels in its orbit.

### Formulae for free orbits

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_mechanics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Formulae for free orbits")]

Orbits are [conic sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section"), so the formula for the distance of a body for a given angle corresponds to the formula for that curve in [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates "Polar coordinates"), which is:

![Image 9: {\displaystyle r={\frac {p}{1+e\cos \theta }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e34b3d588b04110d81d435e06b36e023683a9a09)![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mu =G(m_{1}+m_{2})\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30d000d9d7592fc22fd4a07fd8440f8d07fe5433)![Image 11: {\displaystyle p=h^{2}/\mu \,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/60e212d6386cc2cf31869b40144b141f558c0800)
![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161) is called the [gravitational parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_parameter "Gravitational parameter"). ![Image 13: {\displaystyle m_{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31aafa60e48d39ccce922404c0b80340b2cc777a) and ![Image 14: {\displaystyle m_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0ecebe334d5cadc3ffcf245eb02919034d7a2ec8) are the masses of objects 1 and 2, and ![Image 15: {\displaystyle h}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a) is the [specific angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_angular_momentum "Specific angular momentum") of object 2 with respect to object 1. The parameter ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) is known as the [true anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_anomaly "True anomaly"), ![Image 17: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36) is the [semi-latus rectum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section#Conic_parameters "Conic section"), while ![Image 18: {\displaystyle e}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cd253103f0876afc68ebead27a5aa9867d927467) is the [orbital eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity "Orbital eccentricity"), all obtainable from the various forms of the six independent [orbital elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements "Orbital elements").

All bounded orbits where the gravity of a central body dominates are elliptical in nature. A special case of this is the circular orbit, which is an ellipse of zero eccentricity. The formula for the velocity of a body in a circular orbit at distance _r_ from the center of gravity of mass _M_ can be derived as follows:

Centrifugal acceleration matches the acceleration due to gravity.

So, ![Image 19: {\displaystyle {\frac {v^{2}}{r}}={\frac {GM}{r^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/88621f44f38126f6368814a9e95c691a0bf434ed)

Therefore,

![Image 20: {\displaystyle \ v={\sqrt {{\frac {GM}{r}}\ }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3c8baea40bef1c9ac3ba24d9f240ffd9d3835eb0)
where ![Image 21: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) is the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant"), equal to

6.6743 × 10−11 m 3/(kg·s 2)
To properly use this formula, the units must be consistent; for example, ![Image 22: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) must be in kilograms, and ![Image 23: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538) must be in meters. The answer will be in meters per second.

The quantity ![Image 24: {\displaystyle GM}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d2d9b5427dc6e6f3c11f13d88a5b637b4bc24585) is often termed the [standard gravitational parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter "Standard gravitational parameter"), which has a different value for every planet or moon in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System").

Once the circular orbital velocity is known, the [escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity "Escape velocity") is easily found by multiplying by ![Image 25: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4afc1e27d418021bf10898eb44a7f5f315735ff):

![Image 26: {\displaystyle \ v={\sqrt {2}}{\sqrt {{\frac {GM}{r}}\ }}={\sqrt {{\frac {2GM}{r}}\ }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6ce5f6194c939b417dc6d08a36e6713f87c57321)
To escape from gravity, the kinetic energy must at least match the negative potential energy. Therefore, ![Image 27: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}={\frac {GMm}{r}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4bdf2495984f3d23edccd412d015d6ed66fda72b)

![Image 28: {\displaystyle v={\sqrt {{\frac {2GM}{r}}\ }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/567486d6bd4e22d157701c6afb550228d07ba12a)
If ![Image 29: {\displaystyle 0<e<1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/679de8c4138507493a1cc5adc572bb0ffdd19a82), then the denominator of the equation of free orbits varies with the true anomaly ![Image 30: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af), but remains positive, never becoming zero. Therefore, the relative position vector remains bounded, having its smallest magnitude at periapsis ![Image 31: {\displaystyle r_{p}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d02ec163fac8837ac757005d783b375e52808b97), which is given by:

![Image 32: {\displaystyle r_{p}={\frac {p}{1+e}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d327e3493f643cc37ded75593b1c62c1c2e20f6c)
The maximum value ![Image 33: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538) is reached when ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \theta =180^{\circ }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/acfe2a9d00d19df1cda947de4bd87632ffa66a14). This point is called the apoapsis, and its radial coordinate, denoted ![Image 35: {\displaystyle r_{a}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/da5f0781a46ba20129a554237056b6ade78b956f), is

Let ![Image 37: {\displaystyle 2a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d325c24be7d760207674a169b078892bdd5cbc76) be the distance measured along the apse line from periapsis ![Image 38: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) to apoapsis ![Image 39: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3), as illustrated in the equation below:

Substituting the equations above, we get:

Under standard assumptions, [specific orbital energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy "Specific orbital energy") (![Image 50: {\displaystyle \epsilon \,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/587ec0778f84a86a9567b2e296aec908d895ff21)) of elliptic orbit is negative and the orbital energy conservation equation (the [Vis-viva equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation "Vis-viva equation")) for this orbit can take the form:

*   For a given semi-major axis the specific orbital energy is independent of the eccentricity.

If the eccentricity equals 1, then the orbit equation becomes:

Clearly, the denominator of the equation above goes to zero when ![Image 58: {\displaystyle \cos \theta =-1/e}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b268a7a9a08eebd5258ee0674b0d3eeb64d4a5d2). we denote this value of true anomaly

Calculating trajectories
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_mechanics&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Calculating trajectories")]

One approach to calculating orbits (mainly used historically) is to use [Kepler's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation "Kepler's equation"):

![Image 70: {\displaystyle M=E-\epsilon \cdot \sin E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff78f4e700fcf528ed688ac9d103d605c7fd7443).
where _M_ is the [mean anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_anomaly "Mean anomaly"), _E_ is the [eccentric anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_anomaly "Eccentric anomaly"), and ![Image 71: {\displaystyle \epsilon }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3837cad72483d97bcdde49c85d3b7b859fb3fd2) is the [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(mathematics) "Eccentricity (mathematics)").

With Kepler's formula, finding the time-of-flight to reach an angle ([true anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_anomaly "True anomaly")) of ![Image 72: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) from [periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapsis "Periapsis") is broken into two steps:

1.   Compute the eccentric anomaly ![Image 73: {\displaystyle E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b) from true anomaly ![Image 74: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af)
2.   Compute the time-of-flight ![Image 75: {\displaystyle t}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560) from the eccentric anomaly ![Image 76: {\displaystyle E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b)

Finding the eccentric anomaly at a given time ([the inverse problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_Equation#Inverse_problem "Kepler's Equation")) is more difficult. Kepler's equation is [transcendental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_function "Transcendental function") in ![Image 77: {\displaystyle E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b), meaning it cannot be solved for ![Image 78: {\displaystyle E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b)[algebraically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_function "Algebraic function"). Kepler's equation can be solved for ![Image 79: {\displaystyle E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b)[analytically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function "Analytic function") by inversion.

A solution of Kepler's equation, valid for all real values of ![Image 80: {\displaystyle \textstyle \epsilon }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7a607cfd7220d79ee384166b8b99ad931b00439) is:

![Image 81: {\displaystyle E={\begin{cases}\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {M^{\frac {n}{3}}}{n!}}\lim _{\theta \to 0}\left({\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{\,n-1}}{\mathrm {d} \theta ^{\,n-1}}}\left[\left({\frac {\theta }{\sqrt[{3}]{\theta -\sin(\theta )}}}\right)^{n}\right]\right),&\epsilon =1\\\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {M^{n}}{n!}}\lim _{\theta \to 0}\left({\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{\,n-1}}{\mathrm {d} \theta ^{\,n-1}}}\left[\left({\frac {\theta }{\theta -\epsilon \cdot \sin(\theta )}}\right)^{n}\right]\right),&\epsilon \neq 1\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8bb54b06c5ad1644f1dcab31c615bcb85cb59a89)

Evaluating this yields:

![Image 82: {\displaystyle E={\begin{cases}\displaystyle x+{\frac {1}{60}}x^{3}+{\frac {1}{1400}}x^{5}+{\frac {1}{25200}}x^{7}+{\frac {43}{17248000}}x^{9}+{\frac {1213}{7207200000}}x^{11}+{\frac {151439}{12713500800000}}x^{13}\cdots \ |\ x=(6M)^{\frac {1}{3}},&\epsilon =1\\\\\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1-\epsilon }}M-{\frac {\epsilon }{(1-\epsilon )^{4}}}{\frac {M^{3}}{3!}}+{\frac {(9\epsilon ^{2}+\epsilon )}{(1-\epsilon )^{7}}}{\frac {M^{5}}{5!}}-{\frac {(225\epsilon ^{3}+54\epsilon ^{2}+\epsilon )}{(1-\epsilon )^{10}}}{\frac {M^{7}}{7!}}+{\frac {(11025\epsilon ^{4}+4131\epsilon ^{3}+243\epsilon ^{2}+\epsilon )}{(1-\epsilon )^{13}}}{\frac {M^{9}}{9!}}\cdots ,&\epsilon \neq 1\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/931164f1859aa2606f7dad89cea161b939380c6f)

Alternatively, Kepler's Equation can be solved numerically. First one must guess a value of ![Image 83: {\displaystyle E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b) and solve for time-of-flight; then adjust ![Image 84: {\displaystyle E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b) as necessary to bring the computed time-of-flight closer to the desired value until the required precision is achieved. Usually, [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method "Newton's method") is used to achieve relatively fast convergence.

The main difficulty with this approach is that it can take prohibitively long to converge for the extreme elliptical orbits. For near-parabolic orbits, eccentricity ![Image 85: {\displaystyle \epsilon }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3837cad72483d97bcdde49c85d3b7b859fb3fd2) is nearly 1, and substituting ![Image 86: {\displaystyle e=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c2f5932668126c63c844dc00ca187bc58a29e5a) into the formula for mean anomaly, ![Image 87: {\displaystyle E-\sin E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73cf586252cfbed20f189da20954eb469eac7b9b), we find ourselves subtracting two nearly-equal values, and accuracy suffers. For near-circular orbits, it is hard to find the periapsis in the first place (and truly circular orbits have no periapsis at all). Furthermore, the equation was derived on the assumption of an elliptical orbit, and so it does not hold for parabolic or hyperbolic orbits. These difficulties are what led to the development of the [universal variable formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_variable_formulation "Universal variable formulation"), described below.

For simple procedures, such as computing the [delta-v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "Delta-v") for coplanar transfer ellipses, traditional approaches[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] are fairly effective. Others, such as time-of-flight are far more complicated, especially for near-circular and hyperbolic orbits.

### The patched conic approximation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_mechanics&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: The patched conic approximation")]

The [Hohmann transfer orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit "Hohmann transfer orbit") alone is a poor approximation for interplanetary trajectories because it neglects the planets' own gravity. Planetary gravity dominates the behavior of the spacecraft in the vicinity of a planet and in most cases Hohmann severely overestimates delta-v, and produces highly inaccurate prescriptions for burn timings. A relatively simple way to get a [first-order approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_approximation "Orders of approximation") of delta-v is based on the 'Patched Conic Approximation' technique. One must choose the one dominant gravitating body in each region of space through which the trajectory will pass, and to model only that body's effects in that region. For instance, on a trajectory from the Earth to Mars, one would begin by considering only the Earth's gravity until the trajectory reaches a distance where the Earth's gravity no longer dominates that of the Sun. The spacecraft would be given [escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity "Escape velocity") to send it on its way to interplanetary space. Next, one would consider only the Sun's gravity until the trajectory reaches the neighborhood of Mars. During this stage, the transfer orbit model is appropriate. Finally, only Mars's gravity is considered during the final portion of the trajectory where Mars's gravity dominates the spacecraft's behavior. The spacecraft would approach Mars on a hyperbolic orbit, and a final retrograde burn would slow the spacecraft enough to be captured by Mars. [Friedrich Zander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Zander "Friedrich Zander") was one of the first to apply the patched-conics approach for astrodynamics purposes, when proposing the use of intermediary bodies' gravity for interplanetary travels, in what is known today as a [gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist "Gravity assist").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodynamics#cite_note-3)

The size of the "neighborhoods" (or [spheres of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence_(astrodynamics) "Sphere of influence (astrodynamics)")) vary with radius ![Image 88: {\displaystyle r_{SOI}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1b418a5e5cb9820b94f4798c6bb142c6d23f539d):

![Image 89: {\displaystyle r_{SOI}=a_{p}\left({\frac {m_{p}}{m_{s}}}\right)^{2/5}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4d084075d9fc44d49faff90e6229a0717055119b)
where ![Image 90: {\displaystyle a_{p}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3a5f11f304b2976ca9d33d1575c148e791728e7) is the [semimajor axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semimajor_axis "Semimajor axis") of the planet's orbit relative to the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"); ![Image 91: {\displaystyle m_{p}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7d93b292637f64f747f3fe0ea4bad9f2bd65637) and ![Image 92: {\displaystyle m_{s}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/488560816fccdf62695552ac8bf0611a0d5c09b4) are the [masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") of the planet and Sun, respectively.

This simplification is sufficient to compute rough estimates of fuel requirements, and rough time-of-flight estimates, but it is not generally accurate enough to guide a spacecraft to its destination. For that, numerical methods are required.

### The universal variable formulation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_mechanics&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: The universal variable formulation")]

To address computational shortcomings of traditional approaches for solving the 2-body problem, the [universal variable formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_variable_formulation "Universal variable formulation") was developed. It works equally well for the circular, elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic cases, the differential equations converging well when integrated for any orbit. It also generalizes well to problems incorporating perturbation theory.

The universal variable formulation works well with the variation of parameters technique, except now, instead of the six Keplerian orbital elements, we use a different set of orbital elements: namely, the satellite's initial position and velocity vectors ![Image 93: {\displaystyle x_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86f21d0e31751534cd6584264ecf864a6aa792cf) and ![Image 94: {\displaystyle v_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/60faad24775635f4722ccc438093dbbfe05f34ae) at a given epoch ![Image 95: {\displaystyle t=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/43469ec032d858feae5aa87029e22eaaf0109e9c). In a two-body simulation, these elements are sufficient to compute the satellite's position and velocity at any time in the future, using the universal variable formulation. Conversely, at any moment in the satellite's orbit, we can measure its position and velocity, and then use the universal variable approach to determine what its initial position and velocity _would have been_ at the epoch. In perfect two-body motion, these orbital elements would be invariant (just like the Keplerian elements would be).

However, perturbations cause the orbital elements to change over time. Hence, the position element is written as ![Image 96: {\displaystyle x_{0}(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca4c1f2c7719b7304f44a3cc5dd0416f701ac3a3) and the velocity element as ![Image 97: {\displaystyle v_{0}(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81234e70ccf74821d08d2370e905d01dcb9561e0), indicating that they vary with time. The technique to compute the effect of perturbations becomes one of finding expressions, either exact or approximate, for the functions ![Image 98: {\displaystyle x_{0}(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca4c1f2c7719b7304f44a3cc5dd0416f701ac3a3) and ![Image 99: {\displaystyle v_{0}(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81234e70ccf74821d08d2370e905d01dcb9561e0).

The following are some effects which make real orbits differ from the simple models based on a spherical Earth. Most of them can be handled on short timescales (perhaps less than a few thousand orbits) by perturbation theory because they are small relative to the corresponding two-body effects.

*   Equatorial bulges cause [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession "Precession") of the node and the perigee
*   [Tesseral harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics#Visualization_of_the_spherical_harmonics "Spherical harmonics")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodynamics#cite_note-4) of the gravity field introduce additional perturbations
*   Lunar and solar gravity perturbations alter the orbits
*   Atmospheric drag reduces the semi-major axis unless make-up thrust is used

Over very long timescales (perhaps millions of orbits), even small perturbations can dominate, and the behavior can become [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory"). On the other hand, the various perturbations can be orchestrated by clever astrodynamicists to assist with orbit maintenance tasks, such as [station-keeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_station-keeping "Orbital station-keeping"), [ground track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_track "Ground track") maintenance or adjustment, or phasing of perigee to cover selected targets at low altitude.

In [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight"), an **orbital maneuver** is the use of [propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion "Spacecraft propulsion") systems to change the [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") of a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"). For spacecraft far from Earth—for example those in orbits around the Sun—an orbital maneuver is called a _deep-space maneuver (DSM)_.[_[not verified in body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Transfer orbits are usually elliptical orbits that allow spacecraft to move from one (usually substantially circular) orbit to another. Usually they require a burn at the start, a burn at the end, and sometimes one or more burns in the middle.

*   The [Hohmann transfer orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit "Hohmann transfer orbit") requires a minimal [delta-v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "Delta-v").
*   A [bi-elliptic transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-elliptic_transfer "Bi-elliptic transfer") can require less energy than the Hohmann transfer, if the ratio of orbits is 11.94 or greater,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodynamics#cite_note-5) but comes at the cost of increased trip time over the Hohmann transfer.
*   Faster transfers may use any orbit that intersects both the original and destination orbits, at the cost of higher delta-v.
*   Using low thrust engines (such as [electrical propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_propulsion "Electrical propulsion")), if the initial orbit is supersynchronous to the final desired circular orbit then the optimal transfer orbit is achieved by thrusting continuously in the direction of the velocity at apogee. This method however takes much longer due to the low thrust.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodynamics#cite_note-6)

For the case of orbital transfer between non-coplanar orbits, the [change-of-plane thrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination_change "Orbital inclination change") must be made at the point where the orbital planes intersect (the "node"). As the objective is to change the direction of the velocity vector by an angle equal to the angle between the planes, almost all of this thrust should be made when the spacecraft is at the node near the apoapse, when the magnitude of the velocity vector is at its lowest. However, a small fraction of the orbital inclination change can be made at the node near the periapse, by slightly angling the transfer orbit injection thrust in the direction of the desired inclination change. This works because the cosine of a small angle is very nearly one, resulting in the small plane change being effectively "free" despite the high velocity of the spacecraft near periapse, as the Oberth Effect due to the increased, slightly angled thrust exceeds the cost of the thrust in the orbit-normal axis.

### Gravity assist and the Oberth effect

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_mechanics&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Gravity assist and the Oberth effect")]

In a [gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist "Gravity assist"), a spacecraft swings by a planet and leaves in a different direction, at a different speed. This is useful to speed or slow a spacecraft instead of carrying more fuel.

This maneuver can be approximated by an [elastic collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision "Elastic collision") at large distances, though the flyby does not involve any physical contact. Due to Newton's third law (equal and opposite reaction), any momentum gained by a spacecraft must be lost by the planet, or vice versa. However, because the planet is much, much more massive than the spacecraft, the effect on the planet's orbit is negligible.

The [Oberth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect "Oberth effect") can be employed, particularly during a gravity assist operation. This effect is that use of a propulsion system works better at high speeds, and hence course changes are best done when close to a gravitating body; this can multiply the effective [delta-v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "Delta-v").

### Interplanetary Transport Network and fuzzy orbits

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_mechanics&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Interplanetary Transport Network and fuzzy orbits")]

It is now possible to use computers to search for routes using the nonlinearities in the gravity of the planets and moons of the Solar System. For example, it is possible to plot an orbit from high Earth orbit to Mars, passing close to one of the Earth's [trojan points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_point "Trojan point").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Collectively referred to as the [Interplanetary Transport Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_Transport_Network "Interplanetary Transport Network"), these highly perturbative, even chaotic, orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the Lagrange point (in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections). The biggest problem with them is they can be exceedingly slow, taking many years. In addition launch windows can be very far apart.

They have, however, been employed on projects such as [Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_(spacecraft) "Genesis (spacecraft)"). This spacecraft visited the Earth-Sun [L 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L1 "Lagrange point") point and returned using very little propellant.
