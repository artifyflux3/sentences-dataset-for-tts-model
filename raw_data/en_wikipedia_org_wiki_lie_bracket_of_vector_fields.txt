Conceptually, the Lie bracket [ X , Y ] {\displaystyle [X,Y]} is the derivative of Y {\displaystyle Y} along the flow generated by X {\displaystyle X} , and is sometimes denoted L X Y {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X}Y} ("Lie derivative of Y along X"). This generalizes to the Lie derivative of any tensor field along the flow generated by X {\displaystyle X} .

The Lie bracket is an R - bilinear operation and turns the set of all smooth vector fields on the manifold M {\displaystyle M} into an (infinite-dimensional) Lie algebra .

The Lie bracket plays an important role in differential geometry and differential topology , for instance in the Frobenius integrability theorem , and is also fundamental in the geometric theory of nonlinear control systems .

[ 1 ] V. I. Arnold refers to this as the "fisherman derivative", as one can imagine being a fisherman, holding a fishing rod, sitting in a boat. Both the boat and the float are flowing according to vector field X {\displaystyle X} , and the fisherman lengthens/shrinks and turns the fishing rod according to vector field Y {\displaystyle Y} . The Lie bracket is the amount of dragging on the fishing float relative to the surrounding water.

[ 2 ] Definitions [ edit ] There are three conceptually different but equivalent approaches to defining the Lie bracket: Vector fields as derivations [ edit ] Each smooth vector field X : M → → T M {\displaystyle X:M\rightarrow TM} on a manifold M {\displaystyle M} may be regarded as a differential operator acting on smooth functions f ( p ) {\displaystyle f(p)} (where p ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle p\in M} and f {\displaystyle f} of class C ∞ ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle C^{\infty }(M)} ) when we define X ( f ) {\displaystyle X(f)} to be another function whose value at a point p {\displaystyle p} is the directional derivative of f {\displaystyle f} at p {\displaystyle p} in the direction X ( p ) {\displaystyle X(p)} . In this way, each smooth vector field X {\displaystyle X} becomes a derivation on C ∞ ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle C^{\infty }(M)} . Furthermore, any derivation on C ∞ ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle C^{\infty }(M)} arises from a unique smooth vector field X {\displaystyle X} .

In general, the commutator δ δ 1 ∘ ∘ δ δ 2 − − δ δ 2 ∘ ∘ δ δ 1 {\displaystyle \delta _{1}\circ \delta _{2}-\delta _{2}\circ \delta _{1}} of any two derivations δ δ 1 {\displaystyle \delta _{1}} and δ δ 2 {\displaystyle \delta _{2}} is again a derivation, where ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } denotes composition of operators. This can be used to define the Lie bracket as the vector field corresponding to the commutator derivation: [ X , Y ] ( f ) = X ( Y ( f ) ) − − Y ( X ( f ) ) for all f ∈ ∈ C ∞ ∞ ( M ) .

{\displaystyle [X,Y](f)=X(Y(f))-Y(X(f))\;\;{\text{  for all }}f\in C^{\infty }(M).} Flows and limits [ edit ] Let Φ Φ t X {\displaystyle \Phi _{t}^{X}} be the flow associated with the vector field X {\displaystyle X} , and let D {\displaystyle D} denote the tangent map derivative operator . Then the Lie bracket of X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} at the point x ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} can be defined as the Lie derivative : [ X , Y ] x = ( L X Y ) x := lim t → → 0 ( D Φ Φ − − t X ) Y Φ Φ t X ( x ) − − Y x t = d d t | t = 0 ( D Φ Φ − − t X ) Y Φ Φ t X ( x ) .

{\displaystyle [X,Y]_{x}\ =\ ({\mathcal {L}}_{X}Y)_{x}\ :=\ \lim _{t\to 0}{\frac {(\mathrm {D} \Phi _{-t}^{X})Y_{\Phi _{t}^{X}(x)}\,-\,Y_{x}}{t}}\ =\ \left.{\tfrac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\right|_{t=0}(\mathrm {D} \Phi _{-t}^{X})Y_{\Phi _{t}^{X}(x)}.} This also measures the failure of the flow in the successive directions X , Y , − − X , − − Y {\displaystyle X,Y,-X,-Y} to return to the point x {\displaystyle x} : [ X , Y ] x = 1 2 d 2 d t 2 | t = 0 ( Φ Φ − − t Y ∘ ∘ Φ Φ − − t X ∘ ∘ Φ Φ t Y ∘ ∘ Φ Φ t X ) ( x ) = d d t | t = 0 ( Φ Φ − − t Y ∘ ∘ Φ Φ − − t X ∘ ∘ Φ Φ t Y ∘ ∘ Φ Φ t X ) ( x ) .

{\displaystyle [X,Y]_{x}\ =\ \left.{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\tfrac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}}{\mathrm {d} t^{2}}}\right|_{t=0}(\Phi _{-t}^{Y}\circ \Phi _{-t}^{X}\circ \Phi _{t}^{Y}\circ \Phi _{t}^{X})(x)\ =\ \left.{\tfrac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\right|_{t=0}(\Phi _{\!-{\sqrt {t}}}^{Y}\circ \Phi _{\!-{\sqrt {t}}}^{X}\circ \Phi _{\!{\sqrt {t}}}^{Y}\circ \Phi _{\!{\sqrt {t}}}^{X})(x).} In coordinates [ edit ] Though the above definitions of Lie bracket are intrinsic (independent of the choice of coordinates on the manifold M {\displaystyle M} ), in practice one often wants to compute the bracket in terms of a specific coordinate system { x i } {\displaystyle \{x^{i}\}} . We write ∂ ∂ i = ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x i {\displaystyle \partial _{i}={\tfrac {\partial }{\partial x^{i}}}} for the associated local basis of the tangent bundle, so that general vector fields can be written X = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n X i ∂ ∂ i {\displaystyle \textstyle X=\sum _{i=1}^{n}X^{i}\partial _{i}} and Y = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n Y i ∂ ∂ i {\displaystyle \textstyle Y=\sum _{i=1}^{n}Y^{i}\partial _{i}} for smooth functions X i , Y i : M → → R {\displaystyle X^{i},Y^{i}:M\to \mathbb {R} } .  Then the Lie bracket can be computed as: [ X , Y ] := ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ( X ( Y i ) − − Y ( X i ) ) ∂ ∂ i = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∑ ∑ j = 1 n ( X j ∂ ∂ j Y i − − Y j ∂ ∂ j X i ) ∂ ∂ i .

{\displaystyle [X,Y]:=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left(X(Y^{i})-Y(X^{i})\right)\partial _{i}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\sum _{j=1}^{n}\left(X^{j}\partial _{j}Y^{i}-Y^{j}\partial _{j}X^{i}\right)\partial _{i}.} If M {\displaystyle M} is (an open subset of) R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , then the vector fields X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} can be written as smooth maps of the form X : M → → R n {\displaystyle X:M\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and Y : M → → R n {\displaystyle Y:M\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , and the Lie bracket [ X , Y ] : M → → R n {\displaystyle [X,Y]:M\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is given by: [ X , Y ] := J Y X − − J X Y {\displaystyle [X,Y]:=J_{Y}X-J_{X}Y} where J Y {\displaystyle J_{Y}} and J X {\displaystyle J_{X}} are n × × n {\displaystyle n\times n} Jacobian matrices ( ∂ ∂ j Y i {\displaystyle \partial _{j}Y^{i}} and ∂ ∂ j X i {\displaystyle \partial _{j}X^{i}} respectively using index notation) multiplying the n × × 1 {\displaystyle n\times 1} column vectors X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} .

Properties [ edit ] The Lie bracket of vector fields equips the real vector space V = Γ Γ ( T M ) {\displaystyle V=\Gamma (TM)} of all vector fields on M {\displaystyle M} (i.e., smooth sections of the tangent bundle T M → → M {\displaystyle TM\to M} ) with the structure of a Lie algebra , which means [ • , • ]  is a map V × × V → → V {\displaystyle V\times V\to V} with: R - bilinearity Anti-symmetry, [ X , Y ] = − − [ Y , X ] {\displaystyle [X,Y]=-[Y,X]} Jacobi identity , [ X , [ Y , Z ] ] + [ Z , [ X , Y ] ] + [ Y , [ Z , X ] ] = 0.

{\displaystyle [X,[Y,Z]]+[Z,[X,Y]]+[Y,[Z,X]]=0.} An immediate consequence of the second property is that [ X , X ] = 0 {\displaystyle [X,X]=0} for any X {\displaystyle X} .

Furthermore, there is a " product rule " for Lie brackets. Given a smooth (scalar-valued) function f {\displaystyle f} on M {\displaystyle M} and a vector field Y {\displaystyle Y} on M {\displaystyle M} , we get a new vector field f Y {\displaystyle fY} by multiplying the vector Y x {\displaystyle Y_{x}} by the scalar f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} at each point x ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} . Then: [ X , f Y ] = X ( f ) Y + f [ X , Y ] , {\displaystyle [X,fY]\ =\ X\!(f)\,Y\,+\,f\,[X,Y],} where we multiply the scalar function X ( f ) {\displaystyle X(f)} with the vector field Y {\displaystyle Y} , and the scalar function f {\displaystyle f} with the vector field [ X , Y ] {\displaystyle [X,Y]} .
This turns the vector fields with the Lie bracket into a Lie algebroid .

Vanishing of the Lie bracket of X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} means that following the flows in these directions defines a surface embedded in M {\displaystyle M} , with X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} as coordinate vector fields: Theorem: [ X , Y ] = 0 {\displaystyle [X,Y]=0\,} iff the flows of X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} commute locally, meaning ( Φ Φ t Y Φ Φ s X ) ( x ) = ( Φ Φ s X Φ Φ t Y ) ( x ) {\displaystyle (\Phi _{t}^{Y}\Phi _{s}^{X})(x)=(\Phi _{s}^{X}\,\Phi _{t}^{Y})(x)} for all x ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} and sufficiently small s {\displaystyle s} , t {\displaystyle t} .

This is a special case of the Frobenius integrability theorem .

Examples [ edit ] For a Lie group G {\displaystyle G} , the corresponding Lie algebra g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} is the tangent space at the identity T e G {\displaystyle T_{e}G} , which can be identified with the vector space of left invariant vector fields on G {\displaystyle G} . The Lie bracket of two left invariant vector fields is also left invariant, which defines the Jacobi–Lie bracket operation [ ⋅ ⋅ , ⋅ ⋅ ] : g × × g → → g {\displaystyle [\,\cdot \,,\,\cdot \,]:{\mathfrak {g}}\times {\mathfrak {g}}\to {\mathfrak {g}}} .

For a matrix Lie group, whose elements are matrices g ∈ ∈ G ⊂ ⊂ M n × × n ( R ) {\displaystyle g\in G\subset M_{n\times n}(\mathbb {R} )} , each tangent space can be represented as matrices: T g G = g ⋅ ⋅ T I G ⊂ ⊂ M n × × n ( R ) {\displaystyle T_{g}G=g\cdot T_{I}G\subset M_{n\times n}(\mathbb {R} )} , where ⋅ ⋅ {\displaystyle \cdot } means matrix multiplication and I {\displaystyle I} is the identity matrix. The invariant vector field corresponding to X ∈ ∈ g = T I G {\displaystyle X\in {\mathfrak {g}}=T_{I}G} is given by X g = g ⋅ ⋅ X ∈ ∈ T g G {\displaystyle X_{g}=g\cdot X\in T_{g}G} , and a computation shows the Lie bracket on g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} corresponds to the usual commutator of matrices: [ X , Y ] = X ⋅ ⋅ Y − − Y ⋅ ⋅ X .

{\displaystyle [X,Y]\ =\ X\cdot Y-Y\cdot X.} Generalizations [ edit ] As mentioned above, the Lie derivative can be seen as a generalization of the Lie bracket. Another generalization of the Lie bracket (to vector-valued differential forms ) is the Frölicher–Nijenhuis bracket .
