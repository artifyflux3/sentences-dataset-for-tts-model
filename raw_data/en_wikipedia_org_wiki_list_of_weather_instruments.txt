Main article: Weather instrument This is a list of devices used for recording and give output readings of various aspects of the weather .

Typical instruments [ edit ] Weather stations typically have these following instruments: Thermometer for measuring air and sea surface temperature Barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure Hygrometer for measuring humidity Anemometer for measuring wind speed Pyranometer for measuring solar radiation Rain gauge for measuring liquid precipitation over a set period of time Wind sock for measuring general wind speed and wind direction Wind vane (also called a weather vane or a weathercock) for showing the wind direction Present Weather/Precipitation Identification Sensor for identifying falling precipitation Disdrometer for measuring drop size distribution Transmissometer for measuring visibility Ceilometer for measuring cloud ceiling Observation systems [ edit ] Argo Global Atmosphere Watch Automatic weather station Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS) Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) NEXRAD radar Global Sea Level Observing System SST buoys Hurricane Hunters Dropsonde SNOTEL Weather balloon Weather vane Windsock Thermometer Anemometer Hygrometer Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System Obsolete observation systems [ edit ] WSR-57 WSR-74 Orbital instrumentation [ edit ] AIRS AMSU-A ASTER Aqua Aura AVHRR CALIPSO CloudSat CERES DMC Envisat EROS GOES GOMOS GRACE Hydros ICESat IKONOS Jason-1 Landsat MERIS MetOp Meteor Meteosat MLS MIPAS MISR MODIS MOPITT MTSAT NMP NOAA-N' NPOESS OMI OCO PARASOL QuickBird QuikSCAT RADARSAT-1 SCIAMACHY SeaWiFS SORCE SPOT TES Terra TRMM Obsolete orbital instrumentation [ edit ] ERS Nimbus program Project Vanguard Seasat TOPEX/Poseidon TIROS See also [ edit ] Automated Quality control of meteorological observations Convective storm detection Earth Observing System Environmental monitoring Geographic information system (GIS) Glossary of meteorology Mesonet Meteorology Radiosonde Rocketsonde Surface weather observation Timex Expedition WS4 Tropical cyclone observation Weather reconnaissance Weather radar Weather satellite v t e Earth-based meteorological equipment and instrumentation Anemometer Atmometer Barograph Barometer Ceiling balloon Ceiling projector Ceilometer Dark adaptor goggles Dewcell Disdrometer Dropsonde Field mill Heat flux sensor Hygrometer Ice accretion indicator Lidar Lightning detector Nephelometer Nephoscope Pan evaporation Pyranometer Pyrheliometer Present weather sensor Radiosonde Rain gauge Snow gauge Snowboard Snow pillow SODAR Solarimeter Sounding rocket Stevenson screen Sunshine recorder Tethersonde Thermo-hygrograph Thermometer Tide gauge Transmissometer Weather balloon Weather buoy Weather radar Weather vane Whole sky camera Wind profiler Windsock v t e Earth-based meteorological observation systems and weather stations General Aircraft report (AIREP) Automated airport weather station Automatic weather station (AWS) Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological data (BUFR) Dropsonde Hurricane Hunters Mesonet Meteorological Aerodrome Report (METAR) Pilot report (PIREP) Weather ship By region Worldwide Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) Argo Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) FluxNet Project (FluxNet) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Atlantic (PIRATA) Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA) Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project (TAO/TRITON) Voluntary observing ship program United States Citizen Weather Observer Program (CWOP) Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) NEXRAD radar Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) Remote Automated Weather Station (RAWS) Road Weather Information System (RWIS) Tropospheric Airborne Meteorological Data Reporting (TAMDAR) v t e US weather radars Military weather radars SCR-658 radar AN/APQ-13 AN/APS-2F AN/CPS-9 AN/FPS-41 Weather surveillance radars WSR-1, 1A, 3 and 4 WSR-57 WSR-74C and -74S WSR-88D (NEXRAD) TDWR Research radars ADRAD ARMOR CASA DOW NSSL Doppler SMART-R Advanced Technology Demonstrator CSU-CHILL OU-PRIME Multifunction Phased Array Radar at NSSL Joint Polarization Experiment RaXPol Retrieved from " https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_weather_instruments&oldid=1284466738 " Category : Meteorological instrumentation and equipment Hidden categories: Articles with short description Short description is different from Wikidata This page was last edited on 7 April 2025, at 19:17 (UTC) .
