In physics, [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics") is the study of objects, their interaction, and motion; [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") is mechanics limited to non-relativistic and non-quantum approximations. Most of the techniques of classical mechanics were developed before 1900 so the term **classical mechanics** refers to that historical era as well as the approximations. Other fields of physics that were developed in the same era, that use the same approximations, and are also considered "classical" include [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") (see [history of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics "History of thermodynamics")) and [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") (see [history of electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electromagnetism "History of electromagnetism")).

The critical historical event in classical mechanics was the publication by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") of his laws of motion and his associated development of the mathematical techniques of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") in 1678. Analytic tools of mechanics grew through the next two centuries, including the development of [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") and the [action principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_variational_principles_in_physics "History of variational principles in physics"), concepts critical to the [development of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics "History of quantum mechanics") and of [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_relativity "History of relativity").

[Chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") is a subfield of classical mechanics that was developed in its modern form in the 20th century.

Precursors to Newtonian mechanics

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Aristotle%27s_laws_of_motion.svg/500px-Aristotle%27s_laws_of_motion.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aristotle%27s_laws_of_motion.svg)

Aristotle's laws of motion. In _[Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics\_(Aristotle) "Physics (Aristotle)")_ he states that objects fall at a speed proportional to their weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid they are immersed in. This is a correct approximation for objects in [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")'s gravitational field moving in air or water.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-Rovelli2015-1)

The ancient [Greek philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy "Greek philosophy"), [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") in particular, were among the first to propose that abstract principles govern nature. Aristotle argued, in _[On the Heavens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On\_the\_Heavens "On the Heavens")_, that terrestrial bodies rise or fall to their "natural place" and stated as a law the correct approximation that an object's speed of fall is proportional to its weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid it is falling through.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-Rovelli2015-1) Aristotle believed in logic and observation but it would be more than eighteen hundred years before [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon "Francis Bacon") would first develop the scientific method of experimentation, which he called a _vexation of nature_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-2)

Aristotle saw a distinction between "natural motion" and "forced motion", and he believed that 'in a void' i.e.[vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"), a body at rest will remain at rest [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-3) and a body in motion will continue to have the same motion.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-4) In this way, Aristotle was the first to approach something similar to the law of inertia. However, he believed a vacuum would be impossible because the surrounding air would rush in to fill it immediately. He also believed that an object would stop moving in an unnatural direction once the applied forces were removed. Later Aristotelians developed an elaborate explanation for why an arrow continues to fly through the air after it has left the bow, proposing that an arrow creates a vacuum in its wake, into which air rushes, pushing it from behind. Aristotle's beliefs were influenced by Plato's teachings on the perfection of the circular uniform motions of the heavens. As a result, he conceived of a natural order in which the motions of the heavens were necessarily perfect, in contrast to the terrestrial world of changing elements, where individuals come to be and pass away.

There is another tradition that goes back to the ancient Greeks where mathematics is used to analyze bodies at rest or in motion, which may found as early as the work of some [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism "Pythagoreanism"). Other examples of this tradition include [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") (_On the Balance_), [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") (_On the Equilibrium of Planes_, _On Floating Bodies_), and [Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria") (_Mechanica_). Later, [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world "Science in the medieval Islamic world") and [Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_science "Byzantine science") scholars built on these works, and these ultimately were reintroduced or became available to the West in the [12th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_of_the_12th_century "Renaissance of the 12th century") and again during the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_in_the_Renaissance "History of science in the Renaissance").

Persian Islamic polymath [Ibn Sīnā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_S%C4%ABn%C4%81 "Ibn Sīnā") published his theory of motion in _[The Book of Healing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Book\_of\_Healing "The Book of Healing")_ (1020). He said that an impetus is imparted to a projectile by the thrower, and viewed it as persistent, requiring external forces such as [air resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_resistance "Air resistance") to dissipate it.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-Espinoza-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-Nasr-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-Sayili-7) Ibn Sina made distinction between 'force' and 'inclination' (called "mayl"), and argued that an object gained mayl when the object is in opposition to its natural motion. So he concluded that continuation of motion is attributed to the inclination that is transferred to the object, and that object will be in motion until the mayl is spent. He also claimed that projectile in a vacuum would not stop unless it is acted upon. This conception of motion is consistent with Newton's first law of motion, inertia. Which states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an external force.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-8)

In the 12th century, [Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibat_Allah_Abu%27l-Barakat_al-Baghdaadi "Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi") adopted and modified Avicenna's theory on [projectile motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion "Projectile motion"). In his _Kitab al-Mu'tabar_, Abu'l-Barakat stated that the mover imparts a violent inclination (_mayl qasri_) on the moved and that this diminishes as the moving object distances itself from the mover.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-Gutman-9) According to [Shlomo Pines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Pines "Shlomo Pines"), al-Baghdaadi's theory of [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") was "the oldest negation of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s fundamental dynamic law [namely, that a constant force produces a uniform motion], [and is thus an] anticipation in a vague fashion of the fundamental law of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") [namely, that a force applied continuously produces acceleration]."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-10)

In the 14th century, French priest [Jean Buridan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Buridan "Jean Buridan") developed the [theory of impetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_impetus "Theory of impetus"), with possible influence by Ibn Sina.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-ibn_sina_and_buridan-11)[Albert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_of_Saxony_(philosopher) "Albert of Saxony (philosopher)"), [Bishop of Halberstadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Halberstadt "Bishop of Halberstadt"), developed the theory further.

[Nicole Oresme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme "Nicole Oresme"), one of [Oxford Calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Calculators "Oxford Calculators") at [Merton College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merton_College,_Oxford "Merton College, Oxford"), provided the [mean speed theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_speed_theorem "Mean speed theorem") using geometrical arguments.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-12)

[Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei")'s development of the telescope and his observations further challenged the idea that the heavens were made from a perfect, unchanging substance. Adopting [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus "Copernicus")'s heliocentric hypothesis, Galileo believed the Earth was the same as other planets. Though the reality of the famous Tower of Pisa experiment is disputed, he did carry out quantitative experiments by rolling balls on an [inclined plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclined_plane "Inclined plane"); his correct theory of accelerated motion was apparently derived from the results of the experiments.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-13) Galileo also found that a body dropped vertically hits the ground at the same time as a body projected horizontally, so an Earth rotating uniformly will still have objects falling to the ground under gravity. More significantly, it asserted that uniform motion is [indistinguishable from rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_invariance "Galilean invariance"), and so forms the basis of the theory of relativity. Except with respect to the acceptance of Copernican astronomy, Galileo's direct influence on science in the 17th century outside Italy was probably not very great. Although his influence on educated laymen both in Italy and abroad was considerable, among university professors, except for a few who were his own pupils, it was negligible.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-15)

[Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") was the foremost mathematician and physicist in Western Europe. He formulated the conservation law for elastic collisions, produced the first theorems of centripetal force, and developed the dynamical theory of oscillating systems. He also made improvements to the telescope, discovered Saturn's moon [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon) "Titan (moon)"), and invented the pendulum clock.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-16)

Newtonian mechanics
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Newtonian mechanics")]

[Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") was the first to unify the three laws of motion (the law of inertia, his second law mentioned above, and the law of action and reaction), and to prove that these laws govern both earthly and celestial objects in 1687 in his treatise [_Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica"). Newton and most of his contemporaries hoped that classical mechanics would be able to explain all entities, including (in the form of geometric optics) light.

Newton also developed the [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") which is necessary to perform the mathematical calculations involved in classical mechanics. However it was [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz") who, independently of Newton, developed a calculus with the notation of the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") and [integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") which are used to this day. Classical mechanics retains Newton's dot notation for time derivatives.

[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") extended Newton's laws of motion from particles to [rigid bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_bodies "Rigid bodies") with two additional [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_laws "Euler's laws"). Working with solid materials under forces leads to [deformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(mechanics) "Deformation (mechanics)") that can be quantified. The idea was articulated by Euler (1727), and in 1782 [Giordano Riccati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Riccati "Giordano Riccati") began to determine [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics) "Elasticity (physics)") of some materials, followed by [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)"). [Simeon Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Poisson "Simeon Poisson") expanded study to the third dimension with the [Poisson ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_ratio "Poisson ratio"). [Gabriel Lamé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Lam%C3%A9 "Gabriel Lamé") drew on the study for assuring stability of structures and introduced the [Lamé parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lam%C3%A9_parameters "Lamé parameters").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-17) These coefficients established [linear elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_elasticity "Linear elasticity") theory and started the field of [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics").

Analytical mechanics
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Analytical mechanics")]

After Newton, re-formulations progressively allowed solutions to a far greater number of problems. The first was constructed in 1788 by [Joseph Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Lagrange "Joseph Louis Lagrange"), an [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy")-[French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France")[mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician"). In [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") the solution uses the path of least [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics) "Action (physics)") and follows the [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations "Calculus of variations"). [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton") re-formulated Lagrangian mechanics in 1833, resulting in [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics"). In addition to the solutions of important problems in classical physics, these techniques form the basis for [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"): Lagrangian methods evolved in to the [path integral formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation "Path integral formulation") and the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation") builds Hamiltonian mechanics.

In the middle of the 19th century, Hamilton could claim classical mechanics as at the center of attention among scholars:

> "The theoretical development of the laws of motion of bodies is a problem of such interest and importance that it has engaged the attention of all the eminent mathematicians since the invention of the dynamics as a mathematical science by Galileo, and especially since the wonderful extension which was given to that science by Newton."

— William Rowan Hamilton, 1834 (Transcribed in _Classical Mechanics_ by J.R. Taylor[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-Taylor-18): 237 )

Origin of chaos theory
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Origin of chaos theory")]

In the 1880s, while studying the [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem "Three-body problem"), [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") found that there can be orbits that are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-21) In 1898, [Jacques Hadamard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Hadamard "Jacques Hadamard") published an influential study of the chaotic motion of a free particle gliding frictionlessly on a surface of constant negative curvature, called [Hadamard's billiards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard%27s_billiards "Hadamard's billiards").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-22) Hadamard was able to show that all trajectories are unstable, in that all particle trajectories diverge exponentially from one another, with a positive [Lyapunov exponent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent "Lyapunov exponent").

These developments led in the 20th century to the development of [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory").

Conflicts at the end of the 19th century
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Conflicts at the end of the 19th century")]

Although classical mechanics is largely compatible with other "[classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics")" theories such as classical [electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamics "Electrodynamics") and [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"), some difficulties were discovered in the late 19th century that could only be resolved by modern physics. When combined with classical thermodynamics, classical mechanics leads to the [Gibbs paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_paradox "Gibbs paradox") in which [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy") is not a well-defined quantity. As experiments reached the atomic level, classical mechanics failed to explain, even approximately, such basic things as the energy levels and sizes of atoms. The effort at resolving these problems led to the development of quantum mechanics. [Action at a distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance "Action at a distance") was still a problem for [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") and [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"), these were temporary explained using [aether theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_theories "Aether theories"). Similarly, the different behaviour of classical electromagnetism and classical mechanics under velocity transformations led to the [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity").

At the beginning of the 20th century [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") (1900) and [relativistic mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_mechanics "Relativistic mechanics") (1905) were discovered. This development indicated that classical mechanics was just an approximation of these two theories.

The [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"), introduced by Einstein, would later also include [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") (1915) that would rewrite [gravitational interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") in terms of the curvature of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"). Relativistic mechanics recovers Newtonian mechanics and Newton's gravitational law when the speeds involved are much smaller than the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") and masses involved are smaller than stellar objects.

Quantum mechanics describing atomic and sub-atomic phenomena was also updated in the 1915 to [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), that would lead to the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") and elementary interactions like electromagnetism, the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction") and the [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction"). Quantum mechanics recovers classical mechanics at the [macroscopic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale "Macroscopic scale") in the presence of [decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence "Quantum decoherence").

The unification of general relativity and quantum field theory into a [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity") theory is still an [open problem in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics "List of unsolved problems in physics").

[Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether "Emmy Noether") proved the [Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem "Noether's theorem") in 1918 relating symmetries and [conservation laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law "Conservation law"), it applies to all realms of physics including classical mechanics.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-23)

Following the introduction of general relativity, [Élie Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan") in 1923 derived Newtonian gravitation from [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations "Einstein field equations"). This led to [Newton–Cartan theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cartan_theory "Newton–Cartan theory"), where classical gravitation can be treated using a geometric formulation of spacetime.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-24)

In the 1930s, inspired by quantum mechanics, [Bernard Koopman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Koopman "Bernard Koopman") and [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann") made some links between [Hilbert spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space"), [wavefunctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefunction "Wavefunction") and classical mechanics. This discovery led to the development of [Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koopman%E2%80%93von_Neumann_classical_mechanics "Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-25)

In 1954, [Andrey Kolmogorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov "Andrey Kolmogorov") revisited the work of Poincaré. He considered the problem of whether or not a small perturbation of a [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force "Conservative force") dynamical system resulted in a [quasiperiodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiperiodic_motion "Quasiperiodic motion")[orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(dynamics) "Orbit (dynamics)") in celestial mechanics. The same problem was worked by [Jürgen Moser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Moser "Jürgen Moser") and later by [Vladimir Arnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Arnold "Vladimir Arnold"), leading to the [Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Arnold%E2%80%93Moser_theorem "Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem") and KAM theory.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-:0-26)

Meteorologist [Edward Norton Lorenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz "Edward Norton Lorenz") is often credited as rediscovering the field of chaos theory.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-:0-26) About 1961, he discovered that his weather calculations were sensitive to the [significant figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures "Significant figures") in the initial conditions. He later developed the theory of [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system "Lorenz system").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-:0-26) In 1971, [David Ruelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ruelle "David Ruelle") coined the term strange [attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor "Attractor") to describe these systems.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-:0-26) The term "chaos theory" was finally coined in 1975 by [James A. Yorke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Yorke "James A. Yorke").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics#cite_note-:0-26)
