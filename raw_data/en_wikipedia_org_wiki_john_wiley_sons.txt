Wiley has been publicly owned since 1962, and listed on the [New York Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange "New York Stock Exchange") since 1995; its stock is traded under the symbols [NYSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange "New York Stock Exchange"):[WLY](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:WLY) (for its Class A stock) and [NYSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange "New York Stock Exchange"):[WLYB](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:WLYB) (for its class B stock).

Wiley's operations are organized into three business divisions:

*   Scientific, Technical, Medical, and Scholarly (STMS), also known as [Wiley-Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiley-Blackwell "Wiley-Blackwell")
*   Professional Development
*   Global Education

The company has approximately 10,000 employees worldwide, with headquarters in [Hoboken, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoboken,_New_Jersey "Hoboken, New Jersey"), since 2002.

In 2008, Wiley was named for the second consecutive year to _[Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes "Forbes")_ magazine's annual list of the "400 Best Big Companies in America". In 2007, _Book Business_ magazine cited Wiley as "One of the 20 Best Book Publishing Companies to Work For". For two consecutive years, 2006 and 2005, _[Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune\_(magazine) "Fortune (magazine)")_ magazine named Wiley one of the "100 Best Companies to Work For". Wiley Canada was named to _[Canadian Business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian\_Business "Canadian Business")_ magazine's 2006 list of "Best Workplaces in Canada", and Wiley Australia has received the Australian government's "Employer of Choice for Women" citation every year since its inception in 2001. In 2004, Wiley was named to the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Environmental_Protection_Agency "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency")'s "Best Workplaces for Commuters" list. _Working Mother_ magazine in 2003 listed Wiley as one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers", and that same year, the company received the Enterprise Award from the [New Jersey Business & Industry Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Business_and_Industry_Association "New Jersey Business and Industry Association") in recognition of its contribution to the state's economic growth. In 1998, _[Financial Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial\_Times "Financial Times")_ selected Wiley as one of the "most respected companies" with a "strong and well thought out strategy" in its global survey of CEOs.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In August 2009, the company announced a proposed reduction of Wiley-Blackwell staff in content management operations in the UK and Australia by approximately 60, in conjunction with an increase of staff in Asia.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-UKjoblosses-63) In March 2010, it announced a similar reorganization of its Wiley-Blackwell central marketing operations that would lay off approximately 40 employees. The company's position was that the primary goal of this restructuring was to increase workflow efficiency. In June 2012, it announced the proposed closing of its Edinburgh facility in June 2013 with the intention of relocating journal content management activities currently performed there to [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford "Oxford") and Asia. The move would lay off approximately 50 employees.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-Edinburgh-64)

Wiley is a signatory of the [SDG Publishers Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDG_Publishers_Compact "SDG Publishers Compact"),[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-members-65)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-UN-66) and has taken steps to support the achievement of the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals "Sustainable Development Goals") (SDGs) in the publishing industry.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-67) These include becoming carbon neutral and supporting reforestation.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-Wiley-68)[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-69) Wiley's _[Natural Resources Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\_Resources\_Forum "Natural Resources Forum")_ was one of six out of 100 journals to receive the highest possible "Five Wheel" impact rating[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-70) from an SDG Impact Intensity journal rating system analyzing data from 2016 to 2020.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-Rodenburg-71)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-Linacre-72)

Wiley reported a mean 2017 [gender pay gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap "Gender pay gap") of 21.1% for its UK workforce, while the median was 21.5%. The gender bonus gaps are far higher, at 50.7% for the median measure and 42.3% for the mean. Wiley said: "Our mean and median bonus gaps are driven by our highest earners, who are predominantly male."[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-73)

### Forced inclusion of content in AI LLM training

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiley_(publisher)&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Forced inclusion of content in AI LLM training")]

In August 2024, it was reported that Wiley was projected to earn $44 million (£33 million) by providing Artificial Intelligence (AI) firms access to Wiley-published content for the purpose of training Large Language Models (LLMs) and that authors would not have the option to "opt out" of including their work in these training data sets. Groups representing authors, including the Society of Authors and the Creators' Rights Alliance, have expressed ethical concerns about these deals, citing a lack of transparency from publishers and affirmative consent from authors.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-74)

In 2020, the entire editorial board of the _[European Law Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=European\_Law\_Journal&action=edit&redlink=1 "European Law Journal (page does not exist)")_[[d](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityPage/Q15759262#sitelinks-wikipedia "d:Special:EntityPage/Q15759262")] resigned over a dispute about contract terms and the behavior of its publisher, Wiley. Wiley did not allow the editorial board members to decide over editorial appointments and decisions.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-RetractionWatch-75)

A majority of the editorial board of the journal _[Diversity & Distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity\_%26\_Distributions "Diversity & Distributions")_ resigned in 2018 after Wiley allegedly blocked the publication of a letter protesting the publisher's decision to make the journal entirely open access.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-76)

### Publication practices

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiley_(publisher)&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Publication practices")]

According to [Retraction Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retraction_Watch "Retraction Watch"), Wiley makes some articles disappear from their journals without any explanation.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-77)

### Manipulation of bibliometrics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiley_(publisher)&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Manipulation of bibliometrics")]

According to [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law "Goodhart's law") and concerned academics like the signatories of the [San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Declaration_on_Research_Assessment "San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment"), commercial academic publishers benefit from manipulation of [bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics "Bibliometrics") and [scientometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientometrics "Scientometrics") like the [journal impact factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_impact_factor "Journal impact factor"), which is often used as [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_(statistics) "Proxy (statistics)") of [prestige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_prestige "Occupational prestige") and can influence revenues, including [public subsidies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy "Subsidy") in the form of subscriptions and free work from academics.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-78)

Five Wiley journals, which exhibited unusual levels of [self-citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-citation "Self-citation"), had their [journal impact factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_impact_factor "Journal impact factor") of 2019 suspended from _[Journal Citation Reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal\_Citation\_Reports "Journal Citation Reports")_ in 2020, a sanction which hit 34 journals in total.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-79)

### Publication of "Paper Mill" generated papers

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiley_(publisher)&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Publication of \"Paper Mill\" generated papers")]

In April 2022, the journal [_Science_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal) "Science (journal)") revealed that a Ukrainian company, [International Publisher Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Publisher_Ltd. "International Publisher Ltd."), run by Ksenia Badziun, operates a Russian website where academics can purchase authorships in soon-to-be-published academic papers.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-pop-80) Over a two-year period, researchers found that at least 419 articles "appeared to match manuscripts that later appeared in dozens of different journals" and that "more than 100 of these identified papers were published in 68 journals run by established publishers, including [Elsevier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier "Elsevier"), [Oxford University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Press "Oxford University Press"), [Springer Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springer_Nature "Springer Nature"), [Taylor & Francis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_%26_Francis "Taylor & Francis"), [Wolters Kluwer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolters_Kluwer "Wolters Kluwer"), and Wiley-Blackwell."[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-pop-80) Wiley-Blackwell claimed that they were examining the specific papers that were identified and brought to their attention.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-pop-80)

In 2024, Wiley closed down 19 of the about 250 journals it had acquired in the [Hindawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindawi_(publisher) "Hindawi (publisher)") deal, after retracting "more than 11,300 'compromised' studies over the past two years"; Wiley had earlier shuttered four journals for publishing fake articles coming from [paper mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_paper_mill "Research paper mill").[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-81)

### COI between climate research and fossil fuel industry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiley_(publisher)&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: COI between climate research and fossil fuel industry")]

Wiley is a publisher of [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") research, but also publishes a journal dedicated to [fossil fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel "Fossil fuel") exploration. Climate scientists are concerned that this [conflict of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest "Conflict of interest") could undermine the credibility of [climate science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology "Climatology") because they believe that fossil fuel extraction and [climate action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_action "Climate action") are incompatible.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-82)[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-83)

In 2021, Wiley purchased another [Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Access "Open Access") company named Hindawi.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-84) Shortly after, many articles published by Hindawi were retracted and [Scopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus "Scopus") disconnected all of them from their database.

### Photographer copyrights

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiley_(publisher)&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Photographer copyrights")]

A 2013 lawsuit brought by a stock photo agency for alleged violation of a 1997 license was dismissed for procedural reasons.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-85)

A 2014 ruling by the [District Court for the Southern District of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York "United States District Court for the Southern District of New York"),[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-86) later affirmed by the Second Circuit,[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-87) says that Wiley infringed on the copyright of photographer Tom Bean by using his photos beyond the scope of the license it had purchased. The case was connected to a larger set of copyright infringement cases brought by photo agency DRK against various publishers.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-88)

A 2015 [9th Circuit Court of Appeals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9th_Circuit_Court_of_Appeals "9th Circuit Court of Appeals") opinion established that another photo agency had standing to sue Wiley for its usage of photos beyond the scope of the license acquired.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-89)

In 2018, a [Southern District of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York "United States District Court for the Southern District of New York") court upheld the award of over $39 million to Wiley and other textbook publishers in a vast litigation against Book Dog Books, a re-seller of [used books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Used_books "Used books") which was found to hold and distribute counterfeit copies. The Court found that circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish distribution of 116 titles for which counterfeit copies had been presented and of other 5 titles. It also found that unchallenged testimony on how the publishers usually acquired licenses from authors was sufficient to establish the publishers' copyright on the books in question.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-90)[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-91)

### _Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiley_(publisher)&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons")]

In 2008, John Wiley & Sons filed suit against Thailand native Supap Kirtsaeng over the sale of textbooks made outside of the United States and then imported into the country.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-92) In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court held 6–3 that the [first-sale doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine "First-sale doctrine") applied to copies of copyrighted works made and sold abroad at lower prices, reversing the Second Circuit decision which had favored Wiley.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-93)

### Internet Archive lawsuit

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiley_(publisher)&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Internet Archive lawsuit")]

In June 2020, Wiley was one of a group of publishers who sued the [Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive "Internet Archive"), arguing that its collection of e-books was denying authors and publishers revenue and accusing the library of "willful mass copyright infringement".[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-94)[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-95)

In September 2024, [Lucina Uddin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucina_Uddin "Lucina Uddin"), a neuroscience professor at [UCLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles "University of California, Los Angeles"), sued John Wiley & Sons along with five other [academic journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal "Academic journal") publishers in a proposed [class-action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action "Class action") lawsuit, alleging that the publishers violated [antitrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law "Competition law") law by agreeing not to compete against each other for manuscripts and by denying scholars payment for [peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review "Peer review") services.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-96)[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons#cite_note-97)

DRK contends that its licenses with Wiley for the images at issue in these instances were limited in scope in terms of the print run, media, and/or geographic distribution, and that Wiley violated the license terms by printing more units than authorized, selling the photographs beyond the licensed geographic distribution areas, and/or using the photographs electronically without permission. [...] The record establishes that Wiley infringed on DRK's copyrights for the Three Bean Instances. [...] Because Wiley has failed to raise any issue of material fact as to whether it exceeded the scope of its license for the Three Bean Instances, summary judgment is granted in DRK's favor for these instances.

Book Dog Books, LLC et al"](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/4119847/?full_case=true&format=html). 448. Scorched-earth litigation ensued, including numerous discovery motions, followed by appeals of determinations made by the Magistrate Judge, and multiple motions for summary judgment (followed by motions for reconsideration). [...] Defendants now resurrect that argument, contending that no reasonable jury could find sufficient evidence of distribution for 116 works. [...] Defendants continued to purchase from sources that they knew sold counterfeits. [...] Further, the jury learned that Defendants kept inadequate records. [...] Defendants acknowledge that infringement can be established through circumstantial evidence. [...] Second, Defendants challenge the five works for which Plaintiffs did not present a counterfeit copy. However, the jury heard that Defendants had purchased copies of those works from Best Books World, a known counterfeiter [...] But deposition testimony revealed that those distributors considered Defendants to be one of the most prevalent suppliers of counterfeit books and had ceased doing business with Defendants based on their history of infringement. [...] Defendants assert that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate ownership for thirteen titles, meaning that Plaintiffs failed to establish statutory standing to sue for those works. [...] In each instance, while the copyright registrations submitted in evidence identified someone other than Cengage or Pearson as the copyright holder, trial testimony established that the person or entity listed was either the textbook's author or a publishing company acquired by Cengage or Pearson. Plaintiffs maintained that Cengage or Pearson were granted exclusive licenses for these works. Although Plaintiffs did not submit documentation, Cengage representative Jessica Stitt testified that Cengage owns or holds the exclusive license for every Cengage title. [...] Defendants never challenged this testimony, nor did they ask any questions regarding Plaintiffs' ownership of these works. No contradictory evidence of ownership presented. The jury was entirely justified in concluding that Plaintiffs established ownership for all works.
