[ citation needed ] Such a segment can be a phoneme , a word , a grammatical phrase , a sentence , or an event within a larger narrative structure, depending on the level of analysis.

Syntagmatic analysis involves the study of relationships (rules of combination) among syntagmas.

At the lexical level, syntagmatic structure in a language is the combination of words according to the rules of syntax for that language. For example, English uses determiner + adjective + noun, e.g.

the big house . Another language might use determiner + noun + adjective (Spanish la casa grande ) and therefore have a different syntagmatic structure.

At a higher level, narrative structures feature a realistic temporal flow guided by tension and relaxation; thus, for example, events or rhetorical figures may be treated as syntagmas of epic structures.

Syntagmatic structure is often contrasted with paradigmatic structure. In semiotics , " syntagmatic analysis " is analysis of syntax or surface structure (syntagmatic structure), rather than paradigms as in paradigmatic analysis . Analysis is often achieved through commutation tests .
