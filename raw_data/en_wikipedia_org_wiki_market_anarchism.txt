[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Due to contending definitions of the terms 'markets' and 'capitalism' which are not used by free-market anti-capitalists, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] anarcho-capitalism has been referred to synonymously as "free-market anarchism," but the ideologies differ significantly.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The Center for a Stateless Society (C4SS), which Kevin Carson is associated with, is one such group of free-market anti-capitalists.

[ 11 ] As is Samuel Edward Konkin III 's agorism , a tendency associated with left-libertarianism.

[ 12 ] Some writers, such as Iain McKay, have been skeptical of this conceptual nomenclature on the grounds that it still leads to misunderstandings about its similarity to  anarcho-capitalists.

"In order to get clear on the topic in a conversation about 'Free Market Anticapitalism,' the obvious points where clarification may be needed are going to be the meaning of capitalism, the meaning of markets, and the meaning of freedom in the market context... market anarchists have spent a lot of time...the possibility of disentangling multiple senses of 'capitalism'...The meaning of the term is obviously central to any free market economics...Pro-capitalist economists have often suggested such a broad understanding of 'markets' even if they have not fully understood...its implications. For example Murray Rothbard...." ^ Zwolinski, Matt (9 January 2013).

"Later [left-libertarianism] became a term for the left or Konkinite wing of the free-market libertarian movement, and has since come to cover a range of pro-market but anti-capitalist positions, mostly individualist anarchist, including agorism and mutualism, often with an implication of sympathies (such as for radical feminism or the labor movement) not usually shared by anarcho-capitalists." ^ Mckay, Iain (2008).

It would be tempting to call such a system of market co-operatives "market anarchism" in the same way that Schweickart's calls his similar system market socialism, but that would be unwise. This is because "anarcho"-capitalists have appropriated that term in a rebranding exercise for their own ideology. (...) Best, I think, to call it mutualism, as Proudhon did — that would make it extremely difficult for the propertarian right to appropriate it.

some have starting using the term "market anarchism" to describe Individualist Anarchism and mutualism. This can be considered as an equivalent of "market socialism" but the problem is that the term can be used by "anarcho"-capitalists in yet another attempt to smuggle their authoritarian ideology into anarchist circles.
