In mathematics , the term linear function refers to two distinct but related notions: [ 1 ] In calculus and related areas, a linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line , that is, a polynomial function of degree zero or one.

[ 2 ] For distinguishing such a linear function from the other concept, the term affine function is often used.

[ 3 ] In linear algebra , mathematical analysis , [ 4 ] and functional analysis , a linear function is a linear map .

[ 5 ] As a polynomial function [ edit ] Main article: Linear function (calculus) Graphs of two linear functions.

In calculus, analytic geometry and related areas, a linear function is a polynomial of degree one or less, including the zero polynomial (the latter not being considered to have degree zero).

When the function is of only one variable , it is of the form f ( x ) = a x + b , {\displaystyle f(x)=ax+b,} where a and b are constants , often real numbers . The graph of such a function of one variable is a nonvertical line.

a is frequently referred to as the slope of the line, and b as the intercept.

If a > 0 then the gradient is positive and the graph slopes upwards.

If a < 0 then the gradient is negative and the graph slopes downwards.

For a function f ( x 1 , … … , x k ) {\displaystyle f(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{k})} of any finite number of variables, the general formula is f ( x 1 , … … , x k ) = b + a 1 x 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + a k x k , {\displaystyle f(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{k})=b+a_{1}x_{1}+\cdots +a_{k}x_{k},} and the graph is a hyperplane of dimension k .

A constant function is also considered linear in this context, as it is a polynomial of degree zero or is the zero polynomial. Its graph, when there is only one variable, is a horizontal line.

In this context, a function that is also a linear map (the other meaning) may be referred to as a homogeneous linear function or a linear form . In the context of linear algebra, the polynomial functions of degree 0 or 1 are the scalar-valued affine maps .

As a linear map [ edit ] Main article: Linear map The integral of a function is a linear map from the vector space of integrable functions to the real numbers.

In linear algebra, a linear function is a map f between two vector spaces such that f ( x + y ) = f ( x ) + f ( y ) {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {x} +\mathbf {y} )=f(\mathbf {x} )+f(\mathbf {y} )} f ( a x ) = a f ( x ) .

{\displaystyle f(a\mathbf {x} )=af(\mathbf {x} ).} Here a denotes a constant belonging to some field K of scalars (for example, the real numbers ) and x and y are elements of a vector space , which might be K itself.

In other terms the linear function preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication .

Some authors use "linear function" only for linear maps that take values in the scalar field; [ 6 ] these are more commonly called linear forms .

The "linear functions" of calculus qualify as "linear maps" when (and only when) f (0, ..., 0) = 0 , or, equivalently, when the constant b equals zero in the one-degree polynomial above. Geometrically, the graph of the function must pass through the origin.
