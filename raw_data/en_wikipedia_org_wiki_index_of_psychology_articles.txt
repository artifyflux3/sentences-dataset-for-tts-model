Occasionally, in addition or opposition to employing the scientific method , it also relies on symbolic interpretation and critical analysis , although these traditions have tended to be less pronounced than in other social sciences , such as sociology . Psychologists study phenomena such as perception , cognition , emotion , personality , behavior, and interpersonal relationships . Some, especially depth psychologists , also study the unconscious mind .
