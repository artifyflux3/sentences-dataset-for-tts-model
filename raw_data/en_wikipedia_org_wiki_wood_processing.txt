Find sources: "Wood processing" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Wood processing is an engineering discipline in the wood industry comprising the production of forest products , such as pulp and paper , construction materials , and tall oil .

Paper engineering is a subfield of wood processing.

The major wood product categories are:  sawn timber , wood-based panels , wood chips , paper and paper products and miscellaneous others including poles and railway sleepers .

Forest product processing technologies have undergone extraordinary advances in some of the above categories. Improvements have been achieved in recovery rates [ clarification needed ] , durability and protection, greater utilization of NTFPs such as various grain stalks and bamboo , and the development of new products such as reconstituted wood-panels. Progress has not been homogeneous in all the forest product utilization categories. Although there is little information available on the subjects of technology acquisition, adaptation and innovation for the forest-based industrial sector, it is clear that sawmilling has been far less affected by the spread of innovations than the manufacturing of panel products.
