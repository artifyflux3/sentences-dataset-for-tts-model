Longair's primary research interests are in the fields of high-energy astrophysics and astrophysical cosmology .  He has written eight books and many articles on this work.  His most recent publication is the second edition of his Theoretical Concepts in Physics , released in December 2003.  His other interests include music, mountain walking (completing the Munros in 2011), art, architecture and golf. As of 2017 [update] he is the editor-in-chief of the Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society [ 9 ] and has authored or co-authored biographies of John E.
