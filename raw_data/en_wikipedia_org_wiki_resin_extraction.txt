Tapped pine in the Pays de Buch Resin extraction consists of incising the outer layers of a pine tree in order to collect the sap or resin .

Summary [ edit ] Resin circulates throughout a coniferous tree and a few others, and serves to seal damage to the tree. Harvesting pine resin dates back to Gallo-Roman times in Gascony .

Tapping pines may either be done so as to sustain the life of the tree, or exhaustively in the years before the tree is cut down.

Traditional tapping [ edit ] In Gascony, and to a lesser extent in Provence , pine-tapping was practiced as a form of sharecropping , although uncertain status of the workers sometimes led to labor disputes.

Although almost abandoned during the 20th century, in Spain it has experienced something of a resurgence. Cesefor [ 1 ] is a Spanish non-profit foundation. which promotes  forestry in Spain  and its industry including Non-Wood Forest Products (NWFP) which in the Mediterranean region includes, resins, as well as cork, berries, nuts, and mushrooms, among many others.

Procedure [ edit ] Resin is usually collected by causing minor damage to the tree by making a hole far enough into the trunk to puncture the vacuoles , to let sap exit the tree, known as tapping, and then letting the tree repair its damage by filling the wound with resin. This usually takes a few days. Then, excess resin is collected.
