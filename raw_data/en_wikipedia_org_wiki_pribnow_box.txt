[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is an idealized or consensus sequence —that is, it shows the most frequently occurring base at each position in many promoters analyzed; individual promoters often vary from the consensus at one or more positions. It is also commonly called the -10 sequence or element , because it is centered roughly ten base pairs upstream from the site of initiation of transcription.

The Pribnow box has a function similar to the TATA box that occurs in promoters in eukaryotes and archaea : it is recognized and bound by a subunit of RNA polymerase during initiation of transcription.

[ 3 ] This region of the DNA is also the first place where base pairs separate during prokaryotic transcription to allow access to the template strand. The AT-richness is important to allow this separation, since adenine and thymine are easier to break apart (not only due to fewer hydrogen bonds , but also due to weaker base stacking effects).

[ 4 ] It is named after David Pribnow and Heinz Schaller .
