As of the 2020 census , the population was 330,758.

[ 1 ] The most populous municipality in the county and the county seat is Boulder .

[ 2 ] Boulder County comprises the Boulder, Colorado Metropolitan Statistical Area , which is included in the Denver – Aurora , Colorado Combined Statistical Area .

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] Further information: Curse of the Boulder Valley Boulder County was one of the original 17 counties created by the Territory of Colorado on November 1, 1861. The county was named for Boulder City and Boulder Creek , so named because of the abundance of boulders in the creek which hampered early gold prospecting efforts. Boulder County retains essentially the same borders as in 1861, although a 27.5 square miles (71.2 km 2 ) of its southeastern corner and its approximate population of 40,000 became part of the City and County of Broomfield in 2001.

Before the arrival of the first US settlers, the area was occupied by Native Americans led by Chief Niwot on the plains and seasonally by Utes in the mountains to the west. The first European American settlers were gold prospectors led by Captain Thomas Aikins . His group of about twenty settled at the mouth of Boulder Creek Canyon on October 17, 1858. Chief Niwot told them not to stay and it is said they promised to move into the mountains to prospect in the spring. However, in February 1859, they founded the town of Boulder. At about the same time, they also founded the first Gold Mining town in what would become Colorado, Gold Hill which is about 10 miles west from Boulder. Gold Hill was founded because of the placer gold discovered there. The area was the site of the first commercial scale placer mine in Colorado, producing over 5,500 ounces of gold in the first year of operations (1859).

[ 4 ] In late December 2021, the Marshall Fire raged through the parched lands near Boulder, Colorado . Marshall Fire is the most destructive in Colorado's history.

[ 5 ] The fire impacted City of Superior , City of Louisville and unincorporated Boulder County areas. 991 homes were destroyed with an additional 127 damaged. Over 13,000 people in Superior and 21,000 in Louisville were ultimately evacuated while the fire was spreading due to unusual 100 mile per hour winds. Additionally, one person died and another is missing and presumed dead.

[ 6 ] The cause of the fire has not been officially announced, pending an investigation.

[ 7 ] However, an incident report filed by a ranger with Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks identified two ignition points for the fire. The first ignition point was a shed that began to burn at approximately 11:30AM MST, December 30, 2021. The second ignition point was upwind from the first, and started around noon of the same day on "western side of the Marshall Mesa trailhead".

[ 19 ] Government [ edit ] Boulder County is divided into three districts each represented by a commissioner elected county-wide. The three commissioners comprise the county Board of Commissioners and represent the county as a whole. Each commissioner must reside in their respective district and may be elected to a maximum of two four-year terms.

The Board of County Commissioners are full-time public servants and approve the budget for the entire County government. The Board also oversees the management of 10 County departments and the daily operations of the county, work that is done by a county manager or a chief administrative officer in some counties.

Boulder County has seven other county-wide elected officials, including the District Attorney, who represents the 20th Judicial District.

Politics [ edit ] Boulder County went Republican in all but three presidential elections from 1920 to 1984, the exceptions being the national Democratic landslides of 1932, 1936 and 1964. However, it has swung heavily to the Democrats since the late 1980s, and has supported Democrats at every election since 1988. Since the 1990s, it has become one of the most liberal counties in Colorado; in most years, it is the second-strongest Democratic bastion in the state, behind only the City and County of Denver. The GOP has not crossed the 40% mark in the county since 1988. This tracks closely with the Democratic trend in other counties dominated by college towns.

In recent years, Republican vote share has significantly declined. Republicans took less than 28% of the vote in Boulder County in both 2008 and 2012 , only 22% in 2016 , and just over 20% in 2020 and 2024. In 2020, Joe Biden received over 77% of the vote, the best performance for a Democrat since 1896. Unlike the national trend, Boulder saw next to no Republican shift in the 2024 election; Kamala Harris received 76.5% of the vote which (with the exception of 2020) was also a record performance for a Democrat in the county.

In 2000, Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader took 11.82% of the vote in Boulder County, more than twice the 5.25% he took statewide in Colorado, and more than four times his 2.73% nationwide vote share.

[ 23 ] The cities of Boulder and Longmont are Democratic strongholds, as well as all the mountain towns to the west within the county. In fact, every precinct within the county is majority-Democratic, and most by heavy margins, save one rural plains region in the far northeast corner of the county, north of Longmont, which leans slightly Republican.

Although the amendment passed statewide with 55% of the vote, only 33% of Boulder County supported it.

[ 26 ] In 2012, over 66% of Boulder County voted in favor of Amendment 64 , legalizing marijuana in the state of Colorado.

Local courts [ edit ] The 20th Judicial District of Colorado , the state trial court of general jurisdiction , serves and is coextensive with Boulder County. As of 2009 the 20th Judicial Circuit has eight District Court judges. The Boulder County Court , the state trial court of limited jurisdiction , consists of five judges and six magistrates .

Boulder County has two combined courthouses : The Boulder County Justice Center is located in the City of Boulder and is headquarters to the 20th Judicial District of Colorado. The office of the district attorney is also here, as is the Juvenile Assessment Center, the county's combined assessment and detention facility.

The Longmont Courthouse in the City of Longmont acts as an extension of the County Court and the District Attorney's Office.
