It is the sister journal to Journal of the Royal Society Interface with the main difference being that each issue of Interface Focus contains related articles based on a theme, which is guest edited by prominent researchers in a particular field.

Formed of high-quality articles, each issue aims to facilitate cross-disciplinary research across this traditional divide by acting as a forum accessible to all. Topics may be newly emerging areas of research or dynamic aspects of more established fields. Organisers of each Interface Focus issue are strongly encouraged to contextualise the journal within their chosen subject.

According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal has a 2024 impact factor of 4.
