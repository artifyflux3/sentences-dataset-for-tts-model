Spanos was a Distinguished Professor of English and comparative literature at Binghamton University ( SUNY ) and was a founder and editor of the critical journal boundary 2 . His work draws heavily on the philosophical legacy of Martin Heidegger , and while it does show the influence of the deconstruction of Jacques Derrida and Paul de Man , Spanos's vocabulary and concepts remain closer to Heidegger's Destruktion ("destruction") of metaphysics than to its philosophical successors.

[ 1 ] Spanos took a post-modern approach to the West, globalization , colonization , and general interventionist foreign policy . He talked about a problem/solution mindset that America was in during the Vietnam War , and how all foreign policy now is still stuck in this framework. Spanos' work derives from philosophers ranging from Heidegger and Nietzsche to Foucault .

Early life and education [ edit ] Spanos was born in Newport, New Hampshire, the son of Greek immigrants. A veteran of World War II, he was captured during the Battle of the Bulge and taken a prisoner of war to Dresden, Germany. There, he survived the Allied firebombing of the city. It was a singular experience that he only recounted fifty years later in his autobiographical book In the Neighborhood of Zero .

Spanos completed his PhD at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1964.
