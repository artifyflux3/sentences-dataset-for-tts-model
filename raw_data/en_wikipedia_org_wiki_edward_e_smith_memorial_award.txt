Smith Memorial Award for Imaginative Fiction , or Skylark , annually recognizes someone for lifetime contributions to science fiction , "both through work in the field and by exemplifying the personal qualities which made the late 'Doc' Smith well-loved by those who knew him".

[ 1 ] It is presented by the New England Science Fiction Association at its annual convention, Boskone , to someone chosen by a vote of NESFA members. The trophy is a large lens mounted on a simple plinth .

[ 1 ] The award was inaugurated in 1966, the year after Smith's death. Sixty-two people have been honored in 59 years to 2025. Hal Clement received the award twice, in 1969 and 1997.
