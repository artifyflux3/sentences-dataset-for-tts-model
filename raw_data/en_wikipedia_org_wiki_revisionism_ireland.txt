For opponents, Revisionists are regarded as apologists for the British Empire in Ireland, proponents of a form of denialism and even in some cases advocates of neo-unionism , while the Revisionists on the other hand see themselves as positing a progressive cosmopolitan narrative opposed to a "narrowly sectarian " viewpoint.

History [ edit ] The revisionist school of Irish history can be said to have originated in the 1930s when it was championed by Robert Dudley Edwards , D. B. Quinn and T. W. Moody .

[ 1 ] Themes [ edit ] Figures [ edit ] Brendan Bradshaw, Fellow and Director of Studies in History at Queens' College, Cambridge , stated that there has been an "iconistic assault" on nationalist martyrs. Examples include Ruth Dudley Edwards ' criticisms of Patrick Pearse and Tom Dunne's criticism of Wolfe Tone in his book Theobald Wolfe Tone: Colonial Outsider .

[ 1 ] Patrick Pearse and the Provisional IRA [ edit ] One trend is to link the violence of people like Patrick Pearse and the Easter rebels to the violence of the Provisional IRA by saying Pearse provided a template for the ideology of the Provisionals.

The current (2011 - 2025) President of the Republic of Ireland Michael D. Higgins has criticised this calling it "loose revisionism" and "tendentious". He followed up: “This was of course a somewhat simplistic and ideological assumption, and contemporary historians are more interested in the human rights breaches and the political and social basis of conflict and exclusion as a source of violence in the Northern Ireland of the 1970s.” [ 2 ] Historians and other writers [ edit ] Revisionists [ edit ] Ian Adamson Donald Akenson Jonathan Bardon Owen Dudley Edwards Robert Dudley Edwards Ruth Dudley Edwards Marianne Elliott Richard English Garret FitzGerald R.
