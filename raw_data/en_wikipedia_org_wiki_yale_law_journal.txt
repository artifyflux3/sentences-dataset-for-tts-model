Published continuously since 1891, it is the most widely known of the eight law reviews published by students at Yale Law School. The journal is one of the most cited legal publications in the United States (with an impact factor of 5.000) [ 2 ] and is in the top four for the number of citations per published article.

[ 3 ] The journal, which is published eight times per year, contains articles, essays, features, and book reviews by professional legal scholars as well as student-written notes and comments. It is edited entirely by students. The journal has an online companion, the Yale Law Journal Forum , which features shorter pieces and responses from scholars, practitioners, and policymakers.

The Yale Law Journal , in conjunction with the Harvard Law Review , the Columbia Law Review , and the University of Pennsylvania Law Review , publishes The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation , the most widely followed authority for legal citation formats in the United States.
