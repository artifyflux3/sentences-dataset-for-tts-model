Given an open cover of a compact metric space, a Lebesgue's number of the cover is a number δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} such that every subset of X {\displaystyle X} having diameter less than δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } is contained in some member of the cover.

The existence of Lebesgue's numbers for compact metric spaces is given by the Lebesgue's covering lemma: If the metric space ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} is compact and an open cover of X {\displaystyle X} is given, then the cover admits some Lebesgue's number δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} .

The notion of Lebesgue's numbers itself is useful in other applications as well.

Proof [ edit ] Direct proof [ edit ] Let U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}} be an open cover of X {\displaystyle X} . Since X {\displaystyle X} is compact we can extract a finite subcover { A 1 , … … , A n } ⊆ ⊆ U {\displaystyle \{A_{1},\dots ,A_{n}\}\subseteq {\mathcal {U}}} .
If any one of the A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} 's equals X {\displaystyle X} then any δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} will serve as a Lebesgue's number.
Otherwise for each i ∈ ∈ { 1 , … … , n } {\displaystyle i\in \{1,\dots ,n\}} , let C i := X ∖ ∖ A i {\displaystyle C_{i}:=X\smallsetminus A_{i}} , note that C i {\displaystyle C_{i}} is not empty, and define a function f : X → → R {\displaystyle f:X\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } by f ( x ) := 1 n ∑ ∑ i = 1 n d ( x , C i ) .

{\displaystyle f(x):={\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}d(x,C_{i}).} Since f {\displaystyle f} is continuous on a compact set, it attains a minimum δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } . 
The key observation is that, since every x {\displaystyle x} is contained in some A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} , the extreme value theorem shows δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} . Now we can verify that this δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } is the desired Lebesgue's number.
If Y {\displaystyle Y} is a subset of X {\displaystyle X} of diameter less than δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } , choose x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} as any point in Y {\displaystyle Y} , then by definition of diameter , Y ⊆ ⊆ B δ δ ( x 0 ) {\displaystyle Y\subseteq B_{\delta }(x_{0})} , where B δ δ ( x 0 ) {\displaystyle B_{\delta }(x_{0})} denotes the ball of radius δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } centered at x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} . Since f ( x 0 ) ≥ ≥ δ δ {\displaystyle f(x_{0})\geq \delta } there must exist at least one i {\displaystyle i} such that d ( x 0 , C i ) ≥ ≥ δ δ {\displaystyle d(x_{0},C_{i})\geq \delta } . But this means that B δ δ ( x 0 ) ⊆ ⊆ A i {\displaystyle B_{\delta }(x_{0})\subseteq A_{i}} and so, in particular, Y ⊆ ⊆ A i {\displaystyle Y\subseteq A_{i}} .

Proof by contradiction [ edit ] Suppose for contradiction that X {\displaystyle X} is sequentially compact , { U α α ∣ ∣ α α ∈ ∈ J } {\displaystyle \{U_{\alpha }\mid \alpha \in J\}} is an open cover of X {\displaystyle X} , and the Lebesgue number δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } does not exist. That is: for all δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} , there exists A ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle A\subset X} with diam ⁡ ⁡ ( A ) < δ δ {\displaystyle \operatorname {diam} (A)<\delta } such that there does not exist β β ∈ ∈ J {\displaystyle \beta \in J} with A ⊂ ⊂ U β β {\displaystyle A\subset U_{\beta }} .

This enables us to perform the following construction: δ δ 1 = 1 , ∃ ∃ A 1 ⊂ ⊂ X where diam ⁡ ⁡ ( A 1 ) < δ δ 1 and ¬ ¬ ∃ ∃ β β ( A 1 ⊂ ⊂ U β β ) {\displaystyle \delta _{1}=1,\quad \exists A_{1}\subset X\quad {\text{where}}\quad \operatorname {diam} (A_{1})<\delta _{1}\quad {\text{and}}\quad \neg \exists \beta (A_{1}\subset U_{\beta })} δ δ 2 = 1 2 , ∃ ∃ A 2 ⊂ ⊂ X where diam ⁡ ⁡ ( A 2 ) < δ δ 2 and ¬ ¬ ∃ ∃ β β ( A 2 ⊂ ⊂ U β β ) {\displaystyle \delta _{2}={\frac {1}{2}},\quad \exists A_{2}\subset X\quad {\text{where}}\quad \operatorname {diam} (A_{2})<\delta _{2}\quad {\text{and}}\quad \neg \exists \beta (A_{2}\subset U_{\beta })} ⋮ ⋮ {\displaystyle \vdots } δ δ k = 1 k , ∃ ∃ A k ⊂ ⊂ X where diam ⁡ ⁡ ( A k ) < δ δ k and ¬ ¬ ∃ ∃ β β ( A k ⊂ ⊂ U β β ) {\displaystyle \delta _{k}={\frac {1}{k}},\quad \exists A_{k}\subset X\quad {\text{where}}\quad \operatorname {diam} (A_{k})<\delta _{k}\quad {\text{and}}\quad \neg \exists \beta (A_{k}\subset U_{\beta })} ⋮ ⋮ {\displaystyle \vdots } Note that A n ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle A_{n}\neq \emptyset } for all n ∈ ∈ Z + {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {Z} ^{+}} , since A n ⊄ U β β {\displaystyle A_{n}\not \subset U_{\beta }} . It is therefore possible by the axiom of choice to construct a sequence ( x n ) {\displaystyle (x_{n})} in which x i ∈ ∈ A i {\displaystyle x_{i}\in A_{i}} for each i {\displaystyle i} . Since X {\displaystyle X} is sequentially compact, there exists a subsequence { x n k } {\displaystyle \{x_{n_{k}}\}} (with k ∈ ∈ Z > 0 {\displaystyle k\in \mathbb {Z} _{>0}} ) that converges to x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} .

Because { U α α } {\displaystyle \{U_{\alpha }\}} is an open cover, there exists some α α 0 ∈ ∈ J {\displaystyle \alpha _{0}\in J} such that x 0 ∈ ∈ U α α 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}\in U_{\alpha _{0}}} . As U α α 0 {\displaystyle U_{\alpha _{0}}} is open, there exists r > 0 {\displaystyle r>0} with B r ( x 0 ) ⊂ ⊂ U α α 0 {\displaystyle B_{r}(x_{0})\subset U_{\alpha _{0}}} . Now we invoke the convergence of the subsequence { x n k } {\displaystyle \{x_{n_{k}}\}} : there exists L ∈ ∈ Z + {\displaystyle L\in \mathbb {Z} ^{+}} such that L ≤ ≤ k {\displaystyle L\leq k} implies x n k ∈ ∈ B r / 2 ( x 0 ) {\displaystyle x_{n_{k}}\in B_{r/2}(x_{0})} .

Furthermore, there exists M ∈ ∈ Z > 0 {\displaystyle M\in \mathbb {Z} _{>0}} such that δ δ M = 1 M < r 2 {\displaystyle \delta _{M}={\tfrac {1}{M}}<{\tfrac {r}{2}}} . Hence for all z ∈ ∈ Z > 0 {\displaystyle z\in \mathbb {Z} _{>0}} , we have M ≤ ≤ z {\displaystyle M\leq z} implies diam ⁡ ⁡ ( A M ) < r 2 {\displaystyle \operatorname {diam} (A_{M})<{\tfrac {r}{2}}} .

Finally, define q ∈ ∈ Z > 0 {\displaystyle q\in \mathbb {Z} _{>0}} such that n q ≥ ≥ M {\displaystyle n_{q}\geq M} and q ≥ ≥ L {\displaystyle q\geq L} . For all x ′ ∈ ∈ A n q {\displaystyle x'\in A_{n_{q}}} , notice that: d ( x n q , x ′ ) ≤ ≤ diam ⁡ ⁡ ( A n q ) < r 2 {\displaystyle d(x_{n_{q}},x')\leq \operatorname {diam} (A_{n_{q}})<{\frac {r}{2}}} , because n q ≥ ≥ M {\displaystyle n_{q}\geq M} .

d ( x n q , x 0 ) < r 2 {\displaystyle d(x_{n_{q}},x_{0})<{\frac {r}{2}}} , because q ≥ ≥ L {\displaystyle q\geq L} entails x n q ∈ ∈ B r / 2 ( x 0 ) {\displaystyle x_{n_{q}}\in B_{r/2}\left(x_{0}\right)} .

Hence d ( x 0 , x ′ ) < r {\displaystyle d(x_{0},x')<r} by the triangle inequality , which implies that A n q ⊂ ⊂ U α α 0 {\displaystyle A_{n_{q}}\subset U_{\alpha _{0}}} . This yields the desired contradiction.
