Early life [ edit ] Raimann grew up in Steinbrunn , Austria.

[ 1 ] He began playing American football at the age of 14 for the Vienna Vikings ' youth team.

[ 2 ] Raimann attended Ballsportgymnasium in Vienna , a publicly funded upper secondary school for elite competitive athletes, [ 3 ] and attended Delton-Kellogg High School in Delton, Michigan as an exchange student for his junior year.

[ 4 ] While on exchange, Raimann lived with a host family that included a former Central Michigan University football player, Rollie Ferris, and his future college teammate, Tyden Ferris.

[ 5 ] He returned to Austria after the year and completed his compulsory service in the Austrian military after graduating from Ballsportgymnasium Wien.

[ 1 ] Raimann committed to play college football at Central Michigan after his military service was completed.

[ 6 ] College career [ edit ] Raimann played tight end during his first two seasons at Central Michigan. He caught 20 passes for 164 yards over the course of his first two seasons.

[ 7 ] He moved to offensive tackle after his sophomore year and started all six of the Chippewas' games during its COVID-19-shortened 2020 season .

[ 13 ] Raimann would start 11 of the final 13 games of his rookie year.

[ 13 ] During the off-season, Raimann worked adding strength and mass to his 6'6" frame, putting on 15 pounds.

[ 13 ] He was named the starting left tackle from the opening week of the 2023 season and would play in 15 games during the year.

[ 13 ] Raimann's performance was greatly improved during his sophomore season, with Sports Info Solutions analysis indicating that his rate of quarterback sacks allowed fell from 2.2% as a rookie to 1.2% in year two, with his percentage of blown run blocks similarly dropping from 3.7% to 2.1%.

[ 13 ] Moreover, Raimann's number of penalties also declined in 2023 versus his rookie 2022 campaign—from 7 accepted flags to 4 [ 14 ] —despite his participation in 180 more passing snaps during his second season.

[ 13 ] On July 28, 2025, the Colts signed Raimann to a four-year, $100 million contract extension.
