[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] His other 2022 formula allows extracting the n th digit of π in decimal.

[ 4 ] He was born in Saint-Jovite, Quebec .

He co-authored The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences , made into the website On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences dedicated to integer sequences later in 1995. In 1975, Plouffe broke the world record for memorizing digits of π by reciting 4096 digits, a record which stood until 1977.

[ 5 ] See also [ edit ] Fabrice Bellard , who discovered in 1997 a faster formula to compute pi.
