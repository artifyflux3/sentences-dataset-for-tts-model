( September 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics, a Lagrangian system is a pair ( Y , L ) , consisting of a smooth fiber bundle Y → X and a Lagrangian density L , which yields the Euler–Lagrange differential operator acting on sections of Y → X .

In classical mechanics , many dynamical systems are Lagrangian systems. The configuration space of such a Lagrangian system is a fiber bundle Q → → R {\displaystyle Q\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } over the time axis R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } . In particular, Q = R × × M {\displaystyle Q=\mathbb {R} \times M} if a reference frame is fixed. In classical field theory , all field systems are the Lagrangian ones.

Lagrangians and Euler–Lagrange operators [ edit ] A Lagrangian density L (or, simply, a Lagrangian ) of order r is defined as an n -form , n = dim X , on the r -order jet manifold J r Y of Y .

A Lagrangian L can be introduced as an element of the variational bicomplex of the differential graded algebra O ∗ ∞ ( Y ) of exterior forms on jet manifolds of Y → X . The coboundary operator of this bicomplex contains the variational operator δ which, acting on L , defines the associated Euler–Lagrange operator δL .

In coordinates [ edit ] Given bundle coordinates x λ , y i on a fiber bundle Y and the adapted coordinates x λ , y i , y i Λ , (Λ = ( λ 1 , ..., λ k ) , |Λ| = k ≤ r ) on jet manifolds J r Y , a Lagrangian L and its Euler–Lagrange operator read L = L ( x λ λ , y i , y Λ Λ i ) d n x , {\displaystyle L={\mathcal {L}}(x^{\lambda },y^{i},y_{\Lambda }^{i})\,d^{n}x,} δ δ L = δ δ i L d y i ∧ ∧ d n x , δ δ i L = ∂ ∂ i L + ∑ ∑ | Λ Λ | ( − − 1 ) | Λ Λ | d Λ Λ ∂ ∂ i Λ Λ L , {\displaystyle \delta L=\delta _{i}{\mathcal {L}}\,dy^{i}\wedge d^{n}x,\qquad \delta _{i}{\mathcal {L}}=\partial _{i}{\mathcal {L}}+\sum _{|\Lambda |}(-1)^{|\Lambda |}\,d_{\Lambda }\,\partial _{i}^{\Lambda }{\mathcal {L}},} where d Λ Λ = d λ λ 1 ⋯ ⋯ d λ λ k , d λ λ = ∂ ∂ λ λ + y λ λ i ∂ ∂ i + ⋯ ⋯ , {\displaystyle d_{\Lambda }=d_{\lambda _{1}}\cdots d_{\lambda _{k}},\qquad d_{\lambda }=\partial _{\lambda }+y_{\lambda }^{i}\partial _{i}+\cdots ,} denote the total derivatives.

For instance, a first-order Lagrangian and its second-order Euler–Lagrange operator take the form L = L ( x λ λ , y i , y λ λ i ) d n x , δ δ i L = ∂ ∂ i L − − d λ λ ∂ ∂ i λ λ L .

{\displaystyle L={\mathcal {L}}(x^{\lambda },y^{i},y_{\lambda }^{i})\,d^{n}x,\qquad \delta _{i}L=\partial _{i}{\mathcal {L}}-d_{\lambda }\partial _{i}^{\lambda }{\mathcal {L}}.} Euler–Lagrange equations [ edit ] The kernel of an Euler–Lagrange operator provides the Euler–Lagrange equations δL = 0 .

Cohomology and Noether's theorems [ edit ] Cohomology of the variational bicomplex leads to the so-called
variational formula d L = δ δ L + d H Θ Θ L , {\displaystyle dL=\delta L+d_{H}\Theta _{L},} where d H Θ Θ L = d x λ λ ∧ ∧ d λ λ ϕ ϕ , ϕ ϕ ∈ ∈ O ∞ ∞ ∗ ∗ ( Y ) {\displaystyle d_{H}\Theta _{L}=dx^{\lambda }\wedge d_{\lambda }\phi ,\qquad \phi \in O_{\infty }^{*}(Y)} is the total differential and θ L is a Lepage equivalent of L .

Noether's first theorem and Noether's second theorem are corollaries of this variational formula.

Graded manifolds [ edit ] Extended to graded manifolds , the variational bicomplex provides description of graded Lagrangian systems of even and odd variables.

[ 1 ] Alternative formulations [ edit ] In a different way, Lagrangians, Euler–Lagrange operators and Euler–Lagrange equations are introduced in the framework of the calculus of variations .

Classical mechanics [ edit ] In classical mechanics equations of motion are first and second order differential equations on a manifold M or various fiber bundles Q over R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } . A solution of the equations of motion is called a motion .
