Despite little being known about his life or education, he has been described as the most original of all Arab oculists.

[ 1 ] As his nisba indicates, Ammar was born in Mosul , and later moved to Egypt , where he settled during the reign of the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah , to whom he wrote his only composition, Kitāb al-muntakhab fī ilm al-ayn (“The book of choice in ophthalmology”).

He is mostly known for the invention of a hypodermic syringe , which he used to remove cataracts , a major cause of blindness.

[ 2 ] Regarding his invention he wrote the following: Then I constructed the hollow needle, but I did not operate with it on anybody at all, before I came to Tiberias . There came a man for an operation who told me: Do as you like with me, only I cannot lie on my back. Then I operated on him with the hollow needle and extracted the cataract; and he saw immediately and did not need to lie, but slept as he liked. Only I bandaged his eye for seven days. With this needle nobody preceded me. I have done many operations with it in Egypt.

[ 3 ] He was a contemporary of the famous oculist Ali ibn Isa .
