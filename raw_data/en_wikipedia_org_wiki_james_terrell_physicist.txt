( 1923-08-15 ) August 15, 1923 Houston , United States Died March 21, 2009 (2009-03-21) (aged 85) Los Alamos, New Mexico , United States Alma mater Rice University Known for Terrell rotation Scientific career Fields Theoretical physics Astrophysics Institutions Los Alamos National Laboratories Nelson James Terrell (August 15, 1923–March 21, 2009) [ 1 ] was an US physicist and scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory .

James Terrell worked in relativity and astrophysics . The Terrell rotation , an image distortion of objects travelling near the speed of light , is named after him.

[ 2 ] Life [ edit ] Nelson James Terrell Jr. was born in Houston , Texas in 1923.

[ 1 ] James Terrell did his undergraduate studies Rice University .

[ 2 ] In 1945, he married Anne Elizabeth Pearson.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] Together, they had a daughter.

[ 3 ] From 1945 to 1947, the army sent Terrell to Japan. When he came back, he finished his PhD at Rice University in 1950.

[ 3 ] He worked on nuclear fission and the theory of relativity .

[ 4 ] He worked as assistant professor at Western Reserve University , [ 4 ] and later joined Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1951.

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] Terrell was member of the International Astronomical Union .

[ 5 ] He died in Los Alamos, New Mexico in 2009.

[ 1 ] Research [ edit ] In 1957 he started publishing works on length contraction . He discovered that the appearance of objects looks rotated at large speed, as predicted by special relativity . This is now known as the Terrell rotation or Terrell effect.

[ 2 ] In 1966, he studied quasars . He postulated that quasars were originally ejected from the center of galaxies.

[ 2 ] [ 6 ] This conjecture was the matter of international debate.

[ 2 ] In the 1970s he worked on analysing the x-ray data of Cygnus X-1 , a black hole candidate, [ 4 ] and worked on the x-ray data from the Vela B satellite. He produced a movie of the sky depicting dying stars, quasars, and black holes.

[ 2 ] [ 7 ] He also worked on solving the diffraction problem of high intensity lasers.
