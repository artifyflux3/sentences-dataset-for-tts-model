In [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), **Euler's laws of motion** are [equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion "Equations of motion") which extend [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") for [point particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle "Point particle") to [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") motion.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#cite_note-McGillKing-1) They were formulated by [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") about 50 years after [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") formulated his laws.

**Euler's first law** states that the rate of change of [linear momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum#Linear_momentum_of_a_system_of_particles "Momentum")**p** of a rigid body is equal to the resultant of all the external forces **F**ext acting on the body:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#cite_note-2)

Internal forces between the particles that make up a body do not contribute to changing the momentum of the body as there is an equal and opposite force resulting in no net effect.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#cite_note-Gray-3)

The linear momentum of a rigid body is the product of the mass of the body and the velocity of its [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass")**v**cm.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#cite_note-McGillKing-1)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#cite_note-BookRags-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#cite_note-Rao-5)

**Euler's second law** states that the rate of change of [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum")**L** about a point that is fixed in an inertial reference frame (often the center of mass of the body), is equal to the sum of the external moments of force ([torques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torques "Torques")) acting on that body **M** about that point:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#cite_note-McGillKing-1)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#cite_note-BookRags-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#cite_note-Rao-5)

![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbf {M} ={d\mathbf {L}  \over dt}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/13ab84527d827cc8eb1ae231e3c4f06f422eaef9)
Note that the above formula holds only if both **M** and **L** are computed with respect to a fixed inertial frame or a frame parallel to the inertial frame but fixed on the center of mass. For rigid bodies translating and rotating in only two dimensions, this can be expressed as:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#cite_note-6)

![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbf {M} =\mathbf {r} _{\rm {cm}}\times \mathbf {a} _{\rm {cm}}m+I{\boldsymbol {\alpha }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46425d50afd8692cf756adffed1e493f4429cbee)
where:

*   **r**cm is the position vector of the center of mass of the body with respect to the point about which moments are summed,
*   **a**cm is the linear acceleration of the center of mass of the body,
*   _m_ is the mass of the body,
*   **α** is the [angular acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_acceleration "Angular acceleration") of the body, and
*   _I_ is the [moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia "Moment of inertia") of the body about its center of mass.

Explanation and derivation
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euler%27s_laws_of_motion&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Explanation and derivation")]

The distribution of internal forces in a deformable body are not necessarily equal throughout, i.e. the stresses vary from one point to the next. This variation of internal forces throughout the body is governed by [Newton's second law of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") of conservation of [linear momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_momentum "Linear momentum") and [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum"), which for their simplest use are applied to a mass particle but are extended in [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics") to a body of continuously distributed mass. For continuous bodies these laws are called **Euler's laws of motion**.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#cite_note-Lubliner-7)

The total body force applied to a continuous body with mass _m_, [mass density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_density "Mass density")_ρ_, and volume _V_, is the [volume integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_integral "Volume integral") integrated over the volume of the body:

![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{B}=\int _{V}\mathbf {b} \,dm=\int _{V}\mathbf {b} \rho \,dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2c794458953062f48e78af3a901df549ba096189)
where **b** is the force acting on the body per unit mass ([dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis") of acceleration, misleadingly called the "body force"), and _dm_ = _ρ dV_ is an infinitesimal mass element of the body.

Body forces and contact forces acting on the body lead to corresponding moments ([torques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque")) of those forces relative to a given point. Thus, the total applied torque **M** about the origin is given by

![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbf {M} =\mathbf {M} _{B}+\mathbf {M} _{C}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8790179d7bcfb6b691fb7e0aa51e11da5715c241)
where **M**_B_ and **M**_C_ respectively indicate the moments caused by the body and contact forces.

Thus, the sum of all applied forces and torques (with respect to the origin of the coordinate system) acting on the body can be given as the sum of a volume and [surface integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_integral "Surface integral"):

![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\int _{V}\mathbf {a} \,dm=\int _{V}\mathbf {a} \rho \,dV=\int _{S}\mathbf {t} \,dS+\int _{V}\mathbf {b} \rho \,dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/651922868b07be2854bf7cf5ce6308962c7a64cb)![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mathbf {M} =\mathbf {M} _{B}+\mathbf {M} _{C}=\int _{S}\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {t} \,dS+\int _{V}\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {b} \rho \,dV.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20c85666ade3d360798ffd042604fb2e11b93664)
where **t** = **t**(**n**) is called the [surface traction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_traction "Surface traction"), integrated over the surface of the body, in turn **n** denotes a [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") normal and directed outwards to the surface _S_.

Let the coordinate system (_x_ 1, _x_ 2, _x_ 3) be an [inertial frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference"), **r** be the position vector of a point particle in the continuous body with respect to the origin of the coordinate system, and **v** = ⁠_d_**r**/_dt_⁠ be the velocity vector of that point.

**Euler's first axiom or law** (law of balance of linear momentum or balance of forces) states that in an inertial frame the time rate of change of linear momentum **p** of an arbitrary portion of a continuous body is equal to the total applied force **F** acting on that portion, and it is expressed as

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {d\mathbf {p} }{dt}}&=\mathbf {F} \\{\frac {d}{dt}}\int _{V}\rho \mathbf {v} \,dV&=\int _{S}\mathbf {t} \,dS+\int _{V}\mathbf {b} \rho \,dV.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b11d4cc87bdbec4fa9604c4abd74741505c9ba24)
**Euler's second axiom or law** (law of balance of angular momentum or balance of torques) states that in an inertial frame the time rate of change of angular momentum **L** of an arbitrary portion of a continuous body is equal to the total applied torque **M** acting on that portion, and it is expressed as

![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {d\mathbf {L} }{dt}}&=\mathbf {M} \\{\frac {d}{dt}}\int _{V}\mathbf {r} \times \rho \mathbf {v} \,dV&=\int _{S}\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {t} \,dS+\int _{V}\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {b} \rho \,dV.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a636166f28698822de80eacf89d9f021710838b7)
where ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35c1866e359fbfd2e0f606c725ba5cc37a5195d6) is the velocity, ![Image 11: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) the volume, and the derivatives of **p** and **L** are [material derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_derivative "Material derivative").
