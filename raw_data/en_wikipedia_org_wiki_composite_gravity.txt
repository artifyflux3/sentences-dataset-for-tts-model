A theorem by Steven Weinberg and Edward Witten shows that this is not possible in Lorentz covariant theories: massless particles with spin greater than one are forbidden. The AdS/CFT correspondence may be viewed as a loophole in their argument. However, in this case not only the graviton is emergent; a whole spacetime dimension is emergent, too.
