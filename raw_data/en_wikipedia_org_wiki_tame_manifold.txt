In geometry , a tame manifold is a manifold with a well-behaved compactification .  More precisely, a manifold M {\displaystyle M} is called tame if it is homeomorphic to a compact manifold with a closed subset of the boundary removed.

The Whitehead manifold is an example of a contractible manifold that is not tame.
