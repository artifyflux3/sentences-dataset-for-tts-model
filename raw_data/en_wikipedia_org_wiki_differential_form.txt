In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **differential forms** provide a unified approach to define [integrands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrand "Integrand") over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"). The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by [Élie Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan"). It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.

For instance, the expression ![Image 1: {\displaystyle f(x)\,dx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/128d13d8c89b9bea5cbf00962ef7ff4405848349) is an example of a [1-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-form "1-form"), and can be [integrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") over an interval ![Image 2: {\displaystyle [a,b]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c4b788fc5c637e26ee98b45f89a5c08c85f7935) contained in the domain of ![Image 3: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61): ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/249ee3fdbced31dfc328ff357f67bb134ca66b8d) Similarly, the expression ![Image 5: {\displaystyle f(x,y,z)\,dx\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\,dz\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\,dy\wedge dz}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/44968bd9918d8d850479a02190d3764d8d8584a0) is a **2-form** that can be integrated over a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)")![Image 6: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2): ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \int _{S}\left(f(x,y,z)\,dx\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\,dz\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\,dy\wedge dz\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73a2ad625447c9536d36bce34e5b2fa1cbb81cf2) The symbol ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \wedge }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1caa4004cb216ef2930bb12fe805a76870caed94) denotes the [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_product "Exterior product"), sometimes called the _wedge product_, of two differential forms. Likewise, a **3-form**![Image 9: {\displaystyle f(x,y,z)\,dx\wedge dy\wedge dz}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d1f9e5648c42d62871e31d4c5e403b2998162710) represents a [volume element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_element "Volume element") that can be integrated over a region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional manifold, and is [homogeneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial "Homogeneous polynomial") of degree k in the coordinate differentials ![Image 10: {\displaystyle dx,dy,\ldots .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d68be24160926d9778b06bf8150ce584165353c3) On an _n_-dimensional manifold, a top-dimensional form (_n_-form) is called a _[volume form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume\_form "Volume form")_.

The differential forms form an [alternating algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_algebra "Alternating algebra"). This implies that ![Image 11: {\displaystyle dy\wedge dx=-dx\wedge dy}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9eca305d04c05506e4b8445007f535639968cfa) and ![Image 12: {\displaystyle dx\wedge dx=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/593aa821aee8e3b74928300debf298c2f95db58d) This alternating property reflects the [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(mathematics) "Orientation (mathematics)") of the domain of integration.

The [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative") is an operation on differential forms that, given a _k_-form ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \varphi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e), produces a (_k_+1)-form ![Image 14: {\displaystyle d\varphi .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/874e9f3ab5a6881add7f4324139b4bd83be29d95) This operation extends the [differential of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_of_a_function "Differential of a function") (a function can be considered as a 0-form, and its differential is ![Image 15: {\displaystyle df(x)=f'(x)\,dx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1491426bb6119f5087c2382a725338976e91c05c)). This allows expressing the [fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus "Fundamental theorem of calculus"), the [divergence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem "Divergence theorem"), [Green's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem "Green's theorem"), and [Stokes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem "Stokes' theorem") as special cases of a single general result, the [generalized Stokes theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Stokes_theorem "Generalized Stokes theorem").

Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") on a [differentiable manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"), and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the [interior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_product "Interior product"). The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the [pullback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullback_(differential_geometry) "Pullback (differential geometry)") under smooth functions between two manifolds. This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms. As an example, the [change of variables formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_variables_formula "Change of variables formula") for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.

Differential forms are part of the field of differential geometry, influenced by linear algebra. Although the notion of a differential is quite old, the initial attempt at an algebraic organization of differential forms is usually credited to [Élie Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan") with reference to his 1899 paper.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#cite_note-1) Some aspects of the [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra") of differential forms appears in [Hermann Grassmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Grassmann "Hermann Grassmann")'s 1844 work, _Die Lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik (The Theory of Linear Extension, a New Branch of Mathematics)_.

Differential forms provide an approach to [multivariable calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus "Multivariable calculus") that is independent of [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate "Coordinate").

### Integration and orientation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Integration and orientation")]

A differential k-form can be integrated over an oriented [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_(mathematics) "Manifold (mathematics)") of dimension k. A differential 1-form can be thought of as measuring an infinitesimal oriented length, or 1-dimensional oriented density. A differential 2-form can be thought of as measuring an infinitesimal oriented area, or 2-dimensional oriented density. And so on.

Integration of differential forms is well-defined only on [oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability")[manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_(mathematics) "Manifold (mathematics)"). An example of a 1-dimensional manifold is an interval [_a_, _b_], and intervals can be given an orientation: they are positively oriented if _a_<_b_, and negatively oriented otherwise. If _a_<_b_ then the integral of the differential 1-form _f_(_x_) _dx_ over the interval [_a_, _b_] (with its natural positive orientation) is ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac02adeed584466d53dee65f3228ad66939eb58b) which is the negative of the integral of the same differential form over the same interval, when equipped with the opposite orientation. That is: ![Image 17: {\displaystyle \int _{b}^{a}f(x)\,dx=-\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5fa0c45bba6b7237d507c281d2686600ac6e7e1d) This gives a geometrical context to the [conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral#Conventions "Integral") for one-dimensional integrals, that the sign changes when the orientation of the interval is reversed. A standard explanation of this in one-variable integration theory is that, when the limits of integration are in the opposite order (_b_<_a_), the increment _dx_ is negative in the direction of integration.

More generally, an m-form is an oriented density that can be integrated over an m-dimensional oriented manifold. (For example, a 1-form can be integrated over an oriented curve, a 2-form can be integrated over an oriented surface, etc.) If M is an oriented m-dimensional manifold, and _M_′ is the same manifold with opposite orientation and ω is an m-form, then one has: ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \int _{M}\omega =-\int _{M'}\omega \,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e34c2752dd1295f6cb6c32c04cb05a27fe0cdfd) These conventions correspond to interpreting the integrand as a differential form, integrated over a [chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(algebraic_topology) "Chain (algebraic topology)"). In [measure theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory "Measure theory"), by contrast, one interprets the integrand as a function f with respect to a measure μ and integrates over a subset A, without any notion of orientation; one writes ![Image 19: {\textstyle \int _{A}f\,d\mu =\int _{[a,b]}f\,d\mu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/511cfc5df1d72c9db9323c6d97c4cfc3548bea8d) to indicate integration over a subset A. This is a minor distinction in one dimension, but becomes subtler on higher-dimensional manifolds; see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#Relation_with_measures) for details.

Making the notion of an oriented density precise, and thus of a differential form, involves the [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra"). The differentials of a set of coordinates, _dx_ 1, ..., _dx_ _n_ can be used as a basis for all 1-forms. Each of these represents a [covector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covector "Covector") at each point on the manifold that may be thought of as measuring a small displacement in the corresponding coordinate direction. A general 1-form is a linear combination of these differentials at every point on the manifold: ![Image 20: {\displaystyle f_{1}\,dx^{1}+\cdots +f_{n}\,dx^{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b845acf139ac10d16db75a95d81f6d19c283f932) where the _f_ _k_ = _f_ _k_(_x_ 1, ... , _x_ _n_) are functions of all the coordinates. A differential 1-form is integrated along an oriented curve as a line integral.

The expressions _dx_ _i_ ∧ _dx_ _j_, where _i_<_j_ can be used as a basis at every point on the manifold for all 2-forms. This may be thought of as an infinitesimal oriented square parallel to the _x_ _i_–_x_ _j_-plane. A general 2-form is a linear combination of these at every point on the manifold: ![Image 21: {\textstyle \sum _{1\leq i<j\leq n}f_{i,j}\,dx^{i}\wedge dx^{j}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1104e81454c88e5e0c0c16e63cab911da6af12b2), and it is integrated just like a surface integral.

A fundamental operation defined on differential forms is the [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_product "Exterior product") (the symbol is the [wedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_(symbol) "Wedge (symbol)")∧). This is similar to the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") from vector calculus, in that it is an alternating product. For instance, ![Image 22: {\displaystyle dx^{1}\wedge dx^{2}=-dx^{2}\wedge dx^{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46e07cd976f309e282a7fe8fc43efa5cd9e618e1)

because the square whose first side is _dx_ 1 and second side is _dx_ 2 is to be regarded as having the opposite orientation as the square whose first side is _dx_ 2 and whose second side is _dx_ 1. This is why we only need to sum over expressions _dx_ _i_ ∧ _dx_ _j_, with _i_<_j_; for example: _a_(_dx_ _i_ ∧ _dx_ _j_) + _b_(_dx_ _j_ ∧ _dx_ _i_) = (_a_ − _b_) _dx_ _i_ ∧ _dx_ _j_. The exterior product allows higher-degree differential forms to be built out of lower-degree ones, in much the same way that the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") in vector calculus allows one to compute the area vector of a parallelogram from vectors pointing up the two sides. Alternating also implies that _dx_ _i_ ∧ _dx_ _i_ = 0, in the same way that the cross product of parallel vectors, whose magnitude is the area of the parallelogram spanned by those vectors, is zero. In higher dimensions, _dx_ _i_ 1 ∧ ⋅⋅⋅ ∧ _dx_ _i_ _m_ = 0 if any two of the indices _i_ 1, ..., _i_ _m_ are equal, in the same way that the "volume" enclosed by a [parallelotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelepiped#Parallelotope "Parallelepiped") whose edge vectors are [linearly dependent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence "Linear independence") is zero.

### Multi-index notation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Multi-index notation")]

A common notation for the wedge product of elementary k-forms is so called [multi-index notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-index_notation "Multi-index notation"): in an n-dimensional context, for ![Image 23: {\displaystyle I=(i_{1},i_{2},\ldots ,i_{k}),1\leq i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdots <i_{k}\leq n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22321587b6fcbbb6df12ad4ee29b20e57821bf06), we define ![Image 24: {\textstyle dx^{I}:=dx^{i_{1}}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_{k}}=\bigwedge _{i\in I}dx^{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2cc974ca67fffe1d9129d932c495c04aa319d83f).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#cite_note-2) Another useful notation is obtained by defining the set of all strictly increasing multi-indices of length k, in a space of dimension n, denoted ![Image 25: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {J}}_{k,n}:=\{I=(i_{1},\ldots ,i_{k}):1\leq i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdots <i_{k}\leq n\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec06bf7dd41053a257d829949b55b648e36871dd). Then locally (wherever the coordinates apply), ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \{dx^{I}\}_{I\in {\mathcal {J}}_{k,n}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e5ffe1d0e9cdb3b922c902f16f816a62b6b1608a) spans the space of differential k-forms in a manifold M of dimension n, when viewed as a module over the ring _C_∞(_M_) of smooth functions on M. By calculating the size of ![Image 27: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {J}}_{k,n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/62fd0fe22a036366a00d79844fd94819e2102dda) combinatorially, the module of k-forms on an n-dimensional manifold, and in general space of k-covectors on an n-dimensional vector space, is n choose k: ![Image 28: {\textstyle |{\mathcal {J}}_{k,n}|={\binom {n}{k}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b141636d214173e51087b43c3ca7ae3be41e782a). This also demonstrates that there are no nonzero differential forms of degree greater than the dimension of the underlying manifold.

### The exterior derivative

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: The exterior derivative")]

In addition to the exterior product, there is also the [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative") operator _d_. The exterior derivative of a differential form is a generalization of the [differential of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_of_a_function "Differential of a function"), in the sense that the exterior derivative of _f_ ∈ _C_∞(_M_) = Ω 0(_M_) is exactly the differential of f. When generalized to higher forms, if _ω_ = _f_ _dx_ _I_ is a simple k-form, then its exterior derivative _dω_ is a (_k_ + 1)-form defined by taking the differential of the coefficient functions: ![Image 29: {\displaystyle d\omega =\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x^{i}}}\,dx^{i}\wedge dx^{I}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/55d98b7900aa873823e3d88d0c34c5ab3022aa57) with extension to general k-forms through linearity: if ![Image 30: {\textstyle \tau =\sum _{I\in {\mathcal {J}}_{k,n}}a_{I}\,dx^{I}\in \Omega ^{k}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/216b25d141ff4db0ebacb2cdb14837d140e99d72), then its exterior derivative is ![Image 31: {\displaystyle d\tau =\sum _{I\in {\mathcal {J}}_{k,n}}\left(\sum _{j=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial a_{I}}{\partial x^{j}}}\,dx^{j}\right)\wedge dx^{I}\in \Omega ^{k+1}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af228d587f8071a18c142615d23b4ecb0b2d63c1)

In **R**3, with the [Hodge star operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_star_operator "Hodge star operator"), the exterior derivative corresponds to [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient"), [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics) "Curl (mathematics)"), and [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence"), although this correspondence, like the cross product, does not generalize to higher dimensions, and should be treated with some caution.

The exterior derivative itself applies in an arbitrary finite number of dimensions, and is a flexible and powerful tool with wide application in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), [differential topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology "Differential topology"), and many areas in physics. Of note, although the above definition of the exterior derivative was defined with respect to local coordinates, it can be defined in an entirely coordinate-free manner, as an [antiderivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivation_(differential_algebra) "Derivation (differential algebra)") of degree 1 on the [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra") of differential forms. The benefit of this more general approach is that it allows for a natural coordinate-free approach to integrate on [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"). It also allows for a natural generalization of the [fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus "Fundamental theorem of calculus"), called the (generalized) [Stokes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem "Stokes' theorem"), which is a central result in the theory of integration on manifolds.

### Differential calculus

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Differential calculus")]

Let U be an [open set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set") in **R**_n_. A differential 0-form ("zero-form") is defined to be a [smooth function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function")f on U – the set of which is denoted _C_∞(_U_). If _v_ is any vector in **R**_n_, then _f_ has a [directional derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_derivative "Directional derivative")∂**v**_f_, which is another function on U whose value at a point _p_ ∈ _U_ is the rate of change (at p) of f in the **v** direction: ![Image 32: {\displaystyle (\partial _{\mathbf {v} }f)(p)=\left.{\frac {d}{dt}}f(p+t\mathbf {v} )\right|_{t=0}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d23a223c412bdd6b5b9f65410a80206dd0ab0192) (This notion can be extended pointwise to the case that **v** is a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") on U by evaluating **v** at the point p in the definition.)

In particular, if **v** = **e**_j_ is the j th [coordinate vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector "Coordinate vector") then ∂**v**_f_ is the [partial derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative") of f with respect to the j th coordinate vector, i.e., ∂_f_ / ∂_x_ _j_, where _x_ 1, _x_ 2, ..., _x_ _n_ are the coordinate vectors in U. By their very definition, partial derivatives depend upon the choice of coordinates: if new coordinates _y_ 1, _y_ 2, ..., _y_ _n_ are introduced, then ![Image 33: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x^{j}}}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial y^{i}}{\partial x^{j}}}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y^{i}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e86cfd6843c91b0a094cc7ad1a741a1a06c0909)

The first idea leading to differential forms is the observation that ∂**v**_f_ (_p_) is a [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function "Linear function") of _v_:

![Image 34: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(\partial _{\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {w} }f)(p)&=(\partial _{\mathbf {v} }f)(p)+(\partial _{\mathbf {w} }f)(p)\\(\partial _{c\mathbf {v} }f)(p)&=c(\partial _{\mathbf {v} }f)(p)\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41c4ca739864c70f15f2998d2ec1eb607e7d0ca8)

for any vectors **v**, **w** and any real number c. At each point _p_, this [linear map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map") from **R**_n_ to **R** is denoted _df_ _p_ and called the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") or [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_of_a_function "Differential of a function") of f at p. Thus _df_ _p_(**v**) = ∂**v**_f_ (_p_). Extended over the whole set, the object _df_ can be viewed as a function that takes a vector field on U, and returns a real-valued function whose value at each point is the derivative along the vector field of the function f. Note that at each p, the differential _df_ _p_ is not a real number, but a linear functional on tangent vectors, and a prototypical example of a differential [1-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-form "1-form").

Since any vector **v** is a [linear combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination "Linear combination")Σ _v_ _j_**e**_j_ of its [components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector#Decomposition "Euclidean vector"), _df_ is uniquely determined by _df_ _p_(**e**_j_) for each _j_ and each _p_ ∈ _U_, which are just the partial derivatives of f on U. Thus _df_ provides a way of encoding the partial derivatives of f. It can be decoded by noticing that the coordinates _x_ 1, _x_ 2, ..., _x_ _n_ are themselves functions on U, and so define differential 1-forms _dx_ 1, _dx_ 2, ..., _dx_ _n_. Let _f_ = _x_ _i_. Since ∂_x_ _i_ / ∂_x_ _j_ = _δ_ _ij_, the [Kronecker delta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta_function "Kronecker delta function"), it follows that

![Image 35: {\displaystyle df=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x^{i}}}\,dx^{i}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18d54e1d89b068cef9858a9cc2350fad62cd741e)*

The meaning of this expression is given by evaluating both sides at an arbitrary point p: on the right hand side, the sum is defined "[pointwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise "Pointwise")", so that ![Image 36: {\displaystyle df_{p}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x^{i}}}(p)(dx^{i})_{p}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/08036ae5562d74daa5fde37bd9169bdce438e8bd) Applying both sides to _e_ _j_, the result on each side is the j th partial derivative of f at p. Since p and j were arbitrary, this proves the formula **[(*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#math_*)**.

More generally, for any smooth functions _g_ _i_ and _h_ _i_ on U, we define the differential 1-form _α_ = Σ _i_ _g_ _i_ _dh_ _i_ pointwise by ![Image 37: {\displaystyle \alpha _{p}=\sum _{i}g_{i}(p)(dh_{i})_{p}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01434a640cebe6ca8ebd6e38956c498822310d40) for each _p_ ∈ _U_. Any differential 1-form arises this way, and by using **[(*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#math_*)** it follows that any differential 1-form α on U may be expressed in coordinates as ![Image 38: {\displaystyle \alpha =\sum _{i=1}^{n}f_{i}\,dx^{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b88eb5c2fedd9a3c3c24030d1c805f460f7a32f) for some smooth functions _f_ _i_ on U.

The second idea leading to differential forms arises from the following question: given a differential 1-form α on U, when does there exist a function f on U such that _α_ = _df_? The above expansion reduces this question to the search for a function f whose partial derivatives ∂_f_ / ∂_x_ _i_ are equal to n given functions _f_ _i_. For _n_> 1, such a function does not always exist: any smooth function f satisfies ![Image 39: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x^{i}\,\partial x^{j}}}={\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x^{j}\,\partial x^{i}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b11659d7978d50713246fa58cf41e038831f0426) so it will be impossible to find such an f unless ![Image 40: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f_{j}}{\partial x^{i}}}-{\frac {\partial f_{i}}{\partial x^{j}}}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7375dec5415d7c35bfdc84086771d839714ef075) for all i and j.

The [skew-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_symmetry "Skew symmetry") of the left hand side in i and j suggests introducing an antisymmetric product ∧ on differential 1-forms, the [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_product "Exterior product"), so that these equations can be combined into a single condition ![Image 41: {\displaystyle \sum _{i,j=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial f_{j}}{\partial x^{i}}}\,dx^{i}\wedge dx^{j}=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/89a8d9a7326d6ffed45c689d2bf06be81faa3673) where ∧ is defined so that: ![Image 42: {\displaystyle dx^{i}\wedge dx^{j}=-dx^{j}\wedge dx^{i}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0e6564b779e9db06381a8da5b697cf53d775c174)

This is an example of a differential 2-form. This 2-form is called the [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative")_dα_ of _α_ = ∑_n_

_j_=1 _f_ _j_ _dx_ _j_. It is given by ![Image 43: {\displaystyle d\alpha =\sum _{j=1}^{n}df_{j}\wedge dx^{j}=\sum _{i,j=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial f_{j}}{\partial x^{i}}}\,dx^{i}\wedge dx^{j}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3944d7e9218f0105e86018a19f6f90c8228fe757)

To summarize: _dα_ = 0 is a necessary condition for the existence of a function f with _α_ = _df_.

Differential 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms are special cases of differential forms. For each k, there is a space of differential k-forms, which can be expressed in terms of the coordinates as ![Image 44: {\displaystyle \sum _{i_{1},i_{2}\ldots i_{k}=1}^{n}f_{i_{1}i_{2}\ldots i_{k}}\,dx^{i_{1}}\wedge dx^{i_{2}}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_{k}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad6a1542e589f0d6b94e2cc2b7554db7618efb95) for a collection of functions _f_ _i_ 1 _i_ 2⋅⋅⋅_i_ _k_. Antisymmetry, which was already present for 2-forms, makes it possible to restrict the sum to those sets of indices for which _i_ 1<_i_ 2< ... <_i_ _k_−1<_i_ _k_.

Differential forms can be multiplied together using the exterior product, and for any differential k-form α, there is a differential (_k_ + 1)-form _dα_ called the exterior derivative of α.

Differential forms, the exterior product and the exterior derivative are independent of a choice of coordinates. Consequently, they may be defined on any [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold")M. One way to do this is cover M with [coordinate charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_chart "Coordinate chart") and define a differential k-form on M to be a family of differential k-forms on each chart which agree on the overlaps. However, there are more intrinsic definitions which make the independence of coordinates manifest.

Intrinsic definitions
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Intrinsic definitions")]

Let _M_ be a [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold"). A smooth differential form of degree _k_ is a [smooth section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(fiber_bundle) "Section (fiber bundle)") of the _k_ th [exterior power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra") of the [cotangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_bundle "Cotangent bundle") of _M_. The set of all differential _k_-forms on a manifold _M_ is a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"), often denoted ![Image 45: {\displaystyle \Omega ^{k}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30e527515b7c9de608cccd789454806924363647).

The definition of a differential form may be restated as follows. At any point ![Image 46: {\displaystyle p\in M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35ad2c18a15749505c928763cd4fdb56f4982816), a _k_-form ![Image 47: {\displaystyle \beta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ed48a5e36207156fb792fa79d29925d2f7901e8) defines an element ![Image 48: {\displaystyle \beta _{p}\in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}T_{p}^{*}M,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/152a0e73c538eaa2072cb86b54cbf550b16953f1) where ![Image 49: {\displaystyle T_{p}M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/71b20e0304a65ead2cafb33412a383b34fe527ca) is the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") to _M_ at _p_ and ![Image 50: {\displaystyle T_{p}^{*}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b50277c15fd54b9311c1dc4e3e11e8e17d330dd) is its [dual space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space "Dual space"). This space is [naturally isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_isomorphism "Natural isomorphism")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#cite_note-3)[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] to the fiber at _p_ of the dual bundle of the _k_ th exterior power of the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle") of _M_. That is, ![Image 51: {\displaystyle \beta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ed48a5e36207156fb792fa79d29925d2f7901e8) is also a linear functional ![Image 52: {\textstyle \beta _{p}\colon {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}T_{p}M\to \mathbf {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8b807751d6ba0965b06cdf8844aec109bacd5e4c), i.e. the dual of the _k_ th exterior power is isomorphic to the _k_ th exterior power of the dual: ![Image 53: {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}T_{p}^{*}M\cong {\Big (}{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}T_{p}M{\Big )}^{*}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/23b4b8a1779c19751365f09d19a9d6ebd9a8522f)

By the universal property of exterior powers, this is equivalently an [alternating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_form "Alternating form")[multilinear map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_map "Multilinear map"): ![Image 54: {\displaystyle \beta _{p}\colon \bigoplus _{n=1}^{k}T_{p}M\to \mathbf {R} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/85b2cac7957e7382e777204e16471b133445fd11) Consequently, a differential _k_-form may be evaluated against any _k_-tuple of tangent vectors to the same point _p_ of _M_. For example, a differential 1-form _α_ assigns to each point ![Image 55: {\displaystyle p\in M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35ad2c18a15749505c928763cd4fdb56f4982816) a [linear functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_functional "Linear functional")_α_ _p_ on ![Image 56: {\displaystyle T_{p}M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/71b20e0304a65ead2cafb33412a383b34fe527ca). In the presence of an [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product") on ![Image 57: {\displaystyle T_{p}M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/71b20e0304a65ead2cafb33412a383b34fe527ca) (induced by a [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") on _M_), _α_ _p_ may be [represented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesz_representation_theorem "Riesz representation theorem") as the inner product with a [tangent vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_vector "Tangent vector")![Image 58: {\displaystyle X_{p}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f7e8d9eb9672d0455d39519ae4eb49adfa19331). Differential 1-forms are sometimes called [covariant vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors"), covector fields, or "dual vector fields", particularly within physics.

The exterior algebra may be embedded in the tensor algebra by means of the alternation map. The alternation map is defined as a mapping ![Image 59: {\displaystyle \operatorname {Alt} \colon {\bigotimes }^{k}T^{*}M\to {\bigotimes }^{k}T^{*}M.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47d99f1eaddf9b9f5d5e111d286923673eb9935e) For a tensor ![Image 60: {\displaystyle \tau }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38a7dcde9730ef0853809fefc18d88771f95206c) at a point _p_, ![Image 61: {\displaystyle \operatorname {Alt} (\tau _{p})(x_{1},\dots ,x_{k})={\frac {1}{k!}}\sum _{\sigma \in S_{k}}\operatorname {sgn}(\sigma )\tau _{p}(x_{\sigma (1)},\dots ,x_{\sigma (k)}),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ae755d5a481cc9ff8a9703675f5d102c9bfd528) where _S_ _k_ is the [symmetric group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group "Symmetric group") on _k_ elements. The alternation map is constant on the cosets of the ideal in the tensor algebra generated by the symmetric 2-forms, and therefore descends to an embedding ![Image 62: {\displaystyle \operatorname {Alt} \colon {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}T^{*}M\to {\bigotimes }^{k}T^{*}M.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/85621bff4f78b8c4b46cef3d725d8d22ecc30b71)

This map exhibits ![Image 63: {\displaystyle \beta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ed48a5e36207156fb792fa79d29925d2f7901e8) as a [totally antisymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisymmetric_tensor "Antisymmetric tensor")[covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors")[tensor field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field "Tensor field") of rank _k_. The differential forms on _M_ are in one-to-one correspondence with such tensor fields.

As well as the addition and multiplication by scalar operations which arise from the vector space structure, there are several other standard operations defined on differential forms. The most important operations are the [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_product "Exterior product") of two differential forms, the [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative") of a single differential form, the [interior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_product "Interior product") of a differential form and a vector field, the [Lie derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_derivative "Lie derivative") of a differential form with respect to a vector field and the [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative") of a differential form with respect to a vector field on a manifold with a defined connection.

The exterior product of a _k_-form _α_ and an _ℓ_-form _β_, denoted _α_ ∧ _β_, is a (_k_ + _ℓ_)-form. At each point _p_ of the manifold _M_, the forms _α_ and _β_ are elements of an exterior power of the cotangent space at _p_. When the exterior algebra is viewed as a quotient of the tensor algebra, the exterior product corresponds to the tensor product (modulo the equivalence relation defining the exterior algebra).

The antisymmetry inherent in the exterior algebra means that when _α_ ∧ _β_ is viewed as a multilinear functional, it is alternating. However, when the exterior algebra is embedded as a subspace of the tensor algebra by means of the alternation map, the tensor product _α_ ⊗ _β_ is not alternating. There is an explicit formula which describes the exterior product in this situation. The exterior product is ![Image 64: {\displaystyle \alpha \wedge \beta =\operatorname {Alt} (\alpha \otimes \beta ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/64e370f8f91d909d57a35aecb464cb1d58fdcc54) If the embedding of ![Image 65: {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{n}T^{*}M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/07980b360534afeefdd711bbf6752f15c01e2f37) into ![Image 66: {\displaystyle {\bigotimes }^{n}T^{*}M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30a31e0cccfa65190633377f7f3b627254143783) is done via the map ![Image 67: {\displaystyle n!\operatorname {Alt} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/79f13656f832eee913f507545fd419635992c4d2) instead of ![Image 68: {\displaystyle \operatorname {Alt} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0cada76b2ad3c1e5cbed0390716541e46b750f73), the exterior product is ![Image 69: {\displaystyle \alpha \wedge \beta ={\frac {(k+\ell )!}{k!\ell !}}\operatorname {Alt} (\alpha \otimes \beta ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba3e9590fd24a84e793df92bd1968248d85d98b5) This description is useful for explicit computations. For example, if _k_ = _ℓ_ = 1, then _α_ ∧ _β_ is the 2-form whose value at a point _p_ is the [alternating bilinear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_bilinear_form "Alternating bilinear form") defined by ![Image 70: {\displaystyle (\alpha \wedge \beta )_{p}(v,w)=\alpha _{p}(v)\beta _{p}(w)-\alpha _{p}(w)\beta _{p}(v)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9408eb2ea9ad495cc2b6760e0eca2902de04ef70) for _v_, _w_ ∈ T _p_ _M_.

The exterior product is bilinear: If _α_, _β_, and _γ_ are any differential forms, and if _f_ is any smooth function, then ![Image 71: {\displaystyle \alpha \wedge (\beta +\gamma )=\alpha \wedge \beta +\alpha \wedge \gamma ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d05c888c855b7fffc883b5db15367747f25be21f)![Image 72: {\displaystyle \alpha \wedge (f\cdot \beta )=f\cdot (\alpha \wedge \beta ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9f7e75119f6068ebce781f0ca4ed79d443d3f982)

It is _skew commutative_ (also known as _graded commutative_), meaning that it satisfies a variant of [anticommutativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticommutativity "Anticommutativity") that depends on the degrees of the forms: if _α_ is a _k_-form and _β_ is an _ℓ_-form, then ![Image 73: {\displaystyle \alpha \wedge \beta =(-1)^{k\ell }\beta \wedge \alpha .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65283427068fc9d8e56fccc4b22a1fd4c2550e47)

One also has the [graded Leibniz rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_graded_algebra "Differential graded algebra"):

### Riemannian manifold

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Riemannian manifold")]

On a [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold"), or more generally a [pseudo-Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold"), the metric defines a fibre-wise isomorphism of the tangent and cotangent bundles. This makes it possible to convert vector fields to covector fields and vice versa. It also enables the definition of additional operations such as the [Hodge star operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_star_operator "Hodge star operator")![Image 75: {\displaystyle \star \colon \Omega ^{k}(M)\ {\stackrel {\sim }{\to }}\ \Omega ^{n-k}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a893ef4120fd98141515bd6e8446247f692d4890) and the [codifferential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_star#Codifferential "Hodge star")![Image 76: {\displaystyle \delta \colon \Omega ^{k}(M)\rightarrow \Omega ^{k-1}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f579491dfe04e01e72245ada390c0e07c8c9a4b), which has degree −1 and is [adjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator#Adjoint_of_an_operator "Differential operator") to the exterior differential _d_.

#### Vector field structures

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Vector field structures")]

On a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, 1-forms can be identified with vector fields; vector fields have additional distinct algebraic structures, which are listed here for context and to avoid confusion.

Firstly, each (co)tangent space generates a [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra"), where the product of a (co)vector with itself is given by the value of a quadratic form – in this case, the natural one induced by the [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor"). This algebra is _distinct_ from the [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra") of differential forms, which can be viewed as a Clifford algebra where the quadratic form vanishes (since the exterior product of any vector with itself is zero). Clifford algebras are thus non-anticommutative ("quantum") deformations of the exterior algebra. They are studied in [geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra").

Another alternative is to consider vector fields as derivations. The (noncommutative) algebra of [differential operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator "Differential operator") they generate is the [Weyl algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_algebra "Weyl algebra") and is a noncommutative ("quantum") deformation of the _symmetric_ algebra in the vector fields.

### Exterior differential complex

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Exterior differential complex")]

One important property of the exterior derivative is that _d_ 2 = 0. This means that the exterior derivative defines a [cochain complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochain_complex "Cochain complex"): ![Image 77: {\displaystyle 0\ \to \ \Omega ^{0}(M)\ {\stackrel {d}{\to }}\ \Omega ^{1}(M)\ {\stackrel {d}{\to }}\ \Omega ^{2}(M)\ {\stackrel {d}{\to }}\ \Omega ^{3}(M)\ \to \ \cdots \ \to \ \Omega ^{n}(M)\ \to \ 0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dd2f3b559dcc67537affdd40a6d3754b4ec7e6e5)

This complex is called the de Rham complex, and its [cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology "Cohomology") is by definition the [de Rham cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_cohomology "De Rham cohomology") of _M_. By the [Poincaré lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_lemma "Poincaré lemma"), the de Rham complex is locally [exact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_sequence "Exact sequence") except at Ω 0(_M_). The kernel at Ω 0(_M_) is the space of [locally constant functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_constant_function "Locally constant function") on _M_. Therefore, the complex is a resolution of the constant [sheaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics) "Sheaf (mathematics)")**R**, which in turn implies a form of de Rham's theorem: de Rham cohomology computes the [sheaf cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_cohomology "Sheaf cohomology") of **R**.

Suppose that _f_: _M_ → _N_ is smooth. The differential of _f_ is a smooth map _df_: _TM_ → _TN_ between the tangent bundles of _M_ and _N_. This map is also denoted _f_∗ and called the **pushforward**. For any point _p_ ∈ _M_ and any tangent vector _v_ ∈ _T_ _p_ _M_, there is a well-defined pushforward vector _f_∗(_v_) in _T_ _f_(_p_)_N_. However, the same is not true of a vector field. If _f_ is not injective, say because _q_ ∈ _N_ has two or more preimages, then the vector field may determine two or more distinct vectors in _T_ _q_ _N_. If _f_ is not surjective, then there will be a point _q_ ∈ _N_ at which _f_∗ does not determine any tangent vector at all. Since a vector field on _N_ determines, by definition, a unique tangent vector at every point of _N_, the pushforward of a vector field does not always exist.

By contrast, it is always possible to pull back a differential form. A differential form on _N_ may be viewed as a linear functional on each tangent space. Precomposing this functional with the differential _df_: _TM_ → _TN_ defines a linear functional on each tangent space of _M_ and therefore a differential form on _M_. The existence of pullbacks is one of the key features of the theory of differential forms. It leads to the existence of pullback maps in other situations, such as pullback homomorphisms in de Rham cohomology.

Formally, let _f_: _M_ → _N_ be smooth, and let _ω_ be a smooth _k_-form on _N_. Then there is a differential form _f_∗_ω_ on _M_, called the **pullback** of _ω_, which captures the behavior of _ω_ as seen relative to _f_. To define the pullback, fix a point _p_ of _M_ and tangent vectors _v_ 1, ..., _v_ _k_ to _M_ at _p_. The pullback of _ω_ is defined by the formula ![Image 78: {\displaystyle (f^{*}\omega )_{p}(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{k})=\omega _{f(p)}(f_{*}v_{1},\ldots ,f_{*}v_{k}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6cf28d38d6cec6fcb9916b65efe7435ceb359754)

There are several more abstract ways to view this definition. If _ω_ is a 1-form on _N_, then it may be viewed as a section of the cotangent bundle _T_∗_N_ of _N_. Using ∗ to denote a dual map, the dual to the differential of _f_ is (_df_)∗: _T_∗_N_ → _T_∗_M_. The pullback of _ω_ may be defined to be the composite ![Image 79: {\displaystyle M\ {\stackrel {f}{\to }}\ N\ {\stackrel {\omega }{\to }}\ T^{*}N\ {\stackrel {(df)^{*}}{\longrightarrow }}\ T^{*}M.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f908d3dc04751cee07ca6cd1fbb8c0a23db4c66) This is a section of the cotangent bundle of _M_ and hence a differential 1-form on _M_. In full generality, let ![Image 80: {\textstyle \bigwedge ^{k}(df)^{*}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4433bb78dabfd29e79d715d6707ae68c4f11a0b8) denote the _k_ th exterior power of the dual map to the differential. Then the pullback of a _k_-form _ω_ is the composite ![Image 81: {\displaystyle M\ {\stackrel {f}{\to }}\ N\ {\stackrel {\omega }{\to }}\ {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}T^{*}N\ {\stackrel {{\bigwedge }^{k}(df)^{*}}{\longrightarrow }}\ {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}T^{*}M.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e0478733a69d46c69ce13ac590eb15bd3e4ed35e)

Another abstract way to view the pullback comes from viewing a _k_-form _ω_ as a linear functional on tangent spaces. From this point of view, _ω_ is a morphism of [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle")![Image 82: {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}TN\ {\stackrel {\omega }{\to }}\ N\times \mathbf {R} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97303ff95a376eeaecd80022ab7a82195be1ff15) where _N_ × **R** is the trivial rank one bundle on _N_. The composite map ![Image 83: {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}TM\ {\stackrel {{\bigwedge }^{k}df}{\longrightarrow }}\ {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}TN\ {\stackrel {\omega }{\to }}\ N\times \mathbf {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b6dba872c8d2ca87d10c0be21f5a2452a9627eb) defines a linear functional on each tangent space of _M_, and therefore it factors through the trivial bundle _M_ × **R**. The vector bundle morphism ![Image 84: {\textstyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}TM\to M\times \mathbf {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d8cdf3faf24dbd8ae93a7865be9a22c06d95f534) defined in this way is _f_∗_ω_.

Pullback respects all of the basic operations on forms. If _ω_ and _η_ are forms and _c_ is a real number, then ![Image 85: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f^{*}(c\omega )&=c(f^{*}\omega ),\\f^{*}(\omega +\eta )&=f^{*}\omega +f^{*}\eta ,\\f^{*}(\omega \wedge \eta )&=f^{*}\omega \wedge f^{*}\eta ,\\f^{*}(d\omega )&=d(f^{*}\omega ).\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec885091abaf1eb731bb87e67f138adff71e6676)

The pullback of a form can also be written in coordinates. Assume that _x_ 1, ..., _x_ _m_ are coordinates on _M_, that _y_ 1, ..., _y_ _n_ are coordinates on _N_, and that these coordinate systems are related by the formulas _y_ _i_ = _f_ _i_(_x_ 1, ..., _x_ _m_) for all _i_. Locally on _N_, _ω_ can be written as ![Image 86: {\displaystyle \omega =\sum _{i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}}\omega _{i_{1}\cdots i_{k}}\,dy^{i_{1}}\wedge \cdots \wedge dy^{i_{k}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e99161659367c4ce201c7417c25f06f1d33d87e2) where, for each choice of _i_ 1, ..., _i_ _k_, _ω_ _i_ 1⋅⋅⋅_i_ _k_ is a real-valued function of _y_ 1, ..., _y_ _n_. Using the linearity of pullback and its compatibility with exterior product, the pullback of _ω_ has the formula ![Image 87: {\displaystyle f^{*}\omega =\sum _{i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}}(\omega _{i_{1}\cdots i_{k}}\circ f)\,df_{i_{1}}\wedge \cdots \wedge df_{i_{k}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/83acbb0138869851c2549cce3bbbdcc5dfd71e98)

Each exterior derivative _df_ _i_ can be expanded in terms of _dx_ 1, ..., _dx_ _m_. The resulting _k_-form can be written using [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant "Jacobian matrix and determinant") matrices: ![Image 88: {\displaystyle f^{*}\omega =\sum _{i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}}\sum _{j_{1}<\cdots <j_{k}}(\omega _{i_{1}\cdots i_{k}}\circ f){\frac {\partial (f_{i_{1}},\ldots ,f_{i_{k}})}{\partial (x^{j_{1}},\ldots ,x^{j_{k}})}}\,dx^{j_{1}}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{j_{k}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3dcacea72b68e686df76df13540e74131b6d491a)

Here, ![Image 89: {\textstyle {\frac {\partial (f_{i_{1}},\ldots ,f_{i_{k}})}{\partial (x^{j_{1}},\ldots ,x^{j_{k}})}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74924dabd955bc36b5a11a8f11d7c4f894d9c9e5) denotes the determinant of the matrix whose entries are ![Image 90: {\textstyle {\frac {\partial f_{i_{m}}}{\partial x^{j_{n}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef2ccbf9e1b6fa3e8410cbd4baca8cfe896acaf7), ![Image 91: {\displaystyle 1\leq m,n\leq k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59174e4c31372263dfde35534c3ad664365666ec).

A differential _k_-form can be integrated over an oriented _k_-dimensional manifold. When the _k_-form is defined on an _n_-dimensional manifold with _n_>_k_, then the _k_-form can be integrated over oriented _k_-dimensional submanifolds. If _k_ = 0, integration over oriented 0-dimensional submanifolds is just the summation of the integrand evaluated at points, according to the orientation of those points. Other values of _k_ = 1, 2, 3, ... correspond to line integrals, surface integrals, volume integrals, and so on. There are several equivalent ways to formally define the integral of a differential form, all of which depend on reducing to the case of Euclidean space.

### Integration on Euclidean space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Integration on Euclidean space")]

Let _U_ be an open subset of **R**_n_. Give **R**_n_ its standard orientation and _U_ the restriction of that orientation. Every smooth _n_-form _ω_ on _U_ has the form ![Image 92: {\displaystyle \omega =f(x)\,dx^{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b184cf564269eb1fb65b9ae639be4961328608a2) for some smooth function _f_: **R**_n_ → **R**. Such a function has an integral in the usual Riemann or Lebesgue sense. This allows us to define the integral of _ω_ to be the integral of _f_: ![Image 93: {\displaystyle \int _{U}\omega \ {\stackrel {\text{def}}{=}}\int _{U}f(x)\,dx^{1}\cdots dx^{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a96708ff183338b6b7eabb7c09ff6ef0ca1a5c50) Fixing an orientation is necessary for this to be well-defined. The skew-symmetry of differential forms means that the integral of, say, _dx_ 1 ∧ _dx_ 2 must be the negative of the integral of _dx_ 2 ∧ _dx_ 1. Riemann and Lebesgue integrals cannot see this dependence on the ordering of the coordinates, so they leave the sign of the integral undetermined. The orientation resolves this ambiguity.

### Integration over chains

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Integration over chains")]

Let _M_ be an _n_-manifold and _ω_ an _n_-form on _M_. First, assume that there is a parametrization of _M_ by an open subset of Euclidean space. That is, assume that there exists a diffeomorphism ![Image 94: {\displaystyle \varphi \colon D\to M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef380f8a39f96f217d37d90546daca30b8be31e3) where _D_ ⊆ **R**_n_. Give _M_ the orientation induced by _φ_. Then ([Rudin 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#CITEREFRudin1976)) defines the integral of _ω_ over _M_ to be the integral of _φ_∗_ω_ over _D_. In coordinates, this has the following expression. Fix an embedding of _M_ in **R**_I_ with coordinates _x_ 1, ..., _x_ _I_. Then ![Image 95: {\displaystyle \omega =\sum _{i_{1}<\cdots <i_{n}}a_{i_{1},\ldots ,i_{n}}({\mathbf {x} })\,dx^{i_{1}}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_{n}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1bb35a352bec19f14341b8100b6fdf11d07cf051) Suppose that _φ_ is defined by ![Image 96: {\displaystyle \varphi ({\mathbf {u} })=(x^{1}({\mathbf {u} }),\ldots ,x^{I}({\mathbf {u} })).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb64f82b6901794ee167d71d7be31dd7ecf5d93) Then the integral may be written in coordinates as ![Image 97: {\displaystyle \int _{M}\omega =\int _{D}\sum _{i_{1}<\cdots <i_{n}}a_{i_{1},\ldots ,i_{n}}(\varphi ({\mathbf {u} })){\frac {\partial (x^{i_{1}},\ldots ,x^{i_{n}})}{\partial (u^{1},\dots ,u^{n})}}\,du^{1}\cdots du^{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b89e7893f7df02c405aaf31e10cffa8658ecc06a) where ![Image 98: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial (x^{i_{1}},\ldots ,x^{i_{n}})}{\partial (u^{1},\ldots ,u^{n})}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0e4ce3afe8ab62c2889014c38e7aebc661b7c880) is the determinant of the [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant "Jacobian matrix and determinant"). The Jacobian exists because _φ_ is differentiable.

In general, an _n_-manifold cannot be parametrized by an open subset of **R**_n_. But such a parametrization is always possible locally, so it is possible to define integrals over arbitrary manifolds by defining them as sums of integrals over collections of local parametrizations. Moreover, it is also possible to define parametrizations of _k_-dimensional subsets for _k_<_n_, and this makes it possible to define integrals of _k_-forms. To make this precise, it is convenient to fix a standard domain _D_ in **R**_k_, usually a cube or a simplex. A _k_-**chain** is a formal sum of smooth embeddings _D_ → _M_. That is, it is a collection of smooth embeddings, each of which is assigned an integer multiplicity. Each smooth embedding determines a _k_-dimensional submanifold of _M_. If the chain is ![Image 99: {\displaystyle c=\sum _{i=1}^{r}m_{i}\varphi _{i},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8dad7b70eb8df5f2ad4f5fa2c732c2a80fb7b4ff) then the integral of a _k_-form _ω_ over _c_ is defined to be the sum of the integrals over the terms of _c_: ![Image 100: {\displaystyle \int _{c}\omega =\sum _{i=1}^{r}m_{i}\int _{D}\varphi _{i}^{*}\omega .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a891894a09dcc5a6b037f48f06678c6c5a473562)

This approach to defining integration does not assign a direct meaning to integration over the whole manifold _M_. However, it is still possible to assign such a meaning indirectly because every smooth manifold may be smoothly [triangulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(topology) "Triangulation (topology)") in an essentially unique way, and the integral over _M_ may be defined to be the integral over the chain determined by a triangulation.

### Integration using partitions of unity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Integration using partitions of unity")]

There is another approach, expounded in ([Dieudonné 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#CITEREFDieudonn%C3%A91972)), which does directly assign a meaning to integration over _M_, but this approach requires fixing an orientation of _M_. The integral of an _n_-form _ω_ on an _n_-dimensional manifold is defined by working in charts. Suppose first that _ω_ is supported on a single positively oriented chart. On this chart, it may be pulled back to an _n_-form on an open subset of **R**_n_. Here, the form has a well-defined Riemann or Lebesgue integral as before. The change of variables formula and the assumption that the chart is positively oriented together ensure that the integral of _ω_ is independent of the chosen chart. In the general case, use a partition of unity to write _ω_ as a sum of _n_-forms, each of which is supported in a single positively oriented chart, and define the integral of _ω_ to be the sum of the integrals of each term in the partition of unity.

It is also possible to integrate _k_-forms on oriented _k_-dimensional submanifolds using this more intrinsic approach. The form is pulled back to the submanifold, where the integral is defined using charts as before. For example, given a path _γ_(_t_): [0, 1] → **R**2, integrating a 1-form on the path is simply pulling back the form to a form _f_(_t_)_dt_ on [0, 1], and this integral is the integral of the function _f_(_t_) on the interval.

### Integration along fibers

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Integration along fibers")]

[Fubini's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubini%27s_theorem "Fubini's theorem") states that the integral over a set that is a product may be computed as an iterated integral over the two factors in the product. This suggests that the integral of a differential form over a product ought to be computable as an iterated integral as well. The geometric flexibility of differential forms ensures that this is possible not just for products, but in more general situations as well. Under some hypotheses, it is possible to integrate along the fibers of a smooth map, and the analog of Fubini's theorem is the case where this map is the projection from a product to one of its factors.

Because integrating a differential form over a submanifold requires fixing an orientation, a prerequisite to integration along fibers is the existence of a well-defined orientation on those fibers. Let _M_ and _N_ be two orientable manifolds of pure dimensions _m_ and _n_, respectively. Suppose that _f_: _M_ → _N_ is a surjective submersion. This implies that each fiber _f_−1(_y_) is (_m_ − _n_)-dimensional and that, around each point of _M_, there is a chart on which _f_ looks like the projection from a product onto one of its factors. Fix _x_ ∈ _M_ and set _y_ = _f_(_x_). Suppose that ![Image 101: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega _{x}&\in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{m}T_{x}^{*}M,\\[2pt]\eta _{y}&\in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{n}T_{y}^{*}N,\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a40efed30d826f9560a401f3d46398c751aabf03) and that _η_ _y_ does not vanish. Following ([Dieudonné 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#CITEREFDieudonn%C3%A91972)), there is a unique ![Image 102: {\displaystyle \sigma _{x}\in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{m-n}T_{x}^{*}(f^{-1}(y))}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8d9a726da6d6fe18e549c89ee39ce636f8176154) which may be thought of as the fibral part of _ω_ _x_ with respect to _η_ _y_. More precisely, define _j_: _f_−1(_y_) → _M_ to be the inclusion. Then _σ_ _x_ is defined by the property that ![Image 103: {\displaystyle \omega _{x}=(f^{*}\eta _{y})_{x}\wedge \sigma '_{x}\in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{m}T_{x}^{*}M,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6ffa9a1dc0c5d09bc8ec91c6e2b778279b8a44d3) where ![Image 104: {\displaystyle \sigma '_{x}\in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{m-n}T_{x}^{*}M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab4c77882c126eac2da5212677d9153bc26639cc) is any (_m_ − _n_)-covector for which ![Image 105: {\displaystyle \sigma _{x}=j^{*}\sigma '_{x}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/883569585dd8ec22863ee0bd69df18bbab06e016) The form _σ_ _x_ may also be notated _ω_ _x_ / _η_ _y_.

Moreover, for fixed _y_, _σ_ _x_ varies smoothly with respect to _x_. That is, suppose that ![Image 106: {\displaystyle \omega \colon f^{-1}(y)\to T^{*}M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6af0b4055031723afd2d066e5b1f6795fe0d95e1) is a smooth section of the projection map; we say that _ω_ is a smooth differential _m_-form on _M_ along _f_−1(_y_). Then there is a smooth differential (_m_ − _n_)-form _σ_ on _f_−1(_y_) such that, at each _x_ ∈ _f_−1(_y_), ![Image 107: {\displaystyle \sigma _{x}=\omega _{x}/\eta _{y}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c12f91a8d44fbb7ccb2415851f45432aa799f523) This form is denoted _ω_ / _η_ _y_. The same construction works if _ω_ is an _m_-form in a neighborhood of the fiber, and the same notation is used. A consequence is that each fiber _f_−1(_y_) is orientable. In particular, a choice of orientation forms on _M_ and _N_ defines an orientation of every fiber of _f_.

The analog of Fubini's theorem is as follows. As before, _M_ and _N_ are two orientable manifolds of pure dimensions _m_ and _n_, and _f_: _M_ → _N_ is a surjective submersion. Fix orientations of _M_ and _N_, and give each fiber of _f_ the induced orientation. Let _ω_ be an _m_-form on _M_, and let _η_ be an _n_-form on _N_ that is almost everywhere positive with respect to the orientation of _N_. Then, for almost every _y_ ∈ _N_, the form _ω_ / _η_ _y_ is a well-defined integrable _m_ − _n_ form on _f_−1(_y_). Moreover, there is an integrable _n_-form on _N_ defined by ![Image 108: {\displaystyle y\mapsto {\bigg (}\int _{f^{-1}(y)}\omega /\eta _{y}{\bigg )}\,\eta _{y}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7247d0883e04e85ae30c5e797168913173c0251c) Denote this form by ![Image 109: {\displaystyle {\bigg (}\int _{f^{-1}(y)}\omega /\eta {\bigg )}\,\eta .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f34f74b45503b77f471339833999d914220e428) Then ([Dieudonné 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#CITEREFDieudonn%C3%A91972)) proves the generalized Fubini formula ![Image 110: {\displaystyle \int _{M}\omega =\int _{N}{\bigg (}\int _{f^{-1}(y)}\omega /\eta {\bigg )}\,\eta .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/75d61c0bd0d63bc4a58a37c07cf5a37644e8f111)

It is also possible to integrate forms of other degrees along the fibers of a submersion. Assume the same hypotheses as before, and let _α_ be a compactly supported (_m_ − _n_ + _k_)-form on _M_. Then there is a _k_-form _γ_ on _N_ which is the result of integrating _α_ along the fibers of _f_. The form _α_ is defined by specifying, at each _y_ ∈ _N_, how _γ_ pairs with each _k_-vector **v** at _y_, and the value of that pairing is an integral over _f_−1(_y_) that depends only on _α_, **v**, and the orientations of _M_ and _N_. More precisely, at each _y_ ∈ _N_, there is an isomorphism ![Image 111: {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}T_{y}N\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{n-k}T_{y}^{*}N}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a671aea6f2940650f9965dc2095ae97cfe536e16) defined by the interior product ![Image 112: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} \mapsto \mathbf {v} \,\lrcorner \,\zeta _{y},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ae32d81c58eca6f7f828641609d5d9fbf5572ccf) for any choice of volume form _ζ_ in the orientation of _N_. If _x_ ∈ _f_−1(_y_), then a _k_-vector **v** at _y_ determines an (_n_ − _k_)-covector at _x_ by pullback: ![Image 113: {\displaystyle f^{*}(\mathbf {v} \,\lrcorner \,\zeta _{y})\in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{n-k}T_{x}^{*}M.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/61d486403fe38f6ae083035a299126e6cec86803) Each of these covectors has an exterior product against _α_, so there is an (_m_ − _n_)-form _β_**v** on _M_ along _f_−1(_y_) defined by ![Image 114: {\displaystyle (\beta _{\mathbf {v} })_{x}=\left(\alpha _{x}\wedge f^{*}(\mathbf {v} \,\lrcorner \,\zeta _{y})\right){\big /}\zeta _{y}\in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{m-n}T_{x}^{*}M.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca5341ffa14cab2dc8c1a91d96d8c8c96e71c40e) This form depends on the orientation of _N_ but not the choice of _ζ_. Then the _k_-form _γ_ is uniquely defined by the property ![Image 115: {\displaystyle \langle \gamma _{y},\mathbf {v} \rangle =\int _{f^{-1}(y)}\beta _{\mathbf {v} },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/df2366a985b4c1547a632b346217b1397e85822e) and _γ_ is smooth ([Dieudonné 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#CITEREFDieudonn%C3%A91972)). This form also denoted _α_♭ and called the **integral of _α_ along the fibers of _f_**. Integration along fibers is important for the construction of Gysin maps in de Rham cohomology.

Integration along fibers satisfies the **projection formula** ([Dieudonné 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#CITEREFDieudonn%C3%A91972)). If _λ_ is any _ℓ_-form on _N_, then ![Image 116: {\displaystyle \alpha ^{\flat }\wedge \lambda =(\alpha \wedge f^{*}\lambda )^{\flat }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4803e954aed2442ef1d95cbb742b1476abb69a9)

The fundamental relationship between the exterior derivative and integration is given by the [Stokes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem "Stokes' theorem"): If _ω_ is an (_n_ − 1)-form with compact support on _M_ and _∂M_ denotes the [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#Manifold_with_boundary "Manifold") of _M_ with its induced [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(mathematics) "Orientation (mathematics)"), then ![Image 117: {\displaystyle \int _{M}d\omega =\int _{\partial M}\omega .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/307e671f2b4e1a6d46dffed122e05bb90316ba2a)

A key consequence of this is that "the integral of a closed form over homologous chains is equal": If _ω_ is a closed _k_-form and _M_ and _N_ are _k_-chains that are homologous (such that _M_ − _N_ is the boundary of a (_k_ + 1)-chain _W_), then ![Image 118: {\displaystyle \textstyle {\int _{M}\omega =\int _{N}\omega }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/928684b8d81d26cdb4c283cf58388c9b560c2d82), since the difference is the integral ![Image 119: {\displaystyle \textstyle \int _{W}d\omega =\int _{W}0=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/414259701903c92b05693b056255f236910be584).

For example, if _ω_ = _df_ is the derivative of a potential function on the plane or **R**_n_, then the integral of _ω_ over a path from _a_ to _b_ does not depend on the choice of path (the integral is _f_(_b_) − _f_(_a_)), since different paths with given endpoints are [homotopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopic "Homotopic"), hence homologous (a weaker condition). This case is called the [gradient theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_theorem "Gradient theorem"), and generalizes the [fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus "Fundamental theorem of calculus"). This path independence is very useful in [contour integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_integration "Contour integration").

This theorem also underlies the duality between [de Rham cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_cohomology "De Rham cohomology") and the [homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(mathematics) "Homology (mathematics)") of chains.

### Relation with measures

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Relation with measures")]

On a _general_ differentiable manifold (without additional structure), differential forms _cannot_ be integrated over subsets of the manifold; this distinction is key to the distinction between differential forms, which are integrated over chains or oriented submanifolds, and measures, which are integrated over subsets. The simplest example is attempting to integrate the 1-form _dx_ over the interval [0, 1]. Assuming the usual distance (and thus measure) on the real line, this integral is either 1 or −1, depending on _orientation_: ![Image 120: {\textstyle \int _{0}^{1}dx=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49b7a9a86a445c319f58b1a070dcaffc7cb46a03), while ![Image 121: {\textstyle \int _{1}^{0}dx=-\int _{0}^{1}dx=-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ced5c2896ec3d0a4f9485762885bb8dccd25956). By contrast, the integral of the _measure_|_dx_| on the interval is unambiguously 1 (i.e. the integral of the constant function 1 with respect to this measure is 1). Similarly, under a change of coordinates a differential _n_-form changes by the [Jacobian determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_determinant "Jacobian determinant")_J_, while a measure changes by the _absolute value_ of the Jacobian determinant, |_J_|, which further reflects the issue of orientation. For example, under the map _x_ ↦ −_x_ on the line, the differential form _dx_ pulls back to −_dx_; orientation has reversed; while the [Lebesgue measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure "Lebesgue measure"), which here we denote |_dx_|, pulls back to |_dx_|; it does not change.

In the presence of the additional data of an _orientation_, it is possible to integrate _n_-forms (top-dimensional forms) over the entire manifold or over compact subsets; integration over the entire manifold corresponds to integrating the form over the [fundamental class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_class "Fundamental class") of the manifold, [_M_]. Formally, in the presence of an orientation, one may identify _n_-forms with [densities on a manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Densities_on_a_manifold "Densities on a manifold"); densities in turn define a measure, and thus can be integrated ([Folland 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#CITEREFFolland1999), Section 11.4, pp.361–362).

On an orientable but not oriented manifold, there are two choices of orientation; either choice allows one to integrate _n_-forms over compact subsets, with the two choices differing by a sign. On a non-orientable manifold, _n_-forms and densities cannot be identified —notably, any top-dimensional form must vanish somewhere (there are no [volume forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_form "Volume form") on non-orientable manifolds), but there are nowhere-vanishing densities— thus while one can integrate densities over compact subsets, one cannot integrate _n_-forms. One can instead identify densities with top-dimensional [pseudoforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_form#Relation_to_measures "Volume form").

Even in the presence of an orientation, there is in general no meaningful way to integrate _k_-forms over subsets for _k_<_n_ because there is no consistent way to use the ambient orientation to orient _k_-dimensional subsets. Geometrically, a _k_-dimensional subset can be turned around in place, yielding the same subset with the opposite orientation; for example, the horizontal axis in a plane can be rotated by 180 degrees. Compare the [Gram determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_determinant "Gram determinant") of a set of _k_ vectors in an _n_-dimensional space, which, unlike the determinant of _n_ vectors, is always positive, corresponding to a squared number. An orientation of a _k_-submanifold is therefore extra data not derivable from the ambient manifold.

On a Riemannian manifold, one may define a _k_-dimensional [Hausdorff measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_measure "Hausdorff measure") for any _k_ (integer or real), which may be integrated over _k_-dimensional subsets of the manifold. A function times this Hausdorff measure can then be integrated over _k_-dimensional subsets, providing a measure-theoretic analog to integration of _k_-forms. The _n_-dimensional Hausdorff measure yields a density, as above.

The differential form analog of a [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics) "Distribution (mathematics)") or generalized function is called a **[current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_(mathematics) "Current (mathematics)")**. The space of _k_-currents on _M_ is the dual space to an appropriate space of differential _k_-forms. Currents play the role of generalized domains of integration, similar to but even more flexible than chains.

Applications in physics
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Applications in physics")]

Differential forms arise in some important physical contexts. For example, in Maxwell's theory of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), the **Faraday 2-form**, or [electromagnetic field strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field_strength "Electromagnetic field strength"), is ![Image 122: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {1}{2}}f_{ab}\,dx^{a}\wedge dx^{b}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f25d1675fbc73fd09d92806a7d68bf651973a0a) where the _f_ _ab_ are formed from the electromagnetic fields ![Image 123: {\displaystyle {\vec {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2bc18ae485a72f148e85ccbeff2b3dcdd4f5f3f7) and ![Image 124: {\displaystyle {\vec {B}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/83ae7d80cab55b606de217162280b2279142bbb4); e.g., _f_ 12 = _E_ _z_/_c_, _f_ 23 = −_B_ _z_, or equivalent definitions.

This form is a special case of the [curvature form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature_form "Curvature form") on the [U(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U(1) "U(1)")[principal bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_bundle "Principal bundle") on which both electromagnetism and general [gauge theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theories "Gauge theories") may be described. The [connection form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_form "Connection form") for the principal bundle is the vector potential, typically denoted by **A**, when represented in some gauge. One then has ![Image 125: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =d\mathbf {A} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/be79ec07ba4d9eea0a620dc7a31ceca107433bbc)

The **current 3-form** is ![Image 126: {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} ={\frac {1}{6}}j^{a}\,\varepsilon _{abcd}\,dx^{b}\wedge dx^{c}\wedge dx^{d}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/57022244da5e9bfb21dbe6b1878f27113a844b23) where _j_ _a_ are the four components of the current density. (Here it is a matter of convention to write _F_ _ab_ instead of _f_ _ab_, i.e. to use capital letters, and to write _J_ _a_ instead of _j_ _a_. However, the vector rsp. tensor components and the above-mentioned forms have different physical dimensions. Moreover, by decision of an international commission of the [International Union of Pure and Applied Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Physics "International Union of Pure and Applied Physics"), the magnetic polarization vector has been called ![Image 127: {\displaystyle {\vec {J}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f64ab02528d2b80e1df79bc2a8762489a986afa8) for several decades, and by some publishers **J**; i.e., the same name is used for different quantities.)

Using the above-mentioned definitions, [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") can be written very compactly in [geometrized units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrized_units "Geometrized units") as ![Image 128: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}d{\mathbf {F} }&=\mathbf {0} \\d{\star \mathbf {F} }&=\mathbf {J} ,\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1fb174f0151b8d78258b51b35b3e84bddb690d27) where ![Image 129: {\displaystyle \star }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd316a21eeb5079a850f223b1d096a06bfa788c0) denotes the [Hodge star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_star "Hodge star") operator. Similar considerations describe the geometry of gauge theories in general.

The 2-form ![Image 130: {\displaystyle {\star }\mathbf {F} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b9e4891297b68a5ff7b039ce33e4ff5c7f14c76e), which is [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(mathematics) "Duality (mathematics)") to the Faraday form, is also called **Maxwell 2-form**.

Electromagnetism is an example of a [U(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U(1) "U(1)")[gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory"). Here the [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") is U(1), the one-dimensional [unitary group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_group "Unitary group"), which is in particular [abelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group "Abelian group"). There are gauge theories, such as [Yang–Mills theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory "Yang–Mills theory"), in which the Lie group is not abelian. In that case, one gets relations which are similar to those described here. The analog of the field **F** in such theories is the curvature form of the connection, which is represented in a gauge by a [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra")-valued one-form **A**. The Yang–Mills field **F** is then defined by ![Image 131: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =d\mathbf {A} +\mathbf {A} \wedge \mathbf {A} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/14a0a39307e25aca9a9f8d7e168b86e04a733363)

In the abelian case, such as electromagnetism, **A** ∧ **A** = 0, but this does not hold in general. Likewise the field equations are modified by additional terms involving exterior products of **A** and **F**, owing to the [structure equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurer%E2%80%93Cartan_form "Maurer–Cartan form") of the gauge group.

Applications in geometric measure theory
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_form&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Applications in geometric measure theory")]

Numerous minimality results for complex analytic manifolds are based on the [Wirtinger inequality for 2-forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtinger_inequality_(2-forms) "Wirtinger inequality (2-forms)"). A succinct proof may be found in [Herbert Federer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Federer "Herbert Federer")'s classic text _Geometric Measure Theory_. The Wirtinger inequality is also a key ingredient in [Gromov's inequality for complex projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gromov%27s_inequality_for_complex_projective_space "Gromov's inequality for complex projective space") in [systolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_geometry "Systolic geometry").
