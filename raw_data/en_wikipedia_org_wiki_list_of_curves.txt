Mathematics (Geometry) [ edit ] Algebraic curves [ edit ] Rational curves [ edit ] Rational curves are subdivided according to the degree of the polynomial.

Degree 1 [ edit ] Line Degree 2 [ edit ] Plane curves of degree 2 are known as conics or conic sections and include Circle Unit circle Ellipse Parabola Hyperbola Unit hyperbola Degree 3 [ edit ] Cubic plane curves include Cubic parabola Folium of Descartes Cissoid of Diocles Conchoid of de Sluze Right strophoid Semicubical parabola Serpentine curve Trident curve Trisectrix of Maclaurin Tschirnhausen cubic Witch of Agnesi Degree 4 [ edit ] Quartic plane curves include Ampersand curve Bean curve Bicorn Bow curve Bullet-nose curve Cartesian oval Conchoid of Dürer Cruciform curve Deltoid curve Devil's curve Hippopede Kampyle of Eudoxus Kappa curve Lemniscate Lemniscate of Booth Lemniscate of Gerono Lemniscate of Bernoulli Limaçon Cardioid Limaçon trisectrix Ovals of Cassini Squircle Three-leaved clover Degree 5 [ edit ] Degree 6 [ edit ] Astroid Atriphtaloid Nephroid Quadrifolium Curve families of variable degree [ edit ] Epicycloid Epispiral Epitrochoid Hypocycloid Hypotrochoid Lissajous curve Poinsot's spirals Rational normal curve Rose curve Curves with genus 1 [ edit ] Bicuspid curve Cassinoide Cubic curve Elliptic curve Watt's curve Curves with genus > 1 [ edit ] Bolza surface (genus 2) Klein quartic (genus 3) Bring's curve (genus 4) Macbeath surface (genus 7) Butterfly curve (algebraic) (genus 7) Curve families with variable genus [ edit ] Polynomial lemniscate Fermat curve Sinusoidal spiral Superellipse Hurwitz surface Elkies trinomial curves Hyperelliptic curve Classical modular curve Cassini oval Transcendental curves [ edit ] Bowditch curve Brachistochrone Butterfly curve (transcendental) Catenary Clélies Cochleoid Cycloid Horopter Isochrone Isochrone of Huygens ( Tautochrone ) Isochrone of Leibniz [1] Isochrone of Varignon [2] Lamé curve Pursuit curve Rhumb line Sinusoid Spirals Archimedean spiral Cornu spiral Cotes' spiral Fermat's spiral Galileo's spiral [3] Hyperbolic spiral Lituus Logarithmic spiral Nielsen's spiral Syntractrix Tractrix Trochoid Piecewise constructions [ edit ] Bézier curve Loess curve Lowess Ogee Polygonal curve Maurer rose Reuleaux triangle Stadium Splines B-spline Nonuniform rational B-spline Fractal curves [ edit ] Blancmange curve De Rham curve Dragon curve Koch curve Lévy C curve Sierpiński curve Space-filling curve ( Peano curve ) See also List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension .
