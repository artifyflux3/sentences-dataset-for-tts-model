[ 1 ] Nature of geography [ edit ] Geography as [ edit ] an academic discipline – a body of knowledge given to − or received by − a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialize in. Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks to understand the Earth and its human and natural complexities − not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called 'the world discipline'.

[ 2 ] a field of science – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. This field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer-reviewed research is published. There are many geography-related scientific journals.

a natural science – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of the natural environment (physical geography).

a social science – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society (human geography).

an interdisciplinary field – a field that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions have emerged. Many of the branches of physical geography are also branches of Earth science Branches of geography [ edit ] As "the bridge between the human and physical sciences," geography is divided into two main branches: human geography physical geography [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Other branches include: integrated geography technical geography regional geography Physical geography [ edit ] Physical geography – examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation and life, soil, water, and landforms are produced and interact.

[ 5 ] Fields of physical geography [ edit ] Geomorphology – study of landforms and the processes that them, and more broadly, of the processes controlling the topography of any planet. It seeks to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics, and to predict future changes through field observation, physical experiments, and numerical modeling.

Hydrology – study water movement, distribution, and quality throughout the Earth, including the hydrologic cycle, water resources, and environmental watershed sustainability.

Glaciology – study of glaciers, or more generally ice and natural phenomena that involve ice.

Oceanography – studies a wide range of topics about oceans, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries.

Biogeography – study of species distribution spatially and temporally. Over areal ecological changes, it is also tied to the concepts of species and their past, or present living ' refugium ', their survival locales, or their interim living sites. It aims to reveal where organisms live and at what abundance.

[ 6 ] Climatology – study of climate , scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of time .

[ 7 ] Meteorology is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and short-term forecasting (in contrast with climatology).

Pedology – study of soils in their natural environment [ 8 ] that deals with pedogenesis , soil morphology , and soil classification .

Palaeogeography – study of what geography was in times past, most often concerning the physical landscape and the human or cultural environment.

Coastal geography – study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e., coastal geomorphology, geology, and oceanography) and the human geography (sociology and history) of the coast. It involves understanding coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement, and weather, as well as how humans interact with the coast.

Quaternary science – focuses on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years, including the last ice age and the Holocene period.

Landscape ecology – the relationship between spatial patterns of urban development and ecological processes on many landscape scales and organizational levels.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Approaches of physical geography [ edit ] Quantitative geography – Quantitative research tools and methods applied to geography. See also the quantitative revolution .

Systems approach – Human geography [ edit ] Human geography – one of the two main subfields of geography is the study of human use and understanding of the world and the processes that have affected it. Human geography broadly differs from physical geography in that it focuses on the built environment and how space is created, viewed, and managed by humans, as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy.

[ 5 ] Fields of human geography [ edit ] Cultural geography – study of cultural products and norms and their variations across and relations to spaces and places. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government, and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.

[ 12 ] Children's geographies – study of places and spaces of children's lives, characterized experientially, politically and ethically. Children's geographies rest on the idea that children as a social group share certain characteristics that are experientially, politically, and ethically significant and worthy of study. The pluralization in the title is intended to imply that children's lives will be markedly different in differing times and places and in differing circumstances such as gender, family, and class. The range of foci within children's geographies includes: Children and the city Children and the countryside Children and technology Children and nature, Children and globalization Methodologies of researching children's worlds Ethics of researching children's worlds Otherness of childhood Animal geographies – studies the spaces and places occupied by animals in human culture because social life and space are heavily populated by animals of many different kinds and in many differing ways (e.g., farm animals, pets, wild animals in the city). Another impetus that has influenced the development of the field is ecofeminist and other environmentalist viewpoints on nature-society relations (including questions of animal welfare and rights).

Language geography – studies the geographic distribution of language or its constituent elements. There are two principal fields of study within the geography of language: Geography of languages – deals with the distribution through history and space of languages, [ 13 ] Linguistic geography – deals with regional linguistic variations within languages.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Sexuality and space – encompasses all relationships and interactions between human sexuality, space, and place, including the geographies of LGBT residence, public sex environments, sites of queer resistance, global sexualities, sex tourism, [ 19 ] the geographies of prostitution and adult entertainment, use of sexualised locations in the arts, [ 20 ] [ 21 ] and sexual citizenship.

[ 22 ] Religion geography – study of the influence of geography, i.e., place and space, on religious belief.

[ 23 ] Development geography – study of the Earth's geography concerning its inhabitants' standard of living and quality of life. Measures development by looking at economic, political, and social factors and seeks to understand both the geographical causes and consequences of varying development, in part by comparing More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs) with Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs).

Economic geography – study of the location, distribution, and spatial organization of economic activities worldwide. Subjects of interest include but are not limited to the location of industries, economies of agglomeration (also known as "linkages"), transportation, international trade and development, real estate, gentrification, ethnic economies, gendered economies, core-periphery theory, the economics of urban form, the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and globalization.

Marketing geography – a discipline within marketing analysis that uses geolocation (geographic information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.

[ 24 ] It can be used in any aspect of the marketing mix – the product, price, promotion, or place (geo-targeting).

Transportation geography – branch of economic geography that investigates spatial interactions between people, freight, and information. It studies humans and their use of vehicles or other modes of traveling and how flows of finished goods and raw materials service markets.

Health geography – application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health care, to provide a spatial understanding of a population's health, the distribution of disease in an area, and the environment's effect on health and disease. It also deals with accessibility to health care and spatial distribution of health care providers.

Time geography – study of the temporal factor on spatial human activities within the following constraints: Authority - limits of accessibility to certain places or domains placed on individuals by owners or authorities Capability - limitations on the movement of individuals based on their nature. For example, movement is restricted by biological factors, such as the need for food, drink, and sleep Coupling - restraint of an individual, anchoring him or her to a location while interacting with other individuals to complete a task Historical geography – the study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and "real" geographies of the past. It seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved by understanding how a place or region changes through time, including how people have interacted with their environment and created the cultural landscape.

Political geography – study of the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and how political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. The inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.

Electoral geography – study of the relationship between election results and the regions they affect (such as the environmental impact of voting decisions), and of the effects of regional factors upon voting behavior.

Geopolitics – analysis of geography, history, and social science concerning spatial politics and patterns at various scales, ranging from the level of the state to international.

Strategic geography – concerned with the control of, or access to, spatial areas that affect the security and prosperity of nations.

Military geography – applying geographic tools, information, and techniques to solve military problems in peacetime or war.

Population geography – study of how spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places.

Tourism geography – study of travel and tourism, as an industry and as a social and cultural activity, and their effect on places, including the environmental impact of tourism , the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism.

Urban geography – the study of urban areas, in terms of concentration, infrastructure, economy, and environmental impacts.

Approaches of human geography [ edit ] Behavioral geography – Approach to human geography that examines human behavior using a disaggregate approach Cognitive geography – Interdisciplinary study of cognitive science and geography Critical geography – Variant of social science that seeks to interpret and change the world Feminist geography – Approach in human geography which applies the theories, methods and critiques of feminism Marxist geography – Strand of critical geography Non-representational theory Postcolonialism – Study of the cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism Post-structuralism – Philosophical school and tradition [ 25 ] – Qualitative geography – qualitative research tools and methods applied to geography.

Integrated geography [ edit ] Integrated geography – branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the dynamics of geology, meteorology, hydrology, biogeography, ecology, and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment.

Technical geography [ edit ] Technical geography – branch of geography and the discipline of studying, developing, and applying methods to gather, store, process, and deliver geographic or spatially referenced information. It is a widespread interdisciplinary field that includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems, photogrammetry, and related forms of earth mapping.

Cyber geography – study of the physical network of broadband cables Fields contributing to technical geography [ edit ] Geomatics – Geographic data discipline Photogrammetry – Taking measurements using photography Cartography – Study and practice of making maps Digital terrain modelling – 3D computer-generated imagery and measurements of terrain Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets Geodesy – Science of measuring the shape, orientation, and gravity of Earth Geographic information system – System to capture, manage, and present geographic data Geospatial – Data and information having an implicit or explicit association with a location Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets Global navigation satellite systems represented by Satellite navigation – Use of satellite signals for navigation or geo-spatial positioning – Any system that uses satellite radio signals to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning Global Positioning System – American satellite-based radio navigation service Hydrography – Measurement of bodies of water Mathematics – Area of knowledge Navigation – Process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle Remote sensing – Obtaining information through non-contact sensors Surveying – Science of determining the positions of points and the distances and angles between them Regional geography [ edit ] Regional geography – study of world regions. Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural elements, human elements, and regionalization which covers the techniques of delineating space into regions. Regional geography breaks down into the study of specific regions.

Region – an area, defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, or functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, such as a country and its political divisions, or as one part of a larger whole, as in a country on a continent.

Continents [ edit ] Continent – one of several large landmasses on Earth . They are generally identified by convention rather than any specific criteria, but seven areas are commonly regarded as continents. They are: 1.

Ecosystems [ edit ] Ecosystem – community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.

Biodiversity hotspot – Biodiverse region under threat Realm – broadest biogeographic division of the Earth's land surface, based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms.

Ecoprovince – biogeographic unit smaller than a realm that contains one or more ecoregions.

Ecoregion – Ecological and geographic area Ecodistrict – Environmental planning Ecosection Ecosite Ecotope – Ecologically distinct landscape feature Ecoelement Biome – Biogeographical unit with a particular biological community Bioregion – Ecology terminology Biotope – Habitat for communities made up of populations of multiple species Bioelement Natural landforms [ edit ] The Ganges river delta in India and Bangladesh is one of the most fertile regions in the world.

The volcano Mount St. Helens in Washington , United States See also: List of landforms Natural landform – terrain or body of water. Landforms are topographical elements, and are defined by their surface form and location in the landscape. Landforms are categorized by traits such as elevation, slope, orientation, stratification , rock exposure, and soil type.

It may be physical and exist in the real world (like a bridge or city), or it may be abstract and exist only on maps (such as the Equator, which has a defined location, but cannot be seen where it lies).

Settlement – Community of any size, in which people live Rural area – Geographic area outside towns and cities Hamlet (place) – Small human settlement in a rural area – rural settlement which is too small to be considered a village. Historically, when a hamlet became large enough to justify building a church, it was then classified as a village. One example of a hamlet is a small cluster of houses surrounding a mill.

Village – Human settlement smaller than a town – clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet with the population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand (sometimes tens of thousands).

Town – Type of human settlement – human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size a settlement must be in order to be called a "town" varies considerably in different parts of the world, so that, for example, many American "small towns" seem to British people to be no more than villages, while many British "small towns" would qualify as cities in the United States.

Urban hierarchy – Rank of cities based on their population – ranks the structure of towns within an area.

1st-order towns – bare minimum of essential services, such as bread and milk.

2nd-order towns 3rd-order towns 4th-order towns City – Large permanent human settlement – relatively large and permanent settlement. In many regions, a city is distinguished from a town by attainment of designation according to law, for instance being required to obtain articles of incorporation or a royal charter.

Financial centre – Locations which are centres of financial activity Primate city – Disproportionately largest city of a country or region – the leading city in its country or region, disproportionately larger than any others in the urban hierarchy.

Metropolis – Large city or conurbation – very large city or urban area which is a significant economic, political and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections and communications.

Metropolitan area – Administrative unit of a dense urban core and its satellite cities – region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.

[ 27 ] Global city – City important to the world economy – city that is deemed to be an important node in the global economic system. Globalization is largely created, facilitated and enacted in strategic geographic locales (including global cities) according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade.

Canal – Artificial channel for water – artificial waterway, often connecting one body of water with another.

Causeway – Route raised up on an embankment Dam – Barrier that stops or restricts the flow of surface or underground streams – structure placed across a flowing body of water to stop the flow, usually to use the water for irrigation or to generate electricity.

The compilation of Edrisi marks an era in the history of science . Not only is its historical information most interesting and valuable, but its descriptions of many parts of the earth are still authoritative. For three centuries geographers copied his maps without alteration. The relative position of the lakes which form the Nile, as delineated in his work, does not differ greatly from that established by Baker and Stanley more than seven hundred years afterwards, and their number is the same.
