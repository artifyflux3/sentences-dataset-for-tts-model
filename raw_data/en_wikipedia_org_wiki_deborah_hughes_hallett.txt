Education and career
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deborah_Hughes_Hallett&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Education and career")]

Hughes Hallett earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge") in 1966, and a master's degree from Harvard in 1976. She worked as a preceptor and senior preceptor at Harvard from 1975 to 1991, as an instructor at the [Middle East Technical University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Technical_University "Middle East Technical University") in [Ankara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara "Ankara"), [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey") from 1981 to 1984, and as a faculty member at Harvard from 1986 to 1998. She served as Professor of the Practice in the Teaching of Mathematics at Harvard from 1991 to 1998. She moved to Arizona in 1998, and took on her adjunct position at the Kennedy School in 2001.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett#cite_note-4)

Work on calculus reform
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deborah_Hughes_Hallett&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Work on calculus reform")]

With [Andrew M. Gleason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_M._Gleason "Andrew M. Gleason") at Harvard she was a founder of the Calculus Consortium, a project for the reform of undergraduate teaching in calculus. Through the consortium, she is an author of a successful and influential sequence of high school and college mathematics textbooks. However, the project has also been criticized for omitting topics such as the mean value theorem,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett#cite_note-5) and for its perceived lack of mathematical rigor.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett#cite_note-8)

Hallett was an [invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_International_Congresses_of_Mathematicians_Plenary_and_Invited_Speakers "List of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers") in 1994.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett#cite_note-9)

Hallett won the [Louise Hay Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Hay_Award "Louise Hay Award") in 1998,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett#cite_note-10) and was named a Fellow of the [American Association for the Advancement of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science "American Association for the Advancement of Science") in 1998.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett#cite_note-11) She is a two-time winner of the ICTCM Award, in 1998 for her internet-based course "Information, Data and Decisions" and in 2000 for "Computer Texts for Business Mathematics".[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett#cite_note-12)

In 2005, she received a [Deborah and Franklin Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_and_Franklin_Haimo_Awards_for_Distinguished_College_or_University_Teaching_of_Mathematics "Deborah and Franklin Haimo Awards for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett#cite_note-web-13)

In October 2021, the [American Mathematical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mathematical_Society "American Mathematical Society") named her as the recipient of the 2022 Award for Impact on the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett#cite_note-14)
