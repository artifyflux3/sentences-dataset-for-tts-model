It is the only program that visited all four outer planets.

A total of nine spacecraft have been launched on missions that involve visits to the outer planets ; all nine missions involve encounters with Jupiter , with four spacecraft also visiting Saturn . One spacecraft, Voyager 2 , also visited Uranus and Neptune . The nine missions include two, Ulysses and New Horizons , whose primary objectives were not outer planets, but which flew past Jupiter to gain gravity assists en route to a polar orbit around the Sun ( Ulysses ), and to Pluto ( New Horizons ). Pluto was considered a planet at the time that New Horizons launched, but was reclassified as a dwarf planet .

Cassini–Huygens also flew past Jupiter for a gravity assist on its mission to explore Saturn.

Only three of the missions to the outer planets have been orbiters: Galileo orbited Jupiter for eight years, while Cassini orbited Saturn for thirteen years.

Juno has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016.

New Horizons , although eventually targeting Pluto, used Jupiter for a gravity assist and had an extensive almost half year observation campaign of Jupiter and its moons (hence it is counted in the eight).
