**Lyman Spitzer Jr.** (June 26, 1914– March 31, 1997)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-FRS_Biographical_Memoir-2) was an American [theoretical physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics"), astronomer and mountaineer. As a scientist, he carried out research into [star formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation "Star formation") and [plasma physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") and in 1946 conceived the idea of [telescopes operating in outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_telescope "Space telescope").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-3) Spitzer invented the [stellarator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellarator "Stellarator") plasma device[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-4) and is the namesake of [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope "Spitzer Space Telescope"). As a mountaineer, he made the first ascent of [Mount Thor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Thor "Mount Thor"), with Donald C. Morton.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-mactutor-5)

Early life and education
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lyman_Spitzer&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and education")]

Spitzer was born to a [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian "Presbyterian") family in Toledo, Ohio, the son of Lyman Spitzer Sr. and Blanche Carey (née Brumback). Through his paternal grandmother, he was related to inventor [Eli Whitney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Whitney "Eli Whitney").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-6) Spitzer graduated from [Scott High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_High_School_(Toledo,_Ohio) "Scott High School (Toledo, Ohio)"). He then attended [Phillips Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_Academy "Phillips Academy") from 1929 to 1931 and went on to [Yale College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_College "Yale College"), where he graduated [Phi Beta Kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa "Phi Beta Kappa") in 1935 and was a member of [Skull and Bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones "Skull and Bones"). During a year of study at [St John's College, Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge "St John's College, Cambridge"), he was influenced by [Arthur Eddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington "Arthur Eddington") and the young [Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar"). Returning to the U.S., Spitzer received his [Ph.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy "Doctor of Philosophy") in physics from [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University") in 1938 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled "The spectra of late [supergiant stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergiant_star "Supergiant star")", under the direction of [Henry Norris Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell "Henry Norris Russell").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-9)

In 1965, Spitzer and Donald Morton became the first to climb [Mount Thor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Thor "Mount Thor") 1,675 m (5,495 ft), located in [Auyuittuq National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auyuittuq_National_Park "Auyuittuq National Park"), on [Baffin Island, Nunavut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baffin_Island,_Nunavut "Baffin Island, Nunavut"), Canada.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-FRS_Biographical_Memoir-2): 347  As a member of the [American Alpine Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Alpine_Club "American Alpine Club"), Spitzer established the "Lyman Spitzer Cutting Edge Climbing Award" (Now called the "Cutting Edge Grant") which gives $12,000 to several mountain climbing expeditions annually.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-10)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Lyman_Spitzer_on_Climbing_Trip.png/250px-Lyman_Spitzer_on_Climbing_Trip.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lyman_Spitzer_on_Climbing_Trip.png)

This image was made in July, 1967 on the Summit Ridge of Mt. Bertram Petrie in British Columbia, Canada by [Charles Robert O'Dell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Robert_O%27Dell "Charles Robert O'Dell") during its first ascent.

Spitzer's brief time as a faculty member at [Yale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University") was interrupted by his wartime work on the development of [sonar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar "Sonar"). In 1947, at the age of 33, he succeeded Russell as director of Princeton University Observatory, an institution that, virtually jointly with his contemporary and friend [Martin Schwarzschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Schwarzschild "Martin Schwarzschild"), he continued to head until 1979.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-11)

Spitzer's research centered on the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium"), to which he brought a deep understanding of [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_plasma "Astrophysical plasma") physics. In the 1930s and 1940s, he was among the first to recognize [star formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation "Star formation") as an ongoing contemporary process. His monographs, "Diffuse Matter in Space" (1968) and "Physical Processes in the Interstellar Medium" (1978) consolidated decades of work, and themselves became the standard texts for some decades more.

Spitzer was the founding director of [Project Matterhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Matterhorn "Project Matterhorn"), Princeton University's pioneering program in controlled thermonuclear research, renamed in 1961 as [Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Plasma_Physics_Laboratory "Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory"). He was an early proponent of space optical astronomy in general, and in particular of the project that became [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope "Hubble Space Telescope").

In 1981, Spitzer became a founding member of the [World Cultural Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cultural_Council "World Cultural Council").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-12)

Spitzer died suddenly on March 31, 1997, after completing a regular day of work at [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer#cite_note-FRS_Biographical_Memoir-2) He was buried at [Princeton Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Cemetery "Princeton Cemetery") and was survived by wife [Doreen Canaday Spitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doreen_Canaday_Spitzer "Doreen Canaday Spitzer") (1914-2010), four children, and ten grandchildren. Among Spitzer's four children is neurobiologist [Nicholas C. Spitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Spitzer "Nicholas Spitzer"), who is currently professor and vice chair in neurobiology at [UC San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego "University of California, San Diego").
