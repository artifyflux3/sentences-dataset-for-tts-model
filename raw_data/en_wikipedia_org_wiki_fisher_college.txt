History [ edit ] Fisher College first opened its doors in 1903, founded by Myron C. Fisher and Edmund H. Fisher under the name Winter Hill Business College in the predominantly working-class city of Somerville, Massachusetts, just two miles north of Boston. The school traces its roots to educational entrepreneurs Myron and Edmund Fisher, who believed the immigrants of that city in the early 1900s should have an opportunity to advance beyond unskilled labor jobs. Fisher College moved to its current Beacon Street location in 1939. The Beacon Street site is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail .

[ 2 ] During the 1940s, the college was split into two separate entities: The Fisher School for Men and The Fisher School for Women.

In 1952, the Board of Regents of Higher Education of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved Fisher as a two-year college, and five years later it was given degree-granting powers. In 1970, Fisher gained accreditation from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and operates as an independent, non-profit educational institution.

The Division of Graduate and Professional Studies was established in 1975 to serve the adult population of Eastern Massachusetts. Fisher College began offering online courses and degrees in 1998. In 1999, the College's first bachelor's degree – the Bachelor of Science in Management – was offered, and in 2015 the College's first master's – a Master of Business Administration with a focus on strategic leadership – was accredited.
