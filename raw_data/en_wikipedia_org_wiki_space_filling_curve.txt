Three iterations of the [Peano curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_curve "Peano curve") construction, whose limit is a space-filling curve.

In [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"), a **space-filling curve** is a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") whose [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_a_function "Range of a function") reaches every point in a higher dimensional region, typically the [unit square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_square "Unit square") (or more generally an _n_-dimensional unit [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube "Hypercube")). Because [Giuseppe Peano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano "Giuseppe Peano") (1858–1932) was the first to discover one, space-filling curves in the [2-dimensional plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") are sometimes called _Peano curves_, but that phrase also refers to the [Peano curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_curve "Peano curve"), the specific example of a space-filling curve found by Peano.

The closely related **FASS curves** (approximately space-Filling, self-Avoiding, Simple, and Self-similar curves) can be thought of as finite approximations of a certain type of space-filling curves.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#cite_note-6)

Intuitively, a curve in two or three (or higher) dimensions can be thought of as the path of a continuously moving point. To eliminate the inherent vagueness of this notion, [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Jordan "Camille Jordan") in 1887 introduced the following rigorous definition, which has since been adopted as the precise description of the notion of a _curve_:

In the most general form, the range of such a function may lie in an arbitrary [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), but in the most commonly studied cases, the range will lie in a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") such as the 2-dimensional plane (a _planar curve_) or the 3-dimensional space (_space curve_).

Sometimes, the curve is identified with the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics)#Image_of_a_function "Image (mathematics)") of the function (the set of all possible values of the function), instead of the function itself. It is also possible to define curves without endpoints to be a continuous function on the [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line") (or on the open unit interval(0, 1)).

In 1890, [Giuseppe Peano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano "Giuseppe Peano") discovered a continuous curve, now called the [Peano curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_curve "Peano curve"), that passes through every point of the unit square.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPeano1890-7) His purpose was to construct a [continuous mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_mapping "Continuous mapping") from the [unit interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_interval "Unit interval") onto the [unit square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_square "Unit square"). Peano was motivated by [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor "Georg Cantor")'s earlier counterintuitive result that the infinite number of points in a unit interval is the same [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality "Cardinality") as the infinite number of points in any finite-dimensional [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), such as the unit square. The problem Peano solved was whether such a mapping could be continuous; i.e., a curve that fills a space. Peano's solution does not set up a continuous [one-to-one correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_correspondence "One-to-one correspondence") between the unit interval and the unit square, and indeed such a correspondence does not exist (see [§Properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#Properties) below).

It was common to associate the vague notions of _thinness_ and 1-dimensionality to curves; all normally encountered curves were [piecewise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise "Piecewise") differentiable (that is, have piecewise continuous derivatives), and such curves cannot fill up the entire unit square. Therefore, Peano's space-filling curve was found to be highly counterintuitive.

From Peano's example, it was easy to deduce continuous curves whose ranges contained the _n_-dimensional [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube "Hypercube") (for any positive integer _n_). It was also easy to extend Peano's example to continuous curves without endpoints, which filled the entire _n_-dimensional Euclidean space (where _n_ is 2, 3, or any other positive integer).

Most well-known space-filling curves are constructed iteratively as the limit of a sequence of [piecewise linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_function "Piecewise linear function") continuous curves, each one more closely approximating the space-filling limit.

Peano's ground-breaking article contained no illustrations of his construction, which is defined in terms of [ternary expansions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_expansion "Ternary expansion") and a [mirroring operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mirroring_operator&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mirroring operator (page does not exist)"). But the graphical construction was perfectly clear to him—he made an ornamental tiling showing a picture of the curve in his home in Turin. Peano's article also ends by observing that the technique can be obviously extended to other odd bases besides base 3. His choice to avoid any appeal to [graphical visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_without_words "Proof without words") was motivated by a desire for a completely rigorous proof owing nothing to pictures. At that time (the beginning of the foundation of general topology), graphical arguments were still included in proofs, yet were becoming a hindrance to understanding often counterintuitive results.

A year later, [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") published in the same journal a variation of Peano's construction.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHilbert1891-8) Hilbert's article was the first to include a picture helping to visualize the construction technique, essentially the same as illustrated here. The analytic form of the [Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve "Hilbert curve"), however, is more complicated than Peano's.

Six iterations of the Hilbert curve construction, whose limiting space-filling curve was devised by mathematician [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert").

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-filling_curve&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Outline of the construction of a space-filling curve")]

Let ![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019) denote the [Cantor space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_space "Cantor space")![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbf {2} ^{\mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ecaba27de7f16c8c4e43e02db7f8abbc38b5c398).

We start with a continuous function ![Image 5: {\displaystyle h}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a) from the Cantor space ![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019) onto the entire unit interval ![Image 7: {\displaystyle [0,\,1]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb26544e5140930c301b671b91a780a2ae693a8e). (The restriction of the [Cantor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_function "Cantor function") to the [Cantor set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set "Cantor set") is an example of such a function.) From it, we get a continuous function ![Image 8: {\displaystyle H}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b) from the topological product ![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}\;\times \;{\mathcal {C}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4958918fb3a608b8af9ff94c25bd4dcee3d00875) onto the entire unit square ![Image 10: {\displaystyle [0,\,1]\;\times \;[0,\,1]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d8d07ab53079935c94deef941f12c17567be7293) by setting

![Image 11: {\displaystyle H(x,y)=(h(x),h(y)).\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/104551dee244da89ed952a6ff8ba3cc1f5ad7375)

Since the Cantor set ![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019) is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to its cartesian product with itself ![Image 13: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}\times {\mathcal {C}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8762db24262f1e600ceabb490a90774dc284f19c), there is a continuous bijection ![Image 14: {\displaystyle g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77) from the Cantor set onto ![Image 15: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}\;\times \;{\mathcal {C}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4958918fb3a608b8af9ff94c25bd4dcee3d00875). The composition ![Image 16: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) of ![Image 17: {\displaystyle H}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b) and ![Image 18: {\displaystyle g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77) is a continuous function mapping the Cantor set onto the entire unit square. (Alternatively, we could use the theorem that every [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_set "Compact set") metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set to get the function ![Image 19: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61).)

Finally, one can extend ![Image 20: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) to a continuous function ![Image 21: {\displaystyle F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57) whose domain is the entire unit interval ![Image 22: {\displaystyle [0,\,1]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb26544e5140930c301b671b91a780a2ae693a8e). This can be done either by using the [Tietze extension theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tietze_extension_theorem "Tietze extension theorem") on each of the components of ![Image 23: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61), or by simply extending ![Image 24: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) "linearly" (that is, on each of the deleted open interval ![Image 25: {\displaystyle (a,\,b)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d46dcbf306d8bd4b40bd7779417cbae25f6027a4) in the construction of the Cantor set, we define the extension part of ![Image 26: {\displaystyle F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57) on ![Image 27: {\displaystyle (a,\,b)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d46dcbf306d8bd4b40bd7779417cbae25f6027a4) to be the line segment within the unit square joining the values ![Image 28: {\displaystyle f(a)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/368cb4b81ba5754d7a354a4ce49c2f1084bdaace) and ![Image 29: {\displaystyle f(b)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/adbef9aaf500c30a3f107e5d7efb7a8627d3bba9)).

[Morton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve "Z-order curve") and [Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve "Hilbert curve") curves of level 6 (4 5=1024 cells in the [recursive square partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science) "Recursion (computer science)")) plotting each address as different color in the [RGB standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model "RGB color model"), and using [Geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash "Geohash") labels. The neighborhoods have similar colors, but each curve offers different pattern of grouping similars in smaller scales.

If a curve is not injective, then one can find two intersecting _subcurves_ of the curve, each obtained by considering the images of two disjoint segments from the curve's domain (the unit line segment). The two subcurves intersect if the [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory) "Intersection (set theory)") of the two images is [non-empty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set "Empty set"). One might be tempted to think that the meaning of _curves intersecting_ is that they necessarily cross each other, like the intersection point of two non-parallel lines, from one side to the other. However, two curves (or two subcurves of one curve) may contact one another without crossing, as, for example, a line tangent to a circle does.

A non-self-intersecting continuous curve cannot fill the unit square because that will make the curve a [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") from the unit interval onto the unit square (any continuous [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") from a [compact space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") onto a [Hausdorff space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space") is a homeomorphism). But a unit square has no [cut-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-point "Cut-point"), and so cannot be homeomorphic to the unit interval, in which all points except the endpoints are cut-points. There exist non-self-intersecting curves of nonzero area, the [Osgood curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgood_curve "Osgood curve"), but by [Netto's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netto%27s_theorem "Netto's theorem") they are not space-filling.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#cite_note-FOOTNOTESagan1994131-9)

For the classic Peano and Hilbert space-filling curves, where two subcurves intersect (in the technical sense), there is self-contact without self-crossing. A space-filling curve can be (everywhere) self-crossing if its approximation curves are self-crossing. A space-filling curve's approximations can be self-avoiding, as the figures above illustrate. In 3 dimensions, self-avoiding approximation curves can even contain [knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory "Knot theory"). Approximation curves remain within a bounded portion of _n_-dimensional space, but their lengths increase without bound.

Space-filling curves are special cases of [fractal curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_curves "Fractal curves"). No differentiable space-filling curve can exist. Roughly speaking, differentiability puts a bound on how fast the curve can turn. Michał Morayne proved that the [continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis "Continuum hypothesis") is equivalent to the existence of a Peano curve such that at each point of the real line at least one of its components is differentiable.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#cite_note-10)

The Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-filling_curve&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: The Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem")]

The [Hahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Hahn_(mathematician) "Hans Hahn (mathematician)")–[Mazurkiewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Mazurkiewicz "Stefan Mazurkiewicz") theorem is the following characterization of spaces that are the continuous image of curves:

Spaces that are the continuous image of a unit interval are sometimes called _Peano spaces_.

In many formulations of the Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem, _second-countable_ is replaced by _metrizable_. These two formulations are equivalent. In one direction a compact Hausdorff space is a [normal space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_space "Normal space") and, by the [Urysohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Samuilovich_Urysohn "Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn")[metrization theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrization_theorem "Metrization theorem"), second-countable then implies metrizable. Conversely, a compact metric space is second-countable.

There are many natural examples of space-filling, or rather sphere-filling, curves in the theory of doubly degenerate [Kleinian groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleinian_group "Kleinian group"). For example, [Cannon & Thurston (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve#CITEREFCannonThurston2007) showed that the circle at infinity of the [universal cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_cover "Universal cover") of a fiber of a [mapping torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_torus "Mapping torus") of a [pseudo-Anosov map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Anosov_map "Pseudo-Anosov map") is a sphere-filling curve. (Here the sphere is the sphere at infinity of [hyperbolic 3-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space "Hyperbolic space").)

[Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener "Norbert Wiener") pointed out in _The Fourier Integral and Certain of its Applications_ that space-filling curves could be used to reduce [Lebesgue integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_integration "Lebesgue integration") in higher dimensions to Lebesgue integration in one dimension.
