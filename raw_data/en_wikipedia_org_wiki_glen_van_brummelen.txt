He is president of the Canadian Society for History and Philosophy of Mathematics , [ 1 ] and was a co-editor of Mathematics and the Historian's Craft: The Kenneth O. May Lectures (Springer, 2005).

He has been involved in the summer program Mathpath since 2004 and is the creator of "Glensheep" and their evolution.

[ 2 ] Life [ edit ] Van Brummelen earned his PhD degree from Simon Fraser University in 1993, [ 3 ] and served as a professor of mathematics at Bennington College from 1999 to 2006. He then transferred to Quest University Canada as a founding faculty member. In 2020, he became the dean of the Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences at Trinity Western University in Langley, BC .

[ 4 ] Glen Van Brummelen has published the first major history in English of the origins and early development of trigonometry, The Mathematics of the Heavens and the Earth: The Early History of Trigonometry .

[ 5 ] His second book, Heavenly Mathematics: The Forgotten Art of Spherical Trigonometry , concerns spherical trigonometry .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] In 2016 he received a Deborah and Franklin Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics .
