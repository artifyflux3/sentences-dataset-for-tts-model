[Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Foucault "Léon Foucault")'s [pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum "Foucault pendulum") in the [Panthéon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panth%C3%A9on,_Paris "Panthéon, Paris") of [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris") can measure [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") as well as demonstrate the [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation") of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth").

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") is defined by its [measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition "Operational definition"): time is what a [clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock "Clock") reads.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-1) In classical, non-relativistic physics, it is a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)") quantity (often denoted by the symbol ![Image 3: {\displaystyle t}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560)) and, like [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length"), [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"), and [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge"), is usually described as a [fundamental quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_quantity "Fundamental quantity"). Time can be combined mathematically with other [physical quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities "Physical quantities") to [derive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_proof "Formal proof") other concepts such as [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)"), [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") and time-dependent [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)"). _[Timekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Timekeeping "Category:Timekeeping")_ is a complex of technological and scientific issues, and part of the foundation of _[recordkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recordkeeping "Recordkeeping")_.

Before there were clocks, time was measured by those physical processes[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-2) which were understandable to each epoch of civilization:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-OttoN-3)

*   the first appearance (see: [heliacal rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliacal_rising "Heliacal rising")) of [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius "Sirius") to mark the [flooding of the Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_of_the_Nile "Flooding of the Nile") each year[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-OttoN-3)
*   the periodic succession of [night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night "Night") and [day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day "Day"), seemingly eternally[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-4)

Eventually,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-10) it became possible to characterize the passage of time with instrumentation, using [operational definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition "Operational definition"). Simultaneously, our conception of time has evolved, as shown below.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-11)

Unit of measurement of time
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_in_physics&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Unit of measurement of time")]

In the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI), the unit of time is the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") (symbol: s). It has been defined since 1967 as "the duration of 9 192 631 770[periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(physics) "Period (physics)") of the [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation") corresponding to the transition between the two [hyperfine levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfine_structure "Hyperfine structure") of the [ground state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_state "Ground state") of the [caesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium "Caesium") 133 atom", and is an [SI base unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit "SI base unit").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-12) This definition is based on the operation of a caesium [atomic clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock "Atomic clock"). These clocks became practical for use as primary reference standards after about 1955, and have been in use ever since.

### State of the art in timekeeping

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_in_physics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: State of the art in timekeeping")]

The [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Coordinated Universal Time")[timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp "Timestamp") in use worldwide is an atomic time standard. The relative accuracy of such a time standard is currently on the order of 10−15[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-13) (corresponding to 1 second in approximately 30 million years). The smallest time step considered theoretically observable is called the [Planck time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time "Planck time"), which is approximately 5.391×10−44 seconds – many orders of magnitude below the resolution of current time standards.

The [caesium atomic clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_atomic_clock "Caesium atomic clock") became practical after 1950, when advances in electronics enabled reliable measurement of the microwave frequencies it generates. As further advances occurred, [atomic clock research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock#Research "Atomic clock") has progressed to ever-higher frequencies, which can provide higher accuracy and higher precision. Clocks based on these techniques have been developed, but are not yet in use as primary reference standards.

Conceptions of time
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_in_physics&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Conceptions of time")]

Main article: [Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time")

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Andromeda_galaxy_Ssc2005-20a1.jpg/330px-Andromeda_galaxy_Ssc2005-20a1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Andromeda_galaxy_Ssc2005-20a1.jpg)

Andromeda galaxy ([M31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy "Andromeda Galaxy")) is two million [light-years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year") away. Thus we are viewing M31's light from two million years ago,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-14) a time before [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") existed on Earth.

[Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo "Galileo"), [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), and most people up until the 20th century thought that time was the same for everyone everywhere. This is the basis for [timelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Timelines "Category:Timelines"), where time is a [parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter"). The modern understanding of time is based on [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"), in which rates of time run differently depending on relative motion, and [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and time are merged into [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), where we live on a [world line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line "World line") rather than a timeline. In this view time is a [coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate "Coordinate"). According to the prevailing [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology")[model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling "Scientific modelling") of the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") theory, time itself began as part of the entire [Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") about 13.8 billion years ago.

### Regularities in nature

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_in_physics&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Regularities in nature")]

In order to measure time, one can record the number of occurrences (events) of some [periodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function "Periodic function")[phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon "Phenomenon"). The regular recurrences of the [seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasons "Seasons"), the [motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") of the [sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), [moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") and [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") were noted and tabulated for millennia, before the [laws of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_physics "Laws of physics") were formulated. The sun was the arbiter of the flow of time, but [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") was known only to the [hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour "Hour") for [millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium "Millennium"), hence, the use of the [gnomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon "Gnomon") was known across most of the world, especially [Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia"), and at least as far southward as the jungles of [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia "Southeast Asia").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-15)

In particular, the astronomical observatories maintained for religious purposes became accurate enough to ascertain the regular motions of the stars, and even some of the planets.

At first, [timekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping "Timekeeping") was done by hand by priests, and then for commerce, with watchmen to note time as part of their duties. The tabulation of the [equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox "Equinox"), the [sandglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_sandglass "Marine sandglass"), and the [water clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock "Water clock") became more and more accurate, and finally reliable. For ships at sea, [marine sandglasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_sandglass "Marine sandglass") were used. These devices allowed sailors to call the hours, and to calculate sailing velocity.

[Richard of Wallingford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_of_Wallingford "Richard of Wallingford") (1292–1336), abbot of St. Albans Abbey, famously built a [mechanical clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock#Fully_mechanical "Clock") as an astronomical [orrery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery "Orrery") about 1330.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-17)

By the time of Richard of Wallingford, the use of [ratchets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_(device) "Ratchet (device)") and [gears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear "Gear") allowed the towns of Europe to create mechanisms to display the time on their respective town clocks; by the time of the scientific revolution, the clocks became miniaturized enough for families to share a personal clock, or perhaps a pocket watch. At first, only kings could afford them. [Pendulum clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_clock "Pendulum clock") were widely used in the 18th and 19th century. They have largely been replaced in general use by [quartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_clock "Quartz clock") and [digital clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_clock "Digital clock"). [Atomic clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clocks "Atomic clocks") can theoretically keep accurate time for millions of years. They are appropriate for [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization "Standardization") and scientific use.

### Galileo: the flow of time

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_in_physics&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Galileo: the flow of time")]

In 1583, [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") (1564–1642) discovered that a [pendulum's harmonic motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator "Harmonic oscillator") has a constant period, which he learned by timing the motion of a swaying lamp in [harmonic motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion "Simple harmonic motion") at [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy) "Mass (liturgy)") at the cathedral of [Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa "Pisa"), with his [pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse "Pulse").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-18)

In his _[Two New Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two\_New\_Sciences "Two New Sciences")_ (1638), [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") used a [water clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock "Water clock") to measure the time taken for a bronze ball to roll a known distance down an [inclined plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclined_plane "Inclined plane"); this clock was:[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-galileo-19)

> ...a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water, which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length; the water thus collected was weighed, after each descent, on a very accurate balance; the differences and ratios of these weights gave us the differences and ratios of the times, and this with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results.

Galileo's experimental setup to measure the literal _[flow of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two\_New\_Sciences#The\_flow\_of\_time "Two New Sciences")_, in order to describe the motion of a ball, preceded [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s statement in his [Principia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica"), "I do not define [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"), [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space"), [place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_(geography) "Location (geography)") and [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)"), as being well known to all."[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-galileo2-20)

The [Galilean transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_transformation "Galilean transformation") assume that time is the same for all [reference frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference").

### Newtonian physics: linear time

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_in_physics&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Newtonian physics: linear time")]

In or around 1665, when [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") (1643–1727) derived the motion of objects falling under [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"), the first clear formulation for [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics") of a treatment of time began: linear time, conceived as a _universal clock_.

> Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent, and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time; such as an hour, a day, a month, a year.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-newton-21)

The [water clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock "Water clock") mechanism described by Galileo was engineered to provide [laminar flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow "Laminar flow") of the water during the experiments, thus providing a constant flow of water for the durations of the experiments, and embodying what Newton called _duration_.

In this section, the relationships listed below treat time as a parameter which serves as an index to the behavior of the physical system under consideration. Because Newton's [fluents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_(mathematics) "Fluent (mathematics)") treat a _linear flow of time_ (what he called _mathematical time_), time could be considered to be a linearly varying parameter, an abstraction of the march of the hours on the face of a clock. Calendars and ship's logs could then be mapped to the march of the hours, days, months, years and centuries.

### Thermodynamics and the paradox of irreversibility

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_in_physics&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Thermodynamics and the paradox of irreversibility")]

By 1798, [Benjamin Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Thompson "Benjamin Thompson") (1753–1814) had discovered that work could be transformed to [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat") without limit – a precursor of the conservation of energy or

*   [1st law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy")

In 1824 [Sadi Carnot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_L%C3%A9onard_Sadi_Carnot "Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot") (1796–1832) scientifically analyzed the [steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine") with his [Carnot cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_cycle "Carnot cycle"), an abstract engine. [Rudolf Clausius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius "Rudolf Clausius") (1822–1888) noted a measure of disorder, or [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy"), which affects the continually decreasing amount of free energy which is available to a Carnot engine in the:

*   [2nd law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy")

Thus the continual march of a thermodynamic system, from lesser to greater entropy, at any given temperature, defines an [arrow of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time "Arrow of time"). In particular, [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking "Stephen Hawking") identifies three arrows of time:[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-einstein2-22)

*   Psychological arrow of time – our perception of an inexorable flow.
*   Thermodynamic arrow of time – distinguished by the growth of [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy").
*   Cosmological arrow of time – distinguished by the expansion of the universe.

With time, entropy increases in an isolated thermodynamic system. In contrast, [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger") (1887–1961) pointed out that [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life") depends on a _"negative entropy flow"_.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-23)[Ilya Prigogine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine "Ilya Prigogine") (1917–2003) stated that other thermodynamic systems which, like life, are also far from equilibrium, can also exhibit stable spatio-temporal structures that reminisce life. Soon afterward, the [Belousov–Zhabotinsky reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction "Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction")[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-24) were reported, which demonstrate oscillating colors in a chemical solution.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-25) These nonequilibrium thermodynamic branches reach a _[bifurcation point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation\_theory "Bifurcation theory")_, which is unstable, and another thermodynamic branch becomes stable in its stead.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-26)

### Electromagnetism and the speed of light

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_in_physics&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Electromagnetism and the speed of light")]

In 1864, [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") (1831–1879) presented a combined theory of [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity "Electricity") and [magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism"). He combined all the laws then known relating to those two phenomenon into four equations. These equations are known as [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") for [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"); they allow for solutions in the form of electromagnetic waves and propagate at a fixed speed, _c_, regardless of the velocity of the electric charge that generated them.

The fact that light is predicted to always travel at speed _c_ would be incompatible with Galilean relativity if Maxwell's equations were assumed to hold in any [inertial frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame "Inertial frame") (reference frame with constant velocity), because the Galilean transformations predict the speed to decrease (or increase) in the reference frame of an observer traveling parallel (or antiparallel) to the light.

It was expected that there was one absolute reference frame, that of the [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether "Luminiferous aether"), in which Maxwell's equations held unmodified in the known form.

The [Michelson–Morley experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment "Michelson–Morley experiment") failed to detect any difference in the relative speed of light due to the motion of the Earth relative to the luminiferous aether, suggesting that Maxwell's equations did, in fact, hold in all frames. In 1875, [Hendrik Lorentz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz "Hendrik Lorentz") (1853–1928) discovered [Lorentz transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation"), which left Maxwell's equations unchanged, allowing Michelson and Morley's negative result to be explained. [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") (1854–1912) noted the importance of Lorentz's transformation and popularized it. In particular, the railroad car description can be found in _[Science and Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science\_and\_Hypothesis "Science and Hypothesis")_,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-27) which was published before Einstein's articles of 1905.

The Lorentz transformation predicted [space contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_contraction "Space contraction") and [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation "Time dilation"); until 1905, the former was interpreted as a physical contraction of objects moving with respect to the aether, due to the modification of the intermolecular forces (of electric nature), while the latter was thought to be just a mathematical stipulation. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Relativistic physics: spacetime

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_in_physics&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Relativistic physics: spacetime")]

[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s 1905 [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") challenged the notion of absolute time, and could only formulate a definition of [synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization "Synchronization") for clocks that mark a linear flow of time:

> If at the point A of space there is a clock, an observer at A can determine the time values of events in the immediate proximity of A by finding the positions of the hands which are simultaneous with these events. If there is at the point B of space another clock in all respects resembling the one at A, it is possible for an observer at B to determine the time values of events in the immediate neighbourhood of B.
> 
> 
> But it is not possible without further assumption to compare, in respect of time, an event at A with an event at B. We have so far defined only an "A time" and a "B time".
> 
> 
> We have not defined a common "time" for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we establish _by definition_ that the "time" required by light to travel from A to B equals the "time" it requires to travel from B to A. Let a ray of light start at the "A time" _t_ A from A towards B, let it at the "B time" _t_ B be reflected at B in the direction of A, and arrive again at A at the “A time” _t_′A.
> 
> 
> In accordance with definition the two clocks synchronize if
> 
> ![Image 5: {\displaystyle t_{\text{B}}-t_{\text{A}}=t'_{\text{A}}-t_{\text{B}}{\text{.}}\,\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/373d766ac33b7631673d2a5cd1ef34614745c0ea)
> We assume that this definition of synchronism is free from contradictions, and possible for any number of points; and that the following relations are universally valid:—
> 
> 
> 1.   If the clock at B synchronizes with the clock at A, the clock at A synchronizes with the clock at B.
> 2.   If the clock at A synchronizes with the clock at B and also with the clock at C, the clocks at B and C also synchronize with each other.

— Albert Einstein, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies"[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-arrow_of_time-28)

Einstein showed that if the speed of light is not changing between reference frames, space and time must be so that the moving observer will measure the same speed of light as the stationary one because velocity is _defined_ by space and time:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={d\mathbf {r}  \over dt}{\text{,}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/232192b74a66f7f9a41f2557c03fc9fa749a2a51) where **r** is position and _t_ is time.
Indeed, the Lorentz transformation (for two reference frames in relative motion, whose _x_ axis is directed in the direction of the relative velocity)

![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}t'&=\gamma (t-vx/c^{2}){\text{ where }}\gamma =1/{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}\\x'&=\gamma (x-vt)\\y'&=y\\z'&=z\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ead94e255b685d2b432236ede44a0ecc0cb6b5e7)
can be said to "mix" space and time in a way similar to the way a Euclidean rotation around the _z_ axis mixes _x_ and _y_ coordinates. Consequences of this include [relativity of simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity "Relativity of simultaneity").

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Relativity_of_Simultaneity.svg/250px-Relativity_of_Simultaneity.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Relativity_of_Simultaneity.svg)

Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurred before in the blue frame, and will occur later in the red frame.

More specifically, the Lorentz transformation is a hyperbolic rotation

![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}ct'\\x'\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}\cosh \phi &-\sinh \phi \\-\sinh \phi &\cosh \phi \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}ct\\x\end{pmatrix}}{\text{ where }}\phi =\operatorname {artanh} \,{\frac {v}{c}}{\text{,}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac3433ea77f513c207b37ad416a2c7389eff5ca2)
which is a change of coordinates in the four-dimensional [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"), a dimension of which is _ct_. (In [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") an ordinary rotation

![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}x'\\y'\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\\sin \theta &\cos \theta \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/afa15012cdd47cd24deac72f3e3ce03ed527a90d)
is the corresponding change of coordinates.) The speed of light _c_ can be seen as just a conversion factor needed because we measure the dimensions of spacetime in different units; since the [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre") is currently defined in terms of the second, it has the _exact_ value of 299 792 458 m/s. We would need a similar factor in Euclidean space if, for example, we measured width in nautical miles and depth in feet. In physics, sometimes [units of measurement in which _c_ = 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units "Natural units") are used to simplify equations.

Time in a "moving" reference frame is shown to run more slowly than in a "stationary" one by the following relation (which can be derived by the Lorentz transformation by putting ∆_x_′ = 0, ∆_τ_ = ∆_t_′):

![Image 11: {\displaystyle \Delta t={{\Delta \tau } \over {\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/95d86d3cc40f2b828b60700f56c92355754709f9)
where:

Moving objects therefore are said to _show a slower passage of time_. This is known as [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation "Time dilation").

These transformations are only valid for two frames at _constant_ relative velocity. Naively applying them to other situations gives rise to such [paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox "Paradox") as the [twin paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox "Twin paradox").

That paradox can be resolved using for instance Einstein's [General theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_theory_of_relativity "General theory of relativity"), which uses [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry"), geometry in accelerated, noninertial reference frames. Employing the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") which describes [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"):

![Image 12: {\displaystyle \left[(dx^{1})^{2}+(dx^{2})^{2}+(dx^{3})^{2}-c(dt)^{2})\right],}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/56d3bc66213654f8a8f76ab5d452fc9e46ac7f7b)
Einstein developed a geometric solution to Lorentz's transformation that preserves [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"). His [field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%27s_field_equations "Einstein's field equations") give an exact relationship between the measurements of space and time in a given region of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") and the energy density of that region.

Einstein's equations predict that time should be altered by the presence of [gravitational fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_fields "Gravitational fields") (see the [Schwarzschild metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric "Schwarzschild metric")):

![Image 13: {\displaystyle T={\frac {dt}{\sqrt {\left(1-{\frac {2GM}{rc^{2}}}\right)dt^{2}-{\frac {1}{c^{2}}}\left(1-{\frac {2GM}{rc^{2}}}\right)^{-1}dr^{2}-{\frac {r^{2}}{c^{2}}}d\theta ^{2}-{\frac {r^{2}}{c^{2}}}\sin ^{2}\theta \;d\phi ^{2}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d52053f13754c5f36c5ad2e58eef4ee26000922d)
where:

Or one could use the following simpler approximation:

![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\frac {dt}{d\tau }}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-\left({\frac {2GM}{rc^{2}}}\right)}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/34af93885266bf05e428fb1037d36dc21eab8287)
That is, the stronger the gravitational field (and, thus, the larger the [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration")), the more slowly time runs. The predictions of time dilation are confirmed by [particle acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator "Particle accelerator") experiments and [cosmic ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray") evidence, where moving particles [decay more slowly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_decay "Particle decay") than their less energetic counterparts. Gravitational time dilation gives rise to the phenomenon of [gravitational redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_redshift "Gravitational redshift") and [Shapiro signal travel time delays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro_delay "Shapiro delay") near massive objects such as the sun. The [Global Positioning System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System "Global Positioning System") must also adjust signals to account for this effect.

According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, a freely moving particle traces a history in spacetime that maximises its proper time. This phenomenon is also referred to as the principle of maximal aging, and was described by [Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_F._Taylor "Edwin F. Taylor") and [Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler "John Archibald Wheeler") as:[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-29)

_"Principle of Extremal Aging: The path a free object takes between two events in spacetime is the path for which the time lapse between these events, recorded on the object's wristwatch, is an extremum."_
Einstein's theory was motivated by the assumption that every point in the universe can be treated as a 'center', and that correspondingly, physics must act the same in all reference frames. His simple and elegant theory shows that time is relative to an [inertial frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame "Inertial frame"). In an inertial frame, [Newton's first law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_first_law "Newton's first law") holds; it has its own local geometry, and therefore its _own_ measurements of space and time; _there is no 'universal clock'_. An act of synchronization must be performed between two systems, at the least.

### Time in quantum mechanics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_in_physics&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Time in quantum mechanics")]

There is a time parameter in the equations of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). The [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation")[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-schrodinger-30) is

![Image 15: {\displaystyle H(t)\left|\psi (t)\right\rangle =i\hbar {\partial  \over \partial t}\left|\psi (t)\right\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d39f23fa9d7309e136c65b59b88c622c5442e8dd)
One solution can be

![Image 16: {\displaystyle |\psi _{e}(t)\rangle =e^{-iHt/\hbar }|\psi _{e}(0)\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/abd2ccb642114fcd54957516e45b359301de44c7).
where ![Image 17: {\displaystyle e^{-iHt/\hbar }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/002bb6da81272a393845bc3217e0549770e720f4) is called the [time evolution operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_evolution_operator "Time evolution operator"), and _H_ is the [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics) "Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)").

But the [Schrödinger picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_picture "Schrödinger picture") shown above is equivalent to the [Heisenberg picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_picture "Heisenberg picture"), which enjoys a similarity to the Poisson brackets of classical mechanics. The [Poisson brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_bracket "Poisson bracket") are superseded by a nonzero [commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator "Commutator"), say [_H_, _A_] for [observable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable "Observable")_A_, and Hamiltonian H:

![Image 18: {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}A=(i\hbar )^{-1}[A,H]+\left({\frac {\partial A}{\partial t}}\right)_{\mathrm {classical} }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/240eff73d81462b97dbd95b02dec75ad59cda0ed)
This equation denotes an [uncertainty relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle") in quantum physics. For example, with _time_ (the observable _A_), the energy _E_ (from the Hamiltonian _H_) gives:

![Image 19: {\displaystyle \Delta E\Delta T\geq {\frac {\hbar }{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4a2a63fff6a31d453a402d88f166478fbb814be2)
where

The more [precisely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision "Accuracy and precision") one measures the duration of a [sequence of events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon "Phenomenon"), the less precisely one can measure the energy associated with that sequence, and vice versa. This equation is different from the standard uncertainty principle, because time is not an [operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics) "Operator (physics)") in quantum mechanics.

Corresponding [commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator "Commutator") relations also hold for momentum _p_ and position _q_, which are [conjugate variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_variables "Conjugate variables") of each other, along with a corresponding uncertainty principle in momentum and position, similar to the energy and time relation above.

Quantum mechanics explains the properties of the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table") of the [elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element"). Starting with [Otto Stern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Stern "Otto Stern")'s and [Walter Gerlach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gerlach "Walter Gerlach")'s experiment with [molecular beams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_beam "Molecular beam") in a magnetic field, [Isidor Rabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidor_Rabi "Isidor Rabi") (1898–1988), was able to [modulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation "Modulation") the magnetic resonance of the beam. In 1945 Rabi then suggested that this technique be the basis of a clock[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-sternGerlachRabi-31) using the [resonant frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_frequency "Resonant frequency") of an atomic beam. In 2021 Jun Ye of JILA in Boulder Colorado observed [time dilatation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilatation "Time dilatation") in the difference in the rate of optical lattice clock ticks at the top of a cloud of strontium atoms, than at the bottom of that cloud, a column one millimeter tall, under the influence of gravity.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-jilaYe-32)

One could say that time is a [parameterization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterization "Parameterization") of a [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system") that allows the geometry of the system to be manifested and operated on. It has been asserted that _time is an implicit consequence of [chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos\_theory "Chaos theory")_ (i.e. [nonlinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinearity "Nonlinearity")/[irreversibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversibility "Irreversibility")): the [characteristic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_time "Characteristic time"), or rate of [information entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_entropy "Information entropy") production, of a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System"). [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beno%C3%AEt_Mandelbrot "Benoît Mandelbrot") introduces [intrinsic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intrinsic_time&action=edit&redlink=1 "Intrinsic time (page does not exist)") in his book _Multifractals and [1/f noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1/f\_noise "1/f noise")_.

Khemani, Moessner, and Sondhi define a time crystal as a "stable, conservative, macroscopic clock".[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-kms2019-33): 7

Signalling is one application of the [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave "Electromagnetic wave") described above. In general, a signal is part of [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication "Communication") between parties and places. One example might be a [yellow ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_ribbon "Yellow ribbon") tied to a tree, or the ringing of a [church bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_bell "Church bell"). A signal can be part of a [conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation "Conversation"), which involves a [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol"). Another signal might be the position of the hour hand on a town clock or a railway station. An interested party might wish to view that clock, to learn the time. See: [Time ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_ball "Time ball"), an early form of [Time signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signal "Time signal").

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Lorentz_transform_of_world_line.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lorentz_transform_of_world_line.gif)

Evolution of a [world line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line "World line") of an accelerated massive particle. This world line is restricted to the [timelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timelike "Timelike") top and bottom sections of this [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") figure; this world line cannot cross the top ([future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future "Future")) or the bottom ([past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past "Past")) [light cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone "Light cone"). The left and right sections (which are outside the light cones) are [spacelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacelike "Spacelike").

We as observers can still signal different parties and places as long as we live within their _past_[light cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone "Light cone"). But we cannot receive signals from those parties and places outside our _past_ light cone.

Along with the formulation of the equations for the electromagnetic wave, the field of [telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication "Telecommunication") could be founded.

In 19th century [telegraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy "Telegraphy"), [electrical circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_circuit "Electrical circuit"), some spanning [continents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent "Continent") and [oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean "Ocean"), could transmit [codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code "Code") - simple dots, dashes and spaces. From this, a series of technical issues have emerged; see [Category:Synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Synchronization "Category:Synchronization"). But it is safe to say that our signalling systems can be only approximately [synchronized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization "Synchronization"), a [plesiochronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiochronous "Plesiochronous") condition, from which [jitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter "Jitter") need be eliminated.

That said, [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System")_can_ be synchronized (at an engineering approximation), using technologies like [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS "GPS"). The GPS satellites must account for the effects of gravitation and other relativistic factors in their circuitry. See: [Self-clocking signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-clocking_signal "Self-clocking signal").

Technology for timekeeping standards
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_in_physics&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Technology for timekeeping standards")]

The [primary time standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_time_standard "Primary time standard") in the U.S. is currently [NIST-F1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST-F1 "NIST-F1"), a [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser")-cooled [Cs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium "Caesium") fountain,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-34) the latest in a series of time and frequency standards, from the [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia")-based atomic clock (1949) to the [caesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium "Caesium")-based NBS-1 (1952) to NIST-7 (1993). The respective clock uncertainty declined from 10,000 nanoseconds per day to 0.5 nanoseconds per day in 5 decades.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-35) In 2001 the clock uncertainty for NIST-F1 was 0.1 nanoseconds/day. Development of increasingly accurate frequency standards is underway.

In this time and frequency standard, a population of caesium atoms is laser-cooled to temperatures of one [microkelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkelvin "Microkelvin"). The atoms collect in a ball shaped by six lasers, two for each spatial dimension, vertical (up/down), horizontal (left/right), and back/forth. The vertical lasers push the caesium ball through a microwave cavity. As the ball is cooled, the caesium population cools to its ground state and emits light at its natural frequency, stated in the definition of _second_ above. Eleven physical effects are accounted for in the emissions from the caesium population, which are then controlled for in the NIST-F1 clock. These results are reported to [BIPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIPM "BIPM").

Additionally, a reference [hydrogen maser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maser#Hydrogen_maser "Maser") is also reported to BIPM as a frequency standard for [TAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time "International Atomic Time") ([international atomic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time "International Atomic Time")).

The measurement of time is overseen by [BIPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIPM "BIPM") (_Bureau International des Poids et Mesures_), located in [Sèvres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A8vres "Sèvres"), France, which ensures uniformity of measurements and their traceability to the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") ([SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI")) worldwide. BIPM operates under authority of the [Metre Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_Convention "Metre Convention"), a diplomatic treaty between fifty-one nations, the Member States of the Convention, through a series of Consultative Committees, whose members are the respective national [metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology "Metrology") laboratories.

The equations of general relativity predict a non-static universe. However, Einstein accepted only a static universe, and modified the Einstein field equation to reflect this by adding the [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant "Cosmological constant"), which he later described as his "biggest blunder". But in 1927, [Georges Lemaître](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre "Georges Lemaître") (1894–1966) argued, on the basis of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), that the universe originated in a primordial explosion. At the fifth [Solvay conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvay_conference "Solvay conference"), that year, Einstein brushed him off with "_Vos calculs sont corrects, mais votre physique est abominable._"[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-36) (“Your math is correct, but your physics is abominable”). In 1929, [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble") (1889–1953) announced his discovery of the [expanding universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanding_universe "Expanding universe"). The current generally accepted cosmological model, the [Lambda-CDM model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model "Lambda-CDM model"), has a positive cosmological constant and thus not only an expanding universe but an accelerating expanding universe.

If the universe were expanding, then it must have been much smaller and therefore hotter and denser in the past. [George Gamow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gamow "George Gamow") (1904–1968) hypothesized that the abundance of the elements in the Periodic Table of the Elements, might be accounted for by nuclear reactions in a hot dense universe. He was disputed by [Fred Hoyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle "Fred Hoyle") (1915–2001), who invented the term '[Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang")' to disparage it. [Fermi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi "Enrico Fermi") and others noted that this process would have stopped after only the light elements were created, and thus did not account for the abundance of heavier elements.

[![Image 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/WMAP.jpg/250px-WMAP.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WMAP.jpg)

[WMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAP "WMAP") fluctuations of the [cosmic microwave background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation "Cosmic microwave background radiation")[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-37)

Gamow's prediction was a 5–10-[kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin")[black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation "Black-body radiation") temperature for the universe, after it cooled during the expansion. This was corroborated by [Penzias and Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation "Discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation") in 1965. Subsequent experiments arrived at a 2.7 kelvins temperature, corresponding to an [age of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe "Age of the universe") of 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang.

This dramatic result has raised issues: what happened between the singularity of the Big Bang and the Planck time, which, after all, is the smallest observable time. When might have time separated out from the [spacetime foam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_foam "Spacetime foam");[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-38) there are only hints based on broken symmetries (see [Spontaneous symmetry breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking "Spontaneous symmetry breaking"), [Timeline of the Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Big_Bang "Timeline of the Big Bang"), and the articles in [Category:Physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Physical_cosmology "Category:Physical cosmology")).

[General relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") gave us our modern notion of the expanding universe that started in the Big Bang. Using relativity and quantum theory we have been able to roughly reconstruct the history of the universe. In our [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe "Age of the universe"), during which electromagnetic waves can propagate without being disturbed by conductors or charges, we can see the stars, at great distances from us, in the night sky. (Before this epoch, there was a time, before the universe cooled enough for electrons and nuclei to combine into atoms about 377,000 years after the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"), during which starlight would not have been visible over large distances.)

[Ilya Prigogine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine "Ilya Prigogine")'s reprise is _"[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") precedes [existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence "Existence")"_. In contrast to the views of Newton, of Einstein, and of quantum physics, which offer a symmetric view of time (as discussed above), Prigogine points out that statistical and thermodynamic physics can explain [irreversible phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_process "Irreversible process"),[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics#cite_note-39) as well as the [arrow of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time "Arrow of time") and the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang").
