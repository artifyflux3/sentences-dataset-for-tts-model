In epistemology , the word axiom is understood differently; see axiom and self-evidence . Individual axioms are almost always part of a larger axiomatic system .

ZF (the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms without the axiom of choice) [ edit ] Together with the axiom of choice (see below), these are the de facto standard axioms for contemporary mathematics or set theory . They can be easily adapted to analogous theories, such as mereology .

Axiom of extensionality Axiom of empty set Axiom of pairing Axiom of union Axiom of infinity Axiom schema of replacement Axiom of power set Axiom of regularity Axiom schema of specification See also Zermelo set theory .

Axiom of choice [ edit ] With the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms above, this makes up the system ZFC in which most mathematics is potentially formalisable.
