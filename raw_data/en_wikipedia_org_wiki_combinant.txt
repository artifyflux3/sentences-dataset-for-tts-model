Find sources: "Combinant" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2024 ) In the mathematical theory of probability , the combinants c n of a random variable X are defined via the combinant-generating function G ( t ), which is defined from the moment generating function M ( z ) as G X ( t ) = M X ( log ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 + t ) ) {\displaystyle G_{X}(t)=M_{X}(\log(1+t))} which can be expressed directly in terms of a random variable X as G X ( t ) := E [ ( 1 + t ) X ] , t ∈ ∈ R , {\displaystyle G_{X}(t):=E\left[(1+t)^{X}\right],\quad t\in \mathbb {R} ,} wherever this expectation exists.

The n th combinant can be obtained as the n th derivatives of the logarithm of combinant generating function evaluated at –1 divided by n factorial: c n = 1 n !

∂ ∂ n ∂ ∂ t n log ⁡ ⁡ ( G ( t ) ) | t = − − 1 {\displaystyle c_{n}={\frac {1}{n!}}{\frac {\partial ^{n}}{\partial t^{n}}}\log(G(t)){\bigg |}_{t=-1}} Important features in common with the cumulants are: the combinants share the additivity property of the cumulants; for infinite divisibility (probability) distributions, both sets of moments are strictly positive.
