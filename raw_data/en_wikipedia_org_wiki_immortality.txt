The _[Fountain of Eternal Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain\_of\_Eternal\_Life "Fountain of Eternal Life")_ in [Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland "Cleveland"), Ohio, United States, is described as symbolizing "Man rising above death, reaching upward to God and toward Peace."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-GVCM-1)

**Immortality** is the concept of eternal life.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-2) Some [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species") possess "[biological immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_immortality "Biological immortality")" due to an apparent lack of the [Hayflick limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit "Hayflick limit").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-4)

From at least the time of the [ancient Mesopotamians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Mesopotamian_religion "Ancient Mesopotamian religion"), there has been a conviction that gods may be physically immortal, and that this is also a state that the gods at times offer humans. In [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"), the conviction that God may offer physical immortality with the [resurrection of the flesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_flesh "Resurrection of the flesh") at the end of time has traditionally been at the center of its beliefs.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerkins198417%E2%80%9318-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEaf_H%C3%A4llstr%C3%B6m19889%E2%80%9310-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEndsj%C3%B820232%E2%80%935,_28%E2%80%9330,_110%E2%80%9312-7) What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul "Soul") exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of religion,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTECullmann1955-8) as well as the subject of speculation and debate. In religious contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of divinities to human beings who perform [virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue "Virtue") or follow [divine law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_law "Divine law").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-9)

Some scientists, [futurists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist "Futurist") and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century with the help of certain speculative [technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technologies "Technologies") such as [mind uploading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading "Mind uploading") ([digital immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_immortality "Digital immortality")).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-10)

[Life extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_extension "Life extension") technologies claim to be developing a path to complete [rejuvenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejuvenation_(aging) "Rejuvenation (aging)"). [Cryonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics "Cryonics") holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as [hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(genus) "Hydra (genus)") and [Planarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planarian "Planarian") worms, it is indeed possible for a creature to be [biologically immortal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_immortality "Biological immortality"), these are animals which are physiologically very different from humans, and it is not known if something comparable will ever be possible for humans.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlexander20035%E2%80%9310-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBolonkin20102%E2%80%937-12)

Immortality in religion refers usually to either the belief in physical immortality or a more spiritual _[afterlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife "Afterlife")_. In traditions such as ancient Egyptian beliefs, Mesopotamian beliefs and ancient Greek beliefs, the immortal gods consequently were considered to have physical bodies. In Mesopotamian and Greek religion, the gods also made certain men and women physically immortal,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTERohde1925-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEndsj%C3%B8202328%E2%80%9330,_33%E2%80%9339-14) whereas in Christianity, many believe that all true believers will be [resurrected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection "Resurrection") to physical immortality.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerkins198417%E2%80%9318-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEaf_H%C3%A4llstr%C3%B6m19889%E2%80%9310-6) Similar beliefs that physical immortality is possible are held by [Rastafarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari_movement "Rastafari movement") or [Rebirthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirthing-Breathwork "Rebirthing-Breathwork").

Physical immortality
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Physical immortality")]

Physical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer.

Pursuit of physical immortality before the advent of modern science included [alchemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy"), who sought to create the [Philosopher's Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone "Philosopher's stone"),[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Paracelsus-15) and various cultures' legends such as the [Fountain of Youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_of_Youth "Fountain of Youth") or the [Peaches of Immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaches_of_Immortality "Peaches of Immortality") inspiring attempts at discovering an [elixir of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_of_life "Elixir of life").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEZorea201735%E2%80%9339-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEndsj%C3%B8202388%E2%80%93100-17)

Modern scientific trends, such as [cryonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics "Cryonics"), [digital immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_immortality "Digital immortality"), breakthroughs in [rejuvenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejuvenation_(aging) "Rejuvenation (aging)"), or predictions of an impending [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity "Technological singularity"), to achieve genuine human physical immortality, must still overcome all causes of death to succeed.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlexander200345%E2%80%9357-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBolonkin201072%E2%80%9383-19)

There are three main causes of death: [natural aging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging "Aging"), [disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease "Disease"), and [injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_trauma "Physical trauma").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-20) Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification.

[Aubrey de Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey "Aubrey de Grey"), a leading researcher in the field,[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Garreau-21) defines [aging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging "Aging") as "a collection of cumulative changes to the [molecular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular "Molecular") and [cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)") structure of an adult [organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism "Organism"), which result in essential [metabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic "Metabolic") processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [pathology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology "Pathology") and death." The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), [DNA damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage_theory_of_aging "DNA damage theory of aging"), [oncogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology "Oncology")[nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus "Cell nucleus")[mutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation "Mutation") and [epimutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimutation "Epimutation"), cell [senescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence "Senescence"), [mitochondrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria "Mitochondria") mutations, [lysosomal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosomal "Lysosomal") aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, [immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system "Immune system") decline, and [endocrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine "Endocrine") changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls [engineered negligible senescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategies_for_engineered_negligible_senescence "Strategies for engineered negligible senescence"). There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-22)

Disease is theoretically surmountable by technology. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body should not typically have to deal with its natural make up.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-23) Human understanding of [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics "Genetics") is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. [Preventative medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventative_medicine "Preventative medicine") is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like [Parkinson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease") and [Alzheimer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease "Alzheimer's disease") may soon be curable with the use of [stem cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cells "Stem cells"). Breakthroughs in [cell biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology "Cell biology") and [telomere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere "Telomere") research are leading to treatments for cancer. [Vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine "Vaccine") are being researched for AIDS and [tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis "Tuberculosis"). Genes associated with [type 1 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_diabetes "Type 1 diabetes") and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the [nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system "Nervous system") may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments.

[Physical trauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_trauma "Physical trauma") would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of [paramedic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic "Paramedic")[response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_relief_operation "Disaster relief operation") remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-walker-24) A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology"), would mitigate this factor. The brain cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people.

#### Environmental change

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Environmental change")]

Organisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, death through resource limitation is still possible, such as [hypoxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical) "Hypoxia (medical)") or [starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation "Starvation").

If there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the [cumulative probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_probability "Cumulative probability") of death over an infinite horizon is less than [certainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certainty "Certainty"), even when the risk of fatal trauma [in any finite period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_rate "Hazard rate") is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving ['actuarial escape velocity'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_lifespan#Actuarial_escape_velocity "Indefinite lifespan").

### Biological immortality

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Biological immortality")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Telomere_caps.gif/250px-Telomere_caps.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Telomere_caps.gif)

Human [chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome "Chromosome") (grey) capped by telomeres (white)

Biological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it is the absence of a sustained increase in [rate of mortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_mortality "Rate of mortality") as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-25)

[Biologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologist "Biologist") have chosen the word "immortal" to designate cells that are not limited by the [Hayflick limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit "Hayflick limit"), where cells no longer divide because of [DNA damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair "DNA repair") or shortened [telomeres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere "Telomere"). The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is [HeLa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa "HeLa"), developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of [Henrietta Lacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks "Henrietta Lacks") without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of [Leonard Hayflick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Hayflick "Leonard Hayflick"), there was the erroneous belief fostered by [Alexis Carrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Carrel "Alexis Carrel") that all normal [somatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_(biology) "Somatic (biology)") cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a "cap" at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. [Telomerase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase "Telomerase") is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-LinKahWai-26) No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-27)

#### Biologically immortal species

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Biologically immortal species")]

Life defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include:

*   _Bacteria_ – Bacteria reproduce through [binary fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_(biology) "Fission (biology)"). A parent bacterium splits itself into two identical daughter cells which eventually then split themselves in half. This process repeats, thus making the bacterium essentially immortal. A 2005 [PLoS Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLoS_Biology "PLoS Biology") paper[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-28) suggests that after each division the daughter cells can be identified as the older and the younger, and the older is slightly smaller, weaker, and more likely to die than the younger.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-29)
*   _[Turritopsis dohrnii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis\_dohrnii "Turritopsis dohrnii")_, a jellyfish (phylum [Cnidaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria "Cnidaria"), class [Hydrozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrozoa "Hydrozoa"), order [Anthoathecata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthoathecata "Anthoathecata")), after becoming a sexually mature adult, can transform itself back into a [polyp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(zoology) "Polyp (zoology)") using the cell conversion process of [transdifferentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdifferentiation "Transdifferentiation").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-CheatingDeath-30)_Turritopsis dohrnii_ repeats this cycle, meaning that it may have an [indefinite lifespan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_lifespan "Indefinite lifespan").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-CheatingDeath-30) Its immortal adaptation has allowed it to spread from its original habitat in the Caribbean to "all over the world".[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Telegraph-immortal-jellyfish-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-32)
*   _[Hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra\_(genus) "Hydra (genus)")_ is a [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus "Genus") belonging to the phylum [Cnidaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria "Cnidaria"), the class [Hydrozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrozoa "Hydrozoa") and the order [Anthomedusae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthomedusae "Anthomedusae"). They are simple fresh-water [predatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory "Predatory") animals possessing [radial symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(biology)#Radial_symmetry "Symmetry (biology)").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-34)

As the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no [thermodynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics "Second law of thermodynamics") necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in [free energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy "Gibbs free energy") from the environment and unloads its [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy") as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution"), but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere "end replication problem" are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-35) This may be a tradeoff between selecting for cancer and selecting for aging.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-36)

Modern theories on the evolution of aging include the following:

*   Mutation accumulation is a theory formulated by [Peter Medawar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Medawar "Peter Medawar") in 1952 to explain how evolution would select for aging. Essentially, aging is never selected against, as organisms have offspring before the mortal mutations surface in an individual.
*   [Antagonistic pleiotropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy "Pleiotropy") is a theory proposed as an alternative by [George C. Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Williams_(biologist) "George C. Williams (biologist)"), a critic of Medawar, in 1957. In antagonistic pleiotropy, genes carry effects that are both beneficial and detrimental. In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on, i.e. decline and death.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-37)
*   The disposable soma theory was proposed in 1977 by [Thomas Kirkwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kirkwood "Tom Kirkwood"), which states that an individual body must allocate energy for metabolism, reproduction, and maintenance, and must compromise when there is food scarcity. Compromise in allocating energy to the repair function is what causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age, according to Kirkwood.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-38)

#### Immortality of the germline

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Immortality of the germline")]

Individual organisms ordinarily age and die, while the germlines which connect successive generations are potentially immortal. The basis for this difference is a fundamental problem in biology. The Russian biologist and historian [Zhores A. Medvedev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhores_A._Medvedev "Zhores A. Medvedev")[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Medvedev1981-39) considered that the accuracy of [genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome "Genome") replicative and other synthetic systems alone cannot explain the immortality of [germlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline "Germline"). Rather Medvedev thought that known features of the biochemistry and genetics of [sexual reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction "Sexual reproduction") indicate the presence of unique information maintenance and restoration processes at the different stages of [gametogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gametogenesis "Gametogenesis"). In particular, Medvedev considered that the most important opportunities for information maintenance of [germ cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell "Germ cell") are created by [recombination during meiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination "Genetic recombination") and [DNA repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair "DNA repair"); he saw these as processes within the germ cells that were capable of restoring the integrity of [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") and [chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome "Chromosome") from the types of damage that cause irreversible aging in [somatic cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell "Somatic cell").

### Prospects for human biological immortality

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Prospects for human biological immortality")]

#### Life-extending substances

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Life-extending substances")]

Some[_[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] scientists believe that boosting the amount or proportion of [telomerase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase "Telomerase") in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of [chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome "Chromosome"), could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre ([Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid "Madrid")) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were "[genetically engineered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering "Genetic engineering") to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice".[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-40)

In normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their [Hayflick limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit "Hayflick limit"). With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA"), and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging.

[Embryonic stem cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_stem_cells "Embryonic stem cells") express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most [somatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_(biology) "Somatic (biology)") cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner.

#### Technological immortality, biological machines, and "swallowing the doctor"

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Technological immortality, biological machines, and  \"swallowing the doctor\"")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Protein_translation.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Protein_translation.gif)

 A [ribosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome "Ribosome") is a [biological machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_machine "Biological machine") that utilizes [protein domain dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain_dynamics "Protein domain dynamics"), leading [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman") to [suggest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_Plenty_of_Room_at_the_Bottom "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom") a [medical use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomedicine#Cell_repair_machines "Nanomedicine") for nanotechnology [Protein domain dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain_dynamics "Protein domain dynamics") can be seen by [neutron spin echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_spin_echo "Neutron spin echo") spectroscopy

Technological immortality may be possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, [biological engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_engineering "Biological engineering"), [regenerative medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_medicine "Regenerative medicine"), [microbiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology "Microbiology"), etc. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of [human cloning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cloning "Human cloning"), cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. [Robert Freitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Freitas "Robert Freitas"), a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical [nanorobots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanorobot "Nanorobot") could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-41) Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in [nanomedicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomedicine "Nanomedicine") could give rise to [life extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_extension#Nanotechnology "Life extension") through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [K. Eric Drexler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Eric_Drexler "K. Eric Drexler"), one of the founders of [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology"), postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and using as yet hypothetical [biological machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_machine "Biological machine"), in his 1986 book [Engines of Creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engines_of_Creation "Engines of Creation"). [Raymond Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Kurzweil "Raymond Kurzweil"), a [futurist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist "Futurist") and [transhumanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanist "Transhumanist"), stated in his book _[The Singularity Is Near](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Singularity\_Is\_Near "The Singularity Is Near")_ that he believes that advanced medical [nanorobotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanorobotics "Nanorobotics") could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-42) According to [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman"), it was his former graduate student and collaborator [Albert Hibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hibbs "Albert Hibbs") who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a _medical_ use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [biological machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_machine "Biological machine")). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "swallow the doctor". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay _[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s\_Plenty\_of\_Room\_at\_the\_Bottom "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom")._[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-43)

[Cryonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics "Cryonics"), the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to 'pause' for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients' diseases have been discovered and [aging is reversible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejuvenation_(aging) "Rejuvenation (aging)"). Modern cryonics procedures use a process called [vitrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation#Vitrification "Cryopreservation") which creates a glass-like state rather than [freezing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual's mind.

#### Mind-to-computer uploading

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Mind-to-computer uploading")]

One idea that has been advanced involves [uploading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading "Mind uploading") an individual's habits and memories via [direct mind-computer interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_mind-computer_interface "Direct mind-computer interface"). The individual's memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. [Extropian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extropian "Extropian")[futurists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_studies "Futures studies") like Moravec and [Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil "Ray Kurzweil") have proposed that, thanks to [exponentially growing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth "Exponential growth") computing power, it will someday be possible to [upload human consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading "Mind uploading") onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment.

This could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person's entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science) "Identity (social science)"), thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer.

Another possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual's original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-45)

It is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") in the functions of the [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind"). An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-46) Research on [neural correlates of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_correlates_of_consciousness "Neural correlates of consciousness") is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_][_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Transforming a human into a [cyborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg "Cyborg") can include [brain implants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_implants "Brain implants") or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-47) Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

#### Digital immortality

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Digital immortality")]

As late as 1952, the editorial staff of the _[Syntopicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Syntopicon:\_An\_Index\_to\_The\_Great\_Ideas "A Syntopicon: An Index to The Great Ideas")_ found in their compilation of the [Great Books of the Western World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World "Great Books of the Western World"), that "The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man's soul."[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Syntopicon_I_788-48) Thus, the vast majority of speculation on immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the afterlife.

The viewpoints of [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"), [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam"), and [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism "Judaism") regarding the concept of immortality diverge as each [faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith "Faith") system encapsulates unique [theological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological "Theological") interpretations and doctrines on the enduring [human nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature "Human nature")[soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul "Soul") or [spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality").

Adam and Eve condemned to mortality. [Hans Holbein the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger "Hans Holbein the Younger"), _Danse Macabre_, 16th century

[Christian theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") holds that [Adam and Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve "Adam and Eve") lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants through [the Fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man "Fall of man"), although this initial "imperishability of the bodily frame of man" was "a preternatural condition".[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Syntopicon_I_784-49)

Christians who profess the [Nicene Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be resurrected from the dead at the [Second Coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming "Second Coming"); this belief is known as [universal resurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_resurrection "Universal resurrection").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerkins198417%E2%80%9318-5)[Paul the Apostle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle "Paul the Apostle"), in following his past life as a [Pharisee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees "Pharisees") (a Jewish social movement that held to a future physical resurrection[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-50)), proclaims an amalgamated view of resurrected believers where both the physical and the spiritual are rebuilt in the likeness of post-resurrection Christ, who "will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body" (ESV).[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-51) This thought mirrors Paul's depiction of believers having been "buried therefore with him [that is, Christ] by baptism into death" (ESV).[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-52)

[N.T. Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.T._Wright "N.T. Wright"), a theologian and former [Bishop of Durham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Durham "Bishop of Durham"), has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told [Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)"): "Jesus' resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon [his return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming_of_Christ "Second Coming of Christ"). Part of this will be the [resurrection of all the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_resurrection "Universal resurrection"), who will 'awake', be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says [John Polkinghorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Polkinghorne "John Polkinghorne"), a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the [Intermediate state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_state_(Christianity) "Intermediate state (Christianity)")) is a period when we are in God's presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering [Christ's kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_to_Come "World to Come")."[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-53) This kingdom will consist of [Heaven and Earth "joined together in a new creation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_to_Come "World to Come"), he said.

Christian apocrypha include immortal human figures such as [Cartaphilus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartaphilus "Cartaphilus")[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-54) who were cursed with physical immortality for various transgressions against Christ during the Passion. The medieval [Waldensians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldensians "Waldensians") believed in the immortality of the soul.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Taylor_&_Francis_2021_p._5-PA48-55) Leaders of sects such as [John Asgill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Asgill "John Asgill") and [John Wroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wroe "John Wroe") taught followers that physical immortality was possible.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Coleridge_Coburn_Winer_2019_p._233-56)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Newport_Gribben_2006_p._222-57)

Many Patristic writers have connected the immortal rational soul to the image of God found in Genesis 1:26. Among them is Athanasius of Alexandria and Clement of Alexandria, who say that the immortal rational soul itself is the image of God.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-:0-58) Even Early Christian Liturgies exhibit this connection between the immortal rational soul and the creation of humanity in the image of God.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-:0-58)

Islamic beliefs bear the concept of spiritual immortality within it; following the death of a certain individual, it will be arbitrated consistent with its beliefs as well as actions and will embark on the ever-lasting place where they will abate. The [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim "Muslim") who holds the [five pillars of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_pillars_of_Islam "Five pillars of Islam") will make an entrance into the [Jannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannah "Jannah"), where they will inhabit eternally. In contrast, the _[kafir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafir "Kafir")_ goes to hell.

_[Al-Baqarah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Baqarah "Al-Baqarah")_ (2:25): "But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that their portion is gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say, 'Why, this is what we were fed with before,' for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein forever."

[Angels in Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_in_Islam "Angels in Islam") are reckoned as immortals from the perspective of Islam but most people believe that the angels will die and that the Angel of Death will die, but there is no clear text concerning this. Rather there are texts which may indicate this, and there is the well known _hadeeth_ (narration) about the "trumpet", which is a _munkar hadeeth_ (rejected report).[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-59) Alternatively, _[Jinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn "Jinn")_ have a long lifespan between 1000 and 1500.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-60)_[Khidr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khidr "Khidr")_, a prominent figure in [Sufism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism "Sufism") is given immortality but an exception. [Jesus in Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam "Jesus in Islam") was summoned to the sky by Allah's sanction to preserve him from the cross[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-61) and endow him with long life until the advent of the _[Dajjal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dajjal "Dajjal")_.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-62)_Dajjal_ is, additionally, given a long life. Jesus Christ dispatches the _Dajjal_ as he stays after 40 days, one like a year, one like a month, one like a week, and the rest of his days like normal days.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-63)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-64) The [Qur'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Qur%27an "Holy Qur'an") states that it is the ultimate fate of all life, [including humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_humanity "Ultimate fate of humanity"), to die eventually.

It symbolize the transient nature of life and challenge the concept of immortality in the physical world. This phrase reflects the impermanence of all things.

The traditional concept of an immaterial and immortal soul distinct from the body was not found in Judaism before the [Babylonian exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_exile "Babylonian exile"), but developed as a result of interaction with [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_philosophy "Persian philosophy") and [Hellenistic philosophies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy "Hellenistic philosophy"). Accordingly, the Hebrew word _[nephesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephesh "Nephesh")_, although translated as _"soul"_ in some older English-language Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to "living being".[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-65)[_[need quotation to verify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]_Nephesh_ was rendered in the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint "Septuagint") as ψυχή (_psūchê_), the Greek word for 'soul'.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The only Hebrew word traditionally translated "soul" (_nephesh_) in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul.[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-67) In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated "soul" (ψυχή) has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul.[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-68)_"Soul"_ may refer either to the whole person, the self, as in "three thousand _souls_" were converted in [Acts 2:41](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Acts%202:41&version=nrsv) (see [Acts 3:23](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Acts%203:23&version=nrsv)).

The [Hebrew Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible "Hebrew Bible") speaks about _[Sheol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheol "Sheol")_ (שאול), originally a synonym of the grave – the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence, until the [resurrection of the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techiyat_hamaysim "Techiyat hamaysim"). This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in [Daniel 12:1–4](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+12:1) although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the [intertestamental period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertestamental_period "Intertestamental period").

The views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in [Second Temple period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple_period "Second Temple period"). The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [2 Maccabees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Maccabees "2 Maccabees"), according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-69) Resurrection of the dead is specified in detail in the extra-canonical books of [Enoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch "Book of Enoch"),[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-70) and in [Apocalypse of Baruch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_Apocalypse_of_Baruch "Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch").[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-71) According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [P.R. Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_R._Davies "Philip R. Davies"), there is "little or no clear reference ... either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead" in the [Dead Sea scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_scrolls "Dead Sea scrolls") texts.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-72) Both [Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus "Josephus") and the [New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament") record that the [Sadducees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees "Sadducees") did not believe in an [afterlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife "Afterlife"),[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-73) but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [Pharisees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees "Pharisees"). The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-74) According to [Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus "Josephus"), who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be [reincarnated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation "Reincarnation") and "pass into other bodies", while "the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment."[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-75) The [Book of Jubilees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Jubilees "Book of Jubilees") seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-76)

[Rabbinic Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbinic_Judaism "Rabbinic Judaism") believes that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the [Messianic Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messianic_Age "Messianic Age"), with the coming of the [messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_in_Judaism "Messiah in Judaism"). They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh "Tanakh") is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The perspectives on immortality within [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism") and [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism") exhibit nuanced differences, with each [spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality")[tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition "Tradition") offering distinctive [theological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological "Theological") interpretations and doctrines concerning the [eternal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity "Eternity") essence of the [human soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_soul "Human soul") or [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness").

Representation of a soul undergoing _[punarjanma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation "Reincarnation")_. Illustration from _Hinduism Today_, 2004

[Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism") believe in an immortal soul which is [reincarnated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation "Reincarnation") after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called _[samsara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsara "Samsara")_. If they live their life well, their _[karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma "Karma")_ improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss. There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

There are explicit renderings in the [Upanishads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishad "Upanishad") alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the [Shvetashvatara Upanishad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shvetashvatara_Upanishad "Shvetashvatara Upanishad") (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated "When earth, water, fire, air and sky arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death."

Another view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of [Maharishi Mahesh Yogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi "Maharishi Mahesh Yogi"):

> That man indeed whom these (contacts)
> 
> do not disturb, who is even-minded in
> 
> pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit
> 
> for immortality, O best of men.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi-77)

To Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, "Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life."[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi-77)

An Indian Tamil saint known as [Vallalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallalar "Vallalar") claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-78)[_[unreliable source?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable\_sources "Wikipedia:Reliable sources")_][[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-79)

One of the three marks of existence in Buddhism is [anattā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatt%C4%81 "Anattā"), "non-self". This teaching states that the body does not have an eternal soul but is composed of five [skandhas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandhas "Skandhas") or aggregates. Additionally, another mark of existence is impermanence, also called [anicca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anicca "Anicca"), which runs directly counter to concepts of immortality or permanence. According to one [Tibetan Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhist "Tibetan Buddhist") teaching, [Dzogchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzogchen "Dzogchen"), individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal [body of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_light "Body of light") called the [rainbow body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_body "Rainbow body").[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTERangdrolMatthieu2001153-80)

#### Ancient Greek religion

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Ancient Greek religion")]

Immortality in [ancient Greek religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion "Ancient Greek religion") originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer"), [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod"), and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either [Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium "Elysium"), the [Islands of the Blessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islands_of_the_Blessed "Islands of the Blessed"), heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground. Among those humans made immortal were [Amphiaraus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiaraus "Amphiaraus"), [Ganymede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(mythology) "Ganymede (mythology)"), [Ino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ino_(Greek_mythology) "Ino (Greek mythology)"), [Iphigenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia "Iphigenia"), [Menelaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menelaus "Menelaus"), [Peleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peleus "Peleus"), and a great number of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. [Asclepius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepius "Asclepius") was killed by Zeus, and by [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo "Apollo")'s request, was subsequently immortalized as a star.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-ReferenceA-81)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Sabine_G_p.47-82)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Theony_Condos_p.141-83)

In [ancient Greek religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion "Ancient Greek religion") a number of men and women have been interpreted as being resurrected and made [immortal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#Ancient_Greek_religion). [Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles "Achilles"), after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother [Thetis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetis "Thetis") and brought to an immortal existence in either Leuce, the [Elysian plains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium "Elysium") or the [Islands of the Blessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortunate_Isles "Fortunate Isles"). [Memnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memnon_(mythology) "Memnon (mythology)"), who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. [Alcmene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcmene "Alcmene"), [Castor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_and_Pollux "Castor and Pollux"), [Heracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles "Heracles"), and [Melicertes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melicertes "Melicertes"), are also among the figures interpreted to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to [Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus "Herodotus")'s [_Histories_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histories_(Herodotus) "Histories (Herodotus)"), the seventh century BC sage [Aristeas of Proconnesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristeas_of_Proconnesus "Aristeas of Proconnesus") was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. He would reappear alive years later.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-84) However, Greek attitudes towards resurrection were generally negative, and the idea of resurrection was considered neither desirable nor possible.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-85) For example, [Asclepius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepius "Asclepius") was killed by Zeus for using herbs to resurrect the dead, but by his father [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo "Apollo")'s request, was subsequently immortalized as a star.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-ReferenceA-81)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Sabine_G_p.47-82)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Theony_Condos_p.141-83)

Writing his _Lives of Illustrious Men_ ([Parallel Lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Lives "Parallel Lives")) in the first century, the [Middle Platonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Platonism "Middle Platonism") philosopher [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch") in his chapter on [Romulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus "Romulus") gave an account of the king's mysterious disappearance and subsequent deification, comparing it to Greek tales such as the physical immortalization of Alcmene and Aristeas the [Proconnesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proconnesian "Proconnesian"), "for they say Aristeas died in a fuller's work-shop, and his friends coming to look for him, found his body vanished; and that some presently after, coming from abroad, said they met him traveling towards Croton". Plutarch openly scorned such beliefs held in ancient Greek religion, writing, "many such improbabilities do your fabulous writers relate, deifying creatures naturally mortal."[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-86) Likewise, he writes that while something within humans comes from the gods and returns to them after death, this happens "only when it is most completely separated and set free from the body, and becomes altogether pure, fleshless, and undefiled."[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-87)

The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later belief in the resurrection of Jesus was not lost on early Christians, as [Justin Martyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Martyr "Justin Martyr") argued:

"when we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus."[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-88)
The philosophical idea of an immortal soul was a belief first appearing with either [Pherecydes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pherecydes_of_Syros "Pherecydes of Syros") or the [Orphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphics "Orphics"), and most importantly advocated by [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-FOOTNOTERohde1925-13)

[Zoroastrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrian "Zoroastrian") believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for "immortal" is associated with the month "Amurdad", meaning "deathless" in Persian, in the [Iranian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendar "Iranian calendar") (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or [Ameretat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameretat "Ameretat") is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the "Angel of Immortality" won over the "Angel of Death" in this month.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-89)

### Philosophical religions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Philosophical religions")]

It is repeatedly stated in the _[Lüshi Chunqiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCshi\_Chunqiu "Lüshi Chunqiu")_ that death is unavoidable.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-90)[Henri Maspero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Maspero "Henri Maspero") noted that many scholarly works frame Taoism as a school of thought focused on the quest for immortality.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-91) Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a _way of life_ than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-92) In the Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, a traditional teaching, spiritual immortality can be rewarded to people who do a certain amount of good deeds and live a simple, pure life. A list of good deeds and sins are tallied to determine whether or not a mortal is worthy. Spiritual immortality in this definition allows the soul to leave the earthly realms of afterlife and go to pure realms in the Taoist cosmology.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-93)

Philosophical arguments for the immortality of the soul
-------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Philosophical arguments for the immortality of the soul")]

[Alcmaeon of Croton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcmaeon_of_Croton "Alcmaeon of Croton") argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-alcmaeon-94)

[Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")'s _[Phaedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedo "Phaedo")_ advances four arguments for the soul's immortality:[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-95)

*   The [Cyclical Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedo#The_Cyclical_Argument "Phaedo"), or Opposites Argument explains that [Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms "Theory of forms") are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily "imperishable". As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of magnets.
*   The [Theory of Recollection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamnesis_(philosophy) "Anamnesis (philosophy)") explains that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato's _[Meno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meno "Meno")_, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in _Phaedo_.
*   The [Affinity Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedo#The_Affinity_Argument "Phaedo"), explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live.
*   The [Argument from Form of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedo#The_Argument_from_Form_of_Life "Phaedo") or The Final Argument explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die.

[Plotinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotinus "Plotinus") offers a version of the argument that Kant calls "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Plotinus first argues that the soul is [simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_(philosophy) "Simple (philosophy)"), then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with [Moses Mendelssohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Mendelssohn "Moses Mendelssohn")'s [Phaedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedon "Phaedon").[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-96)

[Theodore Metochites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Metochites "Theodore Metochites") argues that part of the soul's nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved – an impossibility if they are one and the same.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-metochites-97)

[Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna") argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-103)

The full argument for the immortality of the soul and [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas")' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the _[Summa Theologica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa\_Theologica "Summa Theologica")_.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-104)

[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-105)

In early work, [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz") endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his [monadology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology "Monadology") he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-106)

[Moses Mendelssohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Mendelssohn "Moses Mendelssohn")'s _[Phaedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedon "Phaedon")_ is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue _[Phaedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedo "Phaedo")_, in which [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-107)

The possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include [persistent vegetative states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_vegetative_state "Persistent vegetative state"), the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, [social and economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_enhancement#Inequality_and_Social_Disruption "Human enhancement") disparities created by [longevity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity "Longevity"), and survival of the [heat death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe "Heat death of the universe").

Physical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in the myth of [Tithonus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithonus "Tithonus"), or in [Mary Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley "Mary Shelley")'s short story _[The Mortal Immortal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Mortal\_Immortal "The Mortal Immortal")_, where the protagonist lives to witness everyone he cares about die around him. For additional examples in fiction, see [Immortality in fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality_in_fiction "Immortality in fiction").

[Kagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly_Kagan "Shelly Kagan") (2012)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Kagan-2012-Death-108) argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan's argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not:

*   If our characters remain basically the same – that is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now – then eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious.
*   If, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed – e.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures – then such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them.

Either way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Kagan-2012-Death-108)

If human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the world's [social structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structures "Social structures"). Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own [mortality](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mortality "wikt:mortality") shapes their behavior.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-110) With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global [demographic shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_shift "Demographic shift") of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-111) The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society.

Sociology has a growing body of literature on the sociology of immortality, which details the different attempts at reaching immortality (whether actual or symbolic) and their prominence in the 21st century. These attempts include renewed attention to the dead in the West,[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-112) practices of online memorialization,[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-113) and biomedical attempts to increase longevity.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-114) These attempts at reaching immortality and their effects in societal structures have led some to argue that we are becoming a "Postmortal Society".[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-115)[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-116) Foreseen changes to societies derived from the pursuit of immortality would encompass societal paradigms and worldviews, as well as the institutional landscape. Similarly, different forms of reaching immortality might entail a significant reconfiguration of societies, from becoming more technologically oriented to becoming more aligned with nature.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-117)

Immortality would increase population growth,[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-118) bringing with it many consequences as for example the impact of population growth on the environment and [planetary boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries "Planetary boundaries").

Although some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable,[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-119) there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-120)

Some scholars critique the increasing support for immortality projects. Panagiotis Pentaris speculates that defeating ageing as the cause of death comes with a cost: "heightened stratification of humans in society and a wider gap between social classes".[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-:1-121) Others suggest that other immortality projects like transhumanist digital immortality, radical life extension and cryonics are part of the capitalist fabric of exploitation and control,[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-:2-122) which aims to extend privileged lives of the economic elite.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-123) In this sense, immortality could become a political-economic battleground for the twenty-first century between the haves and have-nots.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-:1-121)[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-:2-122)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Ankh.svg/120px-Ankh.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ankh.svg)

The ankh

There are numerous symbols representing immortality. The [ankh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") is an Egyptian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the [gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Egyptian_deities "Category:Egyptian deities") and [pharaohs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh "Pharaoh"), who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip "Möbius strip") in the shape of a [trefoil knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot "Trefoil knot") is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the [Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros "Ouroboros"), the Chinese fungus of longevity, the _ten_[kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji "Kanji"), the [phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology) "Phoenix (mythology)"), the [peacock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock "Peacock") in Christianity,[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-124) and the colors amaranth (in [Western culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture")) and peach (in [Chinese culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_culture "Chinese culture")).

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_ref-45 "Jump up")** The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain. — Sandberg & Boström (2008)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-Sandberg-Bostr%C3%B6m-2008-Roadmap-44)
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_ref-67 "Jump up")** "Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term _"soul"_, we must be clear that scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force."[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality#cite_note-66)[_[full citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources#What\_information\_to\_include "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_]

"Soul" refers to one's life: Herod sought Jesus' _soul_ ([Matt. 2:20](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Matthew%202:20&version=nrsv)); one might save a _soul_ or take it ([Mark 3:4](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Mark%203:4&version=nrsv)); death occurs when God "requires your _soul_" ([Luke 12:20](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Luke%2012:20&version=nrsv)).
