1715834 CD-ROM issue ISSN 1092-0145 Links Journal homepage Archives Physical Review Letters ( PRL ), established in 1958, is a peer-reviewed , scientific journal that is published 52 times per year by the American Physical Society . The journal is considered one of the most prestigious in the field of physics . Over a quarter of Physics Nobel Prize -winning papers between 1995 and 2017 were published in it.

[ 1 ] PRL is published both online and as a print journal. Its focus is on short articles ("letters") intended for quick publication. The Lead Editor is Hugues Chaté. The Managing Editor is Robert Garisto.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] History [ edit ] The journal was created in 1958.

Samuel Goudsmit , who was then the editor of Physical Review , the American Physical Society's flagship journal, organized and published Letters to the Editor of Physical Review into a new standalone journal , which became Physical Review Letters . It was the first journal intended for the rapid publication of short articles, a format that eventually became popular in many other fields.

[ 4 ] Notable articles [ edit ] 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers First report of a functional scanning tunneling microscope (1982) [ 5 ] Invention of the atomic force microscope (1986) [ 6 ] First observation of gravitational waves (2016) [ 7 ] Scope [ edit ] PRL covers all areas of physics. The journal is divided into the following sections: [ 2 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] General Physics : Statistical and Quantum mechanics , Quantum information , etc.

Gravitation and astrophysics Elementary particles and fields Nuclear physics Atomic, molecular, and optical physics Nonlinear dynamics , Fluid dynamics , Classical optics , etc.

Plasma and beam physics Condensed matter : Structure, etc.

Condensed Matter: Semiconductor-Electronic properties, etc.

Polymer , Soft matter , Biological, and Interdisciplinary physics A section before the table of contents highlights a small number of particularly notable articles in each edition.
