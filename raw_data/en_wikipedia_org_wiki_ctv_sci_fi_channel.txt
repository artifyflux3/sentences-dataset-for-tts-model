**CTV Sci-Fi Channel** is a Canadian English-language [discretionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_service "Discretionary service")[specialty channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_channel "Specialty channel") owned by [Bell Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Media "Bell Media") subsidairy of [BCE Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCE_Inc. "BCE Inc."). The channel primarily broadcasts [speculative fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction "Speculative fiction") and related programming.

The network was launched on October 17, 1997 as **Space** under its original parent company [CHUM Limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHUM_Limited "CHUM Limited"). Its slogan, _The Imagination Station_, continued to be used informally by its fans for many years after its retirement. In 2007, Space was acquired by CTVglobemedia, after acquiring CHUM Limited, while the [Citytv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citytv "Citytv") stations were sold to [Rogers Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Sports_%26_Media "Rogers Sports & Media"). The channel adopted its current name in 2019.

The channel was licensed by the [Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Radio-television_and_Telecommunications_Commission "Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission") (CRTC) in 1996.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Sci-Fi_Channel#cite_note-1) It launched on October 17, 1997 at 6:00 p.m. [ET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone "Eastern Time Zone") (3:00 p.m. [PT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone "Pacific Time Zone")), as **Space**: The Imagination Station, launching under the ownership of [CHUM Limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHUM_Limited "CHUM Limited"), airing the film _[Forbidden Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden\_Planet "Forbidden Planet")_, followed by a commentary on that film by author [Robert J. Sawyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Sawyer "Robert J. Sawyer"), followed by the film _[Mars Attacks!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\_Attacks! "Mars Attacks!")_. The Sawyer commentary was the first example of the interstitial materials — mostly produced by [Mark Askwith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Askwith "Mark Askwith") — that became SPACE's signature: short, snappy, mini-documentaries on science fiction and science topics shown between programs, collectively known as "SPACE Flow". Daily installments include _Space News_ (formerly _SPIN_, for "Space Information and News").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Sci-Fi_Channel#cite_note-2)

CTVglobemedia took over Space on June 22, 2007, as a result of a takeover of [CHUM Limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHUM_Limited "CHUM Limited").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] At the same time, the [Citytv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citytv "Citytv") stations were sold to [Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Sports_%26_Media "Rogers Sports & Media") later that year. Ownership changed hands once again when on April 1, 2011, [BCE Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Canada "Bell Canada") gained 100% control of CTVglobemedia's non-publishing assets that it did not already own, placing Space under the ownership of [Bell Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Media "Bell Media").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

On February 8, 2011, the [Reeves-Stevenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_and_Garfield_Reeves-Stevens "Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens") submitted a letter to the [Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Radio-television_and_Telecommunications_Commission "Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission") (CRTC) in support of an application by CTVglobemedia to renew the broadcasting license of Space.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Sci-Fi_Channel#cite_note-3)

On July 6, 2011, a [high definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television "High-definition television") simulcast of Space was launched.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Sci-Fi_Channel#cite_note-4) It is available through all major television providers in Canada.

On March 4, 2013, Space introduced a new logo to coincide with the premiere of the channel's new original co-production _[Orphan Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan\_Black "Orphan Black")_. A Bell Media executive explained that the branding was designed to reflect upon the broadening of the sci-fi genre beyond [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") and "people in polyester onesies running around with taser guns", by portraying the new logo in the form of real-life objects with a "[phenomenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenalism "Phenomenalism") twist" to symbolize the "space around you".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Sci-Fi_Channel#cite_note-5) Through Bell Media's acquisition of [Astral Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_Media "Astral Media"), Space is now co-owned with the French-language, sci-fi channel, Ztélé (since renamed [Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(TV_channel) "Z (TV channel)")).

On June 7, 2018, it was announced that Space would be rebranded as "CTV Sci-Fi", as part of a re-alignment of several Bell Media specialty channels under the [CTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Television_Network "CTV Television Network") brand.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Sci-Fi_Channel#cite_note-6) The following year, it was revealed the channel would instead rebrand as CTV Sci-Fi Channel on September 12, 2019.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Sci-Fi_Channel#cite_note-7)

CTV Sci-Fi Channel's programming includes scripted television series and films primarily focused on the [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction"), [fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy "Fantasy"), [superhero fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_fiction "Superhero fiction"), [horror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film "Horror film"), and [paranormal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal "Paranormal") genres, often in a [marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_(media) "Marathon (media)") format outside of prime time. The channel's original programming has included in-studio shows (including the daily newsmagazine _[Innerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innerspace\_(TV\_series) "Innerspace (TV series)")_), scripted dramas, as well as shows co-produced with the American channel [Syfy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syfy "Syfy"), from which the channel also acquires the bulk of its programming.

The channel holds the linear television rights to the _[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Trek "Star Trek")_ television franchise in Canada, holding library rights to past _Star Trek_ television seasons and movies, and having acquired the rights to the newer _Star Trek_ era, beginning with _[Star Trek: Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Trek:\_Discovery "Star Trek: Discovery")_, that are produced for the [Paramount+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount%2B "Paramount+") streaming service.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Sci-Fi_Channel#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Sci-Fi_Channel#cite_note-GlobeMail-2016-05-18-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Sci-Fi_Channel#cite_note-TorStar-2018-04-23-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Sci-Fi_Channel#cite_note-BellMedia-11)
