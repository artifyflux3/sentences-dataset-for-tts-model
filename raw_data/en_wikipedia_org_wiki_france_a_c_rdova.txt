[ 8 ] [ 9 ] At the end of her term, Purdue's trustees credited her with leading the school to record levels of research funding, reputational rankings, and student retention rates.

[ 10 ] Córdova's scientific career contributions have been in the areas of observational and experimental astrophysics , multi-spectral research on x-ray and gamma ray sources, and space-borne instrumentation. She has published more than 150 scientific papers, most recently in 2007.

[ 15 ] One of her hobbies is rock climbing, a hobby where she met her husband.

[ 16 ] In a Physics Today article she talks about how she turned down an offer from her advisor to be nominated as an astronaut, preferring instead to focus on research.

[ 17 ] In an interview with the American Institute of Physics, she describes her career decisions and life path in greater detail. She said that being a physicist influenced her leadership style, that she is optimistic about the future and that one never knows when they will use the knowledge they learn.

[ 18 ] Honors and awards [ edit ] In 1996, she received NASA's highest honor, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal . She was recognized as a 2000 Kilby Laureate , for "contributions to society through science, technology, innovation, invention, and education."
