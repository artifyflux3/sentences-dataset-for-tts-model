In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **hypersurface** is a generalization of the concepts of [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane"), [plane curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_curve "Plane curve"), and [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)"). A hypersurface is a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") or an [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") of dimension _n_ − 1, which is [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(mathematics) "Embedding (mathematics)") in an [ambient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_space "Ambient space") of dimension _n_, generally a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") or a [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersurface#cite_note-1) Hypersurfaces share, with surfaces in a [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"), the property of being defined by a single [implicit equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_equation "Implicit equation"), at least locally (near every point), and sometimes globally.

A hypersurface in a (Euclidean, affine, or projective) space of dimension two is a plane curve. In a space of dimension three, it is a surface.

For example, the equation

![Image 1: {\displaystyle x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\cdots +x_{n}^{2}-1=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66fd49be6c916225671aa07fdad66702246e2968)
defines an algebraic hypersurface of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety "Dimension of an algebraic variety")_n_ − 1 in the Euclidean space of dimension _n_. This hypersurface is also a [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold"), and is called a [hypersphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersphere "Hypersphere") or an [(_n_ – 1)-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere").

Smooth hypersurface
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypersurface&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Smooth hypersurface")]

A hypersurface that is a [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold") is called a _smooth hypersurface_.

In **R**_n_, a smooth hypersurface is [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersurface#cite_note-2) Every [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space")[compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") smooth hypersurface is a [level set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_set "Level set"), and separates **R**_n_ into two connected components; this is related to the [Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem#Proof_and_generalizations "Jordan curve theorem").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersurface#cite_note-Lima-3)

Affine algebraic hypersurface
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypersurface&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Affine algebraic hypersurface")]

An **algebraic hypersurface** is an [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") that may be defined by a single implicit equation of the form

![Image 2: {\displaystyle p(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0002029058375328a08119596ffd6642dc0e3f90)
where p is a [multivariate polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_polynomial "Multivariate polynomial"). Generally the polynomial is supposed to be [irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_polynomial "Irreducible polynomial"). When this is not the case, the hypersurface is not an algebraic variety, but only an [algebraic set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_set "Algebraic set"). It may depend on the authors or the context whether a reducible polynomial defines a hypersurface. For avoiding ambiguity, the term _irreducible hypersurface_ is often used.

As for algebraic varieties, the coefficients of the defining polynomial may belong to any fixed [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")k, and the points of the hypersurface are the [zeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function") of p in the [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space")![Image 3: {\displaystyle K^{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd4629d292796a8f77ca8c5776201f671d6123ea) where K is an [algebraically closed extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_extension "Algebraically closed extension") of k.

A hypersurface may have [singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety "Singular point of an algebraic variety"), which are the common zeros, if any, of the defining polynomial and its partial derivatives. In particular, a real algebraic hypersurface is not necessarily a manifold.

Hypersurfaces have some specific properties that are not shared with other algebraic varieties.

One of the main such properties is [Hilbert's Nullstellensatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_Nullstellensatz "Hilbert's Nullstellensatz"), which asserts that a hypersurface contains a given [algebraic set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_set "Algebraic set") if and only if the defining polynomial of the hypersurface has a power that belongs to the [ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)") generated by the defining polynomials of the algebraic set.

A corollary of this theorem is that, if two [irreducible polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_polynomial "Irreducible polynomial") (or more generally two [square-free polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-free_polynomial "Square-free polynomial")) define the same hypersurface, then one is the product of the other by a nonzero constant.

Hypersurfaces are exactly the subvarieties of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety "Dimension of an algebraic variety")_n_ – 1 of an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") of dimension of n. This is the geometric interpretation of the fact that, in a polynomial ring over a field, the [height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height_(ring_theory) "Height (ring theory)") of an ideal is 1 if and only if the ideal is a [principal ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_ideal "Principal ideal"). In the case of possibly reducible hypersurfaces, this result may be restated as follows: hypersurfaces are exactly the algebraic sets whose all irreducible components have dimension _n_ – 1.

### Real and rational points

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypersurface&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Real and rational points")]

A _real hypersurface_ is a hypersurface that is defined by a polynomial with [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") coefficients. In this case the algebraically closed field over which the points are defined is generally the field ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7) of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"). The _real points_ of a real hypersurface are the points that belong to ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}\subset \mathbb {C} ^{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4cd1e5d95313d0624164f1d980432c246ed1fad) The set of the real points of a real hypersurface is the _real part_ of the hypersurface. Often, it is left to the context whether the term _hypersurface_ refers to all points or only to the real part.

If the coefficients of the defining polynomial belong to a field k that is not [algebraically closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_field "Algebraically closed field") (typically the field of [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"), a [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field") or a [number field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_field "Number field")), one says that the hypersurface is _defined over_ k, and the points that belong to ![Image 6: {\displaystyle k^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29d0ca5fd176db2867ec07a961a31f17bc6fb07e) are _[rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational\_point "Rational point")_ over k (in the case of the field of rational numbers, "over k" is generally omitted).

For example, the imaginary [n-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere") defined by the equation

![Image 7: {\displaystyle x_{0}^{2}+\cdots +x_{n}^{2}+1=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e3ffc8b06c5e54367dca70961ad3ce7e42e48a7b)
is a real hypersurface without any real point, which is defined over the rational numbers. It has no rational point, but has many points that are rational over the [Gaussian rationals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_rational "Gaussian rational").

Projective algebraic hypersurface
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypersurface&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Projective algebraic hypersurface")]

A _projective (algebraic) hypersurface_ of dimension _n_ – 1 in a [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space") of dimension n over a field k is defined by a [homogeneous polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial "Homogeneous polynomial")![Image 8: {\displaystyle P(x_{0},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fde948d9c95b520dcdfd07db550f879628db190f) in _n_ + 1 indeterminates. As usual, _homogeneous polynomial_ means that all [monomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial "Monomial") of P have the same degree, or, equivalently that ![Image 9: {\displaystyle P(cx_{0},cx_{1},\ldots ,cx_{n})=c^{d}P(x_{0},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b646bb20fcf176c365167d6b42bbcd67d7481a7) for every constant c, where d is the degree of the polynomial. The _points_ of the hypersurface are the points of the projective space whose [projective coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_coordinates "Projective coordinates") are zeros of P.

If one chooses the [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane") of equation ![Image 10: {\displaystyle x_{0}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d18a96da37e1748deeb8d4c590dd4ad6629efef) as [hyperplane at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_at_infinity "Hyperplane at infinity"), the complement of this hyperplane is an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"), and the points of the projective hypersurface that belong to this affine space form an affine hypersurface of equation ![Image 11: {\displaystyle P(1,x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7ac2439d978b3c33040b32e368893696da91290) Conversely, given an affine hypersurface of equation ![Image 12: {\displaystyle p(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0002029058375328a08119596ffd6642dc0e3f90) it defines a projective hypersurface, called its _projective completion_, whose equation is obtained by [homogenizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial#Homogenization "Homogeneous polynomial")p. That is, the equation of the projective completion is ![Image 13: {\displaystyle P(x_{0},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3dd6be6662a300dcac4f8fc6456e5aa8afd9a53) with

![Image 14: {\displaystyle P(x_{0},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})=x_{0}^{d}p(x_{1}/x_{0},\ldots ,x_{n}/x_{0}),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/058f321add32a1ca6ec9836f7417a944dab0b934)
where d is the degree of P.

These two processes projective completion and restriction to an affine subspace are inverse one to the other. Therefore, an affine hypersurface and its projective completion have essentially the same properties, and are often considered as two points-of-view for the same hypersurface.

However, it may occur that an affine hypersurface is [nonsingular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety "Singular point of an algebraic variety"), while its projective completion has singular points. In this case, one says that the affine surface is _singular at infinity_. For example, the [circular cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_cylinder "Circular cylinder") of equation

![Image 15: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-1=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ee594b8851d760d0e2d44aba714907aca657b8f)
in the affine space of dimension three has a unique singular point, which is at infinity, in the direction _x_ = 0, _y_ = 0.
