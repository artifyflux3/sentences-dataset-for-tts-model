Background [ edit ] The conditions for local finiteness were created by Jun-iti Nagata and Yury Smirnov while searching for a stronger version of the Urysohn metrization theorem . The motivation behind local finiteness was to formulate a new way to determine if a topological space X {\displaystyle X} is metrizable without the countable basis requirement from Urysohn's theorem.

[ 1 ] Definitions [ edit ] Let T = ( S , τ τ ) {\displaystyle T=(S,\tau )} be a topological space and let F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} be a set of subsets of S {\displaystyle S} Then F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} is locally finite if and only if each element of S {\displaystyle S} has a neighborhood which intersects a finite number of sets in F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} .

[ 2 ] A locally finite space is an Alexandrov space.

[ 1 ] A T 1 space is locally finite if and only if it is discrete .
