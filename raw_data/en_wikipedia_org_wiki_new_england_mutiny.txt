The club plays its home games at Lusitano Stadium .

Team history [ edit ] Established in 1999 as Springfield Sirens , the club played in the amateur W-League . After winning the W-2 (second division) championship in 2000, [ 1 ] the club played one more season in the W-League, then a season as an exhibition team before changing the team name to the New England Mutiny and accepting promotion to WPSL as one of the founding members of the East Division.

[ 2 ] On July 29, 2004, in a match preparing women's national team of China for international tournament, the Mutiny surprised the fifth ranked team in the world, in front of 3000 fans in Agawam, Massachusetts, with a 3–1 lead, and losing 4–3 only in the final minutes. The Mutiny consider this match one of their two crowning achievements.

After the folding of WPS in 2012, the club joined the new Women's Premier Soccer League Elite , which included three former WPS teams.  Although they finished fifth out of the eight WPSLE teams, they recorded wins over the Chicago Red Stars and Boston Breakers as well as a draw at the Western New York Flash – the former WPS teams – in the last month of the season.  Their win over the Breakers is the first occurrence of an amateur side beating a professional side in US women's soccer, (Chicago fielded an amateur roster in WPSLE,) and is the second of the Mutiny's crowning achievements.  WPSL-Elite lasted just one year as the former WPS teams joined the newly formed National Women's Soccer League , while the remaining teams either folded or, like the Mutiny, returned to the WPSL in 2013.

The Mutiny spent three further years in the WPSL, but after dissatisfaction with playoff procedures and handling in the WPSL, the team branched off to join the inaugural 2016 season of United Women's Soccer .
