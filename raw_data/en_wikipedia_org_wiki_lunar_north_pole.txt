The north pole is in the center The lunar north pole is the point in the Northern Hemisphere of the Moon where the lunar axis of rotation meets its surface.

The lunar North Pole is the northernmost point on the Moon, lying diametrically opposite the lunar south pole . It defines latitude 90° North. At the lunar north pole all directions point south; all lines of longitude converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value.

Craters [ edit ] Notable craters in the lunar north polar region (between 60° North latitude and the North pole) include: Avogadro , Bel'kovich , Brianchon , Emden , Gamow , Goldschmidt , Hermite , J. Herschel , Meton , Nansen , Pascal , Petermann , Philolaus , Plaskett , Pythagoras , Rozhdestvenskiy , Schwarzschild , Seares , Sommerfeld , Stebbins , Sylvester , Thales , Van't Hoff , W. Bond , and Whipple .
