For instance, if we are studying cancer rates among census tracts in a given city local clusters in the rates mean that there are areas that have higher or lower rates than is to be expected by chance alone; that is, the values occurring are above or below those of a random distribution in space.

Global indicators [ edit ] Notable global indicators of spatial association include: [ 1 ] Global Moran's I : The most commonly used measure of global spatial autocorrelation or the overall clustering of the spatial data developed by Patrick Alfred Pierce Moran .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Geary's C (Geary's Contiguity Ratio): A measure of global spatial autocorrelation developed by Roy C. Geary in 1954.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] It is inversely related to Moran's I , but more sensitive to local autocorrelation than Moran's I .

Getis–Ord G (Getis–Ord global G, Geleral G-Statistic): Introduced by Arthur Getis and J. Keith Ord in 1992 to supplement Moran's I .

[ 6 ] Local indicators [ edit ] Notable local indicators of spatial association (LISA) include: [ 1 ] Local Moran's I : Derived from Global Moran's I , it was introduced by Luc Anselin in 1995 [ 7 ] and can be computed using GeoDa .

[ 8 ] Getis–Ord G i (local G i ): Developed by Getis and Ord based on their global G .

INDICATE's I N : Originally developed to assess the spatial distribution of stars, [ 9 ] can be computed for any discrete 2+D dataset using python-based INDICATE tool available from GitHub.
