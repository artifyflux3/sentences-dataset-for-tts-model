Spielman ) American computer scientist For the Australian actor, see Dan Spielman .

Daniel Spielman Born March 1970 ( 1970-03 ) (age 55) Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , U.S.

Alma mater Yale University Massachusetts Institute of Technology Known for Smoothed analysis Awards Gödel Prize (2008, 2015) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Fulkerson Prize (2009) Nevanlinna Prize (2010) MacArthur Fellowship (2012) [ 3 ] Pólya Prize (2014) [ 4 ] Michael and Sheila Held Prize (2021) [ 5 ] Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics (2022) Scientific career Fields Computer Science Institutions Yale University Thesis Computationally Efficient Error-Correcting Codes and Holographic Proofs (1995) Doctoral advisor Michael Sipser [ 6 ] Doctoral students Nikhil Srivastava Daniel Alan Spielman (born March 1970 in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania [ 7 ] ) has been a professor of applied mathematics and computer science at Yale University since 2006. As of 2018, he is the Sterling Professor of Computer Science at Yale.  He is also the Co-Director of the Yale Institute for Network Science, since its founding, and chair of the newly established Department of Statistics and Data Science.

[ 8 ] Education [ edit ] Daniel Spielman attended The Philadelphia School, and Germantown Friends School . He received his bachelor of arts degree in mathematics and computer science from Yale University in 1992 and a PhD in applied mathematics from MIT in 1995 (his dissertation was called "Computationally Efficient Error-Correcting Codes and Holographic Proofs"). He taught in the Mathematics Department at MIT from 1996 to 2005.

Awards [ edit ] Spielman and his collaborator Shang-Hua Teng have jointly won the Gödel Prize twice: in 2008 for their work on smoothed analysis of algorithms [ 9 ] and in 2015 for their work on nearly-linear-time Laplacian solvers.

In 2010 he was awarded the Nevanlinna Prize "for smoothed analysis of Linear Programming, algorithms for graph-based codes and applications of graph theory to Numerical Computing" [ 10 ] and the same year he was named a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery .

[ 11 ] He gave a plenary lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2010.

[ 12 ] In 2012 he was part of the inaugural class of Simons Investigators providing $660,000 for five years for curiosity driven research.

[ 13 ] In October 2012, he was named a recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship .

In 2013, together with Adam Marcus and Nikhil Srivastava , he provided a positive solution to the Kadison–Singer problem , [ 14 ] [ 15 ] a result that was awarded the 2014 Pólya Prize .

In 2017 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences .

[ 16 ] In 2022 he won the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics "for breakthrough contributions to theoretical computer science and mathematics, including to spectral graph theory , the Kadison–Singer problem, numerical linear algebra, optimization, and coding theory .".
