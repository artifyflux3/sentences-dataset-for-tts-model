It was founded in 1954 by a group of distinguished Australians, including Australian Fellows of the Royal Society of London , after its forerunner, the Australian National Research Council had been dissolved.  The Academy Secretariat is in Canberra , at the Shine Dome .

History [ edit ] On 21 August 1919 the Australasian Research Council, based in Sydney , was established in order to represent Australia on the International Research Council . The council was formalised by the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and renamed the Australian National Research Council (ANRC) in July 1921.

[ 1 ] In 1951, following a scientific conference organised by the Australian National University , a new body, the Australian Academy of Science was proposed, after it was generally agreed that the ANRC "had failed to achieve the status that was required of a national body with such weighty responsibilities". The new academy was established in 1954, and, after it had assumed most of functions of the ANRC, the ANRC was dissolved in 1955, the final meeting taking place in Canberra on 16 August 1955.

[ 1 ] The academy was founded by a group of Australians, among them Australian Fellows of the Royal Society in London. The first president was Sir Mark Oliphant .

[ 2 ] Governance and description [ edit ] The Australian Academy of Science is modelled after the Royal Society, and operates under a Royal charter ; [ 2 ] as such, it is an independent body, but it has government endorsement.

The objectives of the academy are to promote science and science education through a wide range of activities; officially "promoting, declaring and disseminating scientific knowledge".

[ 3 ] .

It has defined four major program areas: [ citation needed ] Recognition of outstanding contributions to science Education and public awareness Science policy International relations The academy also runs the 22 National Committees for Science , which provide a forum to discuss issues relevant to all the scientific disciplines in Australia.

Education [ edit ] Science education is a main commitment of Australian Academy of Science. As of 2016 [update] activities included following projects: [ 4 ] Primary Connections Science by Doing Nova: science for curious minds reSolve: Mathematics by Inquiry Science booklets Brain Box The Shine Dome [ edit ] The Shine Dome The Shine Dome (previously known as Becker House) is a well-known Canberra landmark, notable for its unusual structure, and colloquially referred to as "The Martian Embassy", an allusion to its shape and the fact that as the capital of Australia, Canberra is the home of foreign embassies.

[ 5 ] It was designed by architect Sir Roy Grounds , of Grounds, Romberg and Boyd. When completed in 1959 its 45.75-metre-diameter dome was the largest in Australia.

On 1 December 1956, the academy's building design committee met in Adelaide to look over plans submitted by six architects. The plan accepted involved a 710-tonne reinforced concrete dome, which had to be supported by 16 thin supports. The concrete is approximately 60 cm thick at the base supports, and 10 cm at the top. The dome supports itself, with no internal wall holding it up. It cost £200,000 to build. The foundation stone , laid on 2 May 1958 by Prime Minister of Australia , Robert Menzies , was originally part of the pier of the Great Melbourne Telescope constructed in 1869 under the supervision of the Royal Society and transferred to Mount Stromlo Observatory in the 1940s.

The building was named Becker House, for benefactor and Fellow of the Academy Sir Jack Ellerton Becker , in 1962. In 2000, it was renamed in honour of Fellow John Shine , who donated one million dollars to renovate the dome.

The interior contains three floors: on the ground level, the main auditorium, the Ian Wark Theatre, seats 156 people, the Jaeger Room for functions and meetings, the Becker Council Meeting Room and offices; the upper level includes a gallery to the theatre and the Adolf Basser Library ; and the basement houses storage for historical records of science in Australia.

In 2016, the dome appeared in the television documentary series about Australian modernist architecture Streets of Your Town presented by Tim Ross .

On 20 January 2020 the Dome was seriously damaged by a hailstorm with smashed skylights and denting of the copper roof surface.

[ 6 ] Fellows [ edit ] Main article: List of Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science The Fellowship of the Australian Academy of Science is made up of around 500 leading Australian scientists. Scientists judged by their peers to have made an exceptional contribution to knowledge in their field may be elected to Fellowship of the academy. Twenty new Fellows may be elected every year.

[ 7 ] No more than two Fellows may be elected every three years on the basis of distinguished contributions to science by means other than personal research. A small number of distinguished foreign scientists with substantial connections to Australian science are elected as Corresponding Members.

Fellows are denoted by the letters FAA (Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science) after their name.

Arms [ edit ] Coat of arms of the Australian Academy of Science Adopted Granted by the Kings of Arms , 1 March 1965 ( Earl Marshal 's warrant, 30 December 1964).

Crest On a Wreath of the Colours a demi Swan rousant Sable Ducally gorged Or, the wings charged with a conventional representation of the nucleus of an Atom with three Particles in orbit Or.

Torse Argent and Azure.

Helm A closed Helmet.

Escutcheon Azure, a representation of the building of the Australian Academy of Science at Canberra ensigned of a Mullet of seven points Argent on a Canton Argent a representation of the Royal Crown proper.

Supporters On the dexter side a Kangaroo and on the sinister side a Talbot both proper and Ducally gorged Or.

Compartment A field of Grass Vert.

Other elements Mantling Azure doubled Argent.

Symbolism Escutcheon: The seven-pointed silver star on a blue field represents the Commonwealth of Australia as it appears on the National Flag . The representation of the Academy building, the Shine Dome that was completed in 1959, follows the practice of armigers including a representation of their own castle. The royal crown in the canton was included by special permission of Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of the royal charter of the Academy, while the three animals in the arms (kangaroo, talbot, and swan) are gorged (collared) by a coronet to signify the Royal oversight of the Academy through the charter.

Crest: Biological science is represented by the Black swan (which also appears as a supporter on the Coat of Arms of the City of Canberra ), and physical science by the atom symbol on its wing.

Supporters: The Red Kangaroo is taken from the Australian arms , while the White hound supporter is identical to the supporters of the arms of the Royal Society of London and was included by permission of the Royal Society to signify the close relations of the two bodies and the role of Royal Society Fellows in the Australian academy's establishment.
