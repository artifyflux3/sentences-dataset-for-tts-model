In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a mathematical object is said to satisfy a property **locally**, if the property is satisfied on some limited, immediate portions of the object (e.g., on some _sufficiently small_ or _arbitrarily small_[neighborhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)") of points).

Properties of a point on a function
-----------------------------------

Perhaps the best-known example of the idea of locality lies in the concept of [local minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_minimum "Local minimum") (or [local maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_maximum "Local maximum")), which is a point in a function whose functional value is the smallest (resp., largest) within an immediate [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)") of points.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_property#cite_note-1) This is to be contrasted with the idea of global minimum (or global maximum), which corresponds to the minimum (resp., maximum) of the function across its entire domain.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_property#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_property#cite_note-3)

Properties of a single space
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Local_property&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Properties of a single space")]

A [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") is sometimes said to exhibit a property **locally**, if the property is exhibited "near" each point in one of the following ways:

1.   Each point has a [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)") exhibiting the property;
2.   Each point has a [neighborhood base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_base "Neighborhood base") of sets exhibiting the property.

Here, note that condition (2) is for the most part stronger than condition (1), and that extra caution should be taken to distinguish between the two. For example, some variation in the definition of [locally compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact "Locally compact") can arise as a result of the different choices of these conditions.

*   [Locally connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_connected "Locally connected") and [Locally path-connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_path-connected "Locally path-connected") topological spaces

Properties of a pair of spaces
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Local_property&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Properties of a pair of spaces")]

Given some notion of equivalence (e.g., [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism"), [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism"), [isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry")) between [topological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), two spaces are said to be locally equivalent if every point of the first space has a neighborhood which is equivalent to a neighborhood of the second space.

For instance, the [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") and the line are very different objects. One cannot stretch the circle to look like the line, nor compress the line to fit on the circle without gaps or overlaps. However, a small piece of the circle can be stretched and flattened out to look like a small piece of the line. For this reason, one may say that the circle and the line are locally equivalent.

Similarly, the [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") and the plane are locally equivalent. A small enough observer standing on the [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)") of a sphere (e.g., a person and the Earth) would find it indistinguishable from a plane.

Properties of infinite groups
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Local_property&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Properties of infinite groups")]

For an [infinite group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_group "Infinite group"), a "small neighborhood" is taken to be a [finitely generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitely_generated_group "Finitely generated group")[subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup "Subgroup"). An infinite group is said to be **locally _P_** if every finitely generated subgroup is _P_. For instance, a group is [locally finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_finite_group "Locally finite group") if every finitely generated subgroup is finite, and a group is locally soluble if every finitely generated subgroup is [soluble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soluble_group "Soluble group").

Properties of finite groups
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Local_property&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Properties of finite groups")]

For [finite groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_group "Finite group"), a "small neighborhood" is taken to be a subgroup defined in terms of a [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number")_p_, usually the **local subgroups**, the [normalizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalizer "Normalizer") of the nontrivial [_p_-subgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-group "P-group"). In which case, a property is said to be local if it can be detected from the local subgroups. Global and local properties formed a significant portion of the early work on the [classification of finite simple groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple_groups "Classification of finite simple groups"), which was carried out during the 1960s.

Properties of commutative rings
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Local_property&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Properties of commutative rings")]

For commutative rings, ideas of [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry") make it natural to take a "small neighborhood" of a ring to be the [localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_of_a_ring "Localization of a ring") at a [prime ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal "Prime ideal"). In which case, a property is said to be local if it can be detected from the [local rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ring "Local ring"). For instance, being a [flat module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_module "Flat module") over a commutative ring is a local property, but being a [free module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_module "Free module") is not. For more, see [Localization of a module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_of_a_module "Localization of a module").
