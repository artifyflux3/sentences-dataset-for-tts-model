( July 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) There is no single definition of an absolute scale . In statistics and measurement theory, it is simply a ratio scale in which the unit of measurement is fixed, and values are obtained by counting.

[ 1 ] Another definition tells us it is the count of the elements in a set, with its natural origin being zero, the empty set.

[ citation needed ] Some sources tell us that even time can be measured in an absolute scale, proving year zero is measured from the beginning of the universe.

[ 2 ] Colloquially, the Kelvin temperature scale , where absolute zero is the temperature at which molecular energy is at a minimum, and the Rankine temperature scale are also referred to as absolute scales. In that case, an absolute scale is a system of measurement that begins at a minimum, or zero point, and progresses in only one direction.

( July 2025 ) Uses [ edit ] Absolute scales are used when precise values are needed in comparison to a natural, unchanging zero point. Measurements of length , area and volume are inherently absolute, although measurements of distance are often based on an arbitrary starting point. Measurements of weight can be absolute, such as atomic weight , but more often they are measurements of the relationship between two masses , while measurements of speed are relative to an arbitrary reference frame . (Unlike many other measurements without a known, absolute minimum, speed has a known maximum and can be measured from a purely relative scale.) Absolute scales can be used for measuring a variety of things, from the flatness of an optical flat to neuroscientific tests.
