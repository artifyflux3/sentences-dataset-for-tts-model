[ citation needed ] The Jewish Voice has a pro- Israel editorial outlook. It covers Israeli and American news (the latter focused on New York and, to a lesser extent, New Jersey and Florida). The paper describes its mission as "providing our readers with timely and thought-provoking news and opinion, from a pro-American , pro-Israel perspective". By 2025 The Jewish Voice became a multi media company, besides the weekly newspaper and sixteen platforms online (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and more).
