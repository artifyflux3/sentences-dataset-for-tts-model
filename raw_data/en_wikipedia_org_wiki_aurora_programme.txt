For other uses, see Aurora (disambiguation) .

This space art, titled The Next Stop , was selected by the ESA when discussing its Aurora program.

[ 1 ] The Aurora programme (sometimes called Aurora Exploration Programme , or simply Exploration Programme ) was a human spaceflight programme of the European Space Agency (ESA) established in 2001. The objective was to formulate and then to implement a European long-term plan for exploration of the Solar System using robotic spacecraft and human spaceflight to investigate bodies holding promise for traces of life beyond the Earth .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In 2025, the Aurora programme was no longer active.

[ 4 ] Overview [ edit ] Member states committed to participation in the Aurora programme for five-year periods, after which they can change their level of participation or pull out entirely. In the early years the Aurora programme planned for flagship missions and arrow missions for key technology demonstrations, such as Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule and Mars aerocapture demonstrator. Although human spaceflight has remained a long-term goal of the programme, with some basic technology development in this area, the thrust has been on implementation of the ExoMars mission and preparations for an international Mars sample return mission .

[ 2 ] The objective of the Aurora Programme is first to formulate and then to implement a European long-term plan for the robotic and human exploration of solar system bodies holding promise for traces of life.

— ESA [ 5 ] The Aurora programme was a response to Europe's Strategy for space which  was endorsed by European Union Council of Research and the ESA Council.

[ 6 ] Europe strategy for space had three main points including: "explore the solar system and the Universe", "stimulate new technology", and "inspire the young people of Europe to take a greater interest in science and technology".

[ 6 ] One of the foundational principles of the Aurora program was recognising the interdependence of technology and exploration.

[ 6 ] [ 1 ] Missions [ edit ] ExoMars rover model, renamed Rosalind Franklin rover The first decade is planned to focus on robotic missions.

Flagship missions [ edit ] ExoMars launches in 2016 ESA described some Aurora programme missions as "Flagship" missions. The first Flagship mission was ExoMars , a dual robotic mission to Mars made in cooperation with the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos). It involved a Mars orbiter ( ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter ), a technology demonstrator descent module ( Schiaparelli lander), and the Rosalind Franklin rover .

[ 7 ] Flagship missions considered for the Aurora programme included: ExoMars , consisting of an uncrewed Mars orbiter and lander launched jointly with the Russian Federal Space Agency in 2016 on Proton rocket with Fregat upper stage.

Rosalind Franklin rover originally intended to be conducted jointly with the Russian Federal Space Agency in the mid- or late-2020s. Cooperation with Russia was cancelled in 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

As of 2024, the launch is scheduled for 2028.

[ 8 ] a robotic Mars Sample Return Mission by the mid-2020s a human space mission to be launched in the mid-2030s Arrow missions [ edit ] This article needs to be updated .

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

( November 2010 ) Arrow missions were technology demonstrator missions focused on developing a certain technology needed for the Flagship missions. Approved Arrow missions, as of 30 January 2003: Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule , a step in the preparations for the Mars Sample Return mission.

[ citation needed ] Mars aerocapture demonstrator , to further develop the technologies for using a planet's atmosphere to brake into orbit. This particular mission seems to have been revised into an expanded mission to demonstrate "aerobraking/aerocapture, solar electric propulsion and soft landing" to be launched in 2020.

The scientific objectives include exobiological studies as well as study of the surface of Mars.
