Biography [ edit ] Satyadev Dubey was born in Bilaspur now in Chhattisgarh in 1936. He moved to Mumbai with the aim of becoming a cricketer , but ended up joining the Theatre Unit, a theatre group run by Ebrahim Alkazi , which also ran a school for many budding artists. Later when Alkazi left for Delhi to head the National School of Drama , Dubey took over Theatre Unit, and went on to produce many important plays in the Indian theatre.

He produced Girish Karnad 's first play Yayati , and also his noted play Hayavadana , Badal Sarkar 's Ewam Indrajit and Pagla Ghoda , Chandrashekhara Kambara 's Aur Tota Bola ( Jokumaraswamy in original Kannada), Mohan Rakesh 's Aadhe Adhure , Vijay Tendulkar 's Khamosh! Adalat Jaari Hai , and A Raincoat For All Occasions and Jean Anouilh 's Antigone in 2007.

He is credited with the discovery of Dharmavir Bharati 's Andha Yug , a play that was written for radio; Dubey saw its potential, sent it across to Ebrahim Alkazi at National School of Drama. When staged in 1962, Andha Yug brought in a new paradigm in Indian theatre of the times.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] He made two short films Aparichay ke Vindhachal (1965) and Tongue In Cheek (1968), [ 6 ] and directed a Marathi feature film, Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe (1971), based on Vijay Tendulkar 's play, which in turn is based on Friedrich Dürrenmatt 's story "Die Panne".
