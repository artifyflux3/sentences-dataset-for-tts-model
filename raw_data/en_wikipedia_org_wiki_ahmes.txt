He transcribed the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus , a work of ancient Egyptian mathematics that dates to approximately 1550 BC; [ 1 ] he is the earliest contributor to mathematics whose name is known.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Ahmes claimed not to be the writer of the work but rather just the scribe. He claimed the material came from an even older document from around 2000 B.C.
