A quantity growing by four orders of magnitude implies it has grown by a factor of 10000 or 10 4 . However, because computers are binary, orders of magnitude are sometimes given as powers of two.

This article presents a list of multiples, sorted by orders of magnitude, for bit rates measured in bits per second . Since some bit rates may measured in other quantities of data or time (like MB/s), information to assist with converting to and from these formats is provided. This article assumes the following: A group of 8 bits (8 bit) constitutes one byte (1 B). The byte is the most common unit of measurement of information ( megabyte , mebibyte , gigabyte , gibibyte , etc.).

The decimal SI prefixes kilo , mega etc., are powers of 10. The power of two equivalents are the binary prefixes kibi , mebi , etc.

Accordingly: 1 kB ( kilobyte ) = 1000 bytes = 8000 bits 1 KiB ( kibibyte ) = 2 10 bytes = 1024 bytes = 8192 bits 1 kbit ( kilobit ) = 125 bytes = 1000 bits 1 Kibit ( kibibit ) = 2 10 bits = 1024 bits = 128 bytes Factor ( bit/s ) SI prefix Value Field Item 10 −2 5.0×10 −2 bit/s Text data Project ELF bit rate for transmitting 3-letter codes to US nuclear submarines [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 10 0 bit/s 10 1 5.0×10 1 bit/s Positioning system Bit rate for transmissions from GPS satellites [ 3 ] 5.6×10 1 bit/s Text data Bit rate for a skilled operator in Morse code [ 4 ] 10 3 kbit/s 4×10 3 bit/s Audio data Minimum achieved for encoding recognizable speech (using special-purpose speech codecs ) 8×10 3 bit/s Audio data Low bit rate telephone quality 10 4 3.2×10 4 bit/s Audio data MW quality and ADPCM voice in telephony, doubling the capacity of a 30 chan link to 60 ch.

^ WPM, or Words Per Minute, is the number of times the word "PARIS" is transferred per minute. Strictly speaking the code is quinary, accounting inter-element, inter-letter, and inter-word gaps, yielding 50 binary elements (bits) per one word. Therefore 40 wpm is 2000 bits/min or 55.6 bit/s. Counting characters, including inter-word gaps, gives six characters per word or 240 characters per minute, and finally four characters per second.
