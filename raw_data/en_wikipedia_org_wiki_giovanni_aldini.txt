He is considered a pioneer in the field of electrophysiology .

[ 3 ] Biography [ edit ] Giovanni Aldini was born in Bologna on 10 April 1762. He was a brother of the statesman Count Antonio Aldini , secretary of state for the Kingdom of Italy between 1805 and 1814. He graduated in physics at University of Bologna in 1782.

[ 4 ] In 1798, he became professor of experimental physics at University of Bologna , in succession to his uncle Luigi Galvani (1737–1798).

[ 5 ] Aldini's scientific work was chiefly concerned with galvanism , anatomy and its medical applications, with the construction and illumination of lighthouses , and with experiments for preserving human life and material objects from destruction by fire. He wrote in French and English in addition to his native Italian, and in Latin, still used in the 18th century by the scientific community.

Aldini was one of the earliest and most active members of the National Institute of Italy, to the foundation of which he contributed. In recognition of his merits, the emperor of Austria made him a Knight of the Iron Crown and a councillor of state at Milan . Aldini spent the last years of his life in Milan, where he died on 17 January 1834, at the age of 71. He bequeathed a considerable sum to found a school of natural science for artisans at Bologna.

[ 1 ] Experiments [ edit ] Aldini demonstrating electricity generated by an ox head Aldini's most famous public demonstration of the electro-stimulation technique of deceased limbs was performed on the executed criminal George Forster at Newgate in London in 1803.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] The Newgate Calendar describes what happened when the galvanic process was used on the body: On the first application of the process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye was actually opened. In the subsequent part of the process, the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion.

[ 8 ] Aldini's experiment created a sensation since it seemed to demonstrate that electricity could be used to revive the deceased.

Shelley's Frankenstein association [ edit ] Although Mary Shelley was just 5 years old when Foster was executed, it has been suggested that Aldini might have been the inspiration for her famous fictional character Victor Frankenstein .

[ 9 ] Shelley was well read in the sciences and her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley was an amateur chemist .

[ 9 ] In her introduction to the 1831 edition of Frankenstein , she does not mention Aldini, but "galvanism" was among the evening discussion topics before she experienced her "waking dream" that led to her writing.

[ 10 ] Chapter 5, the creature awakened: By the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.
