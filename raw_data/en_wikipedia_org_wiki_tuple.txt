In mathematics , a tuple is a finite sequence or ordered list of numbers or, more generally, mathematical objects , which are called the elements of the tuple. An n -tuple is a tuple of n elements, where n is a non-negative integer . There is only one 0-tuple, called the empty tuple . A 1-tuple and a 2-tuple are commonly called a singleton and an ordered pair , respectively. The term "infinite tuple" is occasionally used for "infinite sequences" .

Tuples are usually written by listing the elements within parentheses " ( ) " and separated by commas; for example, (2, 7, 4, 1, 7) denotes a 5-tuple. Other types of brackets are sometimes used, although they may have a different meaning.

[ a ] An n -tuple can be formally defined as the image of a function that has the set of the n first natural numbers as its domain . Tuples may be also defined from ordered pairs by a recurrence starting from an ordered pair ; indeed, an n -tuple can be identified with the ordered pair of its ( n − 1) first elements and its n th element, for example, ( ( ( 1 , 2 ) , 3 ) , 4 ) = ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) {\displaystyle \left(\left(\left(1,2\right),3\right),4\right)=\left(1,2,3,4\right)} .

In computer science , tuples come in many forms. Most typed functional programming languages implement tuples directly as product types , [ 1 ] tightly associated with algebraic data types , pattern matching , and destructuring assignment .

[ 2 ] Many programming languages offer an alternative to tuples, known as record types , featuring unordered elements accessed by label.

[ 3 ] A few programming languages combine ordered tuple product types and unordered record types into a single construct, as in C structs and Haskell records.

Relational databases may formally identify their rows (records) as tuples .

Tuples also occur in relational algebra ; when programming the semantic web with the Resource Description Framework (RDF); in linguistics ; [ 4 ] and in philosophy .

[ 5 ] Etymology [ edit ] The term originated as an abstraction of the sequence: single, couple/double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, sextuple, septuple, octuple, ..., n ‑tuple, ..., where the prefixes are taken from the Latin names of the numerals. The unique 0-tuple is called the null tuple or empty tuple . A 1‑tuple is called a single (or singleton ), a 2‑tuple is called an ordered pair or couple , and a 3‑tuple is called a triple (or triplet ). The number n can be any nonnegative integer . For example, a complex number can be represented as a 2‑tuple of reals, a quaternion can be represented as a 4‑tuple, an octonion can be represented as an 8‑tuple, and a sedenion can be represented as a 16‑tuple.

Although these uses treat ‑tuple as the suffix, the original suffix was ‑ple as in "triple" (three-fold) or "decuple" (ten‑fold). This originates from medieval Latin plus (meaning "more") related to Greek ‑πλοῦς, which replaced the classical and late antique ‑plex (meaning "folded"), as in "duplex".

[ 6 ] [ b ] Properties [ edit ] The general rule for the identity of two n -tuples is ( a 1 , a 2 , … … , a n ) = ( b 1 , b 2 , … … , b n ) {\displaystyle (a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{n})=(b_{1},b_{2},\ldots ,b_{n})} if and only if a 1 = b 1 , a 2 = b 2 , … … , a n = b n {\displaystyle a_{1}=b_{1},{\text{ }}a_{2}=b_{2},{\text{ }}\ldots ,{\text{ }}a_{n}=b_{n}} .

Thus a tuple has properties that distinguish it from a set : A tuple may contain multiple instances of the same element, so tuple ( 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 ) ≠ ≠ ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) {\displaystyle (1,2,2,3)\neq (1,2,3)} ; but set { 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 } = { 1 , 2 , 3 } {\displaystyle \{1,2,2,3\}=\{1,2,3\}} .

Tuple elements are ordered: tuple ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ≠ ≠ ( 3 , 2 , 1 ) {\displaystyle (1,2,3)\neq (3,2,1)} , but set { 1 , 2 , 3 } = { 3 , 2 , 1 } {\displaystyle \{1,2,3\}=\{3,2,1\}} .

A tuple has a finite number of elements, while a set or a multiset may have an infinite number of elements.

Definitions [ edit ] There are several definitions of tuples that give them the properties described in the previous section.

Tuples as functions [ edit ] The 0 {\displaystyle 0} -tuple may be identified as the empty function . For n ≥ ≥ 1 , {\displaystyle n\geq 1,} the n {\displaystyle n} -tuple ( a 1 , … … , a n ) {\displaystyle \left(a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}\right)} may be identified with the ( surjective ) function F : { 1 , … … , n } → → { a 1 , … … , a n } {\displaystyle F~:~\left\{1,\ldots ,n\right\}~\to ~\left\{a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}\right\}} with domain domain ⁡ ⁡ F = { 1 , … … , n } = { i ∈ ∈ N : 1 ≤ ≤ i ≤ ≤ n } {\displaystyle \operatorname {domain} F=\left\{1,\ldots ,n\right\}=\left\{i\in \mathbb {N} :1\leq i\leq n\right\}} and with codomain codomain ⁡ ⁡ F = { a 1 , … … , a n } , {\displaystyle \operatorname {codomain} F=\left\{a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}\right\},} that is defined at i ∈ ∈ domain ⁡ ⁡ F = { 1 , … … , n } {\displaystyle i\in \operatorname {domain} F=\left\{1,\ldots ,n\right\}} by F ( i ) := a i .

{\displaystyle F(i):=a_{i}.} That is, F {\displaystyle F} is the function defined by 1 ↦ ↦ a 1 ⋮ ⋮ n ↦ ↦ a n {\displaystyle {\begin{alignedat}{3}1\;&\mapsto &&\;a_{1}\\\;&\;\;\vdots &&\;\\n\;&\mapsto &&\;a_{n}\\\end{alignedat}}} in which case the equality ( a 1 , a 2 , … … , a n ) = ( F ( 1 ) , F ( 2 ) , … … , F ( n ) ) {\displaystyle \left(a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{n}\right)=\left(F(1),F(2),\dots ,F(n)\right)} necessarily holds.

Tuples as sets of ordered pairs Functions are commonly identified with their graphs , which is a certain set of ordered pairs. 
Indeed, many authors use graphs as the definition of a function. 
Using this definition of "function", the above function F {\displaystyle F} can be defined as: F := { ( 1 , a 1 ) , … … , ( n , a n ) } .

{\displaystyle F~:=~\left\{\left(1,a_{1}\right),\ldots ,\left(n,a_{n}\right)\right\}.} Tuples as nested ordered pairs [ edit ] Another way of modeling tuples in set theory is as nested ordered pairs . This approach assumes that the notion of ordered pair has already been defined.

The 0-tuple (i.e. the empty tuple) is represented by the empty set ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } .

An n -tuple, with n > 0 , can be defined as an ordered pair of its first entry and an ( n − 1) -tuple (which contains the remaining entries when n > 1) : ( a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , … … , a n ) = ( a 1 , ( a 2 , a 3 , … … , a n ) ) {\displaystyle (a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots ,a_{n})=(a_{1},(a_{2},a_{3},\ldots ,a_{n}))} This definition can be applied recursively to the ( n − 1) -tuple: ( a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , … … , a n ) = ( a 1 , ( a 2 , ( a 3 , ( … … , ( a n , ∅ ∅ ) … … ) ) ) ) {\displaystyle (a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots ,a_{n})=(a_{1},(a_{2},(a_{3},(\ldots ,(a_{n},\emptyset )\ldots ))))} Thus, for example: ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) = ( 1 , ( 2 , ( 3 , ∅ ∅ ) ) ) ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) = ( 1 , ( 2 , ( 3 , ( 4 , ∅ ∅ ) ) ) ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(1,2,3)&=(1,(2,(3,\emptyset )))\\(1,2,3,4)&=(1,(2,(3,(4,\emptyset ))))\\\end{aligned}}} A variant of this definition starts "peeling off" elements from the other end: The 0-tuple is the empty set ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } .

For n > 0 : ( a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , … … , a n ) = ( ( a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , … … , a n − − 1 ) , a n ) {\displaystyle (a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots ,a_{n})=((a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots ,a_{n-1}),a_{n})} This definition can be applied recursively: ( a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , … … , a n ) = ( ( … … ( ( ( ∅ ∅ , a 1 ) , a 2 ) , a 3 ) , … … ) , a n ) {\displaystyle (a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots ,a_{n})=((\ldots (((\emptyset ,a_{1}),a_{2}),a_{3}),\ldots ),a_{n})} Thus, for example: ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) = ( ( ( ∅ ∅ , 1 ) , 2 ) , 3 ) ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) = ( ( ( ( ∅ ∅ , 1 ) , 2 ) , 3 ) , 4 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(1,2,3)&=(((\emptyset ,1),2),3)\\(1,2,3,4)&=((((\emptyset ,1),2),3),4)\\\end{aligned}}} Tuples as nested sets [ edit ] Using Kuratowski's representation for an ordered pair , the second definition above can be reformulated in terms of pure set theory : The 0-tuple (i.e. the empty tuple) is represented by the empty set ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } ; Let x {\displaystyle x} be an n -tuple ( a 1 , a 2 , … … , a n ) {\displaystyle (a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{n})} , and let x → → b ≡ ≡ ( a 1 , a 2 , … … , a n , b ) {\displaystyle x\rightarrow b\equiv (a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{n},b)} . Then, x → → b ≡ ≡ { { x } , { x , b } } {\displaystyle x\rightarrow b\equiv \{\{x\},\{x,b\}\}} .  (The right arrow, → → {\displaystyle \rightarrow } , could be read as "adjoined with".) In this formulation: ( ) = ∅ ∅ ( 1 ) = ( ) → → 1 = { { ( ) } , { ( ) , 1 } } = { { ∅ ∅ } , { ∅ ∅ , 1 } } ( 1 , 2 ) = ( 1 ) → → 2 = { { ( 1 ) } , { ( 1 ) , 2 } } = { { { { ∅ ∅ } , { ∅ ∅ , 1 } } } , { { { ∅ ∅ } , { ∅ ∅ , 1 } } , 2 } } ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) = ( 1 , 2 ) → → 3 = { { ( 1 , 2 ) } , { ( 1 , 2 ) , 3 } } = { { { { { { ∅ ∅ } , { ∅ ∅ , 1 } } } , { { { ∅ ∅ } , { ∅ ∅ , 1 } } , 2 } } } , { { { { { ∅ ∅ } , { ∅ ∅ , 1 } } } , { { { ∅ ∅ } , { ∅ ∅ , 1 } } , 2 } } , 3 } } {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{lclcl}()&&&=&\emptyset \\&&&&\\(1)&=&()\rightarrow 1&=&\{\{()\},\{(),1\}\}\\&&&=&\{\{\emptyset \},\{\emptyset ,1\}\}\\&&&&\\(1,2)&=&(1)\rightarrow 2&=&\{\{(1)\},\{(1),2\}\}\\&&&=&\{\{\{\{\emptyset \},\{\emptyset ,1\}\}\},\\&&&&\{\{\{\emptyset \},\{\emptyset ,1\}\},2\}\}\\&&&&\\(1,2,3)&=&(1,2)\rightarrow 3&=&\{\{(1,2)\},\{(1,2),3\}\}\\&&&=&\{\{\{\{\{\{\emptyset \},\{\emptyset ,1\}\}\},\\&&&&\{\{\{\emptyset \},\{\emptyset ,1\}\},2\}\}\},\\&&&&\{\{\{\{\{\emptyset \},\{\emptyset ,1\}\}\},\\&&&&\{\{\{\emptyset \},\{\emptyset ,1\}\},2\}\},3\}\}\\\end{array}}} n -tuples of m -sets [ edit ] In discrete mathematics , especially combinatorics and finite probability theory , n -tuples arise in the context of various counting problems and are treated more informally as ordered lists of length n .

[ 7 ] n -tuples whose entries come from a set of m elements are also called arrangements with repetition , permutations of a multiset and, in some non-English literature, variations with repetition . The number of n -tuples of an m -set is m n . This follows from the combinatorial rule of product .

[ 8 ] If S is a finite set of cardinality m , this number is the cardinality of the n -fold Cartesian power S × S × ⋯ × S . Tuples are elements of this product set.

Type theory [ edit ] Main article: Product type In type theory , commonly used in programming languages , a tuple has a product type ; this fixes not only the length, but also the underlying types of each component. Formally: ( x 1 , x 2 , … … , x n ) : T 1 × × T 2 × × … … × × T n {\displaystyle (x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}):{\mathsf {T}}_{1}\times {\mathsf {T}}_{2}\times \ldots \times {\mathsf {T}}_{n}} and the projections are term constructors: π π 1 ( x ) : T 1 , π π 2 ( x ) : T 2 , … … , π π n ( x ) : T n {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(x):{\mathsf {T}}_{1},~\pi _{2}(x):{\mathsf {T}}_{2},~\ldots ,~\pi _{n}(x):{\mathsf {T}}_{n}} The tuple with labeled elements used in the relational model has a record type . Both of these types can be defined as simple extensions of the simply typed lambda calculus .

[ 9 ] The notion of a tuple in type theory and that in set theory are related in the following way: If we consider the natural model of a type theory, and use the Scott brackets to indicate the semantic interpretation, then the model consists of some sets S 1 , S 2 , … … , S n {\displaystyle S_{1},S_{2},\ldots ,S_{n}} (note: the use of italics here that distinguishes sets from types) such that: [ [ T 1 ] ] = S 1 , [ [ T 2 ] ] = S 2 , … … , [ [ T n ] ] = S n {\displaystyle [\![{\mathsf {T}}_{1}]\!]=S_{1},~[\![{\mathsf {T}}_{2}]\!]=S_{2},~\ldots ,~[\![{\mathsf {T}}_{n}]\!]=S_{n}} and the interpretation of the basic terms is: [ [ x 1 ] ] ∈ ∈ [ [ T 1 ] ] , [ [ x 2 ] ] ∈ ∈ [ [ T 2 ] ] , … … , [ [ x n ] ] ∈ ∈ [ [ T n ] ] {\displaystyle [\![x_{1}]\!]\in [\![{\mathsf {T}}_{1}]\!],~[\![x_{2}]\!]\in [\![{\mathsf {T}}_{2}]\!],~\ldots ,~[\![x_{n}]\!]\in [\![{\mathsf {T}}_{n}]\!]} .

The n -tuple of type theory has the natural interpretation as an n -tuple of set theory: [ 10 ] [ [ ( x 1 , x 2 , … … , x n ) ] ] = ( [ [ x 1 ] ] , [ [ x 2 ] ] , … … , [ [ x n ] ] ) {\displaystyle [\![(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n})]\!]=(\,[\![x_{1}]\!],[\![x_{2}]\!],\ldots ,[\![x_{n}]\!]\,)} The unit type has as semantic interpretation the 0-tuple.
