Jan Amos Komenský ), art (e.g.

Karel Teige ), literature (e.g.

Milan Kundera ), and especially politics (e.g.

Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk , Ivan Sviták , Václav Havel ). A source drawing from literature, however, distinguished the Czech national philosophy from the speculative tradition of German thought, citing that it emerged from folk wisdom and peasant reasoning.

[ 2 ] Masaryk is credited for introducing the epistemological problem into the modern Czech philosophy, which in turn influenced the discourse on symbol and symbolization.

[ 3 ] Czech philosophers have also played a central role in the development of phenomenology , whose German-speaking founder Edmund Husserl was born in the Czech lands . Czechs Jan Patočka and Václav Bělohradský would later make important contributions to phenomenological thought. Philosophy in Communist Czechoslovakia officially had to conform to Soviet -style Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism , but this also produced some interesting moments such as the thought of Karel Kosík or the international Marxist-Christian dialogue led by Milan Machovec in the 1960s leading up to the Prague Spring .

Positivism became an important and dominant trend of modern Czech philosophy, eclipsing herbatianism , in what is explained as a collective "post-revolutionary" thinking characterized by an attempt to open a window to Europe in order to eliminate traces of philosophical provincialism.
