[Elementary arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_arithmetic "Elementary arithmetic") operations:

*   +, plus (addition)
*   −, minus (subtraction)
*   ÷, obelus (division)
*   ×, times (multiplication)

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), an **operation** is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") from a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") to itself. For example, an operation on [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") will take in real numbers and return a real number. An operation can take zero or more input values (also called "_[operands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operand "Operand")_" or "arguments") to a well-defined output value. The number of operands is the [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity "Arity") of the operation.

The most commonly studied operations are [binary operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation "Binary operation") (i.e., operations of arity 2), such as [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition") and [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"), and [unary operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation "Unary operation") (i.e., operations of arity 1), such as [additive inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_inverse "Additive inverse") and [multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse"). An operation of [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity "Arity") zero, or [nullary operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullary_operation "Nullary operation"), is a [constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(mathematics) "Constant (mathematics)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-:1-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-2) The [mixed product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_product "Mixed product") is an example of an operation of arity 3, also called [ternary operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_operation "Ternary operation").

Generally, the arity is taken to be finite. However, [infinitary operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitary_operation "Infinitary operation") are sometimes considered,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-:1-1) in which case the "usual" operations of finite arity are called **finitary operations**.

A **partial operation** is defined similarly to an operation, but with a [partial function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_function "Partial function") in place of a function.

A binary operation takes two arguments ![Image 3: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) and ![Image 4: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d), and returns the result ![Image 5: {\displaystyle x\circ y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c2ba86902ee98c41deb1275ddb8693977f27e1da).

There are two common types of operations: [unary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation "Unary operation") and [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation "Binary operation"). Unary operations involve only one value, such as [negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation "Negation") and [trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_function "Trigonometric function").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-3) Binary operations, on the other hand, take two values, and include [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition"), [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction"), [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"), [division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics) "Division (mathematics)"), and [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-4)

Operations can involve mathematical objects other than numbers. The [logical values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value "Truth value")_true_ and _false_ can be combined using [logic operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_operation "Logic operation"), such as _and_, _or,_ and _not_. [Vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)") can be added and subtracted.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-5)[Rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation") can be combined using the [function composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") operation, performing the first rotation and then the second. Operations on [sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") include the binary operations _[union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union\_(mathematics) "Union (mathematics)")_ and _[intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection\_(mathematics) "Intersection (mathematics)")_ and the unary operation of _[complementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementation\_(mathematics) "Complementation (mathematics)")_.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-8) Operations on [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") include [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") and [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution "Convolution").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-10)

Operations may not be defined for every possible value of its _[domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain\_of\_a\_function "Domain of a function")_. For example, in the real numbers one cannot divide by zero[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-11) or take square roots of negative numbers. The values for which an operation is defined form a set called its _domain of definition_ or _active domain_. The set which contains the values produced is called the _[codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain "Codomain")_, but the set of actual values attained by the operation is its codomain of definition, active codomain, _[image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image\_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)")_ or _[range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range\_of\_a\_function "Range of a function")_.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-12) For example, in the real numbers, the squaring operation only produces non-negative numbers; the codomain is the set of real numbers, but the range is the non-negative numbers.

Operations can involve dissimilar objects: a vector can be multiplied by a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)") to form another vector (an operation known as [scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication")),[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-13) and the [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product") operation on two vectors produces a quantity that is scalar.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-15) An operation may or may not have certain properties, for example it may be [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative "Associative"), [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative "Commutative"), [anticommutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticommutative "Anticommutative"), [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent "Idempotent"), and so on.

The values combined are called _operands_, _arguments_, or _inputs_, and the value produced is called the _value_, _result_, or _output_. Operations can have fewer or more than two inputs (including the case of zero input and infinitely many inputs[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-:1-1)).

An **operator** is similar to an operation in that it refers to the symbol or the process used to denote the operation. Hence, their point of view is different. For instance, one often speaks of "the operation of addition" or "the addition operation," when focusing on the operands and result, but one switch to "addition operator" (rarely "operator of addition"), when focusing on the process, or from the more symbolic viewpoint, the function +: _X_ × _X_ → _X_ (where X is a set such as the set of real numbers).

An **_n_-ary operation**_ω_ on a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)")_X_ is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")_ω_: _X_ n → _X_. The set _X_ n is called the _domain_ of the operation, the output set is called the _[codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain "Codomain")_ of the operation, and the fixed non-negative integer _n_ (the number of operands) is called the _[arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity "Arity")_ of the operation. Thus a [unary operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation "Unary operation") has arity one, and a [binary operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation "Binary operation") has arity two. An operation of arity zero, called a _nullary_ operation, is simply an element of the codomain _Y_. An _n_-ary operation can also be viewed as an (_n_ + 1)-ary [relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitary_relation "Finitary relation") that is [total](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitary_relation#Definitions "Finitary relation") on its _n_ input domains and [unique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitary_relation#Definitions "Finitary relation") on its output domain.

An **_n_-ary partial operation**_ω_ from _X_ n to _X_ is a [partial function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_function "Partial function")_ω_: _X_ n → _X_. An _n_-ary partial operation can also be viewed as an (_n_ + 1)-ary relation that is unique on its output domain.

The above describes what is usually called a **finitary operation**, referring to the finite number of operands (the value _n_). There are obvious extensions where the arity is taken to be an infinite [ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number "Ordinal number") or [cardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number "Cardinal number"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-:1-1) or even an arbitrary set indexing the operands.

Often, the use of the term _operation_ implies that the domain of the function includes a power of the codomain (i.e. the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product") of one or more copies of the codomain),[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-16) although this is by no means universal, as in the case of [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product"), where vectors are multiplied and result in a scalar. An _n_-ary operation _ω_: _X_ _n_ → _X_ is called an **internal operation**. An _n_-ary operation _ω_: _X_ _i_ × _S_ × _X_ _n_ − _i_ − 1 → _X_ where 0 ≤ _i_<_n_ is called an **external operation** by the _scalar set_ or _operator set_ _S_. In particular for a binary operation, _ω_: _S_ × _X_ → _X_ is called a **left-external operation** by _S_, and _ω_: _X_ × _S_ → _X_ is called a **right-external operation** by _S_. An example of an internal operation is [vector addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition "Vector addition"), where two vectors are added and result in a vector. An example of an external operation is [scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication"), where a vector is multiplied by a scalar and result in a vector.

An **_n_-ary multifunction** or **multioperation**_ω_ is a mapping from a Cartesian power of a set into the set of subsets of that set, formally ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \omega :X^{n}\rightarrow {\mathcal {P}}(X)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/94e05768579f0e50c4bf6fa313b6c4afb61c8f6b).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)#cite_note-17)
