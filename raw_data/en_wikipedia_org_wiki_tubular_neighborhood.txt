( August 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A curve, in blue, and some lines perpendicular to it, in green. Small portions of those lines around the curve are in red.

A close up of the figure above. The curve is in blue, and its tubular neighborhood T is in red. With the notation in the article, the curve is S , the space containing the curve is M , and T = j ( N ) .

{\displaystyle T=j(N).} A schematic illustration of the normal bundle N , with the zero section N 0 {\displaystyle N_{0}} in blue. The transformation j maps N 0 to the curve S in the figure above, and N to the tubular neighbourhood of S .

In mathematics , a tubular neighborhood of a submanifold of a smooth manifold is an open set around it resembling the normal bundle .

The idea behind a tubular neighborhood can be explained in a simple example. Consider a smooth curve in the plane without self-intersections. On each point on the curve draw a line perpendicular to the curve. Unless the curve is straight, these lines will intersect among themselves in a rather complicated fashion. However, if one looks only in a narrow band around the curve, the portions of the lines in that band will not intersect, and will cover the entire band without gaps. This band is a tubular neighborhood.

In general, let S be a submanifold of a manifold M , and let N be the normal bundle of S in M . Here S plays the role of the curve and M the role of the plane containing the curve. Consider the natural map i : N 0 → → S {\displaystyle i:N_{0}\to S} which establishes a bijective correspondence between the zero section N 0 {\displaystyle N_{0}} of N and the submanifold S of M . An extension j of this map to the entire normal bundle N with values in M such that j ( N ) {\displaystyle j(N)} is an open set in M and j is a homeomorphism between N and j ( N ) {\displaystyle j(N)} is called a tubular neighbourhood.

Often one calls the open set T = j ( N ) , {\displaystyle T=j(N),} rather than j itself, a tubular neighbourhood of S , it is assumed implicitly that the homeomorphism j mapping N to T exists.

Normal tube [ edit ] A normal tube to a smooth curve is a manifold defined as the union of all discs such that all the discs have the same fixed radius; the center of each disc lies on the curve ; and each disc lies in a plane normal to the curve where the curve passes through that disc's center.

Formal definition [ edit ] Let S ⊆ ⊆ M {\displaystyle S\subseteq M} be smooth manifolds. A tubular neighborhood of S {\displaystyle S} in M {\displaystyle M} is a vector bundle π π : E → → S {\displaystyle \pi :E\to S} together with a smooth map J : E → → M {\displaystyle J:E\to M} such that J ∘ ∘ 0 E = i {\displaystyle J\circ 0_{E}=i} where i {\displaystyle i} is the embedding S ↪ ↪ M {\displaystyle S\hookrightarrow M} and 0 E {\displaystyle 0_{E}} the zero section there exists some U ⊆ ⊆ E {\displaystyle U\subseteq E} and some V ⊆ ⊆ M {\displaystyle V\subseteq M} with 0 E [ S ] ⊆ ⊆ U {\displaystyle 0_{E}[S]\subseteq U} and S ⊆ ⊆ V {\displaystyle S\subseteq V} such that J | U : U → → V {\displaystyle J\vert _{U}:U\to V} is a diffeomorphism .

The normal bundle is a tubular neighborhood and because of the diffeomorphism condition in the second point, all tubular neighborhood have the same dimension, namely (the dimension of the vector bundle considered as a manifold is) that of M .

{\displaystyle M.} Generalizations [ edit ] Generalizations of smooth manifolds yield generalizations of tubular neighborhoods, such as regular neighborhoods, or spherical fibrations for Poincaré spaces .

These generalizations are used to produce analogs to the normal bundle, or rather to the stable normal bundle , which are replacements for the tangent bundle (which does not admit a direct description for these spaces).
