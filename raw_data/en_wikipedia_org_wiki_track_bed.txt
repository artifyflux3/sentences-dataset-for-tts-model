Trackbeds of disused railways are sometimes used for recreational paths or new light rail links.

Background [ edit ] According to Network Rail , the trackbed is the layers of ballast and sub-ballast above a prepared subgrade /formation (see diagram). It is designed primarily to reduce the stress on the subgrade.

Other definitions include the surface of the ballast on which the track is laid, [ 1 ] the area left after a track has been dismantled and the ballast removed [ 1 ] or the track formation beneath the ballast and above the natural ground.

[ 2 ] The trackbed can significantly influence the performance of the track, especially ride quality of passenger services.
