The Suda states that he was a doctor descended from Nicomachus, son of Machaon the son of Asclepius.

[ 1 ] Greenhill notes he had another son named Arimnestus, and a daughter named Arimneste , by his wife Phaestis, or Phaestias, who was descended from Asclepius as well. He was a native of Stageira , and the friend and physician of Amyntas III , king of Macedonia , 393–369 BC.

[ 2 ] Nicomachean Ethics , Aristotle's work on Ethics may have been dedicated to his father. Aristotle's son was also called Nicomachus .
