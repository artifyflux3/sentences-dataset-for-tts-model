Each step represents a frequency ratio of 2 96 {\displaystyle {\sqrt[{96}]{2}}} , or 12.5 cents. Since 96 factors into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96, it contains all of those temperaments. Most humans can only hear differences of 6 cents on notes that are played sequentially, and this amount varies according to the pitch, so the use of larger divisions of octave can be considered unnecessary. Smaller differences in pitch may be considered vibrato or stylistic devices.

History and use [ edit ] 96-EDO was first advocated by Julián Carrillo in 1924, with a 16th-tone piano. It was also advocated more recently by Pascale Criton and Vincent-Olivier Gagnon.

[ 1 ] Notation [ edit ] Since 96 = 24 × 4, quarter-tone notation can be used and split into four parts.

One can split it into four parts like this: C, C ↑ , C ↑ ↑ /C ↓ ↓ , C ↓ , C , ..., C ↓ , C As it can become confusing with so many accidentals, Julián Carrillo proposed referring to notes by step number from C (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 95, 0) Since the 16th-tone piano has a 97-key layout arranged in 8 conventional piano "octaves", music for it is usually notated according to the key the player has to strike. While the entire range of the instrument is only C 4 –C 5 , the notation ranges from C 0 to C 8 . Thus, written D0 corresponds to sounding C ↑ ↑ 4 or note 2, and written A♭/G♯ 2 corresponds to sounding E 4 or note 32.

Interval size [ edit ] Below are some intervals in 96-EDO and how well they approximate just intonation.

( February 2019 ) Modes [ edit ] 96-EDO contains all of the 12-EDO modes . However, it contains better approximations to some intervals (such as the minor third).
