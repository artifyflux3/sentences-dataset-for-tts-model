Nysian ; FIN : 405 ) is part of the Nysa–Polana complex , the largest cluster of asteroid families in the asteroid belt .

[ 1 ] : 23 It is located in the inner region of the asteroid belt, orbiting the Sun between 2.41 and 2.5 AU . Asteroids in this complex have eccentricities between 0.12 and 0.21 and inclinations of 1.4 to 4.3.

[ 2 ] The family derives its name from its most massive member, 44 Nysa . It has also been known as the Hertha family (adj. Herthian) named after 135 Hertha .

Subdivision [ edit ] Asteroids in this complex are typically divided into the stony Nysa and carbonaceous Polana subgroups, two mineralogically different families: [ 3 ] The much brighter S-type Nysian subgroup (i.e. the Nysa family, in the narrower sense) includes 44 Nysa and 135 Hertha .

In the low- albedo subgroup of the complex lies the Polana family (adj Polanian) , a family of dark F-type asteroids named after 142 Polana , the largest asteroid in this section.

[ 4 ] More recently an additional family, the Eulalia family has also been identified inside this subgroup.
