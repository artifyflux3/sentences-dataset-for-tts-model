They are the monomeric units of the informational biopolymer , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ). Each deoxyribonucleotide comprises three parts: a deoxyribose sugar ( monosaccharide ), a nitrogenous base , and one phosphoryl group .

[ 1 ] The nitrogenous bases are either purines or pyrimidines , heterocycles whose structures support the specific base-pairing interactions that allow nucleic acids to carry information. The base is always bonded to the 1'-carbon of the deoxyribose, an analog of ribose in which the hydroxyl group of the 2'-carbon is replaced with a hydrogen atom. The third component, the phosphoryl group, attaches to the deoxyribose monomer via the hydroxyl group on the 5'-carbon of the sugar.

When deoxyribonucleotides polymerize to form DNA, the phosphate group from one nucleotide will bond to the 3' carbon on another nucleotide, forming a phosphodiester bond via dehydration synthesis . New nucleotides are always added to the 3' carbon of the last nucleotide, so synthesis always proceeds from 5' to 3'.

Deoxyribonucleoside [ edit ] Just as a nucleoside can be considered as a nucleotide without a phosphate group, so too a deoxyribonucleoside is a deoxyribonucleotide without a phosphate.

[ 2 ] An example is deoxycytidine .
