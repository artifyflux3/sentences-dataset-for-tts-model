[ 3 ] History [ edit ] The company originates from several journals and publishing houses, notably Springer-Verlag , which was founded in 1842 by Julius Springer in Berlin [ 4 ] (the grandfather of Bernhard Springer who founded Springer Publishing in 1950 in New York), [ 5 ] Nature Publishing Group which has published Nature since 1869, [ 6 ] and Macmillan Education , which goes back to Macmillan Publishers founded in 1843.

[ 7 ] Springer Nature was formed in 2015 by the merger of Nature Publishing Group, Palgrave Macmillan, and Macmillan Education (held by Holtzbrinck Publishing Group) with Springer Science+Business Media (held by BC Partners ). Plans for the merger were first announced on 15 January 2015.

[ 8 ] The transaction was concluded in May 2015 with Holtzbrinck having the majority 53% share.

[ 9 ] IPO attempts in May 2018 and Autumn 2020 [ 10 ] were unfruitful due to unfavorable market conditions.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] In 2021, Springer Nature acquired Atlantis Press, an open access publisher founded in Paris in 2006, focusing on scientific, technical, and medical (STM) content, and publication of conference proceedings .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Current company [ edit ] After the merger, former Springer Science+Business Media CEO Derk Haank became CEO of Springer Nature.

[ 15 ] When he retired by the end of 2017, he was succeeded by Daniel Ropers , [ 16 ] the co-founder and long-time CEO of bol.com .

[ 17 ] In September 2019, Ropers was replaced by Frank Vrancken Peeters .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] The company is releasing several Policies & Reports, [ 20 ] including a Modern Slavery Act statement, a Tax strategy, and a gender pay gap report for Springer Nature's UK operations.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Springer Nature is a signatory of the SDG Publishers Compact , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] and has taken steps to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the publishing industry.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] These include becoming carbon neutral as of 2020, [ 26 ] organizing its publications into 17 SDG-related content hubs, [ 28 ] [ 29 ] and launching thematic journals such as Nature Climate Change , Nature Energy , Nature Sustainability , [ 30 ] Nature Food , Nature Human Behaviour , Nature Water and Nature Cities (appearing 2024).

[ 31 ] In 2014, the Nature Portfolio series of themed online journals was launched.

[ 32 ] Springer's journal Environment, Development, and Sustainability was one of six out of 100 journals to receive the highest possible "Five Wheel" impact rating [ 33 ] from the SDG Impact Intensity™ journal rating system, based on an analysis of data from 2016–2020 that assessed relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] Brands [ edit ] The following major brands belong to the group (see also Subsidiaries): [ 36 ] Nature Springer.com BioMed Central Scientific American Heinrich Vogel Verlag [ 37 ] SciGraph Controversies [ edit ] In 2017, the company agreed to block access to hundreds of articles on its Chinese site, cutting off access to articles related to Tibet, Taiwan, and China's political elite.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] The company retracted a paper in 2019, in its journal BMC Emergency Medicine due to a dubious peer-review process (a herpetologist could have denied the publication of the paper).

[ 40 ] In July 2020, Springer Nature retracted a paper in the journal Society due to a dubious review process and criticism regarding racism.

[ 41 ] In August 2020, Springer Nature was reported to have rejected the publication of an article at the behest of its co-publisher, Wenzhou Medical University , from a Taiwanese doctor because the word "China" was not placed after "Taiwan".

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] In November 2021, Springer Nature retracted 44 nonsense papers from the Arabian Journal of Geosciences after a lapse in the peer review process.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] In August 2023, after an investigation, Springer Nature retracted a paper that claimed there is no evidence of a global climate crisis.

[ 46 ] [ 48 ] Lawsuits [ edit ] In September 2024, Lucina Uddin , a neuroscience professor at UCLA , sued Springer Nature along with five other academic journal publishers in a proposed class-action lawsuit, alleging that the publishers violated antitrust law by agreeing not to compete against each other for manuscripts and by denying scholars payment for peer review services.
