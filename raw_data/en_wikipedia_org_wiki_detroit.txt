It is situated on the bank of the Detroit River across from the Canadian city of Windsor, Ontario . It is the 26th-most populous city in the United States and the largest U.S. city on the Canada–United States border with a population of 639,111 at the 2020 census , [ 9 ] while the Metro Detroit area at over 4.4 million people is the 14th-largest metropolitan area in the nation and second-largest in the Midwest (after the Chicago metropolitan area ). The county seat of Wayne County , Detroit is a significant cultural center known for its contributions to music, art, architecture and design, in addition to its historical automotive and industrial background.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] In 1701, Royal French explorers Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and Alphonse de Tonty founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit . During the late 19th and early 20th century, it became an important industrial hub at the center of the Great Lakes region . The city's population rose to be the fourth-largest in the nation by 1920, with the expansion of the automotive industry in the early 20th century.

[ 12 ] One of its main features, the Detroit River , became the busiest commercial hub in the world. In the mid-20th century, Detroit entered a state of urban decay that has continued to the present, as a result of industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs in the auto industry, and rapid suburbanization. Since reaching a peak of 1.85 million at the 1950 census , Detroit's population has declined by more than 65 percent.

[ 9 ] In 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy , but successfully exited in 2014.

[ 13 ] In 2024, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that Detroit's population grew for a second consecutive year and led population growth in Michigan for the first time since the 1950s.

[ 14 ] Detroit is a port on the Detroit River, one of the four major straits that connect the Great Lakes system to the St. Lawrence Seaway . The city anchors the third-largest regional economy in the Midwest and the 16th-largest in the United States.

[ 15 ] It is also best known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry , and the " Big Three " auto manufacturers— General Motors , Ford , and Stellantis North America ( Chrysler )—are all headquartered in Metro Detroit.

[ 16 ] It houses the Detroit Metropolitan Airport , one of the most important hub airports in the United States. Detroit and the adjacent Canadian city Windsor constitute the second-busiest international crossing in North America, after San Diego–Tijuana .

[ 17 ] Detroit's culture is marked with diversity, having both local and international influences. Detroit gave rise to the music genres of Motown and techno , and also played an important role in the development of jazz , hip-hop , rock , and punk . A globally unique stock of architectural monuments and historic places was the result of the city's rapid growth in its boom years. Since the 2000s, conservation efforts have managed to save many architectural pieces and achieve several large-scale revitalizations , including the restoration of several historic theaters and entertainment venues, high-rise renovations, new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. Detroit is an increasingly popular tourist destination which caters to about 16 million visitors per year.

[ 18 ] In 2015, Detroit was designated a " City of Design " by UNESCO , the first and only U.S. city to receive that designation.

[ 19 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Detroit For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Detroit .

Toponymy [ edit ] Detroit and adjacent Windsor, Ontario , Canada separated by the Detroit River Detroit is named after the Detroit River , connecting Lake Huron with Lake Erie . The name comes from the French language word détroit meaning ' strait ' as the city was situated on a narrow north–south passage of water linking the two lakes. The river was known as le détroit du Lac Érié in the French language, which means ' the strait of Lake Erie ' .

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] In the historical context, the strait included the St. Clair River , Lake St. Clair , and the Detroit River.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] Indigenous settlement [ edit ] Paleo-Indians inhabited areas near Detroit as early as 11,000 years ago including the culture referred to as the Mound Builders .

[ 24 ] By the 17th century, the region was inhabited by Huron , Odawa , Potawatomi , and Iroquois peoples.

[ 25 ] The area is known by the Anishinaabe people as Waawiiyaataanong , translating to 'where the water curves around'.

[ 26 ] The first Europeans did not penetrate into the region and reach the straits of Detroit until French missionaries and traders worked their way around the Iroquois League, with whom they were at war in the 1630s.

[ 27 ] The Huron and Neutral people held the north side of Lake Erie until the 1650s, when the Iroquois pushed them and the Erie people away from the lake and its beaver -rich feeder streams in the Beaver Wars of 1649–1655.

[ 27 ] By the 1670s, the war-weakened Iroquois laid claim to as far south as the Ohio River valley in northern Kentucky as hunting grounds, [ 27 ] and had absorbed many other Iroquoian peoples after defeating them in war.

[ 27 ] For the next hundred years, virtually no British or French action was contemplated without consultation with the Iroquois or consideration of their likely response.

[ 27 ] French settlement [ edit ] Main article: Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit Topographical plan of the Town of Detroit and Fort Lernoult showing major streets, gardens, fortifications, military comple­xes, and public buildings (John Jacob Ulrich Rivardi, ca. 1800) On July 24, 1701, the French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac (1658–1730), with his lieutenant Alphonse de Tonty (1659–1727), and more than a hundred other Royal French settlers traveling south and west from New France (modern Province of Quebec ), along the St. Lawrence River valley to the Great Lakes region, began constructing a small fort on the north bank of the Detroit River. Cadillac named the settlement Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit , [ 28 ] after Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain (1643–1727), the Secretary of State of the Navy under King Louis XIV (1638–1715, reigned 1643–1715) in the Royal government in Paris.

[ 29 ] Sainte-Anne de Détroit was founded on July 26 and is the second-oldest continuously operating Roman Catholic parish in the United States.

[ 30 ] France offered free land to colonists to attract families further west into the Great Lakes region interior of the North American continent to Detroit; when it eventually reached a population of about 800 by 1765, after the colonial conflict of the French and Indian War (1753–1763), ( Seven Years' War in Europe), it became the largest European settlement between the important towns of Montreal and New Orleans , both also French settlements, in the former colonies of New France and La Louisiane (further south on the Mississippi River , on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico ), respectively.

[ 31 ] The region's then colonial economy was based on the lucrative fur trade , in which numerous Native American peoples had important roles as trappers and traders.

British rule [ edit ] Further information: Fort Shelby (Michigan) During the French and Indian War (1753–63)—the North American front of the Seven Years' War in Europe between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of France —British troops gained control of the settlement a few years into the conflict in 1760 and shortened its name to Detroit. Several regional Native American tribes, such as the Potowatomi , Ojibwe and Huron, launched Pontiac's War (1763–1766), and laid siege in 1763 to Fort Detroit along the Detroit River in the Great Lakes but failed to capture it. In defeat, France ceded its territory in North America of New France and south of the lakes east of the Mississippi to the Appalachian Mountains to Britain following the war.

[ 32 ] When Great Britain evicted France from its colonial possessions in New France ( Canada ) in the peace terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1763, it also removed one barrier to American colonists migrating west across the mountains.

[ 33 ] British negotiations with the Iroquois would both prove critical and lead to the Royal Proclamation of 1763 , which limited settlements South of and below the Great Lakes and west of the Alleghenies / Appalachians . Many colonists and pioneers in the Thirteen Colonies along the East Coast , resented and then simply defied this restraint, later becoming supporters of the rebellious American Revolution . By 1773, after the addition of increasing numbers of the Anglo-American settlers, the population of Detroit and Fort Detroit , was edging up to 1,400 (doubled in the previous decade). During the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the indigenous and loyalist raids of 1778 and the resultant 1779 decisive Sullivan Expedition reopened the Ohio Country (north of the Ohio River and west of the mountains) to even more westward emigration, which began almost immediately to get away from the eastern warfare. By 1778, its population had doubled again, reaching 2,144 and it was the third-largest town in what was known then as the Province of Quebec since the British takeover of former French colonial possessions in North America in 1763.

[ 34 ] After the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and the establishment and recognition of the United States as an independent country, the Great Britain ceded Detroit and other territories in the interior region of the continent, south of the Great Lakes and west of the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River under the  peace of the terms of the 1783 Treaty of Paris . The new Northwest Territories established the southern border with Great Britain's remaining colonial provinces in British North America and became provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada . However, the disputed border area remained under British control with several military forts and trading posts for another decade, and its forces did not fully withdraw until 1796, following the negotiations and ratification of the subsequent Jay Treaty of 1794 between the British and Americans.

[ 35 ] By the turn of the 19th century, white American settlers began pouring westwards across the Appalachians and through the Great Lakes.

[ 36 ] Legacy [ edit ] Further information: Muskrat French Today the municipal flag of Detroit reflects its both its French and English colonial heritage. Descendants of the earliest French and French-Canadian settlers formed a cohesive community, who gradually were superseded as the dominant population after more Anglo-American settlers arrived in the early 19th century with American westward migration. Living along the shores of Lake St. Clair and south to Monroe and downriver suburbs, the ethnic French Canadians of Detroit, also known as Muskrat French in reference to the fur trade, remain a subculture in the region up into the 21st century.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] Post-revolutionary period and 19th century [ edit ] From top: Woodward Avenue shopping district in 1865; The City of Detroit (from Canada Shore) , 1872, by A. C. Warren; the Belle Isle Park in 1891 The Great Detroit Fire of 1805 destroyed most of the city's wooden buildings, leaving only a stone fort, a river warehouse, and brick chimneys from former homes.

[ 39 ] Despite the extensive damage, none of Detroit's 600 residents perished.

[ 40 ] The aftermath of the fire left a lasting legacy on the city's heritage. Father Gabriel Richard coined the city motto, "Speramus Meliora; Resurget Cineribus," as he surveyed the ruins.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] The city seal, designed in 1827, directly depicted the fire by showing two women, one grieving the destruction while the other gestures toward a new city rising from the ashes.

[ 43 ] The seal forms the center of Detroit's flag.

From 1805 to 1847, Detroit served as the capital city of the Michigan Territory and later became its first state capital in January 1837 after Michigan's admission to the Union. During the War of 1812 , Detroit became a focal point of conflict. U.S. Army commander William Hull surrendered Fort Detroit without a fight after the city was cut off from American support assembling at the River Raisin . Later, the U.S. attempted to retake the fort and town during the Battle of Frenchtown in January 1813, a significant victory for the British. The battle is commemorated at the River Raisin National Battlefield Park near Monroe, Michigan . Detroit was eventually recaptured later that year.

[ 44 ] Detroit was officially incorporated as a city in 1815, and its urban design was influenced by the grand boulevards of Washington, D.C.

[ 45 ] Michigan Territorial Chief Justice Augustus B. Woodward , who played a key role in the city's development, designed a geometric street plan that included wide avenues and plazas.

[ 46 ] In 1817, he founded the Catholepistemiad , later evolving into the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan . Detroit's growth continued as a center of education and culture for the Michigan Territory.

Before the American Civil War , Detroit's position along the Canada-U.S. border made it a vital stop on the Underground Railroad . Thousands of enslaved African Americans escaped to Canada via the city.

[ 47 ] [ 45 ] [ 48 ] Notable activists like George DeBaptiste , William Lambert , and Laura Smith Haviland played key roles in assisting refugees.

[ 49 ] Detroit's contributions to the Union effort were also significant, with many residents volunteering to fight. The city's 24th Michigan Infantry Regiment , part of the famous Iron Brigade , suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of Gettysburg .

[ 50 ] The city's tensions over race, in tandem with national concerns over the draft, led to the Detroit race riot of 1863 , leaving some dead and over 200 Black residents homeless. This prompted the establishment of a full-time police force in 1865.

In the late 19th century, Detroit grew as a hub for industry, particularly shipping and manufacturing. The city's wealth, driven by industrial magnates, led to the construction of opulent Gilded Age mansions along the grand avenues designed by Woodward. Detroit earned the nickname "Paris of the West" for its architectural beauty.

[ 45 ] By 1896, Henry Ford 's first automobile was built in the city, and Detroit expanded its borders, annexing surrounding villages and townships as it solidified its place as a key player in the automobile industry.

[ 51 ] Early 20th century and World War II [ edit ] From top: Cadillac Square and Wayne County Building (1902); Cadillac Square (1910s); corner of Michigan Avenue and Griswold Street (circa 1920) In 1903, Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company . Alongside automotive pioneers William C. Durant , the Dodge brothers, James and William Packard , and Walter Chrysler , they established the Big Three automakers , solidifying Detroit's status as the world's automotive capital by the early 20th century.

[ 45 ] The rise of the automotive industry in the United States transformed the city, leading to the development of related businesses such as garages, gas stations, and factories for parts.

[ citation needed ] Detroit's population grew rapidly, reaching the fourth-largest city in the U.S. by 1920.

[ 52 ] In 1907, the Detroit River carried 67 million tons of shipping commerce, surpassing both London and New York City in volume. This earned the river the title "the Greatest Commercial Artery on Earth." During prohibition in the United States (1920–1933), the Detroit River became a major route for smuggling illegal alcohol from Canada.

[ 12 ] The booming auto industry and the expansion of shipping trade were central to Detroit's economic growth in the early 20th century.

With the rapid growth of industrial workers in the auto factories, labor unions such as the American Federation of Labor and the United Auto Workers (UAW) fought to organize workers to gain them better working conditions and wages. They initiated strikes and other tactics in support of improvements such as the 8-hour day/40-hour work week , increased wages, greater benefits, and improved working conditions . The labor activism during those years increased the influence of union leaders in the city such as Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters and Walter Reuther of the UAW.

[ 53 ] The demographic shifts caused by industrialization led to significant racial tensions in Detroit. The Great Migration brought African Americans from the South, while many southern and eastern European immigrants also moved to the city. Competition for jobs and housing fueled tensions between different ethnic and racial groups.

[ citation needed ] This period saw the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in Detroit, which became a powerful force in the city during the 1920s, targeting Black, Catholic, and Jewish communities.

[ 54 ] Even after the Klan's decline, the Black Legion , a secret vigilante group, continued to spread fear in the 1930s.

[ 55 ] In the 1940s the world's "first urban depressed freeway" ever built, the Davison , was constructed.

[ 56 ] Systemic racial discrimination remained prevalent in Detroit, with restrictive housing covenants and violence against Black neighborhoods like Black Bottom and Paradise Valley.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] The city's racial tensions boiled over during the 1943 Detroit race riot . Sparked by a protest at the Packard plant , the riot resulted in 34 deaths, 433 injuries, and widespread property damage.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] During World War II , the government encouraged retooling of the automobile industry in support of the Allied powers , leading to Detroit's key role in the American Arsenal of Democracy .

[ 62 ] Jobs expanded so rapidly due to the defense buildup in World War II that 400,000 people migrated to the city from 1941 to 1943, including 50,000 blacks in the second wave of the Great Migration, and 350,000 whites, many of them from the South. Whites, including ethnic Europeans, feared black competition for jobs and scarce housing. The federal government prohibited discrimination in defense work, but when in June 1943 Packard promoted three black people to work next to whites on its assembly lines, 25,000 white workers walked off the job.

[ 63 ] The skyline of Detroit, 1929 Late 20th century, racial tension and decline [ edit ] Main article: History of Detroit § Decline of Detroit From top: Aerial photo of Detroit (1932); Detroit at its population peak in the mid-20th century. Looking south down Woodward Avenue from the Maccabees Building with the city's skyline in the distance.

Industrial mergers in the 1950s, especially in the automobile sector, increased oligopoly in the American auto industry. Detroit saw the consolidation of companies like Packard and Hudson , which eventually disappeared. At its peak in the 1950 census , Detroit was the fifth-largest U.S. city, with a population of 1.85 million.

[ 64 ] In 1950, the city held about one-third of the state's population. Over the next 60 years, the city's population declined to less than 10 percent of the state's population. The sprawling metropolitan area grew to contain more than half of Michigan's population during the same time period.

[ 45 ] The city's auto industry, which made up 60% of its economy, continued to offer employment opportunities, especially for African Americans migrating from the South to escape Jim Crow laws . While the migration brought higher employment rates, with a 103% increase in Black workers, racial discrimination persisted in employment and housing. Black Detroiters often held lower-paying factory jobs, while city services and better-paying positions remained largely dominated by white residents. Discriminatory policies, such as redlining , limited Black access to housing and financial services, forcing many into overcrowded, unsafe neighborhoods. White residents and political leaders resisted integration, reinforcing a cycle of exclusion and segregation.

[ 65 ] As in other major American cities in the postwar era, urban planning and infrastructure changes also impacted Detroit's racial dynamics. The construction of highways and freeways in the postwar era displaced many Black communities, including historically significant neighborhoods like Black Bottom and Paradise Valley. These areas, vital for Black businesses and culture, were demolished for urban renewal projects, exacerbating the displacement of low-income residents with little consideration for the community impact.

[ 65 ] An electric PCC streetcar in Detroit, 1953 The city also saw a shift in its transportation system, as Detroit's last electric streetcar line was replaced with buses in 1956.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] This change, alongside the rise of suburbanization and the relocation of industries to the outskirts, favored car-dependent, low-density development. By the 21st century, Detroit's sprawling metro area had developed into one of the most spread-out job markets in the U.S., contributing to a decline in Detroit's population and eroding its tax base as jobs moved beyond the reach of urban low-income workers.

[ 68 ] The Detroit Walk to Freedom civil rights march occurred in June 1963.

[ 69 ] Martin Luther King Jr.

gave a major speech that foreshadowed his " I Have a Dream " speech in Washington, D.C., two months later. While the civil rights movement gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965, longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner-city black youth who wanted change.

[ 70 ] I have a dream this afternoon that my four little children, that my four little children will not come up in the same young days that I came up within, but they will be judged on the basis of the content of their character, not the color of their skin ... I have a dream this evening that one day we will recognize the words of Jefferson that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." I have a dream ...

—Martin Luther King Jr. (June 1963 Speech at the Detroit Walk to Freedom ) [ 71 ] The deadly 1967 Detroit riot resulted in massive demographic shifts via white flight .

Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the Twelfth Street riot in July 1967. Governor George W. Romney ordered the Michigan National Guard into Detroit, and President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in U.S. Army troops. The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed, mostly in black residential and business areas. Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods. The affected district lay in ruins for decades.

[ 72 ] According to the Chicago Tribune , it was the 3rd most costly riot in the United States.

[ 73 ] First Williams Block in 1915 (left) and 1989 (right) In 1970, the NAACP filed a lawsuit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken , alleging de facto segregation in Detroit's public schools. The lawsuit argued that although schools were not legally segregated, policies in Detroit and surrounding counties maintained racial segregation through housing practices, as school demographics mirrored segregated neighborhoods.

[ 74 ] The District Court ruled in favor of the NAACP, [ 75 ] but in the landmark 1974 Milliken v. Bradley decision , the U.S. Supreme Court limited the scope of desegregation, ruling that suburban areas could not be forced to aid in Detroit's school desegregation.

[ 76 ] Amid these challenges, Detroit elected Coleman Young as its first Black mayor in 1973. Young focused on increasing racial diversity in city services and improving Detroit's transportation system, although regional tensions with suburban leaders persisted.

[ 77 ] In 1976, a federal grant for a regional rapid transit system failed due to conflicts over planning, leaving Detroit to develop its own Detroit People Mover system.

[ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] The city's struggles were exacerbated by the 1973 and 1979 oil crises, which hurt the auto industry and led to layoffs and plant closures, further diminishing the city's tax base.

[ 81 ] Despite efforts to revitalize the city, such as the opening of the Renaissance Center in 1977, downtown Detroit continued to lose businesses to suburban areas.

[ 45 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Middle-class flight, high unemployment, and increased crime worsened the city's conditions, with abandoned buildings and neighborhoods further contributing to its decline. Young's focus on downtown development was criticized as insufficient in addressing the broader social and economic challenges faced by the city's residents.

[ 84 ] In 1993, Young retired as Detroit's longest-serving mayor and was succeeded by Dennis Archer . Archer prioritized downtown development, easing tensions with its suburban neighbors. A referendum to allow casino gambling in the city passed in 1996; several temporary casino facilities opened in 1999, and permanent downtown casinos with hotels opened in 2007–08.

[ 85 ] 21st century [ edit ] Further information: Detroit bankruptcy and Planning and development in Detroit Michigan Central Station , once symbolic of the city's decline, was redeveloped by Ford Motor Company and reopened in 2024.

[ 86 ] Campus Martius , a downtown park reconfiguration, opened in 2004 and was cited as one of the best public spaces in the U.S.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] The first phase of the International Riverfront redevelopment was completed in 2001 for Detroit's 300th-anniversary celebration.

[ 90 ] In 2008, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick resigned after felony convictions, and in 2013 was sentenced to 28 years in prison.

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] His actions cost the city an estimated $20 million.

[ 93 ] In 2011, about half of Detroit's 305,000 property owners failed to pay their taxes, leaving approximately $246 million (~$329 million in 2023) uncollected.

[ 94 ] Michigan took control of Detroit's government after the city faced a $327 million deficit and over $14 billion in debt.

[ 95 ] Governor Rick Snyder declared a financial emergency in March 2013 , and the city was relying on bond money to stay afloat, with unpaid days off for workers. Underfunded services and failed turnaround efforts led to the appointment of an emergency manager.

[ 96 ] In June 2013, Detroit defaulted on $2.5 billion in debt, and on July 18, it became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy .

[ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] Detroit exited bankruptcy in December 2014, cutting $7 billion in debt and investing $1.7 billion in services.

[ 100 ] The Detroit Institute of Arts , holding over 60,000 artworks worth billions, became a private organization to help fund the city's recovery after legal battles.

[ 101 ] Post-bankruptcy, efforts to improve city services included replacing non-functional street lights with 65,000 LED lights, making Detroit the largest U.S. city with all LED street lighting by 2016.

[ 102 ] Neighborhood revitalization continued, with volunteer renovation projects and urban gardening movements.

[ 103 ] In 2011, the Port Authority Passenger Terminal opened, with the riverwalk connecting Hart Plaza to the Renaissance Center.

One symbol of the city's decades-long decline, the Michigan Central Station , was long vacant. The city renovated it with new windows, elevators and facilities, completing the work in December 2015.

[ 104 ] In 2018, Ford Motor Company purchased the building and plans to use it for mobility testing with a potential return of train service.

[ 105 ] Several other landmark buildings have been privately renovated and adapted as condominiums , hotels, offices, or for cultural uses. Detroit was mentioned as a city of renaissance and has reversed many of the trends of the prior decades.

[ 106 ] [ 107 ] The city has seen a rise in gentrification in some neighborhoods.

[ 108 ] In downtown, for example, the construction of Little Caesars Arena brought with it high class shops and restaurants along Woodward Avenue. Office tower and condominium construction has led to an influx of wealthy families but also a displacement of long-time residents and culture.

[ 109 ] [ 110 ] Areas outside of downtown and other recently revived areas have an average household income of about 25% less than the gentrified areas, a gap that is continuing to grow.

[ 111 ] Since 2011 property developers have revitalized abandoned or underutilized properties in downtown into budget as well as luxury residences. Office, retail, and hospitality conversions have sparked a visible population growth in downtown Detroit and in 2024 Detroit had outpaced all other Michigan cities.

[ 112 ] Geography [ edit ] A satellite image from Sentinel-2 taken in September 2021 of Detroit and its surrounding metropolitan area with Windsor across the river Metropolitan area [ edit ] Detroit is the center of a three-county urban area (with a population of 3,734,090 within an area of 1,337 square miles (3,460 km 2 ) according to the 2010 United States census ), six-county metropolitan statistical area (population of 5,322,219 in an area of 3,913 square miles [10,130 km 2 ] as of the 2010 census), and a nine-county Combined Statistical Area (population of 5.3 million within 5,814 square miles [15,060 km 2 ] as of 2010 [update] ).

[ 113 ] [ 114 ] [ 115 ] Topography [ edit ] According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 142.87 square miles (370.03 km 2 ), of which 138.75 square miles (359.36 km 2 ) is land and 4.12 square miles (10.67 km 2 ) is water.

[ 116 ] Detroit is the principal city in Metro Detroit and Southeast Michigan . It is situated in the Midwestern United States and the Great Lakes region .

[ 117 ] The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge is the only international wildlife preserve in North America and is uniquely located in the heart of a major metropolitan area. The refuge includes islands, coastal wetlands, marshes, shoals, and waterfront lands along 48 miles (77 km) of the Detroit River and western Lake Erie shoreline.

[ 118 ] The city slopes gently from the northwest to southeast on a till plain composed largely of glacial and lake clay. The most notable topographical feature in the city is the Detroit Moraine, a broad clay ridge on which the older portions of Detroit and Windsor are located, rising approximately 62 feet (19 m) above the river at its highest point.

[ 119 ] The highest elevation in the city is directly north of Gorham Playground on the northwest side approximately three blocks south of 8 Mile Road , at a height of 675 to 680 feet (206 to 207 m).

[ 120 ] Detroit's lowest elevation is along the Detroit River, at a surface height of 572 feet (174 m).

[ 121 ] Belle Isle Park is a 982-acre (1.534 sq mi; 397 ha) island park in the Detroit River, between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario . It is connected to the mainland by the MacArthur Bridge . Belle Isle Park contains such attractions as the James Scott Memorial Fountain , the Belle Isle Conservatory , the Detroit Yacht Club on an adjacent island, a half-mile (800 m) beach, a golf course, a nature center, monuments, and gardens. Both the Detroit and Windsor skylines can be viewed at the island's Sunset Point.

[ 122 ] Three road systems cross the city: the original French template, with avenues radiating from the waterfront, and true north–south roads based on the Northwest Ordinance township system. The city is north of Windsor, Ontario. Detroit is the only major city along the Canada–U.S. border in which one travels south to cross into Canada.

[ 123 ] Detroit has four border crossings: the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit–Windsor tunnel provide motor vehicle thoroughfares, with the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel providing railroad access to and from Canada. The fourth border crossing is the Detroit–Windsor Truck Ferry , near the Windsor Salt Mine and Zug Island . Near Zug Island, the southwest part of the city was developed over a 1,500-acre (610 ha) salt mine that is 1,100 feet (340 m) below the surface. The Detroit salt mine run by the Detroit Salt Company has over 100 miles (160 km) of roads within.

[ 124 ] [ 125 ] Cityscape [ edit ] Skyline of Detroit from Windsor, Ontario in 2014. Notable buildings include the Renaissance Center , Ally Detroit Center and Penobscot Building .

Architecture [ edit ] Main article: Architecture of metropolitan Detroit See also: List of tallest buildings in Detroit Ally Detroit Center and the Michigan Labor Legacy Monument Merchants Row on Woodward Avenue between Grand Circus Park and Campus Martius Park downtown Detroit's waterfront showcases a variety of architectural styles, with the postmodern Neo-Gothic spires of Ally Detroit Center paying homage to the city's Art Deco skyscrapers. Together with the Renaissance Center , these buildings form a distinctive and recognizable skyline. Examples of the Art Deco style include the Guardian Building and Penobscot Building downtown, as well as the Fisher Building and Cadillac Place in New Center . Prominent cultural landmarks from the early 20th century include the Fox Theatre , Detroit Opera House , and Detroit Institute of Arts .

[ 126 ] [ 127 ] While Downtown Detroit and New Center feature high-rise buildings, much of Detroit consists of low-rise structures and single-family homes. Residential high-rises are concentrated in upscale neighborhoods such as the East Riverfront, extending toward Grosse Pointe , and Palmer Park . The University Commons-Palmer Park district anchors historic areas including Palmer Woods , Sherwood Forest , and the University District near the University of Detroit Mercy .

[ 128 ] 42 significant structures in the city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Pre-World War II neighborhoods exhibit architectural styles of the era, with working-class areas featuring wood-frame and brick houses, while middle- and upper-class neighborhoods such as Brush Park , Woodbridge , Indian Village , Palmer Woods, and Boston-Edison contain larger, more ornate homes and mansions.

[ 129 ] Multi-million dollar restorations and new developments have revitalized neighborhoods such as West Canfield and Brush Park.

[ 82 ] [ 130 ] The city has one of the United States' largest surviving collections of late 19th- and early 20th-century buildings.

[ 127 ] Architecturally significant churches and cathedrals in the city include St. Joseph's , Old St. Mary's , the Sweetest Heart of Mary , and the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament .

[ 126 ] Historic preservation efforts continue to thrive, with downtown redevelopment projects revitalizing parts of the city, among them Campus Martius Park , Grand Circus Park near the city's theater district , Ford Field , Comerica Park , and Little Caesars Arena .

[ 126 ] [ 131 ] [ 132 ] Neighborhoods [ edit ] Further information: List of neighborhoods in Detroit The Cass Park Historic District in Midtown Detroit New Center Houses in the Indian Village neighborhood Detroit has a variety of neighborhood types. The revitalized Downtown, Midtown , Corktown, New Center areas feature many historic buildings and are high density, while further out, particularly in the northeast and on the fringes, [ 133 ] high vacancy levels are problematic, for which a number of solutions have been proposed. In 2007, Downtown Detroit was recognized as the best city neighborhood in which to retire among the United States' largest metro areas by CNNMoney editors.

[ 134 ] Lafayette Park is a revitalized neighborhood on the city's east side , part of the Ludwig Mies van der Rohe residential district.

[ 135 ] The 78-acre (32 ha) development was originally called the Gratiot Park. Planned by Mies van der Rohe , Ludwig Hilberseimer and Alfred Caldwell it includes a landscaped, 19-acre (7.7 ha) park with no through traffic, in which these and other low-rise apartment buildings are situated.

[ 135 ] Immigrants have contributed to the city's neighborhood revitalization, especially in southwest Detroit.

[ 136 ] Southwest Detroit has experienced a thriving economy in recent years, as evidenced by new housing, increased business openings and the recently opened Mexicantown International Welcome Center.

[ 137 ] The city has numerous neighborhoods consisting of vacant properties resulting in low inhabited density in those areas, stretching city services and infrastructure. These neighborhoods are concentrated in the northeast and on the city's fringes.

[ 133 ] A 2009 parcel survey found about a quarter of residential lots in the city to be undeveloped or vacant, and about 10% of the city's housing to be unoccupied.

[ 133 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] The survey also reported that most (86%) of the city's homes are in good condition with a minority (9%) in fair condition needing only minor repairs.

[ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] To deal with vacancy issues, the city has begun demolishing the derelict houses, razing 3,000 of the total 10,000 in 2010, [ 142 ] but the resulting low density creates a strain on the city's infrastructure. To remedy this, a number of solutions have been proposed including resident relocation from more sparsely populated neighborhoods and converting unused space to urban agricultural use, including Hantz Woodlands , though the city expects to be in the planning stages for up to another two years.

[ 143 ] [ 144 ] Public funding and private investment have been made with promises to rehabilitate neighborhoods. In April 2008, the city announced a $300 million (~$417 million in 2023) stimulus plan to create jobs and revitalize neighborhoods, financed by city bonds and paid for by earmarking about 15% of the wagering tax.

[ 143 ] The city's working plans for neighborhood revitalizations include 7-Mile/Livernois, Brightmoor , East English Village, Grand River/Greenfield, North End , and Osborn .

[ 143 ] Private organizations have pledged substantial funding to the efforts.

[ 145 ] [ 146 ] Additionally, the city has cleared a 1,200-acre (490 ha) section of land for large-scale neighborhood construction, which the city is calling the Far Eastside Plan .

[ 147 ] In 2011, Mayor Dave Bing announced a plan to categorize neighborhoods by their needs and prioritize the most needed services for those neighborhoods.

[ 148 ] Parks [ edit ] Belle Isle and Grand Circus park Detroit Parks & Recreation maintains 308 public parks, totaling 4,950 (2,003 ha) acres or about 5.6% of the city's land area.

Belle Isle Park , Detroit's largest and most visited park is the largest city-owned island park in the U.S., covering 982 acres (397 ha).

Grand Circus , the city's first municipal park, opened in 1847. In the early 20th century, the city enlisted landscape architect Augustus Woodward to conceive a framework for Detroit's modern parks system. Augustus Woodward's plan for the city imagined grand boulevards, spacious and elegant common parks, and an orderly, hub-and-spoke city layout.

[ 149 ] The Detroit International Riverfront features a 3.5-mile promenade with parks, residential buildings, and commercial areas, extending from Hart Plaza to Belle Isle Park. This area includes Tri-Centennial State Park and Harbor, Michigan's first urban state park. Plans for the riverfront's second phase will extend the promenade to the Ambassador Bridge , stimulating residential redevelopment along the riverfront.

[ 150 ] Detroit's major parks also include River Rouge , Palmer, and Chene Park , contributing to the city's green space and outdoor recreation.

[ 151 ] The Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Authority was created in 1940 by the citizens of Southeast Michigan to serve as a regional park system the park system includes 13 parks totaling more than 24,000 acres (97 km 2 ) arranged along the Huron River and Clinton River forming a partial ring around the Detroit metro area.
