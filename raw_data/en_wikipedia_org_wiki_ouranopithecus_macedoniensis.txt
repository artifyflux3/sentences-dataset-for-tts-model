[ 1 ] This species is known from three localities in Northern Greece . The first specimen of Ouranopithecus macedoniensis with upper deciduous teeth is described from the Ravin de la Pluie locality in Axios Valley.

[ 2 ] The other localities are Chalkidiki and Xirochori .

It is known from a large collection of cranial fossils and few postcranial. The material has been dated to the late Miocene 9.6–8.7 million years old, so slightly earlier than O. turkae .

[ 1 ] To some, this suggests O. turkae is the direct descendant of O. macedoniensis , although it is generally accepted that they are sister taxa .

[ 3 ] Etymology [ edit ] The specific epithet macedoniensis is due to the holotype fossil's discovery location in Macedonia, Greece .

Habitat [ edit ] Examination of dental remains of O. macedoniensis and associated bovid species indicate a habitat of low tree cover and a rich herbaceous layer .

[ 4 ] Morphology [ edit ] O. macedoniensis had a large, broad face with a prominent supraorbital torus .  It also had square-shaped orbits.

[ 5 ] O. macedoniensis may have had a relatively large body size. The postcranial evidence is thin, but the dentition of O. macedoniensis suggests extreme sexual dimorphism, a far higher degree than that seen in any extant great ape.

[ 4 ] The ape was probably a quadruped. It is not possible to postulate on how O. macedoniensis used the trees but it seems likely that it did.

O. macedoniensis' s molar enamel cover was fairly thick and had low cusps. The male O. macedoniensis had large canine teeth with shearing lower premolars .

[ 4 ] Diet [ edit ] Based on the heavily pitted surface of the second molar of Ouranopithecus macedoniensis , it is assumed that its diet consisted of harder foods such as nuts or tubers .

[ 4 ] Behaviour [ edit ] Behaviour is very difficult to infer in species with such a small diversity of fossil remains. The large body size may have made climbing difficult in some aspects so it may have been a terrestrial forager but this is speculation within the literature.
