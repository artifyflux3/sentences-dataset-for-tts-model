In air, sound pressure can be measured using a microphone , and in water with a hydrophone . The SI unit of sound pressure is the pascal (Pa).

[ 1 ] Mathematical definition [ edit ] Sound pressure diagram: Silence Audible sound Atmospheric pressure Sound pressure A sound wave in a transmission medium causes a deviation (sound pressure, a dynamic pressure) in the local ambient pressure, a static pressure.

Sound pressure, denoted p , is defined by p total = p stat + p , {\displaystyle p_{\text{total}}=p_{\text{stat}}+p,} where p total is the total pressure, p stat is the static pressure.

Sound measurements [ edit ] Sound intensity [ edit ] Main article: Sound intensity In a sound wave, the complementary variable to sound pressure is the particle velocity . Together, they determine the sound intensity of the wave.

Sound intensity , denoted I and measured in W · m −2 in SI units, is defined by I = p v , {\displaystyle \mathbf {I} =p\mathbf {v} ,} where p is the sound pressure, v is the particle velocity.

Acoustic impedance [ edit ] Main article: Acoustic impedance Acoustic impedance , denoted Z and measured in Pa·m −3 ·s in SI units, is defined by [ 2 ] Z ( s ) = p ^ ^ ( s ) Q ^ ^ ( s ) , {\displaystyle Z(s)={\frac {{\hat {p}}(s)}{{\hat {Q}}(s)}},} where p ^ ^ ( s ) {\displaystyle {\hat {p}}(s)} is the Laplace transform of sound pressure, [ citation needed ] Q ^ ^ ( s ) {\displaystyle {\hat {Q}}(s)} is the Laplace transform of sound volume flow rate.

Specific acoustic impedance , denoted z and measured in Pa·m −1 ·s in SI units, is defined by [ 2 ] z ( s ) = p ^ ^ ( s ) v ^ ^ ( s ) , {\displaystyle z(s)={\frac {{\hat {p}}(s)}{{\hat {v}}(s)}},} where p ^ ^ ( s ) {\displaystyle {\hat {p}}(s)} is the Laplace transform of sound pressure, v ^ ^ ( s ) {\displaystyle {\hat {v}}(s)} is the Laplace transform of particle velocity.

Particle displacement [ edit ] Main article: Particle displacement The particle displacement of a progressive sine wave is given by δ δ ( r , t ) = δ δ m cos ⁡ ⁡ ( k ⋅ ⋅ r − − ω ω t + φ φ δ δ , 0 ) , {\displaystyle \delta (\mathbf {r} ,t)=\delta _{\text{m}}\cos(\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {r} -\omega t+\varphi _{\delta ,0}),} where δ δ m {\displaystyle \delta _{\text{m}}} is the amplitude of the particle displacement, φ φ δ δ , 0 {\displaystyle \varphi _{\delta ,0}} is the phase shift of the particle displacement, k is the angular wavevector , ω is the angular frequency .

It follows that the particle velocity and the sound pressure along the direction of propagation of the sound wave x are given by v ( r , t ) = ∂ ∂ δ δ ∂ ∂ t ( r , t ) = ω ω δ δ m cos ⁡ ⁡ ( k ⋅ ⋅ r − − ω ω t + φ φ δ δ , 0 + π π 2 ) = v m cos ⁡ ⁡ ( k ⋅ ⋅ r − − ω ω t + φ φ v , 0 ) , {\displaystyle v(\mathbf {r} ,t)={\frac {\partial \delta }{\partial t}}(\mathbf {r} ,t)=\omega \delta _{\text{m}}\cos \left(\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {r} -\omega t+\varphi _{\delta ,0}+{\frac {\pi }{2}}\right)=v_{\text{m}}\cos(\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {r} -\omega t+\varphi _{v,0}),} p ( r , t ) = − − ρ ρ c 2 ∂ ∂ δ δ ∂ ∂ x ( r , t ) = ρ ρ c 2 k x δ δ m cos ⁡ ⁡ ( k ⋅ ⋅ r − − ω ω t + φ φ δ δ , 0 + π π 2 ) = p m cos ⁡ ⁡ ( k ⋅ ⋅ r − − ω ω t + φ φ p , 0 ) , {\displaystyle p(\mathbf {r} ,t)=-\rho c^{2}{\frac {\partial \delta }{\partial x}}(\mathbf {r} ,t)=\rho c^{2}k_{x}\delta _{\text{m}}\cos \left(\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {r} -\omega t+\varphi _{\delta ,0}+{\frac {\pi }{2}}\right)=p_{\text{m}}\cos(\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {r} -\omega t+\varphi _{p,0}),} where v m is the amplitude of the particle velocity, φ φ v , 0 {\displaystyle \varphi _{v,0}} is the phase shift of the particle velocity, p m is the amplitude of the acoustic pressure, φ φ p , 0 {\displaystyle \varphi _{p,0}} is the phase shift of the acoustic pressure.

Taking the Laplace transforms of v and p with respect to time yields v ^ ^ ( r , s ) = v m s cos ⁡ ⁡ φ φ v , 0 − − ω ω sin ⁡ ⁡ φ φ v , 0 s 2 + ω ω 2 , {\displaystyle {\hat {v}}(\mathbf {r} ,s)=v_{\text{m}}{\frac {s\cos \varphi _{v,0}-\omega \sin \varphi _{v,0}}{s^{2}+\omega ^{2}}},} p ^ ^ ( r , s ) = p m s cos ⁡ ⁡ φ φ p , 0 − − ω ω sin ⁡ ⁡ φ φ p , 0 s 2 + ω ω 2 .

{\displaystyle {\hat {p}}(\mathbf {r} ,s)=p_{\text{m}}{\frac {s\cos \varphi _{p,0}-\omega \sin \varphi _{p,0}}{s^{2}+\omega ^{2}}}.} Since φ φ v , 0 = φ φ p , 0 {\displaystyle \varphi _{v,0}=\varphi _{p,0}} , the amplitude of the specific acoustic impedance is given by z m ( r , s ) = | z ( r , s ) | = | p ^ ^ ( r , s ) v ^ ^ ( r , s ) | = p m v m = ρ ρ c 2 k x ω ω .

{\displaystyle z_{\text{m}}(\mathbf {r} ,s)=|z(\mathbf {r} ,s)|=\left|{\frac {{\hat {p}}(\mathbf {r} ,s)}{{\hat {v}}(\mathbf {r} ,s)}}\right|={\frac {p_{\text{m}}}{v_{\text{m}}}}={\frac {\rho c^{2}k_{x}}{\omega }}.} Consequently, the amplitude of the particle displacement is related to that of the acoustic velocity and the sound pressure by δ δ m = v m ω ω , {\displaystyle \delta _{\text{m}}={\frac {v_{\text{m}}}{\omega }},} δ δ m = p m ω ω z m ( r , s ) .

{\displaystyle \delta _{\text{m}}={\frac {p_{\text{m}}}{\omega z_{\text{m}}(\mathbf {r} ,s)}}.} Inverse-proportional law [ edit ] Further information: Inverse-square law When measuring the sound pressure created by a sound source, it is important to measure the distance from the object as well, since the sound pressure of a spherical sound wave decreases as 1/ r from the centre of the sphere (and not as 1/ r 2 , like the sound intensity ): [ 3 ] p ( r ) ∝ ∝ 1 r .

{\displaystyle p(r)\propto {\frac {1}{r}}.} This relationship is an inverse-proportional law .

If the sound pressure p 1 is measured at a distance r 1 from the centre of the sphere, the sound pressure p 2 at another position r 2 can be calculated: p 2 = r 1 r 2 p 1 .

{\displaystyle p_{2}={\frac {r_{1}}{r_{2}}}\,p_{1}.} The inverse-proportional law for sound pressure comes from the inverse-square law for sound intensity : I ( r ) ∝ ∝ 1 r 2 .

{\displaystyle I(r)\propto {\frac {1}{r^{2}}}.} Indeed, I ( r ) = p ( r ) v ( r ) = p ( r ) [ p ∗ ∗ z − − 1 ] ( r ) ∝ ∝ p 2 ( r ) , {\displaystyle I(r)=p(r)v(r)=p(r)\left[p*z^{-1}\right](r)\propto p^{2}(r),} where v {\displaystyle v} is the particle velocity, ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle *} is the convolution operator, z −1 is the convolution inverse of the specific acoustic impedance , hence the inverse-proportional law: p ( r ) ∝ ∝ 1 r .

{\displaystyle p(r)\propto {\frac {1}{r}}.} Sound pressure level [ edit ] For other uses, see Sound level .

Sound pressure level ( SPL ) or acoustic pressure level ( APL ) is a logarithmic measure of the effective pressure of a sound relative to a reference value.

Sound pressure level, denoted L p and measured in dB , [ 4 ] is defined by: [ 5 ] L p = ln ⁡ ⁡ ( p p 0 ) Np = 2 log 10 ⁡ ⁡ ( p p 0 ) B = 20 log 10 ⁡ ⁡ ( p p 0 ) dB , {\displaystyle L_{p}=\ln \left({\frac {p}{p_{0}}}\right)~{\text{Np}}=2\log _{10}\left({\frac {p}{p_{0}}}\right)~{\text{B}}=20\log _{10}\left({\frac {p}{p_{0}}}\right)~{\text{dB}},} where p is the root mean square sound pressure, [ 6 ] p 0 is a reference sound pressure , 1 Np is the neper , 1 B = ( ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ ln 10) Np is the bel , 1 dB = ( ⁠ 1 / 20 ⁠ ln 10) Np is the decibel .

The commonly used reference sound pressure in air is [ 7 ] p 0 = 20 μPa, which is often considered as the threshold of human hearing (roughly the sound of a mosquito flying 3 m away). The proper notations for sound pressure level using this reference are L p /(20 μPa) or L p (re 20 μPa) , but the suffix notations dB SPL , dB(SPL) , dBSPL, and dB SPL are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI.

[ 8 ] Most sound-level measurements will be made relative to this reference, meaning 1 Pa will equal an SPL of 20 log 10 ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 2 × × 10 − − 5 ) dB ≈ ≈ 94 dB {\displaystyle 20\log _{10}\left({\frac {1}{2\times 10^{-5}}}\right)~{\text{dB}}\approx 94~{\text{dB}}} . In other media, such as underwater , a reference level of 1 μPa is used.

[ 9 ] These references are defined in ANSI S1.1-2013 .

[ 10 ] The main instrument for measuring sound levels in the environment is the sound level meter . Most sound level meters provide readings in A, C, and Z-weighted decibels and must meet international standards such as IEC 61672-2013 .

Examples [ edit ] The lower limit of audibility is defined as SPL of 0 dB , but the upper limit is not as clearly defined. While 1 atm ( 194 dB peak or 191 dB SPL ) [ 11 ] [ 12 ] is the largest pressure variation an undistorted sound wave can have in Earth's atmosphere (i. e., if the thermodynamic properties of the air are disregarded; in reality, the sound waves become progressively non-linear starting over 150 dB), larger sound waves can be present in other atmospheres or other media, such as underwater or through the Earth.

[ 13 ] Equal-loudness contour , showing sound-pressure-vs-frequency at different perceived loudness levels Ears detect changes in sound pressure. Human hearing does not have a flat spectral sensitivity ( frequency response ) relative to frequency versus amplitude . Humans do not perceive low- and high-frequency sounds as well as they perceive sounds between 3,000 and 4,000 Hz, as shown in the equal-loudness contour . Because the frequency response of human hearing changes with amplitude, three weightings have been established for measuring sound pressure: A, B and C.

In order to distinguish the different sound measures, a suffix is used: A-weighted sound pressure level is written either as dB A or L A . B-weighted sound pressure level is written either as dB B or L B , and C-weighted sound pressure level is written either as dB C or L C . Unweighted sound pressure level is called "linear sound pressure level" and is often written as dB L or just L. Some sound measuring instruments use the letter "Z" as an indication of linear SPL.

[ 13 ] Distance [ edit ] The distance of the measuring microphone from a sound source is often omitted when SPL measurements are quoted, making the data useless, due to the inherent effect of the inverse proportional law . In the case of ambient environmental measurements of "background" noise, distance need not be quoted, as no single source is present, but when measuring the noise level of a specific piece of equipment, the distance should always be stated. A distance of one metre (1 m) from the source is a frequently used standard distance. Because of the effects of reflected noise within a closed room, the use of an anechoic chamber allows sound to be comparable to measurements made in a free field environment.

[ 13 ] According to the inverse proportional law, when sound level L p 1 is measured at a distance r 1 , the sound level L p 2 at the distance r 2 is L p 2 = L p 1 + 20 log 10 ⁡ ⁡ ( r 1 r 2 ) dB .

{\displaystyle L_{p_{2}}=L_{p_{1}}+20\log _{10}\left({\frac {r_{1}}{r_{2}}}\right)~{\text{dB}}.} Multiple sources [ edit ] The formula for the sum of the sound pressure levels of n incoherent radiating sources is L Σ Σ = 10 log 10 ⁡ ⁡ ( p 1 2 + p 2 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + p n 2 p 0 2 ) dB = 10 log 10 ⁡ ⁡ [ ( p 1 p 0 ) 2 + ( p 2 p 0 ) 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + ( p n p 0 ) 2 ] dB .

{\displaystyle L_{\Sigma }=10\log _{10}\left({\frac {p_{1}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}+\dots +p_{n}^{2}}{p_{0}^{2}}}\right)~{\text{dB}}=10\log _{10}\left[\left({\frac {p_{1}}{p_{0}}}\right)^{2}+\left({\frac {p_{2}}{p_{0}}}\right)^{2}+\dots +\left({\frac {p_{n}}{p_{0}}}\right)^{2}\right]~{\text{dB}}.} Inserting the formulas ( p i p 0 ) 2 = 10 L i 10 dB , i = 1 , 2 , … … , n {\displaystyle \left({\frac {p_{i}}{p_{0}}}\right)^{2}=10^{\frac {L_{i}}{10~{\text{dB}}}},\quad i=1,2,\ldots ,n} in the formula for the sum of the sound pressure levels yields L Σ Σ = 10 log 10 ⁡ ⁡ ( 10 L 1 10 dB + 10 L 2 10 dB + ⋯ ⋯ + 10 L n 10 dB ) dB .

{\displaystyle L_{\Sigma }=10\log _{10}\left(10^{\frac {L_{1}}{10~{\text{dB}}}}+10^{\frac {L_{2}}{10~{\text{dB}}}}+\dots +10^{\frac {L_{n}}{10~{\text{dB}}}}\right)~{\text{dB}}.} Examples of sound pressure [ edit ] Examples of sound pressure in air at standard atmospheric pressure Source of sound Distance Sound pressure level [ a ] ( Pa ) ( dB SPL ) Shock wave (distorted sound waves > 1 atm ; waveform valleys are clipped at zero pressure) [ 11 ] [ 12 ] >1.01×10 5 >191 Simple open-ended thermoacoustic device [ 14 ] [ clarification needed ] 1.26×10 4 176 1883 eruption of Krakatoa [ 15 ] [ 16 ] 165 km 172 .30-06 rifle being fired 1 m to shooter's side 7.09×10 3 171 Firecracker [ 17 ] 0.5 m 7.09×10 3 171 Stun grenade [ 18 ] Ambient 1.60×10 3 ...8.00×10 3 158–172 9-inch (23 cm) party balloon inflated to rupture [ 19 ] At ear 4.92×10 3 168 9-inch (23 cm) diameter balloon crushed to rupture [ 19 ] At ear 1.79×10 3 159 9-inch (23 cm) party balloon inflated to rupture [ 19 ] 0.5 m 1.42×10 3 157 9-inch (23 cm) diameter balloon popped with a pin [ 19 ] At ear 1.13×10 3 155 LRAD 1000Xi Long Range Acoustic Device [ 20 ] 1 m 8.93×10 2 153 9-inch (23 cm) party balloon inflated to rupture [ 19 ] 1 m 731 151 Jet engine [ 13 ] 1 m 632 150 9-inch (23 cm) diameter balloon crushed to rupture [ 19 ] 0.95 m 448 147 9-inch (23 cm) diameter balloon popped with a pin [ 19 ] 1 m 282.5 143 Loudest human voice [ 21 ] 1 inch 110 135 Trumpet [ 22 ] 0.5 m 63.2 130 Vuvuzela horn [ 23 ] 1 m 20.0 120 Threshold of pain [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 21 ] At ear 20–100 120–134 Risk of instantaneous noise-induced hearing loss At ear 20.0 120 Jet engine 100–30 m 6.32–200 110–140 Two-stroke chainsaw [ 26 ] 1 m 6.32 110 Jackhammer 1 m 2.00 100 Hearing damage (over long-term exposure, need not be continuous) [ 27 ] At ear 0.36 85 EPA -identified maximum to protect against hearing loss and other disruptive effects from noise, such as sleep disturbance, stress, learning detriment, etc.
