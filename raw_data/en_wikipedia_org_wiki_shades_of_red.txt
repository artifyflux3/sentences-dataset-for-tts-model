This color is an approximation of an orangish red spectral color . It is one of the three primary colors of light in the RGB color model , along with green and blue .  The three additive primaries in the RGB color system are the three colors of light chosen such as to provide the maximum gamut of colors that are capable of being represented on a computer or television set, at a reasonable expense of power .  Portable devices such as mobile phones might have an even narrower gamut due to this purity –power tradeoff and their "red" may be less colorful and more orangish than the standard red of sRGB .

This color is also the color called red in the X11 web colors, which were originally formulated in 1987.  It is also called color wheel red .  It is at precisely zero (360) degrees on the HSV color wheel , also known as the RGB color wheel ( Image of RGB color wheel ).  Its complementary color is cyan .
