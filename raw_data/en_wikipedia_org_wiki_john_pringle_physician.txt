Biography [ edit ] Youth and early career [ edit ] John Pringle was the youngest son of Sir John Pringle, 2nd Baronet , of Stichill , Roxburghshire (1662–1721), by his spouse Magdalen (d. December 1739), daughter of Sir Gilbert Eliott, 3rd Baronet, of Stobs .

He was educated at St Andrews , at Edinburgh , and at Leiden . In 1730 he graduated with a degree of Doctor of Physic at the last-named university, where he was an intimate friend of Gerard van Swieten and Albrecht von Haller .

[ 2 ] He settled in Edinburgh at first as a physician, but between 1733 and 1744 was also Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University.

[ 2 ] In 1742 he became physician to the Earl of Stair , then commanding the British army in Flanders .

[ 2 ] About the time of the battle of Dettingen in Bavaria in June 1743, when the British army was encamped at Aschaffenburg , Pringle, through the Earl of Stair, brought about an agreement with the Marshal of Noailles , the French commander, that military hospitals on both sides be considered as neutral, immune sanctuaries for the sick and wounded, and should be mutually protected. The International Red Cross , as constituted by the modern Geneva Conventions , [ 3 ] developed from this conception and agreement.

[ 4 ] In 1744 he was appointed by the Duke of Cumberland physician-general to the forces in the Low Countries . In 1749, having settled in a smart house in Pall Mall , London , he was made physician in ordinary to the Duke of Cumberland .

[ 2 ] On 1 April 1752 he married Charlotte (d. Dec 1753) second daughter of Dr William Oliver (1695–1764) of Bath , the inventor of Bath Oliver biscuits, [ 2 ] but they had no issue.

In 1760, he wrote an appreciation of the Life of General James Wolfe .

[ 5 ] On 5 June 1766 John Pringle was created a baronet, and in 1774 he was appointed Physician to His Majesty King George III .

He was also a frequent travelling companion to Benjamin Franklin . The successful London bookseller Andrew Millar noted Pringle and Franklin as dinner guests at his home.

[ 6 ] Academia [ edit ] His first book, Observations on the Nature and Cure of Hospital and Jayl Fevers , was published in 1750, and in the same year he contributed to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society three papers on Experiments on Septic and Antiseptic Substances , which gained him the Copley Medal . Two years later he published his important work, Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison , which entitles him to be regarded as the founder of modern military medicine .

[ 2 ] In November 1772 he was elected President of the Royal Society , a position he held until 1778. In this capacity he delivered six discourses, which were afterwards collected into a single volume (1783).

[ 2 ] In 1735, Pringle became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh .

Pringle was a regular correspondent and friend of James Burnett, Lord Monboddo , the Scottish philosopher. Monboddo was an important thinker in pre-evolutionary theory, and some scholars actually credit him with the concept of evolution ; however, Monboddo was also quite eccentric, which was one reason for Monboddo's not receiving credit for the evolution concepts. It was in a letter to Pringle in 1773 that Monboddo revealed he did not really hold to a belief of men being born with tails, which was the chief point of his ridicule.

[ 7 ] At the age of 73 he went, briefly, to Edinburgh in 1780, but returned to London in September 1781, and died in the following year.

[ 2 ] Legacy [ edit ] There is a monument to Pringle in Westminster Abbey , executed by Joseph Nollekens .

[ 2 ] At his death, his baronetcy became extinct.

After a legal case in 2004, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh was able to open to the public the Pringle papers that it holds.
