[ 13 ] As of the 2020 census , its population was 13,376.

[ 17 ] It is located where Interstate 20 and US 259 converge south of the Sabine River .

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Kilgore, Texas Kilgore was founded in 1872 when the International–Great Northern Railroad completed the initial phase of rail line between Palestine and Longview . The rail company chose to bypass New Danville, a small community about 10 miles (16 km) southeast of Longview, in lieu of a new townsite platted on 174 acres (0.70 km 2 ) sold to the railroad by Constantine Buckley Kilgore , the town's namesake. That way the railroad gained the profits from sale and development of the lands.

[ 20 ] A post office was built in Kilgore in 1873 and with a station and transportation for getting commodity crops to market, the city soon began drawing residents and businesses away from New Danville. By 1885, the population had reached 250, and the community had two cotton gins , a church, and a school (for white children only). The racially segregated Kilgore Independent School District was organized in 1910. By 1914 the town had two banks, several businesses, and a reported population of 700. The 1920s showed continued steady growth, and by 1929 Kilgore was home to an estimated 1,000 residents.

Prosperity came to a halt, however, when Kilgore was dealt severe blows by a steep decline in cotton prices (on which most of the town's economy was still based), and the effects of the Great Depression . Businesses began to close and, by the middle of 1930, the population had fallen to 500; the community appeared destined to become a ghost town . Many Blacks joined the Great Migration out of the South to northern, midwestern, and western cities for work.

Kilgore’s downtown in 1930 Kilgore's fortunes changed dramatically on October 3, 1930, when wildcatter Columbus M. "Dad" Joiner struck oil near the neighboring town of Henderson . The well known as the Daisy Bradford #3, marked the discovery of the vast East Texas Oil Field . Seemingly overnight Kilgore was transformed from a small farming town on the decline into a bustling boomtown . The Daisy Bradford #3 was subsequently followed by the Lou Della Crim No. 1 and many others.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] By 1936, the population had increased to more than 12,000, and Kilgore's skyline was crowded with oil derricks .

Oil production continued at a breakneck pace throughout the early 1930s, with more than 1,100 producing oil wells within city limits at the height of the boom. The explosive growth left most civic services overwhelmed, and as a result Kilgore was forced to incorporate in 1931. With the city flooded with male workers and roustabouts , law enforcement struggled to keep order among the shanties , tents, and ramshackle honky-tonks that crowded Kilgore's main streets. On one occasion, they had to summon help from the Texas Rangers to keep the peace. By the mid-1930s the oil boom was almost over and most of the small oil companies and wildcatters had sold out to major corporations. The boom was essentially over by 1940. But oil production has remained central to the city's economy. The population, which fluctuated wildly throughout the 1930s, stabilized at around 10,000 in the 1950s. A 2015 estimate placed it at just under 15,000 residents.

In the 1940s Kilgore had over 1,000 wooden oil derricks. One acre was known by the nickname "The world's richest acre." Now there are 60 steel replicas of the derricks in the city topped with stars. The city is nicknamed the City of Stars.

[ 23 ] Geography [ edit ] Kilgore is located in southern Gregg County and extends south into Rusk County, [ 13 ] where over three-fourths of the city are located in Gregg County, the remainder in Rusk County.

U.S. Route 259 passes through the east side of the city as a limited-access bypass, leading northeast 11 miles (18 km) to Longview and south 17 miles (27 km) to Henderson . Kilgore's city limits extend 3 miles (5 km) north from the city center as far as Interstate 20 , with access from Exits 583, 587, and 589. I-20 leads east 69 miles (111 km) to Shreveport, Louisiana and west 119 miles (192 km) to Dallas .

According to the United States Census Bureau , Kilgore has a total area of 15.7 square miles (40.7 km 2 ), of which 15.7 square miles (40.6 km 2 ) are land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km 2 ), or 0.22%, are covered by water.
