Lagrange points in the Sun–Earth system (not to scale). This view is from the north, so that Earth's orbit is counterclockwise.

A [contour plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_plot "Contour plot") of the [effective potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_potential "Effective potential") due to gravity and the [centrifugal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force "Centrifugal force") of a two-body system in a rotating frame of reference. The arrows indicate the downhill gradients of the potential around the five Lagrange points, toward them (red) and away from them (blue). Counterintuitively, the L 4 and L 5 points are the [high points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima "Maxima and minima") of the potential. At the points themselves these forces are balanced.

In [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics"), the **Lagrange points** (; also **Lagrangian points** or **libration points**) are points of [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_(mechanics) "Equilibrium (mechanics)") for small-mass objects under the [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") influence of two massive [orbiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") bodies. Mathematically, this involves the solution of the [restricted three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_three-body_problem "Restricted three-body problem").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-Lagrange_Cornish-1)

Normally, the two massive bodies exert an unbalanced gravitational force at a point, altering the orbit of whatever is at that point. At the Lagrange points, the [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") forces of the two large bodies and the [centrifugal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force "Centrifugal force") balance each other.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-2) This can make Lagrange points an excellent location for satellites, as [orbit corrections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_station-keeping "Orbital station-keeping"), and hence fuel requirements, needed to maintain the desired orbit are kept at a minimum.

For any combination of two orbital bodies, there are five Lagrange points, L 1 to L 5, all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies. There are five Lagrange points for the Sun–Earth system, and five _different_ Lagrange points for the Earth–Moon system. L 1, L 2, and L 3 are on the line through the centers of the two large bodies, while L 4 and L 5 each act as the third [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)") of an [equilateral triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle") formed with the centers of the two large bodies.

When the mass ratio of the two bodies is large enough, the L 4 and L 5 points are stable points, meaning that objects can orbit them and that they have a tendency to pull objects into them. Several planets have [trojan asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_(astronomy) "Trojan (astronomy)") near their L 4 and L 5 points with respect to the Sun; [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#Interaction_with_the_Solar_System "Jupiter") has more than one million of these trojans.

Some Lagrange points are being used for space exploration. Two important Lagrange points in the Sun-Earth system are L 1, between the Sun and Earth, and L 2, on the same line at the opposite side of the Earth; both are well outside the Moon's orbit. Currently, an [artificial satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite "Artificial satellite") called the [Deep Space Climate Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory "Deep Space Climate Observatory") (DSCOVR) is located at L 1 to study solar wind coming toward Earth from the Sun and to monitor Earth's climate, by taking images and sending them back.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-3) The [James Webb Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope "James Webb Space Telescope"), a powerful infrared space observatory, is located at L 2.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-4) This allows the satellite's sunshield to protect the telescope from the light and heat of the Sun, Earth and Moon simultaneously with no need to rotate the sunshield. The L 1 and L 2 Lagrange points are located about 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) from Earth.

The European Space Agency's earlier [Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft) "Gaia (spacecraft)") telescope, and its newly launched [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid_(spacecraft) "Euclid (spacecraft)"), also occupy orbits around L 2. Gaia keeps a tighter [Lissajous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_orbit "Lissajous orbit") around L 2, while Euclid follows a [halo orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit "Halo orbit") similar to JWST. Each of the space observatories benefit from being far enough from Earth's shadow to utilize solar panels for power, from not needing much power or propellant for station-keeping, from not being subjected to the Earth's magnetospheric effects, and from having direct line-of-sight to Earth for data transfer.

The three collinear Lagrange points (L 1, L 2, L 3) were discovered by the Swiss mathematician [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") around 1750, a decade before the Italian-born [Joseph-Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange "Joseph-Louis Lagrange") discovered the remaining two.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-E327-6)

In 1772, Lagrange published an "Essay on the [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem "Three-body problem")". In the first chapter he considered the general three-body problem. From that, in the second chapter, he demonstrated two special [constant-pattern solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem#General_solution "Three-body problem"), the collinear and the equilateral, for any three masses, with [circular orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit "Circular orbit").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-gallica.bnf.fr-7)

The five Lagrange points are labeled and defined as follows:

The L 1 point lies on the line defined between the two large masses _M_ 1 and _M_ 2. It is the point where the gravitational attraction of _M_ 2 and that of _M_ 1 combine to produce an equilibrium. An object that [orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") more closely than [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") would typically have a shorter orbital period than Earth, but that ignores the effect of Earth's gravitational pull. If the object is directly between Earth and the Sun, then [Earth's gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth "Gravity of Earth") counteracts some of the Sun's pull on the object, increasing the object's orbital period. The closer to Earth the object is, the greater this effect is. At the L 1 point, the object's orbital period becomes exactly equal to Earth's orbital period. L 1 is about 1.5 million kilometers, or 0.01 [au](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit"), from Earth in the direction of the Sun.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-Lagrange_Cornish-1)

The L 2 point lies on the line through the two large masses beyond the smaller of the two. Here, the combined gravitational forces of the two large masses balance the centrifugal force on a body at L 2. On the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, the orbital period of an object would normally be greater than Earth's. The extra pull of Earth's gravity decreases the object's orbital period, and at the L 2 point, that orbital period becomes equal to Earth's. Like L 1, L 2 is about 1.5 million kilometers or 0.01 [au](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit") from Earth (away from the sun). An example of a spacecraft designed to operate near the Earth–Sun L 2 is the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope "James Webb Space Telescope").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-stsci.edu-8) Earlier examples include the [Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe "Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe") and its successor, _[Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck\_(spacecraft) "Planck (spacecraft)")_.

The L 3 point lies on the line defined by the two large masses, beyond the larger of the two. Within the Sun–Earth system, the L 3 point exists on the opposite side of the Sun, a little outside Earth's orbit and slightly farther from the center of the Sun than Earth is. This placement occurs because the Sun is also affected by Earth's gravity and so orbits around the two bodies' [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinates_(astronomy) "Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)"), which is well inside the body of the Sun. An object at Earth's distance from the Sun would have an orbital period of one year if only the Sun's gravity is considered. But an object on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth and directly in line with both "feels" Earth's gravity adding slightly to the Sun's and therefore must orbit a little farther from the barycenter of Earth and Sun in order to have the same 1-year period. It is at the L 3 point that the combined pull of Earth and Sun causes the object to orbit with the same period as Earth, in effect orbiting an Earth+Sun mass with the Earth-Sun barycenter at one focus of its orbit.

Gravitational accelerations at L 4

The L 4 and L 5 points lie at the third vertices of the two [equilateral triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle") in the plane of orbit whose common base is the line between the centers of the two masses, such that the point lies 60° ahead of (L 4) or behind (L 5) the smaller mass with regard to its orbit around the larger mass.

The triangular points (L 4 and L 5) are stable equilibria, provided that the ratio of ⁠_M_ 1/_M_ 2⁠ is greater than 24.96.[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-exact_stability_threshold-9) This is the case for the Sun–Earth system, the Sun–Jupiter system, and, by a smaller margin, the Earth–Moon system. When a body at these points is perturbed, it moves away from the point, but the factor opposite of that which is increased or decreased by the perturbation (either gravity or angular momentum-induced speed) will also increase or decrease, bending the object's path into a stable, [kidney bean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_bean "Kidney bean")-shaped orbit around the point (as seen in the corotating frame of reference).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-cornish-10)

The points L 1, L 2, and L 3 are positions of [unstable equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equilibrium "Mechanical equilibrium"). Any object orbiting at L 1, L 2, or L 3 will tend to fall out of orbit; it is therefore rare to find natural objects there, and spacecraft inhabiting these areas must employ a small but critical amount of [station keeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_station-keeping "Orbital station-keeping") in order to maintain their position.

Natural objects at Lagrange points
----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lagrange_point&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Natural objects at Lagrange points")]

Due to the natural stability of L 4 and L 5, it is common for natural objects to be found orbiting in those Lagrange points of planetary systems. Objects that inhabit those points are generically referred to as '[trojans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_(astronomy) "Trojan (astronomy)")' or 'trojan asteroids'. The name derives from the names that were given to asteroids discovered orbiting at the Sun–[Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") L 4 and L 5 points, which were taken from mythological characters appearing in [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer")'s _[Iliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad "Iliad")_, an [epic poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poem "Epic poem") set during the [Trojan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War "Trojan War"). [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid") at the L 4 point, ahead of [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter"), are named after [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks "Greeks") characters in the _[Iliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad "Iliad")_ and referred to as the "[Greek camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jupiter_Trojans_(Greek_camp) "List of Jupiter Trojans (Greek camp)")". Those at the L 5 point are named after Trojan characters and referred to as the "[Trojan camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jupiter_Trojans_(Trojan_camp) "List of Jupiter Trojans (Trojan camp)")". Both camps are considered to be types of trojan bodies.

As the Sun and Jupiter are the two most massive objects in the Solar System, there are more known Sun–Jupiter trojans than for any other pair of bodies. However, smaller numbers of objects are known at the Lagrange points of other orbital systems:

*   The Sun–Earth L 4 and L 5 points contain interplanetary dust and at least two asteroids, [2010 TK 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_TK7 "2010 TK7") and [2020 XL 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_XL5 "2020 XL5").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-11)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-12)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-Hui2021-13)
*   The Earth–Moon L 4 and L 5 points contain concentrations of [interplanetary dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_dust_cloud "Interplanetary dust cloud"), known as [Kordylewski clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kordylewski_cloud "Kordylewski cloud").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-15) Stability at these specific points is greatly complicated by solar gravitational influence.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-16)
*   The Sun–[Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune "Neptune") L 4 and L 5 points contain several dozen known objects, the [Neptune trojans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_trojan "Neptune trojan").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-ntrojans-17)
*   [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars") has four accepted [Mars trojans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trojan "Mars trojan"): [5261 Eureka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5261_Eureka "5261 Eureka"), [1999 UJ 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_UJ7 "1999 UJ7"), [1998 VF 31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_VF31 "1998 VF31"), and [2007 NS 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NS2 "2007 NS2").
*   Saturn's moon [Tethys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_(moon) "Tethys (moon)") has two smaller moons of Saturn in its L 4 and L 5 points, [Telesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telesto_(moon) "Telesto (moon)") and [Calypso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calypso_(moon) "Calypso (moon)"). Another Saturn moon, [Dione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dione_(moon) "Dione (moon)") also has two Lagrange co-orbitals, [Helene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helene_(moon) "Helene (moon)") at its L 4 point and [Polydeuces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydeuces_(moon) "Polydeuces (moon)") at L 5. The moons wander [azimuthally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth "Azimuth") about the Lagrange points, with Polydeuces describing the largest deviations, moving up to 32° away from the Saturn–Dione L 5 point.
*   One version of the [giant impact hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis "Giant impact hypothesis") postulates that an object named [Theia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet) "Theia (planet)") formed at the Sun–Earth L 4 or L 5 point and crashed into Earth after its orbit destabilized, forming the Moon.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-belbruno-2005-18)
*   In [binary stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star "Binary star"), the [Roche lobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_lobe "Roche lobe") has its apex located at L 1; if one of the stars expands past its Roche lobe, then it will lose matter to its [companion star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_star "Companion star"), known as [Roche lobe overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_lobe_overflow "Roche lobe overflow").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-19)

Objects which are on [horseshoe orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_orbit "Horseshoe orbit") are sometimes erroneously described as trojans, but do not occupy Lagrange points. Known objects on horseshoe orbits include [3753 Cruithne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3753_Cruithne "3753 Cruithne") with Earth, and Saturn's moons [Epimetheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_(moon) "Epimetheus (moon)") and [Janus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(moon) "Janus (moon)").

[Click for animation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lagrangian_points_equipotential.gif "File:Lagrangian points equipotential.gif")

Lagrange points are the constant-pattern solutions of the restricted [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem "Three-body problem"). For example, given two massive bodies in orbits around their common [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter "Barycenter"), there are five positions in space where a third body, of comparatively negligible [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"), could be placed so as to maintain its position relative to the two massive bodies. This occurs because the combined gravitational forces of the two massive bodies provide the exact centripetal force required to maintain the [circular motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_motion "Circular motion") that matches their orbital motion.

Alternatively, when seen in a [rotating reference frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_reference_frame "Rotating reference frame") that matches the [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity") of the two co-orbiting bodies, at the Lagrange points the combined [gravitational fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field") of two massive bodies balance the [centrifugal pseudo-force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force "Centrifugal force"), allowing the smaller third body to remain stationary (in this frame) with respect to the first two.

The location of L 1 is the solution to the following equation, gravitation providing the centripetal force: ![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\frac {M_{1}}{(R-r)^{2}}}-{\frac {M_{2}}{r^{2}}}=\left({\frac {M_{1}}{M_{1}+M_{2}}}R-r\right){\frac {M_{1}+M_{2}}{R^{3}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/05f6eec8aa0c508fc4dd1cf4715fb25550be5433) where _r_ is the distance of the L 1 point from the smaller object, _R_ is the distance between the two main objects, and _M_ 1 and _M_ 2 are the masses of the large and small object, respectively. The quantity in parentheses on the right is the distance of L 1 from the center of mass. The solution for _r_ is the only [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")[root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function") of the following [quintic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintic_function "Quintic function")

![Image 7: {\displaystyle x^{5}+(\mu -3)x^{4}+(3-2\mu )x^{3}-(\mu )x^{2}+(2\mu )x-\mu =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e1a3ac43bb852587e1bc2f305fde46c6bdcdf84a) where ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {M_{2}}{M_{1}+M_{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6440bc21076b65f40188ae20b643d47ff5897494) is the mass fraction of _M 2_ and ![Image 9: {\displaystyle x={\frac {r}{R}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/604f117f4ea80c6514448ef1fc993ffd26d76150) is the normalized distance. If the mass of the smaller object (_M_ 2) is much smaller than the mass of the larger object (_M_ 1) then L 1 and L 2 are at approximately equal distances _r_ from the smaller object, equal to the radius of the [Hill sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere "Hill sphere"), given by: ![Image 10: {\displaystyle r\approx R{\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {\mu }{3}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103753e86bf0e1a58dc65ea590a37eee4c81921e)

We may also write this as: ![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\frac {M_{2}}{r^{3}}}\approx 3{\frac {M_{1}}{R^{3}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac284d6981a38472dead824ba8e6524cac7f8c88) Since the [tidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force "Tidal force") effect of a body is proportional to its mass divided by the distance cubed, this means that the tidal effect of the smaller body at the L 1 or at the L 2 point is about three times of that body. We may also write: ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \rho _{2}\left({\frac {d_{2}}{r}}\right)^{3}\approx 3\rho _{1}\left({\frac {d_{1}}{R}}\right)^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cbb8f915b3be07047ba301b97fe1e9cf6d7d7610) where _ρ_ 1 and _ρ_ 2 are the average densities of the two bodies and _d_ 1 and _d_ 2 are their diameters. The ratio of diameter to distance gives the angle subtended by the body, showing that viewed from these two Lagrange points, the apparent sizes of the two bodies will be similar, especially if the density of the smaller one is about thrice that of the larger, as in the case of the Earth and the Sun.

This distance can be described as being such that the [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period"), corresponding to a circular orbit with this distance as radius around _M_ 2 in the absence of _M_ 1, is that of _M_ 2 around _M_ 1, divided by √3 ≈ 1.73: ![Image 13: {\displaystyle T_{s,M_{2}}(r)={\frac {T_{M_{2},M_{1}}(R)}{\sqrt {3}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7209ac2cfada5c1eb204d1dd9bfe2c824c68fa95)

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/L2_rendering.jpg/500px-L2_rendering.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:L2_rendering.jpg)

The Lagrangian L 2 point for the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun")–[Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") system

The location of L 2 is the solution to the following equation, gravitation providing the centripetal force: ![Image 15: {\displaystyle {\frac {M_{1}}{(R+r)^{2}}}+{\frac {M_{2}}{r^{2}}}=\left({\frac {M_{1}}{M_{1}+M_{2}}}R+r\right){\frac {M_{1}+M_{2}}{R^{3}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/abb4f82dd0e0602269e8cbd28525df2b56901934) with parameters defined as for the L 1 case. The corresponding quintic equation is ![Image 16: {\displaystyle x^{5}+x^{4}(3-\mu )+x^{3}(3-2\mu )-x^{2}(\mu )-x(2\mu )-\mu =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4da333bac1c19e0f873a72f85164d6d3e1c778be)

Again, if the mass of the smaller object (_M_ 2) is much smaller than the mass of the larger object (_M_ 1) then L 2 is at approximately the radius of the [Hill sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere "Hill sphere"), given by: ![Image 17: {\displaystyle r\approx R{\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {\mu }{3}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103753e86bf0e1a58dc65ea590a37eee4c81921e)

The same remarks about tidal influence and apparent size apply as for the L 1 point. For example, the angular radius of the Sun as viewed from L 2 is arcsin(⁠695.5×10 3/151.1×10 6⁠)≈0.264°, whereas that of the Earth is arcsin(⁠6371/1.5×10 6⁠)≈0.242°. Looking toward the Sun from L 2 one sees an [annular eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_eclipse "Annular eclipse"). It is necessary for a spacecraft, like [Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft) "Gaia (spacecraft)"), to follow a [Lissajous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_orbit "Lissajous orbit") or a [halo orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit "Halo orbit") around L 2 in order for its solar panels to get full sun.

The location of L 3 is the solution to the following equation, gravitation providing the centripetal force: ![Image 18: {\displaystyle {\frac {M_{1}}{\left(R-r\right)^{2}}}+{\frac {M_{2}}{\left(2R-r\right)^{2}}}=\left({\frac {M_{2}}{M_{1}+M_{2}}}R+R-r\right){\frac {M_{1}+M_{2}}{R^{3}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a0d2a7d2f5d7e1723320a3debe14065008480104) with parameters _M_ 1, _M_ 2, and _R_ defined as for the L 1 and L 2 cases, and _r_ being defined such that the distance of L 3 from the center of the larger object is _R_−_r_. If the mass of the smaller object (_M_ 2) is much smaller than the mass of the larger object (_M_ 1), then:[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-21)

![Image 19: {\displaystyle r\approx R{\tfrac {7}{12}}\mu .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31882fc1e37403c02504e770096855959d0ddb83)

Thus the distance from L 3 to the larger object is less than the separation of the two objects (although the distance between L 3 and the barycentre is greater than the distance between the smaller object and the barycentre).

The reason these points are in balance is that at L 4 and L 5 the distances to the two masses are equal. Accordingly, the gravitational forces from the two massive bodies are in the same ratio as the masses of the two bodies, and so the resultant force acts through the [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinates_(astronomy) "Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)") of the system. Additionally, the geometry of the triangle ensures that the [resultant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram_law "Parallelogram law") acceleration is to the distance from the barycenter in the same [ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio") as for the two massive bodies. The barycenter being both the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") and center of rotation of the three-body system, this resultant force is exactly that required to keep the smaller body at the Lagrange point in orbital [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_equilibrium "Dynamic equilibrium") with the other two larger bodies of the system (indeed, the third body needs to have negligible mass). The general triangular configuration was discovered by Lagrange working on the [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem "Three-body problem").

### Radial acceleration

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lagrange_point&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Radial acceleration")]

Net radial acceleration of a point orbiting along the Earth–Moon line

The radial acceleration _a_ of an object in orbit at a point along the line passing through both bodies is given by: ![Image 21: {\displaystyle a=-{\frac {GM_{1}}{r^{2}}}\operatorname {sgn} (r)+{\frac {GM_{2}}{(R-r)^{2}}}\operatorname {sgn} (R-r)+{\frac {G{\bigl (}(M_{1}+M_{2})r-M_{2}R{\bigr )}}{R^{3}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a444c0d3d6d96466738f20c2aad08c657e1f4b66) where _r_ is the distance from the large body _M_ 1, _R_ is the distance between the two main objects, and sgn(_x_) is the [sign function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_function "Sign function") of _x_. The terms in this function represent respectively: force from _M_ 1; force from _M_ 2; and centripetal force. The points L 3, L 1, L 2 occur where the acceleration is zero — see chart at right. Positive acceleration is acceleration towards the right of the chart and negative acceleration is towards the left; that is why acceleration has opposite signs on opposite sides of the gravity wells.

Although the L 1, L 2, and L 3 points are nominally unstable, there are quasi-stable periodic orbits called [_halo orbits_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit "Halo orbit") around these points in a three-body system. A full _n_-body [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system") such as the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") does not contain these periodic orbits, but does contain quasi-periodic (i.e. bounded but not precisely repeating) orbits following [Lissajous-curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve "Lissajous curve") trajectories. These quasi-periodic [Lissajous orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_orbit "Lissajous orbit") are what most of Lagrangian-point space missions have used until now. Although they are not perfectly stable, a modest effort of [station keeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_station-keeping "Orbital station-keeping") keeps a spacecraft in a desired Lissajous orbit for a long time.

For Sun–Earth-L 1 missions, it is preferable for the spacecraft to be in a large-amplitude (100,000–200,000 km or 62,000–124,000 mi) Lissajous orbit around L 1 than to stay at L 1, because the line between Sun and Earth has increased solar [interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation) "Interference (wave propagation)") on Earth–spacecraft communications. Similarly, a large-amplitude Lissajous orbit around L 2 keeps a probe out of Earth's shadow and therefore ensures continuous illumination of its solar panels.

The [L 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L4_and_L5) and [L 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L4_and_L5) points are stable provided that the mass of the primary body (e.g. the Earth) is at least 25[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-exact_stability_threshold-9) times the mass of the secondary body (e.g. the Moon),[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-Fitzpatrick-22)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-Greenspan-23) The Earth is over 81 times the mass of the Moon (the Moon is 1.23% of the mass of the Earth[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-Pitjeva-24)). Although the L 4 and L 5 points are found at the top of a "hill", as in the effective potential contour plot above, they are nonetheless stable. The reason for the stability is a second-order effect: as a body moves away from the exact Lagrange position, [Coriolis acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_acceleration "Coriolis acceleration") (which depends on the velocity of an orbiting object and cannot be modeled as a contour map)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-Greenspan-23) curves the trajectory into a path around (rather than away from) the point.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-Greenspan-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-25) Because the source of stability is the Coriolis force, the resulting orbits can be stable, but generally are not planar, but "three-dimensional": they lie on a warped surface intersecting the ecliptic plane. The kidney-shaped orbits typically shown nested around L 4 and L 5 are the projections of the orbits on a plane (e.g. the ecliptic) and not the full 3-D orbits.

Sun–planet Lagrange points to scale (Click for clearer points.)

This table lists sample values of L 1, L 2, and L 3 within the Solar System. Calculations assume the two bodies orbit in a perfect circle with separation equal to the semimajor axis and no other bodies are nearby. Distances are measured from the larger body's center of mass (but see [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter "Barycenter") especially in the case of Earth-Moon and Sun-Jupiter) with L 3 showing a negative direction. The percentage columns show the distance from the orbit compared to the semimajor axis. E.g. for the Moon, L 1 is 326 400 km from Earth's center, which is 84.9% of the Earth–Moon distance or 15.1% "in front of" (Earthwards from) the Moon; L 2 is located 448 900 km from Earth's center, which is 116.8% of the Earth–Moon distance or 16.8% beyond the Moon; and L 3 is located −381 700 km from Earth's center, which is 99.3% of the Earth–Moon distance or 0.7084% inside (Earthward) of the Moon's 'negative' position.

The satellite [ACE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Composition_Explorer "Advanced Composition Explorer") in an orbit around Sun–Earth L 1

[![Image 25](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/The_orbits_of_Gaia_and_Webb_ESA23998736.png/250px-The_orbits_of_Gaia_and_Webb_ESA23998736.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_orbits_of_Gaia_and_Webb_ESA23998736.png)

The [Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft) "Gaia (spacecraft)") (yellow) and [James Webb Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope "James Webb Space Telescope") (blue) orbits around Sun–Earth L 2

Sun–Earth L 1 is suited for making observations of the Sun–Earth system. Objects here are never shadowed by Earth or the Moon and, if observing Earth, always view the sunlit hemisphere. The first mission of this type was the 1978 [International Sun Earth Explorer 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cometary_Explorer "International Cometary Explorer") (ISEE-3) mission used as an interplanetary early warning storm monitor for solar disturbances.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-nasa_sse-26) Since June 2015, [DSCOVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory "Deep Space Climate Observatory") has orbited the L 1 point. Conversely, it is also useful for space-based [solar telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_telescope "Solar telescope"), because it provides an uninterrupted view of the Sun and any [space weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather "Space weather") (including the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") and [coronal mass ejections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejections "Coronal mass ejections")) reaches L 1 up to an hour before Earth. Solar and heliospheric missions currently located around L 1 include the [Solar and Heliospheric Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory "Solar and Heliospheric Observatory"), [Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_(spacecraft) "Wind (spacecraft)"), [Aditya-L1 Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditya-L1 "Aditya-L1") and the [Advanced Composition Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Composition_Explorer "Advanced Composition Explorer"). Planned missions include the [Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_Mapping_and_Acceleration_Probe "Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe")(IMAP) and the [NEO Surveyor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEO_Surveyor "NEO Surveyor").

Sun–Earth L 2 is a good spot for space-based observatories. Because an object around L 2 will maintain the same relative position with respect to the Sun and Earth, shielding and calibration are much simpler. It is, however, slightly beyond the reach of Earth's [umbra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbra,_penumbra_and_antumbra "Umbra, penumbra and antumbra"),[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-27) so solar radiation is not completely blocked at L 2. Spacecraft generally orbit around L 2, avoiding partial eclipses of the Sun to maintain a constant temperature. From locations near L 2, the Sun, Earth and Moon are relatively close together in the sky; this means that a large sunshade with the telescope on the dark-side can allow the telescope to cool passively to around 50 K – this is especially helpful for [infrared astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_astronomy "Infrared astronomy") and observations of the [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background"). The [James Webb Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope "James Webb Space Telescope") was positioned in a halo orbit about L 2 on 24 January 2022.

Sun–Earth L 1 and L 2 are [saddle points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point "Saddle point") and exponentially unstable with [time constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_constant "Time constant") of roughly 23 days. Satellites at these points will wander off in a few months unless course corrections are made.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-cornish-10)

Sun–Earth L 3 was a popular place to put a "[Counter-Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Earth "Counter-Earth")" in [pulp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_magazine "Pulp magazine")[science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") and [comic books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book "Comic book"), despite the fact that the existence of a planetary body in this location had been understood as an impossibility once orbital mechanics and the perturbations of planets upon each other's orbits came to be understood, long before the Space Age; the influence of an Earth-sized body on other planets would not have gone undetected, nor would the fact that the foci of Earth's orbital ellipse would not have been in their expected places, due to the mass of the counter-Earth. The Sun–Earth L 3, however, is a weak saddle point and exponentially unstable with time constant of roughly 150 years.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-cornish-10) Moreover, it could not contain a natural object, large or small, for very long because the gravitational forces of the other planets are stronger than that of Earth (for example, [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus") comes within 0.3[AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit") of this L 3 every 20 months).[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-DUNCOMBE2-28)

A spacecraft orbiting near Sun–Earth L 3 would be able to closely monitor the evolution of active sunspot regions before they rotate into a geoeffective position, so that a seven-day early warning could be issued by the [NOAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration")[Space Weather Prediction Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Weather_Prediction_Center "Space Weather Prediction Center"). Moreover, a satellite near Sun–Earth L 3 would provide very important observations not only for Earth forecasts, but also for deep space support (Mars predictions and for crewed missions to [near-Earth asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_object#Near-Earth_asteroids "Near-Earth object")). In 2010, spacecraft transfer trajectories to Sun–Earth L 3 were studied and several designs were considered.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-transferslibthree-29)

Earth–Moon L 1 allows comparatively easy access to lunar and Earth orbits with minimal change in velocity and this has as an advantage to position a habitable [space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station "Space station") intended to help transport cargo and personnel to the Moon and back. The [SMART-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART-1 "SMART-1") mission [[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-30) passed through the L 1 Lagrangian Point on 11 November 2004 and passed into the area dominated by the Moon's [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") influence.

Earth–Moon L 2 has been used for a [communications satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite") covering the Moon's far side, for example, [Queqiao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queqiao_relay_satellite "Queqiao relay satellite"), launched in 2018,[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-magpie-earth-moon-l2-31) and would be "an ideal location" for a [propellant depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant_depot "Propellant depot") as part of the proposed depot-based space transportation architecture.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-aiaa20100902_p4-32)

Earth–Moon L 4 and L 5 are the locations for the [Kordylewski dust clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kordylewski_cloud "Kordylewski cloud").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-kordylewski-33) The [L5 Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L5_Society "L5 Society")'s name comes from the L 4 and L 5 Lagrangian points in the Earth–Moon system proposed as locations for their huge rotating space habitats. Both positions are also proposed for communication satellites covering the Moon alike communication satellites in [geosynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit "Geosynchronous orbit") cover the Earth.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-TychoESAmoonlight-34)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-TychoVideo-35)

Scientists at the [B612 Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B612_Foundation "B612 Foundation") were[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-36) planning to use [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus")'s L 3 point to position their planned [Sentinel telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_(space_telescope) "Sentinel (space telescope)"), which aimed to look back towards Earth's orbit and compile a catalog of [near-Earth asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_object "Near-Earth object").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-37)

In 2017, the idea of positioning a [magnetic dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole "Magnetic dipole") shield at the Sun–Mars L 1 point for use as an artificial magnetosphere for Mars was discussed at a NASA conference.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#cite_note-38) The idea is that this would protect the planet's atmosphere from the Sun's radiation and solar winds.

The separation of [a Counter-Earth] from the line joining the Earth and the Sun shows a variation with increasing amplitude in time, the effect being most pronounced for the largest assumed mass. During the 112 years covered by the integration the separation becomes large enough in all cases that Clarion should have been directly observed, particularly at times of morning or evening twilight and during total solar eclipses.

Thermodynamic stasis and extended hardware life are far easier to obtain without these punishing conditions seen in LEO. L 2 is not just a great gateway—it is a great place to store propellants. ...L 2 is an ideal location to store propellants and cargos: it is close, high energy, and cold. More importantly, it allows the continuous onward movement of propellants from LEO depots, thus suppressing their size and effectively minimizing the near-Earth boiloff penalties.
