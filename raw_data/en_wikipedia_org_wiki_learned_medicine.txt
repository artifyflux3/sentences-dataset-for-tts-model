[ 1 ] The Renaissance principle of " ad fontes " as applied to Galen sought to establish better texts of his writings, free from later accretions from Arabic-derived texts and texts of medieval Latin. This search for better texts was influential in the early 16th century.

[ 2 ] Historians use the term medical humanism to define this textual activity, pursued for its own sake.

[ 3 ] Portrait of a Renaissance physician Leonhart Fuchs Learned medicine centred on the practica , a genre of Latin texts based on description of diseases and their treatment ( nosology ).

[ 4 ] Its interests were less in the abstract reasoning of medieval medicine and in the tradition of Avicenna , on which it was built, and instead it was based more on the diagnosis and treatment of particular diseases.

[ 5 ] Practica , covering diagnosis and therapies, was contrasted with theorica , which dealt with physiology and abstract thought on health and illness.

[ 6 ] The tradition from Galen valued practica less than theorica concepts, but from the 15th century the status of practica in learned medicine rose.

[ 7 ] "Learned medicine" in this sense was also an academic discipline. It was taught in European universities, and its faculty had the same status as those of theology and law.

[ 8 ] Learned medicine is typically contrasted with the folk medicine of the period, but it has been argued that the distinction is not rigorous.

[ 9 ] Its Galenic teachings were challenged successively by Paracelsianism and Helmontianism .

[ 10 ] Learned medicine and syphilis [ edit ] Around the year 1500 an issue for learned medicine was the nature of morbus gallicus , now identified as venereal syphilis .

Alessandro Benedetti , in particular, advocated the line that it was a novel disease, not described in the traditional authorities.

Niccolo Leoniceno conceded that in terms of symptoms it could not be identified as known to the ancients; but denied that novel diseases could exist.
