It is named after Wei-Liang Chow who proved it in 1939 , and Petr Konstanovich Rashevskii , who proved it independently in 1938 .

The theorem has a number of equivalent statements, one of which is that the topology induced by the Carnot–Carathéodory metric is equivalent to the intrinsic (locally Euclidean) topology of the manifold.  A stronger statement that implies the theorem is the ball–box theorem .  See, for instance, Montgomery (2006) and Gromov (1996) .
