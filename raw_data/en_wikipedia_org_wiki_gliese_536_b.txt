Due to its short orbital period it could help with future studies of biological activity on exoplanets.

[ 5 ] This exoplanet is given the title Super-Earth due to its immense size which is more than five times greater than the Earth. Like many other rocky exoplanets, Gliese 536 b should be part of a large planetary group. Astronomers are still in search of other planets that are in orbit of star Gliese 536.

[ 7 ] But this planet is hotter than Venus, and although the planet is hotter than it, it may be similar to Venus.
