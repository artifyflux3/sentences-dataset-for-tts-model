'close ratio'), also known as Zulü (Zu's ratio), is the name given to an approximation of π ( pi ) found by the Chinese mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi during the 5th century. Using Liu Hui's algorithm , which is based on the areas of regular polygons approximating a circle, Zu computed π as being between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927 [ a ] and gave two rational approximations of π , ⁠ 22 / 7 ⁠ and ⁠ 355 / 113 ⁠ , which were named yuelü ( 约率 ; yuēlǜ ; 'approximate ratio') and milü respectively.

[ 1 ] ⁠ 355 / 113 ⁠ is the best rational approximation of π with a denominator of four digits or fewer, being accurate to six decimal places. It is within 0.000 009 % of the value of π , or in terms of common fractions overestimates π by less than ⁠ 1 / 3 748 629 ⁠ . The next rational number (ordered by size of denominator) that is a better rational approximation of π is ⁠ 52 163 / 16 604 ⁠ , though it is still only correct to six decimal places. To be accurate to seven decimal places, one needs to go as far as ⁠ 86 953 / 27 678 ⁠ . For eight, ⁠ 102 928 / 32 763 ⁠ is needed.

[ 2 ] The accuracy of milü to the true value of π can be explained using the continued fraction expansion of π , the first few terms of which are [3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, ...] (sequence A001203 in the OEIS ). A property of continued fractions is that truncating the expansion of a given number at any point will give the best rational approximation of the number. To obtain milü , truncate the continued fraction expansion of π immediately before the term 292; that is, π is approximated by the finite continued fraction [3; 7, 15, 1] , which is equivalent to milü . Since 292 is an unusually large term in a continued fraction expansion (corresponding to the next truncation introducing only a very small term, ⁠ 1 / 292 ⁠ , to the overall fraction), this convergent will be especially close to the true value of π : [ 3 ] π π = 3 + 1 7 + 1 15 + 1 1 + 1 292 + ⋯ ⋯ ≈ ≈ 3 + 1 7 + 1 15 + 1 1 + 0 = 355 113 {\displaystyle \pi =3+{\cfrac {1}{7+{\cfrac {1}{15+{\cfrac {1}{1+{\color {magenta}{\cfrac {1}{292+\cdots }}}}}}}}}\quad \approx \quad 3+{\cfrac {1}{7+{\cfrac {1}{15+{\cfrac {1}{1+{\color {magenta}0}}}}}}}={\frac {355}{113}}} Zu's contemporary calendarist and mathematician He Chengtian invented a fraction interpolation method called 'harmonization of the divisor of the day' ( 调日法 ; diaorifa ) to increase the accuracy of approximations of π by iteratively adding the numerators and denominators of fractions. Zu's approximation of π ≈ ⁠ 355 / 113 ⁠ can be obtained with He Chengtian's method.

It is not known what method Zu used to calculate this result.
