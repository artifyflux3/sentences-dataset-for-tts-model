[ 1 ] On 27 September 2017, the LIGO and Virgo collaborations announced the observation of the signal, the fourth confirmed event after GW150914 , GW151226 and GW170104 . It was the first binary black hole merger detected by LIGO and Virgo together.

[ 2 ] Event detection [ edit ] Estimated location of GW170814.

The signal was detected at 10:30:43 UTC . The Livingston detector was the first to receive the signal, followed by the Hanford detector 8 milliseconds later and Virgo received the signal 14 milliseconds after Livingston. The detection in all three detectors lead to a very accurate estimate of the position of the source, with a 90% credible region of just 60 deg 2 , a factor 20 times more accurate than before.

[ 3 ] Astrophysical origin [ edit ] Analysis indicated the signal resulted from the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes (BBH) with 30.5 +5.7 −3.0 and 25.3 +2.8 −4.2 times the mass of the Sun , at a distance of 540 +130 −210 megaparsecs ( 1.8 +0.4 −0.7 billion light years) from Earth.

[ 4 ] The resulting black hole had a mass of 53.2 +3.2 −2.5 solar masses, 2.7 +0.4 −0.3 solar masses having been radiated away as gravitational energy . The peak luminosity of GW170814 was 3.7 +0.5 −0.5 × 10 49 W .

Implications for general relativity [ edit ] General relativity predicts that gravitational waves have a tensor -like (spin-2) polarization . The detection in all three detectors led to strong experimental evidence for pure tensor polarization over pure scalar or pure vector polarizations.
