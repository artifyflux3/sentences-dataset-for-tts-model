It is the scale at which the atomic constituents, such as the nucleus containing protons and neutrons , and the electrons in their orbitals , become apparent.

The subatomic scale includes the many thousands of times smaller subnuclear scale , which is the scale of physical size at which constituents of the protons and neutrons —particularly quarks —become apparent.
