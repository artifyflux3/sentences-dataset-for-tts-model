It was originally situated at Deák Ferenc square , but moved to Sütő utca in 1864, and finally to its current location in Városligeti fasor ("Tree lined Avenue to the City Park") in 1904, receiving its present nickname. In the first decades of its existence it operated as a German-language institution, and in 1847 Hungarian became the language of instruction [ 1 ] It had to close in 1952 under Communist pressure. The Fasori Gimnázium re-opened in 1989.
