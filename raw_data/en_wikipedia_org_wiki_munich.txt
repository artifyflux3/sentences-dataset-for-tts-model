As of 30 November 2024, its population was 1,604,384, [ 3 ] making it the third-largest city in Germany after Berlin and Hamburg . Munich is the largest city in Germany that is not a state of its own , and it ranks as the 11th-largest city in the European Union .

The metropolitan area has around 3 million inhabitants, and the broader Munich Metropolitan Region is home to about 6.2 million people.

[ 4 ] It is the third largest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union.

Munich is located on the river Isar north of the Alps . It is the seat of the Upper Bavarian administrative region. With 4,500 people per km 2 , Munich is Germany's most densely populated municipality. It is also the second-largest city in the Bavarian dialect area after Vienna .

The first record of Munich dates to 1158. The city has played an important role in Bavarian and German history. During the Reformation , it remained a Catholic stronghold. Munich became the capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806 and developed as a centre for arts, architecture, culture, and science. The House of Wittelsbach ruled until 1918, when the German revolution of 1918–1919 ended their reign and saw the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic .

In the 1920s, Munich became a centre of political movements, including the rise of the Nazi Party . The city was known as the "Capital of the Movement". During World War II , Munich was heavily bombed, but much of its historic architecture has since been restored.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] After the war, the city's population and economy grew rapidly. Munich hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics .

Munich is a major centre for science, technology, finance, innovation, business, and tourism. It has a high standard of living, ranking first in Germany and third worldwide in the 2018 Mercer survey.

[ 7 ] It was named the world's most liveable city by Monocle's Quality of Life Survey 2018 .

[ 8 ] Munich is the wealthiest city in the European Union by GDP per capita among cities with over one million inhabitants [ 9 ] and is among the most expensive German cities for real estate and rents.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] In 2023, 30.1% of residents were foreigners, and 19.4% were German citizens with a migration background from abroad.

[ 12 ] Munich's economy is based on high tech , automobiles , the service sector , information technology , biotechnology , engineering, and electronics . Multinational companies such as BMW , Siemens , Allianz SE , and Munich Re are headquartered there. The city has two research universities and many scientific institutions.

[ 13 ] Munich is known for its architecture, cultural venues, sports events, exhibitions, and the annual Oktoberfest , the world's largest Volksfest .

[ 14 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Munich For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Munich .

Coat of arms of Munich The unofficial city anthem of Munich, recorded in 1929 Etymology [ edit ] Munich was a tiny 12th-century monastic settlement, which was named zu den Munchen ("to the monks"). The Old High German Munche served as the base for the modern German city name München .

[ 15 ] Prehistory [ edit ] The river Isar was a prehistoric trade route and in the Bronze Age Munich was among the largest raft ports in Europe.

[ 16 ] Bronze Age settlements up to four millennia old have been discovered.

[ 17 ] Evidence of Celtic settlements from the Iron Age have been discovered in areas around Ramersdorf-Perlach .

[ 18 ] Roman period [ edit ] The ancient Roman road Via Julia, which connected Augsburg and Salzburg , crossed over the Isar south of Munich, at the towns of Baierbrunn and Gauting .

[ 19 ] A Roman settlement north-east of Munich was excavated in the neighborhood of Denning .

[ 20 ] Post-Roman settlements [ edit ] Starting in the 6th century, the Baiuvarii populated the area around what is now modern Munich, such as in Johanneskirchen, Feldmoching, Bogenhausen and Pasing.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] The first known Christian church was built ca. 815 in Fröttmanning.

[ 23 ] Origin of medieval town [ edit ] Munich in the 16th century Plan of Munich in 1642 The first medieval bridges across the river Isar were located in current city areas of Munich and Landshut .

[ 16 ] Henry the Lion , the Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, founded the town of Munich in his territory to control the salt trade , after having burned down the town of Föhring and its bridges over the Isar.

[ 24 ] Historians date this event at about 1158.

[ 25 ] : 167 The layout of Munich city, with five city gates and market place, resembled that of Höxter .

[ 25 ] : 168 Henry built a new toll bridge, customs house and a coin market closer to his home, somewhat upstream, at a settlement around the area of modern old town Munich. This new toll bridge most likely crossed the Isar where the Museuminsel and the modern Ludwigsbrücke are now located.

[ 26 ] Otto of Freising protested to his nephew, Emperor Frederick Barbarosa (d. 1190). However, on 14 June 1158, in Augsburg , the conflict was settled in favor of Duke Henry. The Augsburg Arbitration mentions the name of the location in dispute as forum apud Munichen . Although Bishop Otto had lost his bridge, the arbiters ordered Duke Henry to pay a third of his income to the Bishop in Freising as compensation.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The 14th June 1158 is considered the official founding day of the city of Munich. Archaeological excavations at Marienhof Square (near Marienplatz ) in advance of the expansion of the S-Bahn (subway) in 2012 discovered shards of vessels from the 11th century, which prove again that the settlement of Munich must be older than the Augsburg Arbitration of 1158.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] The old St. Peter's Church near Marienplatz is also believed to predate the founding date of the town.

[ 32 ] In 1175, Munich received city status and fortification. In 1180, after Henry the Lion's fall from grace with Emperor Frederick Barbarosa, including his trial and exile, Otto I Wittelsbach became Duke of Bavaria, and Munich was handed to the Bishop of Freising . In 1240, Munich was transferred to Otto II Wittelsbach and in 1255, when the Duchy of Bavaria was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of Upper Bavaria .

Duke Louis IV , a native of Munich, was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as Holy Roman Emperor in 1328. He strengthened the city's position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income.

On 13 February 1327, a large fire broke out in Munich that lasted two days and destroyed about a third of the town.

[ 33 ] In 1349, the Black Death ravaged Munich and Bavaria.

[ 34 ] The growth of Munich was supplemented by its location on top of a gravel bed, where the Isar branched into Munich City Streams , which in turn provided power for many mills and industries within Munich.

In the 15th century, Munich underwent a revival of Gothic arts : the Old Town Hall was enlarged, and Munich's largest Gothic church – the Frauenkirche – now a cathedral, was constructed in only 20 years, starting in 1468.

Capital of reunited Bavaria [ edit ] The Renaissance Antiquarium of the Residenz When Bavaria was reunited in 1506 after a brief war against the Duchy of Landshut , Munich became its capital. The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court.

[ citation needed ] The Renaissance movement beset Munich and the Bavarian branch of the House of Wittelsbach under Duke Albrecht V who bolstered their prestige by conjuring up a lineage that reached back to classical antiquity . In 1568 Albrecht V built the Antiquarium to house the Wittelsbach collection of Greek and Roman antiquities in the Munich Residenz .

[ 35 ] Albrecht V appointed the composer Orlando di Lasso as director of the court orchestra and tempted numerous Italian musicians to work at the Munich court, establishing Munich as a hub for late Renaissance music .

[ 36 ] During the rule of Duke William V Munich began to be called the "German Rome" and William V began presenting Emperor Charlemagne as ancestor of the Wittelsbach dynasty.

[ 37 ] Duke William V further cemented the Wittelsbach rule by commissioning the Jesuit Michaelskirche . He had the sermons of his Jesuit court preacher Jeremias Drexel translated from Latin into German and published them to a greater audience.

[ 38 ] William V was addressed with the epithet "the Pious" and like his contemporary Wittelsbach dukes promoted himself as "father of the land" ( Landesvater ), encouraged pilgrimages and Marian devotions .

[ 39 ] William V had the Hofbräuhaus built in 1589. It would become the prototype for beer halls across Munich. After World War II the Residenze, the Hofbräuhaus, the Frauenkirche , and the Peterskirche were reconstructed to look exactly as they did before the Nazi Party seized power in 1933.

[ 40 ] Marienplatz , Munich, about 1650 Banners with the colours of Munich (left) and Bavaria (right) with the Frauenkirche in the background The Catholic League was founded in Munich in 1609. In 1623, during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), Munich became an electoral residence when Duke Maximilian I was invested with the electoral dignity , but in 1632 the city was occupied by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden .

[ 41 ] In 1634 Swedish and Spanish troops advanced on Munich. Maximilian I published a plague ordinance to halt an epidemic escalation.

[ 42 ] The bubonic plague nevertheless ravaged Munich and the surrounding countryside in 1634 and 1635.

[ 43 ] During the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) troops again converged on Munich in 1647 and precautions were taken, so as to avoid another epidemic.

[ 44 ] Under the regency of the Bavarian electors, Munich was an important centre of Baroque life, but also had to suffer under Habsburg occupations in 1704 and 1742.

[ citation needed ] When Elector Maximilian III Joseph died in 1745, the succession empowered the Palatinate branch within the House of Wittelsbach .

[ 45 ] In 1777 Bavarian lands were inherited by Karl Theodor . The new duke was disliked by the citizens of Munich for his supposedly enlightened ideas. In 1785 Karl Theodor invited Count Rumford Benjamin Thompson to take up residency in Munich and implement stringent social reforms. The poor were forced to live in newly built workhouses . The Bavarian army was restructured, with common soldiers receiving better food and reassurances that they would be treated humanely by officers.

[ 46 ] Munich was the largest German city to lose fortification in the 1790s.

[ 47 ] In 1791 Karl Theodor and Count Rumford started to demolish Munich's fortifications.

[ 48 ] After 1793 Munich's citizens, including house servants, carpenters, butchers, merchants, and court officials, seized the opportunity, building new houses, stalls, and sheds outside the city walls.

[ 49 ] After making an alliance with Napoleonic France, the city became the capital of the new Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806 with Elector Maximillian IV Joseph becoming its first king. The state parliament (the Landtag ) and the new archdiocese of Munich and Freising were also located in the city.

[ citation needed ] The establishment of Bavarian state sovereignty profoundly affected Munich. Munich became the center of a modernizing kingdom, and one of the king's first acts was the secularization of Bavaria. He had dissolved all monasteries in 1802 and once crowned, Maximilian Joseph generated state revenues by selling off church lands. While many monasteries were reestablished, Maximilian Joseph I succeeded in controlling the right to brew beer ( Braurecht ). The king handed the brewing monopoly to Munich's wealthiest brewers, who in turn paid substantial taxes on their beer production. In 1807 the king abolished all ordinances that limited the number of apprentices and journeymen a brewery could employ. Munich's population had swelled and Munich brewers were now free to employ as many workers as they needed to meet the demand.

[ 50 ] In October 1810 a beer festival was held on the meadows just outside Munich to commemorate the wedding of the crown prince and princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen . The parades in regional dress ( Tracht ) represented the diversity of the kingdom. The fields are now part of the Theresienwiese and the celebrations developed into Munich's annual Oktoberfest .

[ 51 ] The Bavarian state proceeded to take control over the beer market, by regulating all taxes on beer in 1806 and 1811. Brewers and the beer taverns ( Wirtshäuser ) were taxed, and the state also controlled the quality of beer while limiting the competition among breweries.

[ 52 ] In 1831 the king's government introduced a cost-of-living allowance on beer for lower-ranking civil servants and soldiers. Soldiers stationed in Munich were granted a daily allowance for beer in the early 1840s.

[ 53 ] By the 1850s beer had become essential staple food for Munich's working and lower classes. Since the Middle Ages beer had been regarded as nutritious liquid bread ( fließendes Brot ) in Bavaria. But Munich suffered from poor water sanitation and as early as the 1700s beer came to be regarded as the fifth element . Beer was essential in maintaining public health in Munich and in the mid-1840s Munich police estimated that at least 40,000 residents relied primarily on beer for their nutrition.

[ 54 ] The Palace of Justice in Baroque Revival style In 1832 Peter von Hess painted the Greek War of Independence at the order of King Ludwig I . Ludwig I had the Königsplatz built in neoclassicism as a matter of ideological choice.

Leo von Klenze supervised the construction of a Propylaea between 1854 and 1862.

[ 55 ] During the early to mid-19th century, the old fortified city walls of Munich were largely demolished due to population expansion.

[ 56 ] The first Munich railway station was built in 1839, with a line going to Augsburg in the west. By 1849 a newer Munich Central Train Station ( München Hauptbahnhof ) was completed, with a line going to Landshut and Regensburg in the north.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] In 1825 Ludwig I had ascended to the throne and commissioned leading architects such as Leo von Klenze to design a series of public museums in neoclassical style. The grand building projects of Ludwig I gave Munich the endearment "Isar-Athen" and "Monaco di Bavaria".

[ 59 ] Between 1856 and 1861 the court gardener Carl von Effner landscaped the banks of the river Isar and established the Maximilian Gardens . From 1848 the Münchner Neueste Nachrichten was published as a regional newspaper in Munich. In 1857 the construction of the Maximilianeum was begun.

[ 60 ] By the time Ludwig II became king in 1864, he remained mostly aloof from his capital and focused more on his fanciful castles in the Bavarian countryside, which is why he is known the world over as the 'fairytale king'. Ludwig II tried to lure Richard Wagner to Munich, but his plans for an opera house were declined by the city council. Ludwig II nevertheless generated a windfall for Munich's craft and construction industries. In 1876 Munich hosted the first German Art and Industry Exhibition, which showcased the northern Neo-Renaissance fashion that came to be the German Empire 's predominant style. Munich based artists put on the German National Applied Arts Exhibition in 1888, showcasing Baroque Revival architecture and Rococo Revival designs.

[ 61 ] Jugendstil style house at Leopoldstr. 77, Münchner Freiheit In 1900 Wilhelm Röntgen moved to Munich, where he was appointed as a professor of physics. In 1901 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.

[ 62 ] The Prince Regent Luitpold 's reign from 1886 to 1912 was marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in Munich.

[ 63 ] At the dawn of the 20th century Munich was an epicenter for the Jugendstil movement, combining a liberal magazine culture with progressive industrial design and architecture. The German art movement took its name from the Munich magazine Die Jugend ( The Youth ).

[ 64 ] Prominent Munich Jugendstil artists include Hans Eduard von Berlepsch-Valendas , Otto Eckmann , [ 65 ] Margarethe von Brauchitsch , August Endell , Hermann Obrist , Wilhelm von Debschitz , [ 66 ] and Richard Riemerschmid . In 1905 two large department stores opened in Munich, the Kaufhaus Oberpollinger and the Warenhaus Hermann Tietz , both having been designed by the architect Max Littmann .

[ 67 ] In 1911 the expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter was established in Munich. Its founding members include Gabriele Münter .

[ 68 ] World War I to World War II [ edit ] Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, life in Munich became very difficult, as the Allied blockade of Germany led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916, three bombs fell on Munich.

[ citation needed ] In 1916, the 'Bayerische Motoren Werke' ( BMW ) produced its first aircraft engine in Munich.

[ 69 ] The public limited company BMW AG was founded in 1918, with Camillo Castiglioni owning one third of the share capital. In 1922 BMW relocated its headquarters to a factory in Munich.

[ 70 ] After World War I, the city was at the centre of substantial political unrest. In November 1918, on the eve of the German revolution, Ludwig III of Bavaria and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican premier of Bavaria Kurt Eisner in February 1919 by Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley , the Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed.

[ 71 ] The November 1918 revolution ended the reign of the Wittelsbach in Bavaria.

[ 72 ] In Mein Kampf Adolf Hitler described his political activism in Munich after November 1918 as the "Beginning of My Political Activity". Hitler called the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic "the rule of the Jews".

[ 73 ] In 1919 Bavaria Film was founded and in the 1920s Munich offered film makers an alternative to Germany's largest film studio, Babelsberg Studio .

[ 74 ] Unrest during the Beer Hall Putsch In 1923 Gustav von Kahr was appointed Bavarian prime minister and immediately planned for the expulsion of all Jews who did not hold German citizenship. Chief of Police Ernst Pöhner and Wilhelm Frick openly indulged in antisemitism, while Bavarian judges praised people on the political right as patriotic for their crimes and handed down mild sentences.

[ 75 ] In 1923, Adolf Hitler and his supporters, who were concentrated in Munich, staged the Beer Hall Putsch , an attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the Nazi Party (NSDAP).

[ 76 ] Munich was chosen as capital for the Free State of Bavaria and acquired increased responsibility for administering the city itself and the surrounding districts. Offices needed to be built for bureaucracy, so a 12-story office building was erected in the southern part of the historic city centre in the late 1920s.

[ 72 ] Munich again became important to the Nazis when they took power in Germany in 1933. The party created its first concentration camp at Dachau , 16 km (10 mi) north-west of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of National Socialism, Munich was referred to as the Hauptstadt der Bewegung ("Capital of the Movement").

[ 77 ] The NSDAP headquarters and the documentation apparatus for controlling all aspects of life were located in Munich. Nazi organizations, such as the National Socialist Women's League and the Gestapo , had their offices along Brienner Straße and around the Königsplatz . The party acquired 68 buildings in the area and many Führerbauten (" Führer buildings") were built to reflect a new aesthetic of power.

[ 78 ] Construction work for the Führerbau and the party headquarters (known as the Brown House ) started in September 1933.

[ 79 ] The Haus der Kunst (House of German Art) was the first building to be commissioned by Hitler. The architect Paul Troost was asked to start work shortly after the Nazis had seized power because "the most German of all German cities" was left with no exhibition building when in 1931 the Glass Palace was destroyed in an arson attack.

[ 80 ] The Red Terror that supposedly preceded Nazi control in Munich was detailed in Nazi publications; seminal accounts are that of Rudolf Schricker Rotmord über München published in 1934, and Die Blutchronik des Marxismus in Deutschland by Adolf Ehrt and Hans Roden.

[ 81 ] In 1930 Feinkost Käfer was founded in Munich; the Käfer catering business is now a world leading party service.

[ 82 ] The city was the site where the 1938 Munich Agreement signed between the United Kingdom and the Third French Republic with Nazi Germany as part of the Franco-British policy of appeasement . The British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain assented to the German annexation of Czechoslovakia 's Sudetenland in the hopes of satisfying Hitler's territorial expansion.

[ 83 ] The Munich-Riem Airport was completed in October 1939.

[ 84 ] On 8 November 1939, shortly after the Second World War had begun, Georg Elser planted a bomb in the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, who held a political party speech. Hitler, however, had left the building minutes before the bomb went off.

[ 85 ] By mid 1942 the majority of Jews living in Munich and the suburbs had been deported.

[ 86 ] Liberated survivors of the Munich-Allach concentration camp greet arriving U.S. troops, 30 April 1945 During the war, Munich was the location of multiple forced labour camps, including two Polenlager camps for Polish youth, [ 87 ] [ 88 ] and 40 subcamps of the Dachau concentration camp , in which men and women of various nationalities were held.

[ 89 ] With up to 17,000 prisoners in 1945, the largest subcamp of Dachau was the Munich-Allach concentration camp .

Munich was the base of the White Rose , a student resistance movement . The group had distributed leaflets in several cities and following the 1943 Battle of Stalingrad members of the group stenciled slogans such as "Down with Hitler" and "Hitler the Mass Murderer" on public buildings in Munich. The core members were arrested and executed after Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans Scholl were caught distributing leaflets on Munich University campus calling upon the youth to rise against Hitler.

[ 90 ] The city was heavily damaged by the bombing of Munich in World War II , with 71 air raids over five years. US troops captured Munich on 30 April 1945.

[ 91 ] Postwar [ edit ] In the aftermath of World War II, Germany and Japan were subject to US Military occupation.

[ 92 ] Due to Polish annexation of the Former eastern territories of Germany and expulsion of Germans from all over Eastern Europe , Munich operated over a thousand refugee camps for 151,113 people in October 1946.

[ 93 ] After US occupation Munich was completely rebuilt following a meticulous plan, which preserved its pre-war street grid, bar a few exceptions owing to then-modern traffic concepts. In 1957, Munich's population surpassed one million. The city continued to play a highly significant role in the German economy, politics and culture, giving rise to its nickname Heimliche Hauptstadt ("secret capital") in the decades after World War II.

[ 94 ] In Munich, the Bayerischer Rundfunk began its first television broadcast in 1954.

[ 95 ] The Free State of Bavaria used the arms industry as kernel for its high tech development policy.

[ 96 ] Since 1963, Munich has been hosting the Munich Security Conference , held annually in the Hotel Bayerischer Hof .

[ 97 ] Munich also became known on the political level due to the strong influence of Bavarian politician Franz Josef Strauss from the 1960s to the 1980s. The Munich Airport , which commenced operations in 1992, was named in his honor.

[ 98 ] In the early 1960s Dieter Kunzelmann was expelled from the Situationist International and founded an influential group called Subversive Aktion in Munich. Kunzelmann was also active in West Berlin, and became known for using situationist avant-garde as a cover for political violence.

After winning the bid in 1966 the Mayor of Munich Hans-Jochen Vogel accelerated the construction of the U-Bahn subway and the S-Bahn metropolitan commuter railway. In May 1967 the construction work began for a new U-Bahn line connecting the city with the Olympic Park . The Olympic Park subway station was built near the BMW Headquarters and the line was completed in May 1972, three months before the opening of the 1972 Summer Olympics. Shortly before the opening ceremony, Munich also inaugurated a sizable pedestrian priority zone between Karlsplatz and Marienplatz .

[ 100 ] In 1970 the Munich city council released funds so that the iconic gothic facade and Glockenspiel of the New City Hall (Neues Rathaus) could be restored.

[ 101 ] During the 1972 Summer Olympics 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by Palestinian terrorists in the Munich massacre , when gunmen from the Palestinian " Black September " group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team.

[ 102 ] The most deadly militant attack the Federal Republic of Germany has ever witnessed was the Oktoberfest bombing . The attack was eventually blamed on militant Neo-Nazism .

[ 103 ] The Nockherberg beer garden Munich and its urban sprawl emerged as the leading German high tech region during the 1980s and 1990s. The urban economy of Munich became characterized by a dynamic labour market , low unemployment, a growing service economy and high per capita income.

[ 96 ] Munich is home of the famous Nockherberg Strong Beer Festival during the Lenten fasting period (usually in March). Its origins go back to the 17th/18th century, but has become popular when the festivities were first televised in the 1980s. The fest includes comical speeches and a mini-musical in which numerous German politicians are parodied by look-alike actors.

[ 104 ] In 2007 the ecological restoration of the river Isar in the urban area of Munich was awarded the Water Development Prize by the German Association for Water, Wastewater and Waste (known as DWA in German). The renaturation of the Isar allows for the near natural development of the river bed and is part of Munich's flood protection .

[ 108 ] Geography [ edit ] Satellite photo by ESA Sentinel-2 Topography [ edit ] Munich lies on the elevated plains of Upper Bavaria , about 50 km (31 mi) north of the northern edge of the Alps , at an altitude of about 520 m (1,706 ft) ASL . The local rivers are the Isar and the Würm . Munich is situated in the Northern Alpine Foreland . The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile flint area which is no longer affected by the folding processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is covered with morainic hills. Between these are fields of fluvio-glacial out-wash, such as around Munich. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the ground water can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to marshes as in the north of Munich.

Climate [ edit ] According to the Köppen climate classification , the climate is oceanic ( Cfb ), independent of the isotherm but with some humid continental ( Dfb ) features like warm to hot summers and cold winters, but without permanent snow cover.

[ 109 ] [ 110 ] The city centre lies between both climates, while the airport of Munich has a humid continental climate . The warmest month, on average, is July. The coolest is January.

The proximity to the Alps brings higher volumes of rainfall and consequently greater susceptibility to flood problems . Studies of adaptation to climate change and extreme events are carried out; one of them is the Isar Plan of the EU Adaptation Climate.

[ 111 ] Showers and thunderstorms bring the highest average monthly precipitation in late spring and throughout the summer. The most precipitation occurs in July, on average. Winter tends to have less precipitation, the least in February.

The higher elevation and proximity to the Alps cause the city to have more rain and snow than many other parts of Germany. The Alps affect the city's climate in other ways too; for example, the warm downhill wind from the Alps ( föhn wind ), which can raise temperatures sharply within a few hours even in the winter.

Being at the centre of Europe, Munich is subject to many climatic influences, so that weather conditions there are more variable than in other European cities, especially those further west and south of the Alps.

Munich is near the Alps . Annual variation in temperature can be significant, because there are no large bodies of water nearby. The winter in Munich is generally cold and overcast, and some Munich winters have significant snow. January is the coldest month. While winter averages remain only moderately cold, and relatively mild for an elevated inland location of Munich's latitude, inversion from the nearby Alps causes cold air to sink and result in temperatures below −15 °C (5 °F). In Munich the summer is usually pleasantly warm, with daytime temperatures averaging 25 °C (77 °F).

Munich is subject to active convective seasons and sometimes damaging events. The Alpine thunderstorm system moves along the mountain range, or detaches, heading east-north-east over the foothills of the Alps.

[ 112 ] At Munich's official weather stations , the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are 37.5 °C (100 °F), on 27 July 1983 in Trudering-Riem, and −31.6 °C (−24.9 °F), on 12 February 1929 in the Botanic Garden of the city.

In November 2016 the city council concluded officially that a further rise in medium temperature, a higher number of heat extremes, a rise in the number of hot days and nights with temperatures higher than 20 °C ( tropical nights ), a change in precipitation patterns , as well as a rise in the number of local instances of heavy rain, is to be expected as part of the ongoing climate change. The city administration decided to support a joint study from its own Referat für Gesundheit und Umwelt (department for health and environmental issues) and the German Meteorological Service that will gather data on local weather. The data is supposed to be used to create a plan for action for adapting the city to better deal with climate change as well as an integrated action program for climate protection in Munich. With the help of those programs issues regarding spatial planning and settlement density, the development of buildings and green spaces as well as plans for functioning ventilation in a cityscape can be monitored and managed.

[ 124 ] About 1% adhere to other Christian denominations. There is also a small Old Catholic parish and an English-speaking parish of the Episcopal Church in the city. According to Munich Statistical Office, in 2013 about 6.9% of Munich's population was Muslim .

[ 125 ] Munich has the largest Uyghur population with about 800 (whole Germany about 1,600) people with Uyghur diaspora. Many of them fled to Munich due to the Chinese government and are exiled in Munich. Munich is also home to World Uyghur Congress , which is an international organisation of exiled Uyghurs.

[ 126 ] Government and politics [ edit ] Bavarian State Chancellery As the capital of Bavaria, Munich is an important political centre for both the state and country as a whole. It is the seat of the Landtag of Bavaria , the State Chancellery , and all state departments. Several national and international authorities are located in Munich, including the Federal Finance Court of Germany , the German Patent Office and the European Patent Office . Bavaria has been dominated by the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) on a federal, state, and local level since the establishment of the Federal Republic in 1949.

They are subdivided into 105 statistical areas.

Allach-Untermenzing (23), Altstadt-Lehel (1), Aubing-Lochhausen-Langwied (22), Au-Haidhausen (5), Berg am Laim (14), Bogenhausen (13), Feldmoching-Hasenbergl (24), Hadern (20), Laim (25), Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt (2), Maxvorstadt (3), Milbertshofen-Am Hart (11), Moosach (10), Neuhausen-Nymphenburg (9), Obergiesing (17), Pasing-Obermenzing (21), Ramersdorf-Perlach (16), Schwabing-Freimann (12), Schwabing-West (4), Schwanthalerhöhe (8), Sendling (6), Sendling-Westpark (7), Thalkirchen-Obersendling-Forstenried-Fürstenried-Solln (19), Trudering-Riem (15), and Untergiesing-Harlaching (18).

There is no official division into districts. The number of districts is about 50, and if smaller units are counted as well, there are about 90 to 100 (see map ). The three largest districts are Schwabing in the north (about 110,000 inhabitants), Sendling in the southwest (about 100,000 inhabitants), and Giesing in the south (about 80,000 inhabitants).

[ 130 ] Architecture [ edit ] Main article: Architecture of Munich The New Town Hall and Marienplatz Frauenkirche Old Town Hall and Heiliggeistkirche seen from Viktualienmarkt Old Town [ edit ] The Ruffinihaus at Rindermarkt At the centre of the old town is the Marienplatz with the Old Town Hall and the New Town Hall . Its tower contains the Rathaus-Glockenspiel . The Peterskirche is the oldest church of the inner city. Nearby St. Peter, the Gothic hall-church Heiliggeistkirche was converted to baroque style from 1724 onwards and looks down upon the Viktualienmarkt . Three gates of the demolished medieval fortification survive; these are the Isartor , the Sendlinger Tor , and the Karlstor . The Karlstor leads up to the Stachus , a square dominated by the Justizpalast (Palace of Justice).

The Frauenkirche serves as the cathedral for the Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising . The nearby Michaelskirche is the largest renaissance church north of the Alps, while the Theatinerkirche is a basilica in Italianate high baroque, which had a major influence on southern German baroque architecture. Its dome dominates the Odeonsplatz .

Palaces and castles [ edit ] Schloss Nymphenburg ( Nymphenburg Palace , construction started 1664) is a museum open to the public for tours.

[ 131 ] [ 132 ] The smaller Schloss Fürstenried ( Fürstenried Palace , construction 1715–1717) is used by the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising as a conference location.

[ 133 ] Schloss Blutenburg ( Blutenburg Castle ) opened as a children's library in 2024, [ 134 ] but visitors may tour the late-Gothic Blutenburg Castle Church built on the same grounds.

[ 135 ] The large Munich Residenz complex on the edge of Munich's Old Town now ranks among Europe's most significant museums of interior decoration. Within the Residenz is the splendid Cuvilliés Theatre and next door is the National Theatre Munich . Among the mansions that still exist in Munich are the Palais Porcia , the Palais Preysing , the Palais Holnstein and the Prinz-Carl-Palais . All mansions are situated close to the Residenz , so is the Alter Hof , the first residence of the House of Wittelsbach .

Modernist architecture [ edit ] Despite Munich being the breeding ground for German Jugendstil , starting with the architect Martin Dülfer , Munich Jugendstil style was quickly submerged as historic trash. While the modernist architect Theodor Fischer was based in Munich, his influence on Munich underwhelmed. Prior to 1914 the city of Munich was under-industrialized. During the Weimar Republic , the Munich establishment was hostile to modernism . The TUM professor German Bestelmeyer favored a conservative style, and Jacobus Oud was rejected for the post of city building chief. Modernist exceptions include a series of post offices by Robert Vorhoelzer built in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Examples of avant-garde temporary constructions include the Wohnmaschine ( Housing Machine ) by Robert Vorhoelzer , as well as the Flachdachhaus ( Flat Roof House ) by Fritz Norkauer .

Paul Schultze-Naumburg , and the Kampfbund enjoyed particular popularity.

[ 136 ] High rise buildings [ edit ] The HVB Tower at Arabellapark Several high-rise buildings are clustered at the northern edge of Munich in the skyline, like the HVB Tower , the Arabella High-Rise Building , the Highlight Towers , Uptown Munich , Münchner Tor and the BMW Headquarters next to the Olympic Park . Further high-rise buildings are located in the Werksviertel [ de ] in Berg am Laim .

Long-term residential development [ edit ] Munich is subject to a long-term residential development plan that is established by the city administration of Munich. The LaSie ("Langfristige Siedlungsentwicklung") was passed in 2011 in response to the acute housing crisis. LaSie is aligned with the strategic development plan passed for Munich in 1998 ("Perspektive München"). LaSie defines three priorities for the construction of residential housing in Munich. Existing housing estates , post-war low-density developments, and the suburban area are subject to densification ("Nachverdichtung").

[ 216 ] Due to the high standard of living in and the thriving economy of the city and the region, there was an influx of people and Munich's population surpassed 1.5 million by June 2015, an increase of more than 20% in 10 years.

[ citation needed ] Transport [ edit ] Munich has an extensive public transport system consisting of an underground metro, trams, buses and high-speed rail. In 2015, the transport modal share in Munich was 38 percent public transport, 25 percent car, 23 percent walking, and 15 percent bicycle.

[ 217 ] Its public transport system delivered 566 million passenger trips that year.

[ 218 ] Munich is the hub of a developed regional transportation system, including the second-largest airport in Germany and the Berlin–Munich high-speed railway , which connects Munich to the German capital city with a journey time of about 4 hours.

Flixmobility which offers intercity coach service is headquartered in Munich.

The trade fair Transport Logistic is held every two years at the Neue Messe München (Messe München International).

Public transport [ edit ] Public transport network A class R2 Straßenbahn ( Tram ) on route 19 at Ostbahnhof Munich's S-Bahn at the Marienplatz station For its urban population of 2.6 million people, Munich and its closest suburbs have a comprehensive network of public transport incorporating the Munich U-Bahn , the Munich S-Bahn , trams and buses. The system is supervised by the Munich Transport and Tariff Association ( Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund ). The Munich tramway is the oldest existing public transportation system in the city, which has been in operation since 1876. Munich also has an extensive network of bus lines. The average amount of time people spend commuting to and from work with public transit in Munich on a weekday is 56 min.

[ citation needed ] The extensive network of subway and tram lines assists and complement pedestrian movement in the city centre. The 700m-long Kaufinger Straße, which starts near the Main train station, forms a pedestrian east–west spine that traverses almost the entire centre. Major spines and many smaller streets cover an extensive area of the centre that can be enjoyed on foot and bike. These attributes result from applying the principle of filtered permeability . Pedestrian and bike paths, which permeate the entire Munich city centre, go through public squares and open spaces for enjoyment. Munich city centre was subject to urban planning and has a comprehensive model for laying out neighborhoods and districts according to grid plan .

[ 219 ] Cycling [ edit ] Main article: Cycling in Munich Map of Munich's cycling network Cycling has a strong presence in the city and is recognized as a good alternative. The growing number of bicycle lanes are widely used throughout the year. Cycle paths can be found alongside the majority of sidewalks and streets, although the newer or renovated ones are much easier to tell apart from pavements than older ones. A modern bike hire system is available within the area bounded by the Mittlerer Ring .

Cultural history trails and bicycle routes [ edit ] Since 2001, historically interesting places in Munich can be explored via the List of cultural history trails in Munich ( KulturGeschichtsPfade ). Sign-posted cycle routes are the Outer Äußere Radlring (outer cycle route) and the RadlRing München .

[ 220 ] Munich Central Train Station [ edit ] Main article: München Hauptbahnhof Munich Central Train Station ( München Hauptbahnhof ) is the central railway station located in the city centre and is the long-distance station in Munich.

[ citation needed ] Munich Central Train Station serves about 450,000 passengers a day, which puts it on par with other large stations in Germany. Munich Central Train Station alongside München Ost railway station are two of the 21 stations in Germany classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 1 station .

The central mainline station is a terminal station with 32 platforms . The subterranean S-Bahn with 2 platforms and U-Bahn stations with 6 platforms are through stations.

[ citation needed ] Intercity-Express (ICE) and EuroCity-Express (ECE; Munich– Bregenz – Zurich ) trains – and starting in 2026 also TGV trains (Munich– Paris ) [ 221 ] – stop at Munich Central Train Station.

InterCity (IC) and EuroCity (EC) trains to destinations east of Munich also stop at the München Ost railway station. Munich is connected to Nuremberg via Ingolstadt by the Nuremberg–Munich high-speed railway and Berlin–Munich high-speed railway .

[ citation needed ] The old air raid shelter next to platform 11 of Munich Central Train Station was an important distribution point for guest workers ( Gastarbeiter ) between 1960 and 1973. At peak more than 1,000 guest workers arrived per day, in total 1.8 million guest workers passed through Munich Central Train Station.

[ 222 ] Autobahns [ edit ] Munich motorway network Munich is an integral part of the Autobahn network of southern Germany. Motorways from Stuttgart (W), Nuremberg , Frankfurt and Berlin (N), Deggendorf and Passau (E), Salzburg and Innsbruck (SE), Garmisch Partenkirchen (S) and Lindau (SW) terminate at Munich, allowing direct access to the different parts of Germany, Austria and Italy.

Traffic is often very heavy in and around Munich.

Traffic congestion are commonplace at the beginning and end of major Bavarian holidays. There are few "green waves" or roundabouts , and an abundance of construction sites.

[ citation needed ] Munich has introduced an environmental zone and was among the first German cities to require a green sticker for vehicles, these are a requirement when entering the city or driving in the wider surrounding area.

[ 223 ] Air [ edit ] Munich International Airport [ edit ] Munich International Airport (MUC) Franz Josef Strauss International Airport ( IATA : MUC, ICAO : EDDM) is the second-largest airport in Germany and seventh-largest in Europe after London Heathrow , Paris Charles de Gaulle , Frankfurt , Amsterdam , Madrid and Istanbul Atatürk . It is used by about 46 million passengers a year, and lies some 30 km (19 mi) north east of the city centre. It replaced the smaller Munich-Riem Airport in 1992. The airport can be reached by suburban train lines from the city. From the main railway station the journey takes 40–45 minutes. A magnetic levitation train (called Transrapid ), which was to have run at speeds of up to 400 km/h (249 mph) from the central station to the airport in a travel time of 10 minutes, had been approved, [ 224 ] but was cancelled in March 2008 because of cost escalation and after heavy protests.

[ 225 ] Lufthansa opened its second hub at the airport when Terminal 2 was opened in 2003.

Other airports [ edit ] In 2008, the Bavarian state government granted a licence to expand Oberpfaffenhofen Air Station located west of Munich, for commercial use. These plans were opposed by many residents in the Oberpfaffenhofen area as well as other branches of local government, including the city of Munich, which took the case to court.

[ 226 ] However, in October 2009, the permit allowing up to 9725 business flights per year to depart from or land at Oberpfaffenhofen was confirmed by a regional judge.

[ 227 ] Despite being 110 km (68 mi) from Munich, Memmingen Airport has been advertised as Airport Munich West. After 2005, passenger traffic of nearby Augsburg Airport was relocated to Munich Airport, leaving the Augsburg region of Bavaria without an air passenger airport within close reach.

Around Munich [ edit ] Nearby towns [ edit ] The Munich agglomeration sprawls across the plain of the Alpine foothills comprising about 2.6 million inhabitants. Several smaller traditional Bavarian towns and cities like Dachau , Freising , Erding , Starnberg , Landshut and Moosburg are today part of the Greater Munich Region, formed by Munich and the surrounding districts, making up the Munich Metropolitan Region , which has a population of about 6 million people.

[ 4 ] Recreation [ edit ] South of Munich, there are numerous nearby freshwater lakes such as Lake Starnberg , Ammersee , Chiemsee , Walchensee , Kochelsee , Tegernsee , Schliersee , Simssee , Staffelsee , Wörthsee , Kirchsee and the Osterseen (Easter Lakes), which are popular among Munich residents for recreation, swimming and watersports and can be quickly reached by car and a few also by Munich's S-Bahn .
