While not always the case, it is usually associated with a mesoscale convective system .

[ 2 ] In the early stages of research on the subject, the mesohigh was often referred to as a "thunderstorm high".

[ 3 ] Formation [ edit ] A mesohigh forms underneath the downdraft in a squall line and is associated with the cold pool of a thunderstorm. It is largely formed by hydrostatic phenomenon, specifically the evaporation of falling precipitation .

[ 4 ] As precipitation, primarily rain , falls in the downdraft, it evaporates in the unsaturated air, leading to cooling in the downdraft due to an absorption of latent heat . The cooling of the air leads to an increase in the pressure as the air becomes denser.

[ 5 ] While not the primary mechanism behind the mesohigh, melting or sensible cooling of hail can also lead to increased pressure in the mesohigh.

[ 6 ] An additional source of increased pressure is hydrometeor loading , the weight of precipitation increasing the speed of the downdraft, leading to increased pressure as the air converges at the surface.

[ 7 ] While hydrometeor loading is not a main contributor of increased pressure to the mesohigh, and it is a non-hydrostatic process, it can increase the pressure as much as 2 mb.
