The surface of the Earth requires (at least) two charts to include every point without plotting the same point more than once on the same chart. Here the [globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe "Globe") is decomposed into charts around the [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_pole "North pole") and [South Poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole "South Pole").

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **manifold** is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") that locally resembles [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") near each point. More precisely, an ![Image 3: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-dimensional manifold, or _![Image 4: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-manifold_ for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)") that is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to an [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_(topology) "Open (topology)") of ![Image 5: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-dimensional Euclidean space.

One-dimensional manifolds include [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") and [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), but not [self-crossing curves such as a figure 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate "Lemniscate"). Two-dimensional manifolds are also called [surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)"). Examples include the [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)"), the [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), and the [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus"), and also the [Klein bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle "Klein bottle") and [real projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane "Real projective plane").

The concept of a manifold is central to many parts of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") and modern [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics") because it allows complicated structures to be described in terms of well-understood topological properties of simpler spaces. Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of [systems of equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_equations "Systems of equations") and as [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of functions. The concept has applications in computer-graphics given the need to associate pictures with coordinates (e.g. [CT scans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan "CT scan")).

Manifolds can be equipped with additional structure. One important class of manifolds are [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"); their [differentiable structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_structure "Differentiable structure") allows [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") to be done. A [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") on a manifold allows [distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance") and [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") to be measured. [Symplectic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold") serve as the [phase spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space "Phase space") in the [Hamiltonian formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), while four-dimensional [Lorentzian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian_manifold "Lorentzian manifold") model [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") in [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity").

The study of manifolds requires working knowledge of calculus and [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology").

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Circle_with_overlapping_manifold_charts.svg/250px-Circle_with_overlapping_manifold_charts.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_with_overlapping_manifold_charts.svg)

Figure 1: The four charts each map part of the circle to an open interval, and together cover the whole circle.

After a line, a circle is the simplest example of a topological manifold. Topology ignores bending, so a small piece of a circle is treated the same as a small piece of a line. Considering, for instance, the top part of the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle"), _x_ 2+_y_ 2=1, where the [_y_-coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") is positive (indicated by the yellow arc in _Figure 1_). Any point of this arc can be uniquely described by its _x_-coordinate. So, [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(mathematics) "Projection (mathematics)") onto the first coordinate is a [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function_(topology) "Continuous function (topology)") and [invertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function")[mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_(mathematics) "Mapping (mathematics)") from the upper arc to the [open interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_interval "Open interval") (−1, 1): ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {top} }(x,y)=x.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b54e617a6b0bf7528e91980df68a29d60ac6e9c0)

Such functions along with the open regions they map are called _[charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas\_(topology)#Charts "Atlas (topology)")_. Similarly, there are charts for the bottom (red), left (blue), and right (green) parts of the circle: ![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\chi _{\mathrm {bottom} }(x,y)&=x\\\chi _{\mathrm {left} }(x,y)&=y\\\chi _{\mathrm {right} }(x,y)&=y.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ebd20d8fcddbde345924b092a4d585d2eb37867c)

Together, these parts cover the whole circle, and the four charts form an [atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology) "Atlas (topology)") for the circle.

The top and right charts, ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {top} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97f44d5bf66863a5cf40b89dcd61cca395b3ce31) and ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {right} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e885dc63a8621eaa9aa9a8f33f64f8b7a1f41597) respectively, overlap in their domain: their intersection lies in the quarter of the circle where both ![Image 11: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) and ![Image 12: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d)-coordinates are positive. Both map this part into the interval ![Image 13: {\displaystyle (0,1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c79c6838e423c1ed3c7ea532a56dc9f9dae8290b), though differently. Thus a function ![Image 14: {\displaystyle T:(0,1)\rightarrow (0,1)=\chi _{\mathrm {right} }\circ \chi _{\mathrm {top} }^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a0717a218e62fa93acea22bca78b7c7e68115f60) can be constructed, which takes values from the co-domain of ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {top} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97f44d5bf66863a5cf40b89dcd61cca395b3ce31) back to the circle using the inverse, followed by ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {right} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e885dc63a8621eaa9aa9a8f33f64f8b7a1f41597) back to the interval. If _a_ is any number in ![Image 17: {\displaystyle (0,1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c79c6838e423c1ed3c7ea532a56dc9f9dae8290b), then: ![Image 18: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}T(a)&=\chi _{\mathrm {right} }\left(\chi _{\mathrm {top} }^{-1}\left[a\right]\right)\\&=\chi _{\mathrm {right} }\left(a,{\sqrt {1-a^{2}}}\right)\\&={\sqrt {1-a^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40ce5573c9fdbffd539c2d9a9f80fdd33ca68ae3)

Such a function is called a [_transition map_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology)#Transition_maps "Atlas (topology)").

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Circle_manifold_chart_from_slope.svg/250px-Circle_manifold_chart_from_slope.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_manifold_chart_from_slope.svg)

Figure 2: A circle manifold chart based on slope, covering all but one point of the circle.

The top, bottom, left, and right charts do not form the only possible atlas. Charts need not be geometric projections, and the number of charts is a matter of choice. Consider the charts ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {minus} }(x,y)=s={\frac {y}{1+x}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2fca7161bff563f0090aefe795a0c5ef8a775165) and ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {plus} }(x,y)=t={\frac {y}{1-x}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d1f55ddc80e2443d65ff31fff224633ee80e523d)

Here _s_ is the slope of the line through the point at coordinates (_x_,_y_) and the fixed pivot point (−1,0); similarly, _t_ is the opposite of the slope of the line through the points at coordinates (_x_,_y_) and (+1,0). The inverse mapping from _s_ to (_x_,_y_) is given by ![Image 22: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&={\frac {1-s^{2}}{1+s^{2}}}\\[5pt]y&={\frac {2s}{1+s^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f08d1a41825c29ff1f55d16dae15784d549e8179)

It can be confirmed that _x_ 2+_y_ 2=1 for all values of _s_ and _t_. These two charts provide a second atlas for the circle, with the transition map ![Image 23: {\displaystyle t={\frac {1}{s}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1abc9b568a1b2b246f4b9697409287efe98267d3) (that is, one has this relation between _s_ and _t_ for every point where _s_ and _t_ are both nonzero).

Each chart omits a single point, either (−1,0) for _s_ or (+1,0) for _t_, so neither chart alone is sufficient to cover the whole circle. It can be proved that it is not possible to cover the full circle with a single chart. For example, although it is possible to construct a circle from a single line interval by overlapping and "gluing" the ends, this does not produce a chart; a portion of the circle will be mapped to both ends at once, losing invertibility.

The [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") is an example of a surface. The [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere") of [implicit equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_equation "Implicit equation")

_x_ 2 + _y_ 2 + _z_ 2 – 1 = 0
may be covered by an atlas of six [charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart_(mathematics) "Chart (mathematics)"): the plane _z_ = 0 divides the sphere into two half spheres (_z_> 0 and _z_< 0), which may both be mapped on the disc _x_ 2 + _y_ 2< 1 by the projection on the _xy_ plane of coordinates. This provides two charts; the four other charts are provided by a similar construction with the two other coordinate planes.

As with the circle, one may define one chart that covers the whole sphere excluding one point. Thus two charts are sufficient, but the sphere cannot be covered by a single chart.

This example is historically significant, as it has motivated the terminology; it became apparent that the whole surface of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") cannot have a plane representation consisting of a single [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map "Map") (also called "chart", see [nautical chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_chart "Nautical chart")), and therefore one needs [atlases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas "Atlas") for covering the whole Earth surface.

[![Image 24](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Conics_and_cubic.svg/250px-Conics_and_cubic.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Conics_and_cubic.svg)

Four manifolds from [algebraic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve "Algebraic curve"): ■circles, ■parabola, ■hyperbola, ■cubic.

Manifolds do not need to be [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") (all in "one piece"); an example is a pair of separate circles.

Manifolds need not be [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_manifold "Closed manifold"); thus a line segment without its end points is a manifold. They are never [countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set "Countable set"), unless the dimension of the manifold is 0. Putting these freedoms together, other examples of manifolds are a [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"), a [hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola"), and the [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") of points on a [cubic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_curve "Cubic curve")_y_ 2 = _x_ 3 − _x_ (a closed loop piece and an open, infinite piece).

However, excluded are examples like two touching circles that share a point to form a figure-8; at the shared point, a satisfactory chart cannot be created. Even with the bending allowed by topology, the vicinity of the shared point looks like a "+", not a line. A "+" is not homeomorphic to a line segment, since deleting the center point from the "+" gives a space with four [components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_connected_space "Locally connected space") (i.e. pieces), whereas deleting a point from a line segment gives a space with at most two pieces; [topological operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") always preserve the number of pieces.

Informally, a manifold is a [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") that is "modeled on" Euclidean space.

A manifold can be constructed by giving a collection of coordinate charts, that is, a covering by open sets with homeomorphisms to a Euclidean space, and patching functions[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]: homeomorphisms from one region of Euclidean space to another region if they correspond to the same part of the manifold in two different coordinate charts. A manifold can be given additional structure if the patching functions satisfy axioms beyond continuity. For instance, [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold") have homeomorphisms on overlapping neighborhoods [diffeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphic "Diffeomorphic") with each other, so that the manifold has a well-defined set of functions which are differentiable in each neighborhood, thus differentiable on the manifold as a whole.

Formally, a (topological) manifold is a [second countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_countable "Second countable")[Hausdorff space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space") that is locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space.

_Second countable_ and _Hausdorff_ are [point-set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-set_topology "Point-set topology") conditions; _second countable_ excludes spaces which are in some sense 'too large' such as the [long line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_line_(topology) "Long line (topology)"), while _Hausdorff_ excludes spaces such as "the line with two origins" (these generalizations of manifolds are discussed in [non-Hausdorff manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hausdorff_manifold "Non-Hausdorff manifold")).

_Locally homeomorphic_ to a Euclidean space means that every point has a neighborhood [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to an [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_subset "Open subset") of the [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space")![Image 25: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7035fcb9fe3ebecc6bc9f372f82d0352202c8bf) for some nonnegative integer n.

This implies that either the point is an [isolated point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_point "Isolated point") (if ![Image 26: {\displaystyle n=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/26819344e55f5e671c76c07c18eb4291fcec85ae)), or it has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the [open ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_ball "Open ball")![Image 27: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} ^{n}=\left\{(x_{1},x_{2},\dots ,x_{n})\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}:x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\cdots +x_{n}^{2}<1\right\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb77e171f09bb54e3d5bb5a3aa8ed8086f9140a6) This implies also that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) since ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) is homeomorphic, and even [diffeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphic "Diffeomorphic") to any open ball in it (for ![Image 30: {\displaystyle n>0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/27a6a5d982d54202a14f111cb8a49210501b2c96)).

The n that appears in the preceding definition is called the _local dimension_ of the manifold. Generally manifolds are taken to have a constant local dimension, and the local dimension is then called the _dimension_ of the manifold. This is, in particular, the case when manifolds are [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space"). However, some authors admit manifolds that are not connected, and where different points can have different [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#cite_note-1) If a manifold has a fixed dimension, this can be emphasized by calling it a **pure manifold**. For example, the (surface of a) sphere has a constant dimension of 2 and is therefore a pure manifold whereas the [disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union "Disjoint union") of a sphere and a line in three-dimensional space is _not_ a pure manifold. Since dimension is a local invariant (i.e. the map sending each point to the dimension of its neighbourhood over which a chart is defined, is [locally constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_constant "Locally constant")), each [connected component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") has a fixed dimension.

[Sheaf-theoretically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics) "Sheaf (mathematics)"), a manifold is a [locally ringed space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_ringed_space "Locally ringed space"), whose structure [sheaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics) "Sheaf (mathematics)") is locally isomorphic to the sheaf of continuous (or differentiable, or complex-analytic, etc.) functions on Euclidean space. This definition is mostly used when discussing analytic manifolds in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry").

Charts, atlases, and transition maps
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Charts, atlases, and transition maps")]

The spherical Earth is navigated using flat maps or charts, collected in an atlas. Similarly, a manifold can be described using [mathematical maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics) "Map (mathematics)"), called _coordinate charts_, collected in a mathematical _atlas_. It is not generally possible to describe a manifold with just one chart, because the global structure of the manifold is different from the simple structure of the charts. For example, no single flat map can represent the entire Earth without separation of adjacent features across the map's boundaries or duplication of coverage. When a manifold is constructed from multiple overlapping charts, the regions where they overlap carry information essential to understanding the global structure.

A _coordinate map_, a _coordinate chart_, or simply a _chart_, of a manifold is an invertible map between a subset of the manifold and a simple space such that both the map and its inverse preserve the desired structure.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#cite_note-Morita-2) For a topological manifold, the simple space is a subset of some Euclidean space ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) and interest focuses on the topological structure. This structure is preserved by [homeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphisms "Homeomorphisms"), invertible maps that are continuous in both directions.

In the case of a differentiable manifold, a set of _charts_ called an _atlas_, whose _transition functions_ (see below) are all differentiable, allows us to do calculus on it. [Polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates "Polar coordinates"), for example, form a chart for the plane ![Image 32: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd) minus the positive _x_-axis and the origin. Another example of a chart is the map χ top mentioned above, a chart for the circle.

The description of most manifolds requires more than one chart. A specific collection of charts which covers a manifold is called an _[atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas\_(topology) "Atlas (topology)")_. An atlas is not unique as all manifolds can be covered in multiple ways using different combinations of charts. Two atlases are said to be equivalent if their union is also an atlas.

The atlas containing all possible charts consistent with a given atlas is called the _maximal atlas_ (i.e. an equivalence class containing that given atlas). Unlike an ordinary atlas, the maximal atlas of a given manifold is unique. Though useful for definitions, it is an abstract object and not used directly (e.g. in calculations).

Charts in an atlas may overlap and a single point of a manifold may be represented in several charts. If two charts overlap, parts of them represent the same region of the manifold, just as a map of Europe and a map of Russia may both contain Moscow. Given two overlapping charts, a _transition function_ can be defined which goes from an open ball in ![Image 33: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) to the manifold and then back to another (or perhaps the same) open ball in ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d). The resultant map, like the map _T_ in the circle example above, is called a _change of coordinates_, a _coordinate transformation_, a _transition function_, or a _transition map_.

### Additional structure

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Additional structure")]

An atlas can also be used to define additional structure on the manifold. The structure is first defined on each chart separately. If all transition maps are compatible with this structure, the structure transfers to the manifold.

This is the standard way differentiable manifolds are defined. If the transition functions of an atlas for a topological manifold preserve the natural differential structure of ![Image 35: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) (that is, if they are [diffeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism")), the differential structure transfers to the manifold and turns it into a differentiable manifold. [Complex manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold") are introduced in an analogous way by requiring that the transition functions of an atlas are [holomorphic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function "Holomorphic function"). For [symplectic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold"), the transition functions must be [symplectomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectomorphism "Symplectomorphism").

The structure on the manifold depends on the atlas, but sometimes different atlases can be said to give rise to the same structure. Such atlases are called _compatible_.

These notions are made precise in general through the use of [pseudogroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudogroup "Pseudogroup").

Manifold with boundary
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Manifold with boundary")]

[![Image 36](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Boundary_of_Manifold_with_charts.png/330px-Boundary_of_Manifold_with_charts.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boundary_of_Manifold_with_charts.png)

A smooth 2-manifold: The interior chart with transition map _φ_ 1 maps an open subset around an interior point to an open Euclidean subset, while the boundary chart with transition map _φ_ 2 maps a closed subset around a boundary point to a closed Euclidean subset. The boundary is itself a 1-manifold without boundary, so the chart with transition map _φ_ 3 must map to an open Euclidean subset.

A **manifold with boundary** is a manifold with an edge. For example, a [disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)") (circle plus interior) is a [2-manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-manifold "2-manifold") with as boundary the circle, a [1-manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-manifold "1-manifold"). The boundary of an ![Image 37: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-manifold with boundary is an ![Image 38: {\displaystyle (n-1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/df88c6333caaf6471cf277f24b802ff9931b133e)-manifold. In three dimensions, a [ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics) "Ball (mathematics)") (sphere plus interior) is a 3-manifold with boundary. Its boundary is a sphere, a 2-manifold.

In technical language, a manifold with boundary is a space containing both interior points and boundary points. Every interior point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the open ![Image 39: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-ball ![Image 40: {\displaystyle \{(x_{1},x_{2},\dots ,x_{n})\vert \Sigma x_{i}^{2}<1\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4e100ff66f8a9c9011ad5412c710e01fbf4244e2). Every boundary point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the "half" ![Image 41: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-ball ![Image 42: {\displaystyle \{(x_{1},x_{2},\dots ,x_{n})\vert \Sigma x_{i}^{2}<1{\text{ and }}x_{1}\geq 0\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9bc8fecee7bef6cb98b03607beaa10810a891342). Any homeomorphism between half-balls must send points with ![Image 43: {\displaystyle x_{1}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29d278bb750c26d4220fe951a98423a8e9cf354b) to points with ![Image 44: {\displaystyle x_{1}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29d278bb750c26d4220fe951a98423a8e9cf354b). This invariance allows to "define" boundary points; see next paragraph.

If in addition we are considering differentiable manifolds, then a [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square "Square") with interior is not a manifold with boundary. The four vertices are neither locally diffeomorphic to Euclidean space nor to Euclidean half-space. This is an example of a differentiable manifold with corners. Similarly, products of differentiable manifolds with boundaries are not generally differentiable manifolds with boundaries, but instead are differentiable manifolds with corners.

### Boundary and interior

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Boundary and interior")]

The **interior** of ![Image 46: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd), denoted ![Image 47: {\displaystyle \operatorname {Int} M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f5926b38819033c310ba401e01fb80883fe9f6f), is the set of points in ![Image 48: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) which have neighborhoods homeomorphic to an open subset of ![Image 49: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d).

The boundary points can be characterized as those points which land on the boundary hyperplane ![Image 54: {\displaystyle (x_{n}=0)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e933fef438fcb4c8ad97063ce5d5650c53537c4c) of ![Image 55: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{+}^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cf8024dbc8cbeae85a715a4d414e9c06e2cd68e6) under some coordinate chart.

A single manifold can be constructed in different ways, each stressing a different aspect of the manifold, thereby leading to a slightly different viewpoint.

[![Image 62](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Sphere_with_chart.svg/250px-Sphere_with_chart.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sphere_with_chart.svg)

The chart maps the part of the sphere with positive _z_ coordinate to a disc.

Perhaps the simplest way to construct a manifold is the one used in the example above of the circle. First, a subset of ![Image 63: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd) is identified, and then an atlas covering this subset is constructed. The concept of _manifold_ grew historically from constructions like this. Here is another example, applying this method to the construction of a sphere:

A sphere can be treated in almost the same way as the circle. In mathematics a sphere is just the surface (not the solid interior), which can be defined as a subset of ![Image 64: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5): ![Image 65: {\displaystyle S=\left\{(x,y,z)\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}\mid x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1\right\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/775afdf3449b1cfb06d12798796feb321467f0ff)

The sphere is two-dimensional, so each chart will map part of the sphere to an open subset of ![Image 66: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd). Consider the northern hemisphere, which is the part with positive _z_ coordinate (coloured red in the picture on the right). The function χ defined by ![Image 67: {\displaystyle \chi (x,y,z)=(x,y),\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/108dbaa2e46762e5b24a83558bca9c663056b0f7)

maps the northern hemisphere to the open [unit disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_disc "Unit disc") by projecting it on the (_x_, _y_) plane. A similar chart exists for the southern hemisphere. Together with two charts projecting on the (_x_, _z_) plane and two charts projecting on the (_y_, _z_) plane, an atlas of six charts is obtained which covers the entire sphere.

This can be easily generalized to higher-dimensional spheres.

A manifold can be constructed by gluing together pieces in a consistent manner, making them into overlapping charts. This construction is possible for any manifold and hence it is often used as a characterisation, especially for differentiable and Riemannian manifolds. It focuses on an atlas, as the patches naturally provide charts, and since there is no exterior space involved it leads to an intrinsic view of the manifold.

The manifold is constructed by specifying an atlas, which is itself defined by transition maps. A point of the manifold is therefore an [equivalence class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") of points which are mapped to each other by transition maps. Charts map equivalence classes to points of a single patch. There are usually strong demands on the consistency of the transition maps. For topological manifolds they are required to be homeomorphisms; if they are also diffeomorphisms, the resulting manifold is a differentiable manifold.

This can be illustrated with the transition map _t_ = 1⁄_s_ from the second half of the circle example. Start with two copies of the line. Use the coordinate _s_ for the first copy, and _t_ for the second copy. Now, glue both copies together by identifying the point _t_ on the second copy with the point _s_ = 1⁄_t_ on the first copy (the points _t_ = 0 and _s_ = 0 are not identified with any point on the first and second copy, respectively). This gives a circle.

#### Intrinsic and extrinsic view

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Intrinsic and extrinsic view")]

The first construction and this construction are very similar, but represent rather different points of view. In the first construction, the manifold is seen as [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") in some Euclidean space. This is the _extrinsic view_. When a manifold is viewed in this way, it is easy to use intuition from Euclidean spaces to define additional structure. For example, in a Euclidean space, it is always clear whether a vector at some point is [tangential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential "Tangential") or [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_vector "Normal vector") to some surface through that point.

The patchwork construction does not use any embedding, but simply views the manifold as a topological space by itself. This abstract point of view is called the _intrinsic view_. It can make it harder to imagine what a tangent vector might be, and there is no intrinsic notion of a [normal bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_bundle "Normal bundle"), but instead there is an intrinsic [stable normal bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_normal_bundle "Stable normal bundle").

#### _n_-Sphere as a patchwork

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: n-Sphere as a patchwork")]

The [_n_-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersphere "Hypersphere")**S**_n_ is a generalisation of the idea of a circle (1-sphere) and sphere (2-sphere) to higher dimensions. An _n_-sphere **S**_n_ can be constructed by gluing together two copies of ![Image 68: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d). The transition map between them is [inversion in a sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_in_a_sphere "Inversion in a sphere"), defined as ![Image 69: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}\setminus \{0\}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}\setminus \{0\}:x\mapsto x/\|x\|^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d700fbfa7db1a94b49659e7342fab0af214545a6)

This function is its own inverse and thus can be used in both directions. As the transition map is a [smooth function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function"), this atlas defines a smooth manifold. In the case _n_ = 1, the example simplifies to the circle example given earlier.

### Identifying points of a manifold

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Identifying points of a manifold")]

It is possible to define different points of a manifold to be the same point. This can be visualized as gluing these points together in a single point, forming a [quotient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(topology) "Quotient space (topology)"). There is, however, no reason to expect such quotient spaces to be manifolds. Among the possible quotient spaces that are not necessarily manifolds, [orbifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbifold "Orbifold") and [CW complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex "CW complex") are considered to be relatively [well-behaved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-behaved "Well-behaved"). An example of a quotient space of a manifold that is also a manifold is the [real projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space "Real projective space"), identified as a quotient space of the corresponding sphere.

One method of identifying points (gluing them together) is through a right (or left) action of a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)"), which [acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)") on the manifold. Two points are identified if one is moved onto the other by some group element. If _M_ is the manifold and _G_ is the group, the resulting quotient space is denoted by _M_ / _G_ (or _G_ \ _M_).

Manifolds which can be constructed by identifying points include [tori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus#Topology "Torus") and [real projective spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space "Real projective space") (starting with a plane and a sphere, respectively).

### Gluing along boundaries

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Gluing along boundaries")]

Two manifolds with boundaries can be glued together along a boundary. If this is done the right way, the result is also a manifold. Similarly, two boundaries of a single manifold can be glued together.

Formally, the gluing is defined by a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") between the two boundaries[_[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy\_dispute#Disputed\_statement "Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Manifold#gluing\_manifolds\_with\_boundary "Talk:Manifold")_]. Two points are identified when they are mapped onto each other. For a topological manifold, this bijection should be a homeomorphism, otherwise the result will not be a topological manifold. Similarly, for a differentiable manifold, it has to be a diffeomorphism. For other manifolds, other structures should be preserved.

A finite cylinder may be constructed as a manifold by starting with a strip [0,1]×[0,1] and gluing a pair of opposite edges on the boundary by a suitable diffeomorphism. A [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane") may be obtained by gluing a sphere with a hole in it to a [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip "Möbius strip") along their respective circular boundaries.

The [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product") of manifolds is also a manifold.

The dimension of the product manifold is the sum of the dimensions of its factors. Its topology is the [product topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology "Product topology"), and a Cartesian product of charts is a chart for the product manifold. Thus, an atlas for the product manifold can be constructed using atlases for its factors. If these atlases define a differential structure on the factors, the corresponding atlas defines a differential structure on the product manifold. The same is true for any other structure defined on the factors. If one of the factors has a boundary, the product manifold also has a boundary. Cartesian products may be used to construct tori and finite [cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry) "Cylinder (geometry)"), for example, as **S**1×**S**1 and **S**1×[0,1], respectively.

[![Image 70](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Red_cylinder.svg/250px-Red_cylinder.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Red_cylinder.svg)

A finite cylinder is a manifold with boundary.

The study of manifolds combines many important areas of mathematics: it generalizes concepts such as [curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") and surfaces as well as ideas from [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") and topology.

Before the modern concept of a manifold there were several important results.

[Non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry") considers spaces where [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate") fails. [Saccheri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Gerolamo_Saccheri "Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri") first studied such geometries in 1733, but sought only to disprove them. [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss"), [Bolyai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai "János Bolyai") and [Lobachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky "Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky") independently discovered them 100 years later. Their research uncovered two types of spaces whose geometric structures differ from that of classical Euclidean space; these gave rise to [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry") and [elliptic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry"). In the modern theory of manifolds, these notions correspond to Riemannian manifolds with constant negative and positive [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature"), respectively.

Carl Friedrich Gauss may have been the first to consider abstract spaces as mathematical objects in their own right. His [theorema egregium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_egregium "Theorema egregium") gives a method for computing the curvature of a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)") without considering the [ambient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_space "Ambient space") in which the surface lies. Such a surface would, in modern terminology, be called a manifold; and in modern terms, the theorem proved that the curvature of the surface is an [intrinsic property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_properties "Intrinsic and extrinsic properties"). Manifold theory has come to focus exclusively on these intrinsic properties (or invariants), while largely ignoring the extrinsic properties of the ambient space.

Another, more topological example of an intrinsic [property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_property "Topological property") of a manifold is its [Euler characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic "Euler characteristic"). [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") showed that for a convex [polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope "Polytope") in the three-dimensional Euclidean space with _V_[vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)") (or corners), _E_ edges, and _F_ faces,![Image 71: {\displaystyle V-E+F=2.\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22b650edf70725f0fec8b36e7ec9313ed61b6561)The same formula will hold if we project the vertices and edges of the polytope onto a sphere, creating a [topological map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_map "Topological map") with _V_ vertices, _E_ edges, and _F_ faces, and in fact, will remain true for any spherical map, even if it does not arise from any convex polytope.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#cite_note-3) Thus 2 is a topological invariant of the sphere, called its **Euler characteristic**. On the other hand, a [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus") can be sliced open by its 'parallel' and 'meridian' circles, creating a map with _V_=1 vertex, _E_=2 edges, and _F_=1 face. Thus the Euler characteristic of the torus is 1−2+1=0. The Euler characteristic of other surfaces is a useful [topological invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_invariant "Topological invariant"), which can be extended to higher dimensions using [Betti numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betti_number "Betti number"). In the mid nineteenth century, the [Gauss–Bonnet theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem "Gauss–Bonnet theorem") linked the Euler characteristic to the [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature").

Investigations of [Niels Henrik Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel "Niels Henrik Abel") and [Carl Gustav Jacobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacobi "Carl Gustav Jacobi") on inversion of [elliptic integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_integral "Elliptic integral") in the first half of 19th century led them to consider special types of complex manifolds, now known as [Jacobians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_variety "Abelian variety"). [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann") further contributed to their theory, clarifying the geometric meaning of the process of [analytic continuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_continuation "Analytic continuation") of functions of complex variables.

Another important source of manifolds in 19th century mathematics was [analytical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_mechanics "Analytical mechanics"), as developed by [Siméon Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Poisson "Siméon Poisson"), Jacobi, and [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton"). The possible states of a mechanical system are thought to be points of an abstract space, [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space "Phase space") in [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") and [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") formalisms of classical mechanics. This space is, in fact, a high-dimensional manifold, whose dimension corresponds to the degrees of freedom of the system and where the points are specified by their [generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinate "Generalized coordinate"). For an unconstrained movement of free particles the manifold is equivalent to the Euclidean space, but various [conservation laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_laws "Conservation laws") constrain it to more complicated formations, e.g. [Liouville tori](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liouville_tori&action=edit&redlink=1 "Liouville tori (page does not exist)"). The theory of a rotating solid body, developed in the 18th century by Leonhard Euler and [Joseph-Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange "Joseph-Louis Lagrange"), gives another example where the manifold is nontrivial. Geometrical and topological aspects of classical mechanics were emphasized by [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré"), one of the founders of topology.

Riemann was the first one to do extensive work generalizing the idea of a surface to higher dimensions. The name _manifold_ comes from Riemann's original [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") term, _Mannigfaltigkeit_, which [William Kingdon Clifford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kingdon_Clifford "William Kingdon Clifford") translated as "manifoldness". In his Göttingen inaugural lecture, Riemann described the set of all possible values of a variable with certain constraints as a _Mannigfaltigkeit_, because the variable can have _many_ values. He distinguishes between _stetige Mannigfaltigkeit_ and _diskrete_ _Mannigfaltigkeit_ (_continuous manifoldness_ and _discontinuous manifoldness_), depending on whether the value changes continuously or not. As continuous examples, Riemann refers to not only colors and the locations of objects in space, but also the possible shapes of a spatial figure. Using [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction"), Riemann constructs an _n-fach ausgedehnte Mannigfaltigkeit_ (_n times extended manifoldness_ or _n-dimensional manifoldness_) as a continuous stack of (n−1) dimensional manifoldnesses. Riemann's intuitive notion of a _Mannigfaltigkeit_ evolved into what is today formalized as a manifold. Riemannian manifolds and [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface") are named after Riemann.

### Poincaré's definition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Poincaré's definition")]

In his very influential paper, [Analysis Situs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_Situs_(paper) "Analysis Situs (paper)"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#cite_note-4) Henri Poincaré gave a definition of a differentiable manifold (_variété_) which served as a precursor to the modern concept of a manifold.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#cite_note-5)

In the first section of Analysis Situs, Poincaré defines a manifold as the [level set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_set "Level set") of a [continuously differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_differentiable "Continuously differentiable") function between Euclidean spaces that satisfies the nondegeneracy hypothesis of the [implicit function theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem "Implicit function theorem"). In the third section, he begins by remarking that the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of a continuously differentiable function is a manifold in the latter sense. He then proposes a new, more general, definition of manifold based on a 'chain of manifolds' (_une chaîne des variétés_).

Poincaré's notion of a _chain of manifolds_ is a precursor to the modern notion of atlas. In particular, he considers two manifolds defined respectively as graphs of functions ![Image 72: {\displaystyle \theta (y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4a0994fb69a6feada2c857693348ec209c50b66d) and ![Image 73: {\displaystyle \theta '\left(y'\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/df1b8fba8ab5321d5b3ffea5c5cd94a9d305efdc). If these manifolds overlap (_a une partie commune_), then he requires that the coordinates ![Image 74: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) depend continuously differentiably on the coordinates ![Image 75: {\displaystyle y'}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a535de94a2183d7130731eab8a83531d7c35c6b) and vice versa ('_...les ![Image 76: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) sont fonctions analytiques des ![Image 77: {\displaystyle y'}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a535de94a2183d7130731eab8a83531d7c35c6b) et inversement_'). In this way he introduces a precursor to the notion of a [chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#Charts) and of a [transition map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#Transition_maps).

For example, the unit circle in the plane can be thought of as the graph of the function ![Image 78: {\textstyle y={\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6ac282fd415e57a16d0571c14bbaae6678f99565) or else the function ![Image 79: {\textstyle y=-{\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/173a110fb1529edfad3da406e90d3301904c9549) in a neighborhood of every point except the points (1, 0) and (−1, 0); and in a neighborhood of those points, it can be thought of as the graph of, respectively, ![Image 80: {\textstyle x={\sqrt {1-y^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/26cb2b799254bd3bcbe835a608c79dd5cc0b1de8) and ![Image 81: {\textstyle x=-{\sqrt {1-y^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c23f2962ae7b30919617ba5b66866605e19f721). The circle can be represented by a graph in the neighborhood of every point because the left hand side of its defining equation ![Image 82: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-1=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ee594b8851d760d0e2d44aba714907aca657b8f) has nonzero gradient at every point of the circle. By the [implicit function theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem "Implicit function theorem"), every [submanifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submanifold "Submanifold") of Euclidean space is locally the graph of a function.

[Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl") gave an intrinsic definition for differentiable manifolds in his lecture course on Riemann surfaces in 1911–1912, opening the road to the general concept of a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") that followed shortly. During the 1930s [Hassler Whitney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassler_Whitney "Hassler Whitney") and others clarified the [foundational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics "Foundations of mathematics") aspects of the subject, and thus intuitions dating back to the latter half of the 19th century became precise, and developed through [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") theory. Notably, the [Whitney embedding theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_embedding_theorem "Whitney embedding theorem")[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#cite_note-6) showed that the intrinsic definition in terms of charts was equivalent to Poincaré's definition in terms of subsets of Euclidean space.

### Topology of manifolds: highlights

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Topology of manifolds: highlights")]

Two-dimensional manifolds, also known as a 2D _surfaces_ embedded in our common 3D space, were considered by Riemann under the guise of [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface"), and rigorously classified in the beginning of the 20th century by [Poul Heegaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul_Heegaard "Poul Heegaard") and [Max Dehn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Dehn "Max Dehn"). Poincaré pioneered the study of three-dimensional manifolds and raised a fundamental question about them, today known as the [Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Poincaré conjecture"). After nearly a century, [Grigori Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman "Grigori Perelman") proved the Poincaré conjecture (see the [Solution of the Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture#Solution "Poincaré conjecture")). [William Thurston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston "William Thurston")'s [geometrization program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture "Geometrization conjecture"), formulated in the 1970s, provided a far-reaching extension of the Poincaré conjecture to the general three-dimensional manifolds. Four-dimensional manifolds were brought to the forefront of mathematical research in the 1980s by [Michael Freedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Freedman "Michael Freedman") and in a different setting, by [Simon Donaldson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Donaldson "Simon Donaldson"), who was motivated by the then recent progress in theoretical physics ([Yang–Mills theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory "Yang–Mills theory")), where they serve as a substitute for ordinary 'flat' [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"). [Andrey Markov Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov_(Soviet_mathematician) "Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)") showed in 1960 that no algorithm exists for classifying four-dimensional manifolds. Important work on higher-dimensional manifolds, including [analogues of the Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Generalized Poincaré conjecture"), had been done earlier by [René Thom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Thom "René Thom"), [John Milnor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milnor "John Milnor"), [Stephen Smale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Smale "Stephen Smale") and [Sergei Novikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Novikov_(mathematician) "Sergei Novikov (mathematician)"). A very pervasive and flexible technique underlying much work on the [topology of manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology "Differential topology") is [Morse theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_theory "Morse theory").

Additional structure

### Topological manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Topological manifolds")]

The simplest kind of manifold to define is the topological manifold, which looks locally like some "ordinary" Euclidean space ![Image 83: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d). By definition, all manifolds are topological manifolds, so the phrase "topological manifold" is usually used to emphasize that a manifold lacks additional structure, or that only its topological properties are being considered. Formally, a topological manifold is a topological space [locally homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_homeomorphism "Local homeomorphism") to a Euclidean space. This means that every point has a neighbourhood for which there exists a [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") (a [bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection")[continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function_(topology) "Continuous function (topology)") whose inverse is also continuous) mapping that neighbourhood to ![Image 84: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d). These homeomorphisms are the charts of the manifold.

A _topological_ manifold looks locally like a Euclidean space in a rather weak manner: while for each individual chart it is possible to distinguish differentiable functions or measure distances and angles, merely by virtue of being a topological manifold a space does not have any _particular_ and _consistent_ choice of such concepts.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#cite_note-7) In order to discuss such properties for a manifold, one needs to specify further structure and consider [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#Differentiable_manifolds) and [Riemannian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#Riemannian_manifolds) discussed below. In particular, the same underlying topological manifold can have several mutually incompatible classes of differentiable functions and an infinite number of ways to specify distances and angles.

Usually additional technical assumptions on the topological space are made to exclude pathological cases. It is customary to require that the space be [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space") and [second countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-countable_space "Second-countable space").

The _dimension_ of the manifold at a certain point is the dimension of the Euclidean space that the charts at that point map to (number _n_ in the definition). All points in a [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") manifold have the same dimension. Some authors require that all charts of a topological manifold map to Euclidean spaces of same dimension. In that case every topological manifold has a topological invariant, its dimension.

### Differentiable manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Differentiable manifolds")]

For most applications, a special kind of topological manifold, namely, a **differentiable manifold**, is used. If the local charts on a manifold are compatible in a certain sense, one can define directions, tangent spaces, and differentiable functions on that manifold. In particular it is possible to use [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") on a differentiable manifold. Each point of an _n_-dimensional differentiable manifold has a [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space"). This is an _n_-dimensional Euclidean space consisting of the [tangent vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_vectors "Tangent vectors") of the curves through the point.

Two important classes of differentiable manifolds are **smooth** and **[analytic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_manifold "Analytic manifold")**. For smooth manifolds the transition maps are smooth, that is, infinitely differentiable. Analytic manifolds are smooth manifolds with the additional condition that the transition maps are [analytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function "Analytic function") (they can be expressed as [power series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series "Power series")). The sphere can be given analytic structure, as can most familiar curves and surfaces.

A [rectifiable set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifiable_set "Rectifiable set") generalizes the idea of a piecewise smooth or [rectifiable curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifiable_curve "Rectifiable curve") to higher dimensions; however, rectifiable sets are not in general manifolds.

### Riemannian manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Riemannian manifolds")]

To measure distances and angles on manifolds, the manifold must be Riemannian. A _Riemannian manifold_ is a differentiable manifold in which each [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") is equipped with an [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space")![Image 85: {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9a50080b735975d8001c9552ac2134b49ad534c0) in a manner which varies smoothly from point to point. Given two tangent vectors ![Image 86: {\displaystyle u}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3e6bb763d22c20916ed4f0bb6bd49d7470cffd8) and ![Image 87: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597), the inner product ![Image 88: {\displaystyle \langle u,v\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6704456ffbbed3155bc5dd40e03459129011c99) gives a real number. The [dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") (or scalar) product is a typical example of an inner product. This allows one to define various notions such as length, [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle"), [areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area") (or [volumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume")), [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature") and [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence") of [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field").

All differentiable manifolds (of constant dimension) can be given the structure of a Riemannian manifold. The Euclidean space itself carries a natural structure of Riemannian manifold (the tangent spaces are naturally identified with the Euclidean space itself and carry the standard scalar product of the space). Many familiar curves and surfaces, including for example all _n_-spheres, are specified as subspaces of a Euclidean space and inherit a metric from their embedding in it.

A **Finsler manifold** allows the definition of distance but does not require the concept of angle; it is an analytic manifold in which each tangent space is equipped with a [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_space "Normed space"), ![Image 89: {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/113f0d8fe6108fc1c5e9802f7c3f634f5480b3d1), in a manner which varies smoothly from point to point. This norm can be extended to a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)"), defining the length of a curve; but it cannot in general be used to define an inner product.

Any Riemannian manifold is a Finsler manifold.

**Lie groups**, named after [Sophus Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophus_Lie "Sophus Lie"), are differentiable manifolds that carry also the structure of a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") which is such that the group operations are defined by smooth maps.

A Euclidean vector space with the group operation of vector addition is an example of a non-compact Lie group. A simple example of a [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") Lie group is the circle: the group operation is simply rotation. This group, known as ![Image 90: {\displaystyle \operatorname {U} (1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39823af285de3e72d7d50f96fe5b8ba024017af2), can be also characterised as the group of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") of [modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value") 1 with multiplication as the group operation.

Other examples of Lie groups include special groups of [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"), which are all subgroups of the [general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group"), the group of ![Image 91: {\displaystyle n\times n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59d2b4cb72e304526cf5b5887147729ea259da78) matrices with non-zero determinant. If the matrix entries are [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), this will be an ![Image 92: {\displaystyle n^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac9810bbdafe4a6a8061338db0f74e25b7952620)-dimensional disconnected manifold. The [orthogonal groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group"), the [symmetry groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_group "Symmetry group") of the sphere and [hyperspheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersphere "Hypersphere"), are ![Image 93: {\displaystyle n(n-1)/2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5b1d96c185de1bffc1e78739934b09489f683efc) dimensional manifolds, where ![Image 94: {\displaystyle n-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbd0b0f32b28f51962943ee9ede4fb34198a2521) is the dimension of the sphere. Further examples can be found in the [table of Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_Lie_groups "Table of Lie groups").

### Other types of manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Other types of manifolds")]

Classification and invariants
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Classification and invariants")]

Different notions of manifolds have different notions of classification and invariant; in this section we focus on smooth closed manifolds.

The classification of smooth closed manifolds is well understood _in principle_, except in [dimension 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-manifold "4-manifold"): in low dimensions (2 and 3) it is geometric, via the [uniformization theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem "Uniformization theorem") and the [solution of the Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_of_the_Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Solution of the Poincaré conjecture"), and in high dimension (5 and above) it is algebraic, via [surgery theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery_theory "Surgery theory"). This is a classification in principle: the general question of whether two smooth manifolds are diffeomorphic is not computable in general. Further, specific computations remain difficult, and there are many open questions.

Orientable surfaces can be visualized, and their diffeomorphism classes enumerated, by genus. Given two orientable surfaces, one can determine if they are diffeomorphic by computing their respective genera and comparing: they are diffeomorphic if and only if the genera are equal, so the genus forms a [complete set of invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_set_of_invariants "Complete set of invariants").

This is much harder in higher dimensions: higher-dimensional manifolds cannot be directly visualized (though visual intuition is useful in understanding them), nor can their diffeomorphism classes be enumerated, nor can one in general determine if two different descriptions of a higher-dimensional manifold refer to the same object.

However, one can determine if two manifolds are _different_ if there is some intrinsic characteristic that differentiates them. Such criteria are commonly referred to as **[invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)")**, because, while they may be defined in terms of some presentation (such as the genus in terms of a triangulation), they are the same relative to all possible descriptions of a particular manifold: they are _invariant_ under different descriptions.

One could hope to develop an arsenal of invariant criteria that would definitively classify all manifolds up to isomorphism. It is known that for manifolds of dimension 4 and higher, [no program exists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_manifolds#Computability "Classification of manifolds") that can decide whether two manifolds are diffeomorphic.

Smooth manifolds have [a rich set of invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_manifolds#Enumeration_versus_invariants "Classification of manifolds"), coming from [point-set topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-set_topology "Point-set topology"), classic algebraic topology, and [geometric topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology "Geometric topology"). The most familiar invariants, which are visible for surfaces, are [orientability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability") (a normal invariant, also detected by [homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_homology "Singular homology")) and [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_(mathematics) "Genus (mathematics)") (a homological invariant).

Smooth closed manifolds have no local invariants (other than dimension), though geometric manifolds have local invariants, notably the [curvature of a Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature_of_Riemannian_manifolds "Curvature of Riemannian manifolds") and the [torsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_(differential_geometry) "Torsion (differential geometry)") of a manifold equipped with an [affine connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection "Affine connection"). This distinction between local invariants and no local invariants is a common way to distinguish between geometry and topology. All invariants of a smooth closed manifold are thus global.

[Algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology") is a source of a number of important global invariant properties. Some key criteria include the _[simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply\_connected "Simply connected")_ property and orientability (see below). Indeed, several branches of mathematics, such as [homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(mathematics) "Homology (mathematics)") and [homotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy "Homotopy") theory, and the theory of [characteristic classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_classes "Characteristic classes") were founded in order to study invariant properties of manifolds.

In dimensions two and higher, a simple but important invariant criterion is the question of whether a manifold admits a meaningful orientation. Consider a topological manifold with charts mapping to ![Image 95: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d). Given an [ordered basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)#Ordered_bases_and_coordinates "Basis (linear algebra)") for ![Image 96: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d), a chart causes its piece of the manifold to itself acquire a sense of ordering, which in 3-dimensions can be viewed as either right-handed or left-handed. Overlapping charts are not required to agree in their sense of ordering, which gives manifolds an important freedom. For some manifolds, like the sphere, charts can be chosen so that overlapping regions agree on their "handedness"; these are _[orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability")_ manifolds. For others, this is impossible. The latter possibility is easy to overlook, because any closed surface embedded (without self-intersection) in three-dimensional space is orientable.

Some illustrative examples of non-orientable manifolds include: (1) the [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip "Möbius strip"), which is a manifold with boundary, (2) the [Klein bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle "Klein bottle"), which must intersect itself in its 3-space representation, and (3) the [real projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane "Real projective plane"), which arises naturally in geometry.

[![Image 97](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Moebius_strip.svg/250px-Moebius_strip.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moebius_strip.svg)

Möbius strip

Begin with an infinite circular cylinder standing vertically, a manifold without boundary. Slice across it high and low to produce two circular boundaries, and the cylindrical strip between them. This is an orientable manifold with boundary, upon which "surgery" will be performed. Slice the strip open, so that it could unroll to become a rectangle, but keep a grasp on the cut ends. Twist one end 180°, making the inner surface face out, and glue the ends back together seamlessly. This results in a strip with a permanent half-twist: the Möbius strip. Its boundary is no longer a pair of circles, but (topologically) a single circle; and what was once its "inside" has merged with its "outside", so that it now has only a _single_ side. Similarly to the Klein Bottle below, this two dimensional surface would need to intersect itself in two dimensions, but can easily be constructed in three or more dimensions.

Take two Möbius strips; each has a single loop as a boundary. Straighten out those loops into circles, and let the strips distort into [cross-caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cap "Cross-cap"). Gluing the circles together will produce a new, closed manifold without boundary, the Klein bottle. Closing the surface does nothing to improve the lack of orientability, it merely removes the boundary. Thus, the Klein bottle is a closed surface with no distinction between inside and outside. In three-dimensional space, a Klein bottle's surface must pass through itself. Building a Klein bottle which is not self-intersecting requires four or more dimensions of space.

#### Real projective plane

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: Real projective plane")]

[![Image 98](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/BoysSurfaceTopView.PNG/250px-BoysSurfaceTopView.PNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BoysSurfaceTopView.PNG)

The [real projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane "Real projective plane") is a two-dimensional manifold that cannot be realized in three dimensions without self-intersection, shown here as [Boy's surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy%27s_surface "Boy's surface").

Begin with a sphere centered on the origin. Every line through the origin pierces the sphere in two opposite points called _antipodes_. Although there is no way to do so physically, it is possible (by considering a [quotient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(topology) "Quotient space (topology)")) to mathematically merge each antipode pair into a single point. The closed surface so produced is the real projective plane, yet another non-orientable surface. It has a number of equivalent descriptions and constructions, but this route explains its name: all the points on any given line through the origin project to the same "point" on this "plane".

### Genus and the Euler characteristic

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: Genus and the Euler characteristic")]

For two dimensional manifolds a key invariant property is the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_(mathematics) "Genus (mathematics)"), or "number of handles" present in a surface. A torus is a sphere with one handle, a double torus is a sphere with two handles, and so on. Indeed, it is possible to fully characterize compact, two-dimensional manifolds on the basis of genus and orientability. In higher-dimensional manifolds genus is replaced by the notion of [Euler characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic "Euler characteristic"), and more generally [Betti numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betti_number "Betti number") and [homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(mathematics) "Homology (mathematics)") and [cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology "Cohomology").

[![Image 99](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/MorinSurfaceAsSphere%27sInsideVersusOutside.PNG/250px-MorinSurfaceAsSphere%27sInsideVersusOutside.PNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MorinSurfaceAsSphere%27sInsideVersusOutside.PNG)

A [Morin surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morin_surface "Morin surface"), an [immersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(mathematics) "Immersion (mathematics)") used in [sphere eversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_eversion "Sphere eversion")

Just as there are various types of manifolds, there are various types of [maps of manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps_of_manifolds "Maps of manifolds"). In addition to continuous functions and smooth functions generally, there are maps with special properties. In [geometric topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology "Geometric topology") a basic type are [embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding"), of which [knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory "Knot theory") is a central example, and generalizations such as [immersions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(mathematics) "Immersion (mathematics)"), [submersions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submersion_(mathematics) "Submersion (mathematics)"), [covering spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space "Covering space"), and [ramified covering spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramified_covering_space "Ramified covering space"). Basic results include the [Whitney embedding theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_embedding_theorem "Whitney embedding theorem") and [Whitney immersion theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_immersion_theorem "Whitney immersion theorem").

In Riemannian geometry, one may ask for maps to preserve the Riemannian metric, leading to notions of [isometric embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_embedding "Isometric embedding"), [isometric immersions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_immersion "Isometric immersion"), and [Riemannian submersions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_submersion "Riemannian submersion"); a basic result is the [Nash embedding theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_embedding_theorem "Nash embedding theorem").

### Scalar-valued functions

A basic example of maps between manifolds are scalar-valued functions on a manifold, ![Image 102: {\displaystyle f\colon M\to \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b28c87bb68bdeda0931c6fa7210a19a7da47528a) or ![Image 103: {\displaystyle f\colon M\to \mathbb {C} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d982a5659e47ce1bfa1fa7874a7b9b7dbad1925b)

sometimes called [regular functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_function "Regular function") or [functionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics) "Functional (mathematics)"), by analogy with algebraic geometry or linear algebra. These are of interest both in their own right, and to study the underlying manifold.

In geometric topology, most commonly studied are [Morse functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_function "Morse function"), which yield [handlebody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handlebody "Handlebody") decompositions, while in [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"), one often studies solution to [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equations "Partial differential equations"), an important example of which is [harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis "Harmonic analysis"), where one studies [harmonic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_function "Harmonic function"): the kernel of the [Laplace operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator "Laplace operator"). This leads to such functions as the [spherical harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics "Spherical harmonics"), and to [heat kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_kernel "Heat kernel") methods of studying manifolds, such as [hearing the shape of a drum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_the_shape_of_a_drum "Hearing the shape of a drum") and some proofs of the [Atiyah–Singer index theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiyah%E2%80%93Singer_index_theorem "Atiyah–Singer index theorem").

Generalizations of manifolds
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&action=edit&section=43 "Edit section: Generalizations of manifolds")]

Infinite dimensional manifolds The definition of a manifold can be generalized by dropping the requirement of finite dimensionality. Thus an infinite dimensional manifold is a topological space locally homeomorphic to a [topological vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space "Topological vector space") over the reals. This omits the point-set axioms, allowing higher cardinalities and [non-Hausdorff manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hausdorff_manifold "Non-Hausdorff manifold"); and it omits finite dimension, allowing structures such as [Hilbert manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_manifold "Hilbert manifold") to be modeled on [Hilbert spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_spaces "Hilbert spaces"), [Banach manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_manifold "Banach manifold") to be modeled on [Banach spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space "Banach space"), and [Fréchet manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_manifold "Fréchet manifold") to be modeled on [Fréchet spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_space "Fréchet space"). Usually one relaxes one or the other condition: manifolds with the point-set axioms are studied in [general topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_topology "General topology"), while infinite-dimensional manifolds are studied in [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis").Orbifolds An [orbifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbifold "Orbifold") is a generalization of manifold allowing for certain kinds of "[singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_singularity "Mathematical singularity")" in the topology. Roughly speaking, it is a space which locally looks like the quotients of some simple space (_e.g._ Euclidean space) by the [actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)") of various [finite groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_group "Finite group"). The singularities correspond to fixed points of the group actions, and the actions must be compatible in a certain sense.Algebraic varieties and schemes[Non-singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve#Singularities "Algebraic curve") algebraic varieties over the real or complex numbers are manifolds. One generalizes this first by allowing singularities, secondly by allowing different fields, and thirdly by emulating the patching construction of manifolds: just as a manifold is glued together from open subsets of Euclidean space, an [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") is glued together from affine algebraic varieties, which are zero sets of polynomials over algebraically closed fields. [Schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)") are likewise glued together from affine schemes, which are a generalization of algebraic varieties. Both are related to manifolds, but are constructed algebraically using [sheaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics) "Sheaf (mathematics)") instead of atlases.Because of [singular points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_singularity "Mathematical singularity"), a variety is in general not a manifold, though linguistically the French _variété_, German _Mannigfaltigkeit_ and English _manifold_ are largely [synonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonymous "Synonymous"). In French an algebraic variety is called _une [variété algébrique](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/vari%C3%A9t%C3%A9\_alg%C3%A9brique "fr:variété algébrique")_ (an _algebraic variety_), while a smooth manifold is called _une [variété différentielle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/vari%C3%A9t%C3%A9\_diff%C3%A9rentielle "fr:variété différentielle")_ (a _differential variety_).Stratified space A "stratified space" is a space that can be divided into pieces ("strata"), with each stratum a manifold, with the strata fitting together in prescribed ways (formally, a [filtration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration_(mathematics) "Filtration (mathematics)") by closed subsets).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#cite_note-8) There are various technical definitions, notably a Whitney stratified space (see [Whitney conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_conditions "Whitney conditions")) for smooth manifolds and a [topologically stratified space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topologically_stratified_space "Topologically stratified space") for topological manifolds. Basic examples include [manifold with boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_with_boundary "Manifold with boundary") (top dimensional manifold and codimension 1 boundary) and manifolds with corners (top dimensional manifold, codimension 1 boundary, codimension 2 corners). Whitney stratified spaces are a broad class of spaces, including algebraic varieties, analytic varieties, [semialgebraic sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semialgebraic_set "Semialgebraic set"), and [subanalytic sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subanalytic_set "Subanalytic set").CW-complexes A [CW complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex "CW complex") is a topological space formed by gluing disks of different dimensionality together. In general the resulting space is singular, hence not a manifold. However, they are of central interest in algebraic topology, especially in [homotopy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_theory "Homotopy theory").Homology manifolds A [homology manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_manifold "Homology manifold") is a space that behaves like a manifold from the point of view of homology theory. These are not all manifolds, but (in high dimension) can be analyzed by surgery theory similarly to manifolds, and failure to be a manifold is a local obstruction, as in surgery theory.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#cite_note-bfmw-9)Differential spaces Let ![Image 104: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) be a nonempty set. Suppose that some family of real functions on ![Image 105: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) was chosen.

It is an algebra with respect to the pointwise addition and multiplication. Let ![Image 107: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) be equipped with the topology induced by ![Image 108: {\displaystyle C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029). Suppose also that the following conditions hold. First: for every ![Image 109: {\displaystyle H\in C^{\infty }\left(\mathbb {R} ^{n}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e929b9f5b0e3341415d9d245732b8e0957eef2e), where ![Image 110: {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d059936e77a2d707e9ee0a1d9575a1d693ce5d0b), and arbitrary ![Image 111: {\displaystyle f_{1},\dots ,f_{n}\in C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/664260609db96974bb469c93142450d3a392d68f), the composition ![Image 112: {\displaystyle H\circ \left(f_{1},\dots ,f_{n}\right)\in C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87140b87ed10301ffdc249c04949b4f7d23ac703). Second: every function, which in every point of ![Image 113: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) locally coincides with some function from ![Image 114: {\displaystyle C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029), also belongs to ![Image 115: {\displaystyle C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029).
