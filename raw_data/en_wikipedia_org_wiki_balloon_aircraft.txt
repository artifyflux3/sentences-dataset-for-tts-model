In 1999, [Bertrand Piccard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Piccard "Bertrand Piccard") and [Brian Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones_(aeronaut) "Brian Jones (aeronaut)") achieved the first non-stop balloon [circumnavigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation "Circumnavigation") in _[Breitling Orbiter 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitling\_Orbiter\_3 "Breitling Orbiter 3")_.

In [aeronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautics "Aeronautics"), a **balloon** (or a **hot air baloon**) is an unpowered [aerostat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerostat "Aerostat"), which remains aloft or floats due to its [buoyancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy "Buoyancy"). A balloon may be free, moving with the wind, or [tethered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moored_balloon "Moored balloon") to a fixed point. It is distinct from an [airship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship "Airship"), which is a powered aerostat that can propel itself through the air in a controlled manner.

Many balloons have a [basket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket "Basket"), [gondola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondola_(airship) "Gondola (airship)"), or capsule suspended beneath the main envelope for carrying people or equipment (including cameras and telescopes, and flight-control mechanisms).

"Aerostation out at Elbows, or The Itinerant Aeronaut" print illustration and poem (1785)

Aerostation is an obsolete term referring to ballooning and the construction, operation, and navigation of lighter-than-air vehicles. [Tiberius Cavallo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Cavallo "Tiberius Cavallo")'s _The History and Practice of Aerostation_ was published in 1785.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-1) Other books were published on the subject[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-4) including by [Monck Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Monck_Mason "Thomas Monck Mason").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-5) Dramatist [Frederick Pilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Pilon "Frederick Pilon") wrote a play with aerostation as its title.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-6)

A [balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon "Balloon") is conceptually the simplest of all flying machines. The balloon is a fabric envelope filled with a gas that is [lighter than the surrounding atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighter_than_air "Lighter than air"). As the entire balloon is less [dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density") than its surroundings, it rises, taking along with it a basket, attached underneath, which carries passengers or payload. Although a balloon has no propulsion system, a degree of directional control is possible by making the balloon rise or sink in altitude to find favorable wind directions.

There are three main types of balloons:

*   The [hot air balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_air_balloon "Hot air balloon") or _Montgolfière_ obtains its buoyancy by heating the air inside the balloon; it has become the most common type.
*   The [gas balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_balloon "Gas balloon") or _Charlière_ is inflated with a gas of lower [molecular weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mass "Molecular mass") than the ambient atmosphere; most gas balloons operate with the internal pressure of the gas the same as the [pressure of the surrounding atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure"); a [superpressure balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpressure_balloon "Superpressure balloon") can operate with the [lifting gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_gas "Lifting gas") at pressure that exceeds that of the surrounding air, with the objective of limiting or eliminating the loss of gas from day-time heating; gas balloons are filled with gases such as: 
    *   [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") – originally used extensively but, since the [Hindenburg disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindenburg_disaster "Hindenburg disaster"), is now seldom used due to its high flammability;
    *   [coal gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_gas "Coal gas") – although giving around half the lift of hydrogen,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-7) extensively used during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, since it was cheaper than hydrogen and readily available;
    *   [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium") – used today for all airships and most manned gas balloons;
    *   other gases have included [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia") and [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane"), but these have poor lifting capacity and other safety defects and have never been widely used.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-8)

*   The _[Rozière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozi%C3%A8re\_balloon "Rozière balloon")_ type has both heated and unheated lifting gases in separate gasbags. This type of balloon is sometimes used for long-distance record flights, such as the [recent circumnavigations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation#Aviation_2 "Circumnavigation"), but is not otherwise in use.

Both the hot air, or Montgolfière, balloon and the gas balloon are still in common use. Montgolfière balloons are relatively inexpensive, as they do not require high-grade materials for their envelopes, and they are popular for balloonist sport activity.

Hot air balloons, San Diego

Hot air balloon taking off

The first balloon which carried passengers used hot air to obtain buoyancy and was built by the brothers [Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgolfier_brothers "Montgolfier brothers") in [Annonay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annonay "Annonay"), France in 1783: the first passenger flight was 19 September 1783, carrying a sheep, a duck, and a rooster.

The first tethered manned balloon flight was by a larger Montgolfier balloon, probably on 15 October 1783. The first free balloon flight was by the same Montgolfier balloon on 21 November 1783.

When heated, air expands, so a given volume of space contains less air. This makes it lighter and, if its lifting power is greater than the weight of the balloon containing it, it will lift the balloon upwards. A hot air balloon can only stay up while it has fuel for its burner, to keep the air hot enough.

The Montgolfiers' early hot air balloons used a solid-fuel [brazier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazier "Brazier") which proved less practical than the hydrogen balloons that had followed almost immediately, and hot air ballooning soon died out.

In the 1950s, the convenience and low cost of bottled gas burners led to a revival of hot air ballooning for sport and leisure.

The height or altitude of a hot air balloon is controlled by turning the burner up or down as needed, unlike a gas balloon where ballast weights are often carried so that they can be dropped if the balloon gets too low, and in order to land some lifting gas must be vented through a valve.

A man-carrying balloon using the light gas hydrogen for buoyancy was made by Professor [Jacques Charles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Charles "Jacques Charles") and flown less than a month after the Montgolfier flight, on 1 December 1783. Gas balloons have greater [lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)") for a given volume, so they do not need to be so large, and they can also stay up for much longer than hot air, so gas balloons dominated ballooning for the next 200 years. In the 19th century, it was common to use manufactured [town gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_gas "Town gas") (coal gas) to fill balloons; this was not as light as pure hydrogen gas, having about half the lifting power, but it was much cheaper and readily available.

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/GasballoonsABQ.jpg/250px-GasballoonsABQ.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GasballoonsABQ.jpg)

Gas balloons at the [Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque_International_Balloon_Fiesta "Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta")

Light gas balloons are predominant in scientific applications, as they are capable of reaching much higher altitudes for much longer periods of time. They are generally filled with helium. Although hydrogen has more lifting power, it is explosive in an atmosphere rich in [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"). With a few exceptions, scientific balloon missions are unmanned.

There are two types of light-gas balloons: zero-pressure and superpressure. Zero-pressure balloons are the traditional form of light-gas balloon. They are partially inflated with the light gas before launch, with the gas pressure the same both inside and outside the balloon. As the zero-pressure balloon rises, its gas expands to maintain the zero pressure difference, and the balloon's envelope swells.

At night, the gas in a zero-pressure balloon cools and contracts, causing the balloon to sink. A zero-pressure balloon can only maintain altitude by releasing gas when it goes too high, where the expanding gas can threaten to rupture the envelope, or releasing ballast when it sinks too low. Loss of gas and ballast limits the endurance of zero-pressure balloons to a few days.

A [superpressure balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpressure_balloon "Superpressure balloon"), in contrast, has a tough and inelastic envelope that is filled with light gas to pressure higher than that of the external atmosphere, and then sealed. The superpressure balloon cannot change size greatly, and so maintains a generally constant volume. The superpressure balloon maintains an altitude of constant density in the atmosphere, and can maintain flight until gas leakage gradually brings it down.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-9)

Superpressure balloons offer flight endurance of months, rather than days. In fact, in typical operation an Earth-based superpressure balloon mission is ended by a command from ground control to open the envelope, rather than by natural leakage of gas.

[High-altitude balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_balloon "High-altitude balloon") are used as high flying vessels to carry scientific instruments (like [weather balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_balloon "Weather balloon")), or reach near-space altitudes to take footage or photos of the earth. These balloons can fly over 100,000 feet (30.5 km) into the air, and are designed to burst at a set altitude where the parachute will deploy to safely carry the payload back to earth.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-10)

[Cluster ballooning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_ballooning "Cluster ballooning") uses many smaller gas-filled balloons for flight.

### Combination balloons

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balloon_(aeronautics)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Combination balloons")]

Early hot air balloons could not stay up for very long because they used a lot of fuel, while early hydrogen balloons were difficult to take higher or lower as desired because the aeronaut could only vent the gas or drop off ballast a limited number of times. [Pilâtre de Rozier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pil%C3%A2tre_de_Rozier "Pilâtre de Rozier") realised that for a long-distance flight such as crossing the [English Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel "English Channel"), the aeronaut would need to make use of the differing wind directions at different altitudes. It would be essential therefore to have good control of altitude while still able to stay up for a long time. He developed a combination balloon having two gas bags, the [Rozier balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozier_balloon "Rozier balloon"). The upper one held hydrogen and provided most of the steady lift. The lower one held hot air and could be quickly heated or cooled to provide the varying lift for good altitude control.

In 1785 Pilâtre de Rozier took off in an attempt to fly across the Channel, but shortly into the flight the hydrogen gas bag caught fire and de Rozier did not survive the ensuing accident. This earned de Rozier the title "The First to Fly and the First to Die".

It wasn't until the 1980s that technology was developed to allow safe operation of the Rozier type, for example by using non-flammable helium as the lifting gas, and several designs have successfully undertaken long-distance flights.

### Tethering and kite balloons

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balloon_(aeronautics)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Tethering and kite balloons")]

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Static.balloon.bristol.arp.jpg/250px-Static.balloon.bristol.arp.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Static.balloon.bristol.arp.jpg)

As an alternative to free flight, a balloon may be [tethered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethered_balloon "Tethered balloon") to allow reliable take off and landing at the same location. Some of the earliest balloon flights were tethered for safety, and since then balloons have been tethered for many purposes, including military observation and aerial barrage, meteorological and commercial uses.

The natural spherical shape of a balloon is unstable in high winds. Tethered balloons for use in windy conditions are often stabilised by aerodynamic shaping and connecting to the tether by a halter arrangement. These are called [kite balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite_balloon "Kite balloon").

A kite balloon is distinct from a [kytoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kytoon "Kytoon"), which obtains a portion of its lift aerodynamically.

[Bartolomeu de Gusmão](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeu_de_Gusm%C3%A3o "Bartolomeu de Gusmão")'s prototype airship _Passarola_ devised 1709.

Unmanned hot air balloons are mentioned in Chinese history. [Zhuge Liang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuge_Liang "Zhuge Liang") of the [Shu Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_Han "Shu Han") kingdom, in the [Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms "Three Kingdoms") era (220–280 AD) used airborne lanterns for military signaling. These lanterns are known as [Kongming lanterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongming_lantern "Kongming lantern") (_Kǒngmíng dēng_ 孔明灯).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-12) The Mongolian army learned of the [Kongming lantern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongming_lantern "Kongming lantern") from the Chinese and used it in [Battle of Legnica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Legnica "Battle of Legnica") during the Mongol invasion of Poland.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-13) In his work „Il volare non e imposible come fin hora universalmente e stato creduto” ("Flying is Not Impossible, as was commonly believed until now"), the Polish nobleman and scientist [Tytus Boratyni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Livio_Burattini "Tito Livio Burattini") presented the concept of flight using a gas lighter than air[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-14). In 1709 the Brazilian-Portuguese cleric [Bartolomeu de Gusmão](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeu_de_Gusm%C3%A3o "Bartolomeu de Gusmão") made a balloon filled with heated air rise inside a room in [Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon "Lisbon"). On August 8, 1709, in Lisbon, Gusmão managed to lift a small balloon made of paper with hot air about four meters in front of king John V and the Portuguese court[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-20) He also claimed to have built a balloon named _\_Passarola\__ (_Big bird_) and attempted to lift himself from Saint George Castle in Lisbon, landing about one kilometre away. However the claim of this feat remains uncertain, even though there is record of this flight in the source used by the [FAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_A%C3%A9ronautique_Internationale "Fédération Aéronautique Internationale") the exact distance and conditions of the flight are not confirmed.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-RPT00-21)

### The first modern balloons

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balloon_(aeronautics)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: The first modern balloons")]

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Montgolfier_Balloon.JPG/250px-Montgolfier_Balloon.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Montgolfier_Balloon.JPG)

A model of the [Montgolfier brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgolfier_brothers "Montgolfier brothers") balloon at the [London Science Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Science_Museum "London Science Museum")

Following [Henry Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish "Henry Cavendish")'s 1766 work on [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen"), [Joseph Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Black "Joseph Black") proposed that a balloon filled with hydrogen would be able to rise in the air.

The first recorded manned flight was made in a hot air balloon built by the [Montgolfier brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgolfier_brothers "Montgolfier brothers") on 21 November 1783.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-RPT00-21) The flight started in Paris and reached a height of 500 feet or so. The pilots, [Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Pil%C3%A2tre_de_Rozier "Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier") and [François Laurent d'Arlandes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Laurent_d%27Arlandes "François Laurent d'Arlandes"), covered about 5.5 miles (8.9 km) in 25 minutes.

On 1 December 1783, Professor [Jacques Charles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Charles "Jacques Charles") and the [Robert brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_brothers "Robert brothers") made the first gas balloon flight, also from Paris. Their [hydrogen-filled balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_brothers#First_manned_hydrogen_balloon_flight "Robert brothers") flew to almost 2,000 feet (600 m), stayed aloft for over 2 hours and covered a distance of 27 miles (43 km), landing in the small town of [Nesles-la-Vallée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesles-la-Vall%C3%A9e "Nesles-la-Vallée").

The first Italian balloon ascent was made by Count [Paolo Andreani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Andreani "Paolo Andreani") and two other passengers in a balloon designed and constructed by the three Gerli brothers, on 25 February 1784. A public demonstration occurred in [Brugherio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugherio "Brugherio") a few days later, on 13 March 1784, when the vehicle flew to a height of 1,537 metres (5,043 ft) and a distance of 8 kilometres (5.0 mi).[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-22) On 28 March Andreani received a standing ovation at [La Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Scala "La Scala"), and later a medal from [Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor").

De Rozier, together with [Joseph Proust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Proust "Joseph Proust"), took part in a further flight on 23 June 1784, in a modified version of the Montgolfiers' first balloon christened La [Marie-Antoinette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Antoinette "Marie-Antoinette") after the Queen. They took off in front of the King of France and King [Gustav III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_III "Gustav III") of Sweden. The balloon flew north at an altitude of approximately 3,000 metres, above the clouds, travelling 52 km in 45 minutes before cold and turbulence forced them to descend past [Luzarches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luzarches "Luzarches"), between [Coye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coye "Coye") et [Orry-la-Ville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orry-la-Ville "Orry-la-Ville"), near the Chantilly forest.

The first balloon ascent in Britain was made by [James Tytler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tytler "James Tytler") on 25 August 1784 at [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh "Edinburgh"), Scotland, in a [hot air balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_air_balloon "Hot air balloon").

The first aircraft disaster occurred in May 1785 when the town of [Tullamore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullamore "Tullamore"), [County Offaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Offaly "County Offaly"), Ireland was seriously damaged when the crash of a balloon resulted in a fire that burned down about 100 houses, making the town home to the world's first [aviation disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents "Aviation accidents and incidents"). To this day, the town shield depicts a [phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology) "Phoenix (mythology)") rising from the ashes.

Balloon landing in Mashgh square, [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran") ([Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia "Persia")), at the time of Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar, around 1850.

[Jean-Pierre Blanchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Blanchard "Jean-Pierre Blanchard") went on to make the first manned flight of a balloon in America on 9 January 1793, after touring Europe to set the record for the first balloon flight in countries including the [Austrian Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Netherlands "Austrian Netherlands"), Germany, the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") and [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland"). His hydrogen filled balloon took off from a prison yard in [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia"), Pennsylvania. The flight reached 5,800 feet(1,770 m) and landed in [Gloucester County, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucester_County,_New_Jersey "Gloucester County, New Jersey"). President [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington") was among the guests observing the takeoff. [Sophie Blanchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Blanchard "Sophie Blanchard"), married to Jean-Pierre, was the first woman to pilot her own balloon and the first woman to adopt ballooning as a career.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-23)

On 29 September 1804, Abraham Hopman became the first Dutchman to make a successful balloon flight in the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-24)

Gas balloons became the most common type from the 1790s until the 1960s. The French military [observation balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_balloon "Observation balloon")_[L'Intrépide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Intr%C3%A9pide "L'Intrépide")_ of 1795 is the oldest preserved aircraft in Europe; it is on display in the _[Heeresgeschichtliches Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heeresgeschichtliches\_Museum "Heeresgeschichtliches Museum")_ in Vienna. [Jules Verne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne "Jules Verne") wrote a short, non-fiction story, published in 1852, about being stranded aboard a hydrogen balloon.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-25)

The earliest successful balloon flight recorded in Australia was by William Dean in 1858. His balloon was gas-filled and travelled 30 km with two people aboard.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-26) On 5 January 1870, T. Gale, made an ascent from the Domain in Sydney. His balloon was 17 metres in length by 31 metres in circumference and his ascent, with him seated on the netting, took him about a mile before he landed in Glebe.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-27)

[Henri Giffard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Giffard "Henri Giffard") also developed a tethered balloon for passengers in 1878 in the [Tuileries Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuileries_Garden "Tuileries Garden") in Paris. The first tethered balloon in modern times was made in France at Chantilly Castle in 1994 by [Aerophile SA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerophile_SA "Aerophile SA").

Ballooning developed as a leisure activity. It was given a significant boost when Charles Green discovered that readily-available [coal gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_gas "Coal gas"), then coming into urban use, gave half the lifting power of hydrogen, which had to be specially manufactured. In 1836 Green made an almost 500 mile long-distance flight from London, England to [Weilberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Weilberg&action=edit&redlink=1 "Weilberg (page does not exist)") in Germany.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-28)

The first military use of a balloon was at the [Battle of Fleurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fleurus_(1794) "Battle of Fleurus (1794)") in 1794, when _L'Entreprenant_ was used by the [French Aerostatic Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Aerostatic_Corps "French Aerostatic Corps") to watch the movements of the enemy. On 2 April 1794, an aeronauts corps was created in the French army; however, given the logistical problems linked with the production of hydrogen on the battlefield (it required constructing ovens and pouring water on white-hot iron), the corps was disbanded in 1799.

The first major use of balloons in the military occurred during the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War") with the [Union Army Balloon Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army_Balloon_Corps "Union Army Balloon Corps") established in 1861.

Close-up view of an American major in the basket of an [observation balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_balloon "Observation balloon") flying over territory near front lines during World War I.

During the [Paraguayan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguayan_War "Paraguayan War") (1864–70), observation balloons were used by the [Brazilian Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Army "Brazilian Army").

Balloons were used by the [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland")[Royal Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Engineers "Royal Engineers") in 1885 for reconnaissance and observation purposes during the [Bechuanaland Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechuanaland_Protectorate "Bechuanaland Protectorate") and the [Sudan Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_Expedition "Nile Expedition"). Although experiments in Britain had been conducted as early as 1863, a [School of Ballooning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Ballooning "School of Ballooning") was not established at [Chatham, Medway, Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham,_Kent "Chatham, Kent") until 1888. During the [Anglo-Boer War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War "Second Boer War") (1899–1902), use was made of observation balloons. A 11,500 cubic feet (330 m 3) balloon was kept inflated for 22 days and marched 165 miles into the Transvaal with the British forces.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-Bruce-8-29)

Hydrogen-filled balloons were widely used during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") (1914–1918) to detect enemy troop movements and to direct artillery fire. Observers phoned their reports to officers on the ground who then relayed the information to those who needed it. Balloons were frequently targets of opposing aircraft. Planes assigned to attack enemy balloons were often equipped with [incendiary bullets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incendiary_bullet "Incendiary bullet"), for the purpose of igniting the hydrogen.

The [Aeronaut Badge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronaut_Badge "Aeronaut Badge") was established by the [United States Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "United States Army") in World War I to denote service members who were qualified balloon pilots. Observation balloons were retained well after the Great War, being used in the Russo-Finnish Wars, the [Winter War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War "Winter War") of 1939–40, and the [Continuation War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation_War "Continuation War") of 1941–45.

During [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") the [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan") launched thousands of hydrogen "[fire balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_balloon "Fire balloon")" against the United States and Canada. In [Operation Outward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Outward "Operation Outward") the British used balloons to carry incendiaries to [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"). During 2018, [incendiary balloons and kites were launched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_airborne_arson_attacks "Palestinian airborne arson attacks") from Gaza at Israel, burning some 12,000 dunams (3,000 acres) in Israel.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-30)

Large helium balloons [are used by the South Korean government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_campaigns_in_Korea "Balloon campaigns in Korea") and private activists advocating freedom in [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea"). They float hundreds of kilometers across the border carrying news from the outside world, illegal radios, foreign currency and gifts of personal hygiene supplies. A North Korean military official has described it as "psychological warfare" and threatened to attack South Korea if their release continued.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-32)

[Ed Yost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Yost "Ed Yost") redesigned the hot air balloon in the late 1950s using rip-stop nylon fabrics and high-powered [propane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propane "Propane") burners to create the modern hot air balloon. His first flight of such a balloon, lasting 25 minutes and covering 3 miles(5 km), occurred on 22 October 1960 in [Bruning, Nebraska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruning,_Nebraska "Bruning, Nebraska"). Yost's improved design for hot air balloons triggered the modern sport balloon movement. Today, hot air balloons are much more common than gas balloons.

In the late 1970s the British hot air balloonist [Julian Nott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nott_(balloonist) "Julian Nott (balloonist)") constructed a hot air balloon using technologies he believed would have been available to the [Nazca culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_culture "Nazca culture") of [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru") some 1500 to 2000 years earlier, and demonstrated that it could fly.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-Nott-33) and again in 2003,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-34) Nott has speculated that the Nazca might have used it as a tool for designing the [Nazca Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Lines "Nazca Lines").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-Nott-33) Nott also pioneered the use of [hybrid energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle#Power "Hybrid vehicle"), where [solar power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power "Solar power") is a significant heat source, and in 1981 he [crossed the English Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_Channel_crossings_by_air "List of English Channel crossings by air").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-35)

Tethered gas balloons have been installed as [amusement rides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amusement_rides "List of amusement rides") in Paris since 1999, in Berlin since 2000, in [Disneyland Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland_Paris "Disneyland Paris") since 2005, in the San Diego Wild Animal Park since 2005, in [Walt Disney World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World "Walt Disney World") in Orlando since 2009, and the [DHL Balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHL_Balloon "DHL Balloon") in Singapore in 2006. Modern tethered gas balloons are made by [Aerophile SAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerophile_SAS "Aerophile SAS").

Hot air balloons used in sport flying are sometimes made in special designs to advertise a company or product, such as the Chubb [fire extinguisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_extinguisher "Fire extinguisher") illustrated.

A balloon in space uses internal gas pressure only to maintain its shape.

The [Echo satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_satellite "Echo satellite") was a [balloon satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_satellite "Balloon satellite") launched into Earth orbit in 1960 and used for passive relay of radio communication. [PAGEOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAGEOS "PAGEOS") was launched in 1966 for worldwide satellite triangulation, allowing for greater precision in the calculation of different locations on the planet's surface.

In 1984, the [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") space probes [Vega 1 and Vega 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega_program "Vega program") released two balloons with scientific experiments in the atmosphere of [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus"). They transmitted signals for two days to Earth.

On 19 October 1910, [Alan Hawley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_R._Hawley "Alan R. Hawley") and [Augustus Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_Post "Augustus Post") landed in the wilderness of Quebec, Canada after traveling for 48 hours and 1887.6 kilometers (1,173 mi) from St. Louis during the [Gordon Bennett International Balloon Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Bennett_Cup_in_ballooning "Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning"), setting a distance record that held for more than 20 years. It took the men a week to hike out of the woods, during which time search parties had been mobilized and many had taken the pair for dead.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-36)

On 13 December 1913 through 17 December 1913 [Hugo Kaulen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Kaulen "Hugo Kaulen") stayed aloft for 87 hours. His record lasted until 1976.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-37)[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

On 27 May 1931, [Auguste Piccard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Piccard "Auguste Piccard") and Paul Kipfer became the first to reach the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere") in a balloon.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-38)[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

On 31 August 1933, [Alexander Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Dahl "Alexander Dahl") took the first picture of the Earth's curvature in an open hydrogen gas balloon.

The helium-filled [_Explorer II_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratobowl "Stratobowl") balloon, piloted by [US Army Air Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Army_Air_Corps "US Army Air Corps") officers Capt. Orvil A. Anderson, Maj. William E. Kepner and Capt. Albert W. Stevens, reached a new record height of 22,066 m (72,395 ft) on 11 November 1935. This followed the same crew's previous near-fatal plunge in July 1934 in a predecessor craft, _Explorer_, after its canopy ruptured just 190 m (624 ft) short (it transpired) of the then-current altitude record of 22,000 m (72,178 ft) set by the Soviet balloon _[Osoaviakhim-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osoaviakhim-1 "Osoaviakhim-1")_.

In 1976, [Ed Yost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Yost "Ed Yost") set 13 aviation world's records for distance traveled and amount of time aloft in his attempt to cross the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") —solo— by balloon (3.938 km, 107:37 h).

In 1978, [Ben Abruzzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Abruzzo "Ben Abruzzo") and his team became the first to cross the Pacific Ocean in a hot air balloon.

The current absolute altitude record for manned balloon flight was set at 34,668 m (113,739 ft) on 4 May 1961 by [Malcolm Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Ross_(balloonist) "Malcolm Ross (balloonist)") and [Victor Prather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Prather "Victor Prather") in the [Strato-Lab V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Strato-Lab "Project Strato-Lab") balloon payload launched from the deck of the [USS _Antietam_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Antietam_(CV-36) "USS Antietam (CV-36)") in the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico").[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-FAIAbsoluteAltitute-40)

The previous record altitude for a manned balloon was set at 38,960.5 m (127,823 ft) by [Felix Baumgartner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Baumgartner "Felix Baumgartner") in the [Red Bull Stratos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Stratos "Red Bull Stratos") balloon launched from [Roswell, New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell,_New_Mexico "Roswell, New Mexico") on Sunday, 14 October 2012.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-FAIAbsoluteAltitute-40)

The current record altitude for a manned balloon was set at 41,419.0 m (135,889.108 ft) by [Alan Eustace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Eustace "Alan Eustace") on 24 October 2014 as part of the [StratEx Space Dive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StratEx_Space_Dive "StratEx Space Dive") project.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-FAIAbsoluteAltitute-40)

On 1 March 1999 [Bertrand Piccard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Piccard "Bertrand Piccard") and [Brian Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones_(aeronaut) "Brian Jones (aeronaut)") set off in the balloon [Breitling Orbiter 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitling_Orbiter "Breitling Orbiter") from [Château d'Oex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_d%27Oex "Château d'Oex") in Switzerland on the first non-stop balloon [circumnavigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumnavigation "Circumnavigation") around the globe. They landed in [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt") after a 40,814 km (25,361 mi) flight lasting 19 days, 21 hours and 55 minutes.

The altitude record for an unmanned balloon is 53.0 kilometres (173,882 ft) in the [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere"), reached with a volume of 60,000 cubic metres. The balloon was launched by [JAXA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAXA "JAXA") on 25 May 2002 from [Iwate Prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwate_Prefecture "Iwate Prefecture"), Japan.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-41) This is the greatest height ever obtained by an atmospheric vehicle. Only [rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket"), [rocket planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_plane "Rocket plane"), and [ballistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics "Ballistics") projectiles have flown higher.

In 2015, the two pilots Leonid Tiukhtyaev and Troy Bradley arrived safely in [Baja California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California "Baja California"), Mexico after a journey of 10,711 km. The two men, originally from Russia and the United States of America respectively, started in Japan and flew with a helium balloon over the Pacific. In 160 hours, the balloon named "Two Eagles" arrived in Mexico, which is new distance and duration records for straight gas balloons.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)#cite_note-42)
