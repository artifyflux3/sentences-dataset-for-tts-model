SI units 9.806650 N CGS units 980,665.0 dyn British Gravitational units 2.204623 lbf Absolute English units 70.93164 pdl The kilogram-force ( kgf or kg F ), or kilopond ( kp , from Latin : pondus , lit.

'weight'), is a non-standard gravitational metric unit of force . It is not accepted for use with the International System of Units (SI) [ 1 ] and is deprecated for most uses.

[ citation needed ] The kilogram-force is equal to the magnitude of the force exerted on one kilogram of mass in a 9.806 65 m/s 2 gravitational field ( standard gravity , a conventional value approximating the average magnitude of gravity on Earth).

[ 2 ] That is, it is the weight of a kilogram under standard gravity. One kilogram-force is defined as 9.806 65 N .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Similarly, a gram-force is 9.806 65 mN , and a milligram-force is 9.806 65 μN .

History [ edit ] The gram-force and kilogram-force were never well-defined units until the CGPM adopted a standard acceleration of gravity of 9.80665 m/s 2 for this purpose in 1901, [ 5 ] though they had been used in low-precision measurements of force before that time. Even then, the proposal to define kilogram-force as a standard unit of force was explicitly rejected.

[ 6 ] Instead, the newton was proposed in 1913 [ 7 ] and accepted in 1948.

[ 8 ] The kilogram-force has never been a part of the International System of Units (SI), which was introduced in 1960. The SI unit of force is the newton .

Prior to this, the units were widely used in much of the world. They are still in use for some purposes; for example, they are used to specify tension of bicycle spokes , [ 9 ] draw weight of bows in archery , and tensile strength of electronics bond wire , [ 10 ] for informal references to pressure (as the technically incorrect kilogram per square centimetre , omitting -force , the kilogram -force per square centimetre being the technical atmosphere , the value of which is very near those of both the bar and the standard atmosphere ), and to define the " metric horsepower " (PS) as 75 metre-kiloponds per second.

[ 3 ] In addition, the kilogram force was the standard unit used for Vickers hardness testing .

[ 11 ] Three approaches to metric units of mass and force or weight [ 12 ] [ 13 ] v t e Base Force Weight Mass 2nd law of motion m = ⁠ F / a ⁠ F = ⁠ W ⋅ a / g ⁠ F = m ⋅ a System GM M CGS MTS SI Acceleration ( a ) m/s 2 m/s 2 Gal m/s 2 m/s 2 Mass ( m ) hyl kilogram gram tonne kilogram Force ( F ), weight ( W ) kilopond kilopond dyne sthène newton Pressure ( p ) technical atmosphere standard atmosphere barye pieze pascal In 1940s, Germany, the thrust of a rocket engine was measured in kilograms-force, [ citation needed ] in the Soviet Union it remained the primary unit for thrust in the Russian space program until at least the late 1980s.

[ citation needed ] Dividing the thrust in kilograms-force on the mass of an engine or a rocket in kilograms conveniently gives the thrust to weight ratio , dividing the thrust on propellant consumption rate ( mass flow rate ) in kilograms per second gives the specific impulse in seconds.

The term "kilopond" has been declared obsolete.

[ 14 ] Related units [ edit ] The tonne-force , metric ton-force , megagram-force , and megapond ( Mp ) are each 1000 kilograms-force.

The decanewton or dekanewton ( daN ), exactly 10 N, is used in some fields as an approximation to the kilogram-force, because it is close to the 9.80665 N of 1 kgf.

The gram-force is 1 ⁄ 1000 of a kilogram-force.
