Links Online archive Annals of Philosophy; or, Magazine of Chemistry, Mineralology, Mechanics, Natural History, Agriculture and the Arts [ 1 ] was a learned journal founded in 1813 by the Scottish chemist Thomas Thomson . It shortly became a leader in its field of commercial scientific periodicals.

[ 2 ] Contributors included John George Children , [ 3 ] Edward Daniel Clarke , [ 4 ] Philip Crampton , [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Alexander Crichton , [ 7 ] James Cumming , [ 8 ] John Herapath , [ 9 ] William George Horner , [ 10 ] Thomas Dick Lauder , [ 11 ] John Miers , [ 12 ] Matthew Paul Moyle , [ 13 ] Robert Porrett , [ 14 ] James Thomson , [ 15 ] and Charles Wheatstone .

[ 16 ] Thomson edited it until 1821, when he was succeeded in 1821 by Richard Phillips . The journal was bought by Richard Taylor in 1827, and closed down for the benefit of the Philosophical Magazine .

[ 17 ] The Annals of Philosophy were issued monthly following a standard pattern. Often the first article was a biographical article (10 pages) on a living or recently deceased scientist. This was then followed by a series of extended pieces (5-10 pages) on particular topics, sometimes by eminent authors. Then there were shorter news items and correspondence. Summaries followed: first of the proceedings of learned bodies (Royal Society, Linnean, French Institute -if available: the Napoleonic Wars made communications with the continent difficult at first, [ 18 ] etc.), then of patents, and finally of new books. The last section was a meteorological journal. Every six months a title page, index, and preface were issued which could be bound before the six monthly issues to make a half-yearly volume.

[ 19 ] Including front matter, volumes were just under 500 pages each.
