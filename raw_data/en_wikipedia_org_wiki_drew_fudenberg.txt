He was also the principal editor of Econometrica from 1996 until 2000.

Fudenberg has authored a number of books on game theory, including Game Theory with Jean Tirole , a primary reference for graduate students in economics; Dynamic Models of Oligopoly , also with Jean Tirole; and Theory of Learning in Games with David K. Levine .
