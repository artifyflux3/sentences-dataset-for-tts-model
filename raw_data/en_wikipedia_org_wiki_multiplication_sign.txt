[ 1 ] The symbol is also used in botany , in  botanical hybrid names .

The form is properly a four-fold rotationally symmetric saltire .

[ 2 ] The multiplication sign × is similar to a lowercase X ( x ).

History [ edit ] The earliest known use of the × symbol to indicate multiplication appears in an anonymous appendix to the 1618 edition of John Napier 's Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio .

[ 3 ] This appendix has been attributed to William Oughtred , [ 3 ] who used the same symbol in his 1631 algebra text, Clavis Mathematicae , stating: Multiplication of species [i.e. unknowns] connects both proposed magnitudes with the symbol 'in' or × : or ordinarily without the symbol if the magnitudes be denoted with one letter.

[ 4 ] Other works  have been identified in which crossed diagonals appear in diagrams involving multiplied numbers, such as Robert Recorde 's The Ground of Arts [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and Oswald Schreckenfuchs 's 1551 edition of Almagest , but these are not symbolizations.

[ 3 ] Uses [ edit ] In mathematics , the symbol × has a number of uses, including Multiplication of two numbers , where it is read as "times" or "multiplied by" [ 1 ] Cross product of two vectors , where it is usually read as "cross" Cartesian product of two sets, where it is usually read as "cross" [ 7 ] Geometric dimension of an object, such as noting that a room is 10 feet × 12 feet in area, where it is usually read as "by" (e.g., "10 feet by 12 feet") Display resolution in pixels, such as 1920 pixels across × 1080 pixels down. Read as "by".

Dimensions of a matrix , where it is usually read as "by" A statistical interaction between two explanatory variables , where it is usually read as "by" the optical magnification is sometimes referred to as "power" (for example "10× power") In biology , the multiplication sign is used in a botanical hybrid name , for instance Ceanothus papillosus × impressus (a hybrid between C. papillosus and C. impressus ) or Crocosmia × crocosmiiflora (a hybrid between two other species of Crocosmia ). However, the communication of these hybrid names with a Latin letter "x" is common, especially when the actual "×" symbol is not readily available.

The multiplication sign is also used by historians for an event between two dates . When employed between two dates –  for example 1225 and 1232 –  the expression "1225×1232" means "no earlier than 1225 and no later than 1232".

[ 8 ] A monadic × symbol is used by the APL programming language to denote the sign function .

Similar notations [ edit ] Main article: Multiplication: Notation The lower-case Latin letter x is sometimes used in place of the multiplication sign. This is considered incorrect in mathematical writing.

[ citation needed ] In algebraic notation, widely used in mathematics, a multiplication symbol is usually omitted wherever it would not cause confusion: " a multiplied by b " can be written as ab or a b .

[ 1 ] Other symbols can also be used to denote multiplication, often to reduce confusion between the multiplication sign × and the common variable x . In some countries, such as Germany , the primary symbol for multiplication is the " dot operator " ⋅ (as in a ⋅ b ). This symbol is also used in compound units of measurement , e.g., N⋅m (see International System of Units § Lexicographic conventions ). In algebra, it is a notation to resolve ambiguity (for instance, " b times 2 " may be written as b ⋅2 , to avoid being confused with a value called b 2 ). This notation is used wherever multiplication should be written explicitly, such as in " ab = a ⋅2 for b = 2 "; this usage is also seen in English-language texts. In some languages, the use of full stop as a multiplication symbol, such as a .

b , is common when the symbol for decimal point is comma .

Historically, computer language syntax was restricted to the ASCII character set, and the asterisk * became the de facto symbol for the multiplication operator. This selection is reflected in the numeric keypad on English-language keyboards, where the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are represented by the keys + , - , * and / , respectively.
