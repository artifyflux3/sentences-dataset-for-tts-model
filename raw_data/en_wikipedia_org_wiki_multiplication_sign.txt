The **multiplication sign** (×), also known as the **times sign** or the **dimension sign**, is a [mathematical symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols "Glossary of mathematical symbols") used to denote the operation of [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"), which results in a [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics) "Product (mathematics)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-:1-1)

The symbol is also used in [botany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany "Botany"), in botanical [hybrid names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_name_(botany) "Hybrid name (botany)").

The form is properly a four-fold [rotationally symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry "Rotational symmetry")[saltire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltire "Saltire").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-2) The multiplication sign × is similar to a lowercase [X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X "X") (x).

The earliest known use of the × symbol to indicate multiplication appears in an anonymous appendix to the 1618 edition of [John Napier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Napier "John Napier")'s _[Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirifici\_Logarithmorum\_Canonis\_Descriptio "Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio")_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-Cajori-3) This appendix has been attributed to [William Oughtred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Oughtred "William Oughtred"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-Cajori-3) who used the same symbol in his 1631 algebra text, _Clavis Mathematicae_, stating:

> Multiplication of species [i.e. unknowns] connects both proposed magnitudes with the symbol 'in' or ×: or ordinarily without the symbol if the magnitudes be denoted with one letter.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-4)

Other works have been identified in which crossed diagonals appear in diagrams involving multiplied numbers, such as [Robert Recorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Recorde "Robert Recorde")'s _[The Ground of Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Ground\_of\_Arts "The Ground of Arts")_[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-6) and [Oswald Schreckenfuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Schreckenfuchs "Oswald Schreckenfuchs")'s 1551 edition of _[Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest")_, but these are not symbolizations.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-Cajori-3)

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the [symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol "Symbol") × has a number of uses, including

*   [Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication") of two [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers "Numbers"), where it is read as "times" or "multiplied by"[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-:1-1)
*   [Cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") of two [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"), where it is usually read as "cross"
*   [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product") of two sets, where it is usually read as "cross"[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-7)
*   Geometric dimension of an object, such as noting that a room is 10 feet × 12 feet in area, where it is usually read as "by" (e.g., "10 feet by 12 feet")
*   [Display resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution "Display resolution") in pixels, such as 1920 pixels across × 1080 pixels down. Read as "by".
*   Dimensions of a [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"), where it is usually read as "by"
*   A [statistical interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics) "Interaction (statistics)") between two explanatory [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)"), where it is usually read as "by"
*   the [optical magnification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification#Size_ratio_(optical_magnification) "Magnification") is sometimes referred to as "power" (for example "10× power")

In [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), the multiplication sign is used in a botanical [hybrid name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_name_(botany) "Hybrid name (botany)"), for instance _Ceanothus papillosus_ × _impressus_ (a hybrid between _[C. papillosus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceanothus\_papillosus "Ceanothus papillosus")_ and _[C. impressus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceanothus\_impressus "Ceanothus impressus")_) or _[Crocosmia × crocosmiiflora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocosmia\_%C3%97\_crocosmiiflora "Crocosmia × crocosmiiflora")_ (a hybrid between two other species of _Crocosmia_). However, the communication of these hybrid names with a Latin letter "x" is common, especially when the actual "×" symbol is not readily available.

The multiplication sign is also used by [historians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian "Historian") for an event between two [dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_date "Calendar date"). When employed between two dates– for example 1225 and 1232– the expression "1225×1232" means "no earlier than 1225 and no later than 1232".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-8)

A [monadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming) "Monad (functional programming)")× symbol is used by the [APL programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)") to denote the [sign function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_function "Sign function").

The lower-case Latin letter x is sometimes used in place of the multiplication sign. This is considered incorrect in mathematical writing.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") notation, widely used in mathematics, a multiplication symbol is usually omitted wherever it would not cause confusion: "a multiplied by b" can be written as _ab_ or _a b_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign#cite_note-:1-1)

Other symbols can also be used to denote multiplication, often to reduce confusion between the multiplication sign × and the common variable x. In some countries, such as [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), the primary symbol for multiplication is the "[dot operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_operator "Dot operator")" ⋅ (as in _a_⋅_b_). This symbol is also used in compound [units of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement "Units of measurement"), e.g., N⋅m (see _[International System of Units §Lexicographic conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_System\_of\_Units#Lexicographic\_conventions "International System of Units")_). In algebra, it is a notation to resolve ambiguity (for instance, "_b_ times 2" may be written as _b_⋅2, to avoid being confused with a value called _b_ 2). This notation is used wherever multiplication should be written explicitly, such as in "_ab_ = _a_⋅2 for _b_ = 2"; this usage is also seen in English-language texts. In some languages, the use of [full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") as a multiplication symbol, such as _a_._b_, is common when the symbol for [decimal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_point "Decimal point") is [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma").

Historically, computer language [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming) "Syntax (programming)") was restricted to the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") character set, and the [asterisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk "Asterisk")* became the de facto symbol for the multiplication operator. This selection is reflected in the [numeric keypad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad "Numeric keypad") on English-language keyboards, where the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are represented by the keys +, -, * and /, respectively.
