In mathematics , the interior product (also known as interior derivative , interior multiplication , inner multiplication , inner derivative , insertion operator , contraction , or inner derivation ) is a degree −1 (anti)derivation on the exterior algebra of differential forms on a smooth manifold . The interior product, named in opposition to the exterior product , should not be confused with an inner product . The interior product ι ι X ω ω {\displaystyle \iota _{X}\omega } is sometimes written as X ⌟ ⌟ ω ω .

{\displaystyle X\mathbin {\lrcorner } \omega .} [ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] The interior product is defined to be the contraction of a differential form with a vector field .  Thus if X {\displaystyle X} is a vector field on the manifold M , {\displaystyle M,} then ι ι X : Ω Ω p ( M ) → → Ω Ω p − − 1 ( M ) {\displaystyle \iota _{X}:\Omega ^{p}(M)\to \Omega ^{p-1}(M)} is the map which sends a p {\displaystyle p} -form ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } to the ( p − − 1 ) {\displaystyle (p-1)} -form ι ι X ω ω {\displaystyle \iota _{X}\omega } defined by the property that ( ι ι X ω ω ) ( X 1 , … … , X p − − 1 ) = ω ω ( X , X 1 , … … , X p − − 1 ) {\displaystyle (\iota _{X}\omega )\left(X_{1},\ldots ,X_{p-1}\right)=\omega \left(X,X_{1},\ldots ,X_{p-1}\right)} for any vector fields X 1 , … … , X p − − 1 .

{\displaystyle X_{1},\ldots ,X_{p-1}.} When ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is a scalar field (0-form), ι ι X ω ω = 0 {\displaystyle \iota _{X}\omega =0} by convention.

The interior product is the unique antiderivation of degree −1 on the exterior algebra such that on one-forms α α {\displaystyle \alpha } ι ι X α α = α α ( X ) = ⟨ ⟨ α α , X ⟩ ⟩ , {\displaystyle \displaystyle \iota _{X}\alpha =\alpha (X)=\langle \alpha ,X\rangle ,} where ⟨ ⟨ ⋅ ⋅ , ⋅ ⋅ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle \,\cdot ,\cdot \,\rangle } is the duality pairing between α α {\displaystyle \alpha } and the vector X .

{\displaystyle X.} Explicitly, if β β {\displaystyle \beta } is a p {\displaystyle p} -form and γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is a q {\displaystyle q} -form, then ι ι X ( β β ∧ ∧ γ γ ) = ( ι ι X β β ) ∧ ∧ γ γ + ( − − 1 ) p β β ∧ ∧ ( ι ι X γ γ ) .

{\displaystyle \iota _{X}(\beta \wedge \gamma )=\left(\iota _{X}\beta \right)\wedge \gamma +(-1)^{p}\beta \wedge \left(\iota _{X}\gamma \right).} The above relation says that the interior product obeys a graded Leibniz rule . An operation satisfying linearity and a Leibniz rule is called a derivation.

Properties [ edit ] If in local coordinates ( x 1 , .

.

.

, x n ) {\displaystyle (x_{1},...,x_{n})} the vector field X {\displaystyle X} is given by X = f 1 ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + f n ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x n {\displaystyle X=f_{1}{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{1}}}+\cdots +f_{n}{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{n}}}} then the interior product is given by ι ι X ( d x 1 ∧ ∧ .

.

∧ ∧ d x n ) = ∑ ∑ r = 1 n ( − − 1 ) r − − 1 f r d x 1 ∧ ∧ .

∧ ∧ d x r ^ ^ ∧ ∧ .

∧ ∧ d x n , {\displaystyle \iota _{X}(dx_{1}\wedge ...\wedge dx_{n})=\sum _{r=1}^{n}(-1)^{r-1}f_{r}dx_{1}\wedge ...\wedge {\widehat {dx_{r}}}\wedge ...\wedge dx_{n},} where d x 1 ∧ ∧ .

∧ ∧ d x r ^ ^ ∧ ∧ .

∧ ∧ d x n {\displaystyle dx_{1}\wedge ...\wedge {\widehat {dx_{r}}}\wedge ...\wedge dx_{n}} is the form obtained by omitting d x r {\displaystyle dx_{r}} from d x 1 ∧ ∧ .

∧ ∧ d x n {\displaystyle dx_{1}\wedge ...\wedge dx_{n}} .

By antisymmetry of forms, ι ι X ι ι Y ω ω = − − ι ι Y ι ι X ω ω , {\displaystyle \iota _{X}\iota _{Y}\omega =-\iota _{Y}\iota _{X}\omega ,} and so ι ι X ∘ ∘ ι ι X = 0.

{\displaystyle \iota _{X}\circ \iota _{X}=0.} This may be compared to the exterior derivative d , {\displaystyle d,} which has the property d ∘ ∘ d = 0.

{\displaystyle d\circ d=0.} The interior product with respect to the commutator of two vector fields X , {\displaystyle X,} Y {\displaystyle Y} satisfies the identity ι ι [ X , Y ] = [ L X , ι ι Y ] = [ ι ι X , L Y ] .

{\displaystyle \iota _{[X,Y]}=\left[{\mathcal {L}}_{X},\iota _{Y}\right]=\left[\iota _{X},{\mathcal {L}}_{Y}\right].} Proof.

For any k-form Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } , L X ( ι ι Y Ω Ω ) − − ι ι Y ( L X Ω Ω ) = ( L X Ω Ω ) ( Y , − − ) + Ω Ω ( L X Y , − − ) − − ( L X Ω Ω ) ( Y , − − ) = ι ι L X Y Ω Ω = ι ι [ X , Y ] Ω Ω {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X}(\iota _{Y}\Omega )-\iota _{Y}({\mathcal {L}}_{X}\Omega )=({\mathcal {L}}_{X}\Omega )(Y,-)+\Omega ({\mathcal {L}}_{X}Y,-)-({\mathcal {L}}_{X}\Omega )(Y,-)=\iota _{{\mathcal {L}}_{X}Y}\Omega =\iota _{[X,Y]}\Omega } and similarly for the other result.

Cartan identity [ edit ] The interior product relates the exterior derivative and Lie derivative of differential forms by the Cartan formula (also known as the Cartan identity , Cartan homotopy formula [ 2 ] or Cartan magic formula ) : L X ω ω = d ( ι ι X ω ω ) + ι ι X d ω ω = { d , ι ι X } ω ω .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X}\omega =d(\iota _{X}\omega )+\iota _{X}d\omega =\left\{d,\iota _{X}\right\}\omega .} where the anticommutator was used. This identity defines a duality between the exterior and interior derivatives. Cartan's identity is important in symplectic geometry and general relativity : see moment map .

[ 3 ] The Cartan homotopy formula is named after Élie Cartan .

[ 4 ] Proof by direct computation [ 5 ] Since vector fields are locally integrable, we can always find a local coordinate system ( ξ ξ 1 , … … , ξ ξ n ) {\displaystyle (\xi ^{1},\dots ,\xi ^{n})} such that the vector field X {\displaystyle X} corresponds to the partial derivative with respect to the first coordinate, i.e., X = ∂ ∂ 1 {\displaystyle X=\partial _{1}} .

By linearity of the interior product, exterior derivative, and Lie derivative, it suffices to prove the Cartan's magic formula for monomial k {\displaystyle k} -forms. There are only two cases: Case 1: α α = a d ξ ξ 1 ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k {\displaystyle \alpha =a\,d\xi ^{1}\wedge d\xi ^{2}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k}} . Direct computation yields: ι ι X α α = a d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k , d ( ι ι X α α ) = ( ∂ ∂ 1 a ) d ξ ξ 1 ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k + ∑ ∑ i = k + 1 n ( ∂ ∂ i a ) d ξ ξ i ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k , d α α = ∑ ∑ i = k + 1 n ( ∂ ∂ i a ) d ξ ξ i ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ 1 ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k , ι ι X ( d α α ) = − − ∑ ∑ i = k + 1 n ( ∂ ∂ i a ) d ξ ξ i ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k , L X α α = ( ∂ ∂ 1 a ) d ξ ξ 1 ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\iota _{X}\alpha &=a\,d\xi ^{2}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k},\\d(\iota _{X}\alpha )&=(\partial _{1}a)\,d\xi ^{1}\wedge d\xi ^{2}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k}+\sum _{i=k+1}^{n}(\partial _{i}a)\,d\xi ^{i}\wedge d\xi ^{2}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k},\\d\alpha &=\sum _{i=k+1}^{n}(\partial _{i}a)\,d\xi ^{i}\wedge d\xi ^{1}\wedge d\xi ^{2}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k},\\\iota _{X}(d\alpha )&=-\sum _{i=k+1}^{n}(\partial _{i}a)\,d\xi ^{i}\wedge d\xi ^{2}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k},\\L_{X}\alpha &=(\partial _{1}a)\,d\xi ^{1}\wedge d\xi ^{2}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k}.\end{aligned}}} Case 2: α α = a d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ 3 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k + 1 {\displaystyle \alpha =a\,d\xi ^{2}\wedge d\xi ^{3}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k+1}} . Direct computation yields: ι ι X α α = 0 , d α α = ( ∂ ∂ 1 a ) d ξ ξ 1 ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k + 1 + ∑ ∑ i = k + 2 n ( ∂ ∂ i a ) d ξ ξ i ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k + 1 , ι ι X ( d α α ) = ( ∂ ∂ 1 a ) d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k + 1 , L X α α = ( ∂ ∂ 1 a ) d ξ ξ 2 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d ξ ξ k + 1 .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\iota _{X}\alpha &=0,\\d\alpha &=(\partial _{1}a)\,d\xi ^{1}\wedge d\xi ^{2}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k+1}+\sum _{i=k+2}^{n}(\partial _{i}a)\,d\xi ^{i}\wedge d\xi ^{2}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k+1},\\\iota _{X}(d\alpha )&=(\partial _{1}a)\,d\xi ^{2}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k+1},\\L_{X}\alpha &=(\partial _{1}a)\,d\xi ^{2}\wedge \dots \wedge d\xi ^{k+1}.\end{aligned}}} Proof by abstract algebra, credited to Shiing-Shen Chern [ 4 ] The exterior derivative d {\displaystyle d} is an anti-derivation on the exterior algebra. Similarly, the interior product ι ι X {\displaystyle \iota _{X}} with a vector field X {\displaystyle X} is also an anti-derivation. On the other hand, the Lie derivative L X {\displaystyle L_{X}} is a derivation.

The anti-commutator of two anti-derivations is a derivation.

To show that two derivations on the exterior algebra are equal, it suffices to show that they agree on a set of generators. Locally, the exterior algebra is generated by 0-forms (smooth functions f {\displaystyle f} ) and their differentials, exact 1-forms ( d f {\displaystyle df} ). Verify Cartan's magic formula on these two cases.
