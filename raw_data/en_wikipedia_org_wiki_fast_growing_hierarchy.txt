A primary example is the Wainer hierarchy , or Löb–Wainer hierarchy , which is an extension to all α < ε 0 .  Such hierarchies provide a natural way to classify computable functions according to rate-of-growth and computational complexity .

Definition [ edit ] Let μ be a large countable ordinal such that to every limit ordinal α < μ there is assigned a fundamental sequence (a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals whose supremum is α).  A fast-growing hierarchy of functions f α : N → N , for α < μ, is then defined as follows: f 0 ( n ) = n + 1 , {\displaystyle f_{0}(n)=n+1,} f α α + 1 ( n ) = f α α n ( n ) {\displaystyle f_{\alpha +1}(n)=f_{\alpha }^{n}(n)} f α α ( n ) = f α α [ n ] ( n ) {\displaystyle f_{\alpha }(n)=f_{\alpha [n]}(n)} if α is a limit ordinal.

Here f α n ( n ) = f α ( f α (...( f α ( n ))...)) denotes the n th iterate of f α applied to n , and α[ n ] denotes the n th element of the fundamental sequence assigned to the limit ordinal α.  (An alternative definition takes the number of iterations to be n +1, rather than n , in the second line above.) The initial part of this hierarchy, comprising the functions f α with finite index (i.e., α < ω), is often called the Grzegorczyk hierarchy because of its close relationship to the Grzegorczyk hierarchy ; note, however, that the former is here an indexed family of functions f n , whereas the latter is an indexed family of sets of functions E n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}^{n}} . (See Points of Interest below.) Generalizing the above definition even further, a fast iteration hierarchy is obtained by taking f 0 to be any non-decreasing function g: N → N .

For limit ordinals not greater than ε 0 , there is a straightforward natural definition of the fundamental sequences (see the Wainer hierarchy below), but beyond ε 0 the definition is much more complicated.  However, this is possible well beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal, Γ 0 , up to at least the Bachmann–Howard ordinal . Using Buchholz psi functions one can extend this definition easily to the ordinal of transfinitely iterated Π Π 1 1 {\displaystyle \Pi _{1}^{1}} -comprehension (see Analytical hierarchy ).

A fully specified extension beyond the recursive ordinals is thought to be unlikely; e.g., Prӧmel et al.

[1991](p. 348) note that in such an attempt "there would even arise problems in ordinal notation".

The Wainer hierarchy [ edit ] The Wainer hierarchy is the particular fast-growing hierarchy of functions f α (α ≤ ε 0 ) obtained by defining the fundamental sequences as follows [Gallier 1991][Prӧmel, et al., 1991]: For limit ordinals λ < ε 0 , written in Cantor normal form , if λ = ω α 1 + ... + ω α k−1 + ω α k for α 1 ≥ ... ≥ α k−1 ≥ α k , then λ[ n ] = ω α 1 + ... + ω α k−1 + ω α k [ n ], if λ = ω α+1 , then λ[ n ] = ω α n , if λ = ω α for a limit ordinal α, then λ[ n ] = ω α[ n ] , and if λ = ε 0 , take λ[0] = 0 and λ[ n + 1] = ω λ[ n ] as in [Gallier 1991]; alternatively, take the same sequence except starting with λ[0] = 1 as in [Prӧmel, et al., 1991].

For n > 0, the alternative version has one additional ω in the resulting exponential tower, i.e. λ[ n ] = ω ω ⋰ ω with n omegas.

Some authors use slightly different definitions (e.g., ω α+1 [ n ] = ω α ( n+1 ), instead of ω α n ), and some define this hierarchy only for α < ε 0 (thus excluding f ε 0 from the hierarchy).

To continue beyond ε 0 , see the Fundamental sequences for the Veblen hierarchy .

Points of interest [ edit ] Following are some relevant points of interest about fast-growing hierarchies: Every f α is a total function .  If the fundamental sequences are computable (e.g., as in the Wainer hierarchy), then every f α is a total computable function .

In the Wainer hierarchy, f α is dominated by f β if α < β. (For any two functions f , g : N → N , f is said to dominate g if f ( n ) > g ( n ) for all sufficiently large n .)  The same property holds in any fast-growing hierarchy with fundamental sequences satisfying the so-called Bachmann property . (This property holds for most natural well orderings.) [ clarification needed ] In the Grzegorczyk hierarchy, every primitive recursive function is dominated by some f α with α < ω.  Hence, in the Wainer hierarchy, every primitive recursive function is dominated by f ω , which is a variant of the Ackermann function .

For n ≥ 3, the set E n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}^{n}} in the Grzegorczyk hierarchy is composed of just those total multi-argument functions which, for sufficiently large arguments, are computable within time bounded by some fixed iterate f n -1 k evaluated at the maximum argument.

In the Wainer hierarchy, every f α with α < ε 0 is computable and provably total in Peano arithmetic .

Every computable function that is provably total in Peano arithmetic is dominated by some f α with α < ε 0 in the Wainer hierarchy.  Hence f ε 0 in the Wainer hierarchy is not provably total in Peano arithmetic.

The Goodstein function has approximately the same growth rate ( i.e.

each is dominated by some fixed iterate of the other) [ citation needed ] as f ε 0 in the Wainer hierarchy, dominating every f α for which α < ε 0 , and hence is not provably total in Peano Arithmetic.

In the Wainer hierarchy, if α < β < ε 0 , then f β dominates every computable function within time and space bounded by some fixed iterate f α k .

Friedman's TREE function dominates f Γ 0 in a fast-growing hierarchy described by Gallier (1991).

The Wainer hierarchy of functions f α and the Hardy hierarchy of functions h α are related by f α = h ω α for all α < ε 0 .  The Hardy hierarchy "catches up" to the Wainer hierarchy at α = ε 0 , such that f ε 0 and h ε 0 have the same growth rate, in the sense that f ε 0 ( n -1) ≤ h ε 0 ( n ) ≤ f ε 0 ( n +1) for all n ≥ 1. (Gallier 1991) Girard (1981) and Cichon & Wainer (1983) showed that the slow-growing hierarchy of functions g α attains the same growth rate as the function f ε 0 in the Wainer hierarchy when α is the Bachmann–Howard ordinal . Girard (1981) further showed that the slow-growing hierarchy g α attains the same growth rate  as f α (in a particular fast-growing hierarchy) when α is the ordinal of the theory ID <ω of arbitrary finite iterations of an inductive definition. (Wainer 1989) Functions in fast-growing hierarchies [ edit ] The functions at finite levels (α < ω) of any fast-growing hierarchy coincide with those of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy: (using hyperoperation ) f 0 ( n ) = n + 1 = 2[1] n − 1 f 1 ( n ) = f 0 n ( n ) = n + n = 2 n = 2[2] n f 2 ( n ) = f 1 n ( n ) = 2 n · n > 2 n = 2[3] n for n ≥ 2 f k +1 ( n ) = f k n ( n ) > (2[ k + 1]) n n ≥ 2[ k + 2] n for n ≥ 2, k < ω.

Beyond the finite levels are the functions of the Wainer hierarchy (ω ≤ α ≤ ε 0 ): f ω ( n ) = f n ( n ) > 2[ n + 1] n > 2[ n ]( n + 3) − 3 = A ( n , n ) for n ≥ 4, where A is the Ackermann function (of which f ω is a unary version).

f ω+1 ( n ) = f ω n ( n ) ≥ f n [ n + 2] n ( n ) for all n > 0, where n [ n + 2] n is the n th Ackermann number .

f ω+1 (64) = f ω 64 (64) > Graham's number (= g 64 in the sequence defined by g 0 = 4, g k +1 = 3[ g k + 2]3).  This follows by noting f ω ( n ) > 2[ n + 1] n > 3[ n ]3 + 2, and hence f ω ( g k + 2) > g k +1 + 2.

f ε 0 ( n ) is the first function in the Wainer hierarchy that dominates the Goodstein function .
