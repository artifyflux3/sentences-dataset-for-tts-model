Intuitively, a perfect measure μ is one for which, if we consider the pushforward measure on the real line R , then every measurable set is " μ -approximately a Borel set ".  The notion of perfectness is closely related to tightness of measures :  indeed, in metric spaces , tight measures are always perfect.

Definition [ edit ] A measure space ( X , Σ, μ ) is said to be perfect if, for every Σ-measurable function f : X → R and every A ⊆ R with f −1 ( A ) ∈ Σ, there exist Borel subsets A 1 and A 2 of R such that A 1 ⊆ ⊆ A ⊆ ⊆ A 2 and μ μ ( f − − 1 ( A 2 ∖ ∖ A 1 ) ) = 0.

{\displaystyle A_{1}\subseteq A\subseteq A_{2}{\mbox{ and }}\mu {\big (}f^{-1}(A_{2}\setminus A_{1}){\big )}=0.} Results concerning perfect measures [ edit ] If X is any metric space and μ is an inner regular (or tight ) measure on X , then ( X , B X , μ ) is a perfect measure space, where B X denotes the Borel σ -algebra on X .
