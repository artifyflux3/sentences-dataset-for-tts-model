Find sources: "Sides of an equation" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , LHS is informal shorthand for the left-hand side of an equation .  Similarly, RHS is the right-hand side . The two sides have the same value, expressed differently, since equality is symmetric .

[ 1 ] More generally, these terms may apply to an inequation or inequality ; the right-hand side is everything on the right side of a test operator in an expression , with LHS defined similarly.

Example [ edit ] The expression on the right side of the "=" sign is the right side of the equation and the expression on the left of the "=" is the left side of the equation.

For example, in x + 5 = y + 8 {\displaystyle x+5=y+8} x + 5 is the left-hand side (LHS) and y + 8 is the right-hand side (RHS).

Homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations [ edit ] In solving mathematical equations, particularly linear simultaneous equations , differential equations and integral equations , the terminology homogeneous is often used for equations with some linear operator L on the LHS and 0 on the RHS. In contrast, an equation with a non-zero RHS is called inhomogeneous or non-homogeneous , as exemplified by Lf = g , with g a fixed function, which equation is to be solved for f . Then any solution of the inhomogeneous equation may have a solution of the homogeneous equation added to it, and still remain a solution.

For example in mathematical physics , the homogeneous equation may correspond to a physical theory formulated in empty space , while the inhomogeneous equation asks for more 'realistic' solutions with some matter, or charged particles.

Syntax [ edit ] More abstractly, when using infix notation T * U the term T stands as the left-hand side and U as the right-hand side of the operator *. This usage is less common, though.
