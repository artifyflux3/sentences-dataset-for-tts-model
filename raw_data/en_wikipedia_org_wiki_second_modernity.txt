Where modernity broke down agricultural society in favour of industrial society , second modernity transforms industrial society into a new and more reflexive network society or information society.

[ 1 ] Risk society [ edit ] Main article: Risk society Second modernity is marked by a new awareness of the risks — risks to all forms of life, plant, animal and human — created by the very successes of modernity in tackling the problem of human scarcity.

[ 2 ] Systems that previously seemed to offer protection from risks both natural and social are increasingly recognised as producing new man-made risks on a global scale as a byproduct of their functioning.

[ 3 ] Such systems become part of the problem, not the solution. Modernisation and information advances themselves create new social dangers, such as cybercrime , [ 4 ] while scientific advances open up new areas, like cloning or genetic modification , where decisions are necessarily made without adequate capacity to assess longterm consequences.

[ 5 ] Recognising the fresh dilemmas created by this reflexive modernization , Beck has suggested a new "cosmopolitan Realpolitik" to overcome the difficulties of a world in which national interests can no longer be promoted effectively at the national level alone.

[ 6 ] Knowledge society [ edit ] Second modernity has also been linked [ clarification needed ] to the so-called knowledge society , marked by a pluralisation of different types of knowledge.

[ 7 ] It is characterised in particular by knowledge-dependent risks — the uncertainties manufactured by the information world itself.

[ 8 ] Resistance [ edit ] Various forms of resistance to second modernity have emerged, among them, for example, Euroscepticism .

[ 9 ] Beck sees al-Qaeda as a by-product of, as well as resistance to, second modernity, not only in its use of information-technology tools, but also in its syncretist ideology.
