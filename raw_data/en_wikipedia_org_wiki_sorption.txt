Blue spheres are solute molecules.

Sorption is a physical and chemical process by which one substance becomes attached to another. Specific cases of sorption are treated in the following articles: Absorption "the incorporation of a substance in one state into another of a different state" [ 1 ] (e.g., liquids being absorbed by a solid or gases being absorbed by a liquid); Adsorption The physical adherence or bonding of ions and molecules onto the surface of another phase (e.g., reagents adsorbed to a solid catalyst surface); Ion exchange An exchange of ions between two electrolytes or between an electrolyte solution and a complex .

The reverse of sorption is desorption .

Sorption rate [ edit ] The adsorption and absorption rate of a diluted solute in gas or liquid solution to a surface or interface can be calculated using Fick's laws of diffusion .
