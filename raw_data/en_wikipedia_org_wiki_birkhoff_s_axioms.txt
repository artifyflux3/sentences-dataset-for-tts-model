D. Birkhoff created a set of four postulates of Euclidean geometry in the plane, sometimes referred to as Birkhoff's axioms .

[ 1 ] These postulates are all based on basic geometry that can be confirmed experimentally with a scale and protractor . Since the postulates build upon the real numbers , the approach is similar to a model -based introduction to Euclidean geometry.

Birkhoff's axiomatic system was utilized in the secondary-school textbook by Birkhoff and Beatley.

[ 2 ] These axioms were also modified by the School Mathematics Study Group to provide a new standard for teaching high school geometry, known as SMSG axioms .
A few  other textbooks in the foundations of geometry use variants of Birkhoff's axioms.

[ 3 ] Birkhoff's four postulates [ edit ] The distance between two points A and B is denoted by d ( A, B ) , and the angle formed by three points A , B , C is denoted by ∠ ABC .

Postulate I: Postulate of line measure .  
The set of points { A , B , ...} on any line can  be put into a 1:1 correspondence with the real numbers { a , b , ...} so that | b − a | = d ( A, B ) for all points A and B .

Postulate II: Point-line postulate .  
There is one and only one line ℓ that contains any two given distinct points P and Q .

Postulate III: Postulate of angle measure .  
The set of rays { ℓ, m, n , ...} through any point O can be put into 1:1 correspondence with the real numbers a (mod 2 π ) so that if A and B are points (not equal to O ) of ℓ and m , respectively, the difference a m − a ℓ (mod 2π) of the numbers associated with the lines ℓ and m is ∠ AOB . Furthermore, if the point B on m varies continuously in a line r not containing the vertex O , the number a m varies continuously also.

Postulate IV: Postulate of similarity .  
Given two triangles ABC and A'B'C' and some constant k > 0 such that d ( A', B' ) = kd ( A, B ), d ( A', C' ) = kd ( A, C ) and ∠ B'A'C' = ±∠ BAC , then d ( B', C' ) = kd ( B, C ), ∠ C'B'A' = ±∠ CBA , and ∠ A'C'B' = ±∠ ACB .
