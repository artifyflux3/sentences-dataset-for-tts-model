Various mobile devices described as handheld PCs, clockwise from top-left: Sony Vaio UX Micro PC (ultra-mobile PC), Philips Velo (Handheld PC), GPD Win 2 (handheld gaming PC), HP 200LX (Palmtop PC) A handheld computer , also called a palmtop computer , is a term that has variously been used to describe a small-sized personal computer (PC) typically built around a clamshell form factor and a laptop -like keyboard , including: Palmtop PCs , personal digital assistants (PDA), ultra-mobile PCs (UMPC) or portable gaming PCs . The brand Handheld PC specifically is a now-defunct class of computers introduced in the 1990s that was marketed by Microsoft , and is detailed below.

History and definitions [ edit ] See also: Palmtop PC and Subnotebook Atari Portfolio (1989) Toshiba Libretto 50CT (c. 1996), these subnotebooks have also been called a "palmtop" or "handheld" due to its size The term has varying uses and has been intermixed with other terms.

[ 1 ] The first "hand-held" device compatible with desktop IBM personal computers of the time was the Atari Portfolio of 1989; such devices were often called " Palmtop PCs " at the time, as they were IBM PC–compatibles that could fit in the palm of a human hand . Other early models were the Poqet PC of 1989 and the Hewlett Packard HP 95LX of 1991 which run the MS-DOS operating system.

[ 2 ] Other DOS-compatible hand-held computers also existed. The popular definition of "handheld PC" eventually became a device bigger than a personal digital assistant (PDA) and with the addition of a keyboard that folds in half (making it more similar to a laptop rather than for example a cell phone ) with both PDAs and handheld PCs considered under the umbrella "palmtop computer".

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] An Asus ROG Ally handheld gaming PC (2023) has been referred to as a "handheld gaming PC" despite not having a keyboard After 2000, the handheld PC segment practically halted, replaced by other forms and continuing only as a niche, although later communicators such as Nokia E90 or Toshiba Portégé G910 [ 5 ] can be considered to be of the same class. On the other hand, ultra-compact laptops capable of running common x86 -compatible desktop operating systems have been typically classified as subnotebooks . Microsoft's ultra-mobile PC brought x86-based Windows — typically the modern definition of 'PC' — to palm sized mobile devices for the first time and these have also been referred to as handheld PCs.

[ 6 ] The Steam Deck has rekindled interest in "handheld" PCs since 2021, specifically for gaming, designed with a gamepad integrated for video games although it does not have a keyboard. Other modern examples include handheld devices aimed at hobbyists, such as devices by GamePad Digital including the GPD Win , and the uConsole by ClockworkPi.

2003 Operating system Windows CE Related Pocket PC The Handheld PC ( H/PC ) is a class of portable computers running Windows CE created and marketed by Microsoft . Introduced in 1996, the intent of Windows CE was to provide an environment for applications compatible with the Microsoft Windows operating system, on processors better suited to low-power operation in a portable device. These devices could run on the SH-3 , MIPS , and later ARM processor architectures.

[ 7 ] It provides the appointment calendar functions usual for any PDA. Microsoft was wary of using the term "PDA" for the Handheld PC. Instead, Microsoft marketed this type of device as a "PC companion".

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Its main competitor in the field was Psion with their Series 3 and Series 5 .

Specifications [ edit ] An NEC Handheld PC running Windows CE 1.0 To be classed as a Windows CE Handheld PC, the device must: [ 10 ] Run Microsoft's Windows CE Be bundled with an application suite only found through an OEM Platform Release and not in Windows CE itself Use ROM Have a screen supporting a resolution of at least 480×240 Include a keyboard (except tablet models) Include a PC card slot Include an infrared (IrDA) port Provide wired serial and/or Universal Serial Bus (USB) connectivity Devices [ edit ] Sharp Mobilon PRO PV5000A, Handheld PC running Windows CE 2.11 released in 1998 HP 's first displays' widths were more than a third larger than that of Microsoft's specification. Soon, all of their competition followed. Examples of Handheld PC devices are the NEC MobilePro 900c , HP 320LX , Sharp Telios, HP Jornada 720 , IBM WorkPad Z50 , and Vadem Clio .

[ 11 ] Also included are tablet computers like the Fujitsu PenCentra 130, and even communicators like the late Samsung NEXiO S150.

Versions [ edit ] The second generation of Handheld PCs were based on Windows CE 2.0. Improvements include color 640 x 240 resolution displays (the first generation devices only supported 480 x 240), taskbar customization, printer support, and the addition of Pocket PowerPoint to the Pocket Office suite.

[ 12 ] In October 1998, Handheld PC Professional based on Windows CE 2.11 was released with many enhancements under the hood, as well as full VGA display resolution.

[ 13 ] New hardware resembling subnotebooks were released on the market using this version.

[ 14 ] In September 2000, the updated Handheld PC 2000 was announced which is based on version 3.0 of Windows CE.

[ 15 ] [ 4 ] Handheld PC version history [ 16 ] Handheld PC version Windows CE version Other platforms Handheld PC 1.0 — 2.0 Palm-size PC 1.0, Auto PC 1.0 Handheld PC Professional 2.11 Palm-size PC 1.1 / 1.2 Handheld PC 2000 3.0 Pocket PC 2000 , Pocket PC 2002 , Smartphone 2002 Reception [ edit ] Handheld PC failed to be a success, being not so competitive against Palm 's smaller and lighter keyboard-less Palm PDAs as well against subnotebook computers that were quickly dropping in price. The second version of the CE software failed to improve the situation.

[ 4 ] In October 1999, Philips announced that it will stop producing their Velo Handheld PC and stop using Windows CE entirely due to low sales.

[ 17 ] After 2000, with Microsoft attempting again with Handheld PC 2000, interest in the form factor overall quickly evaporated, and by early 2002 Microsoft were no longer working on Handheld PC, with its distinct functionality removed from version 4.0 of Windows CE.

[ 9 ] HP and Sharp both discontinued their Windows CE H/PCs in 2002, [ 18 ] while NEC was last to leave the market.

[ citation needed ] At the same time, notebook computers had become increasingly slimmer and portable, and the Handheld PC was increasingly limited by its Windows CE software in comparison.

[ 19 ] Due to limited success of Handheld PC, Microsoft focused more on the keyboard-less and smaller Pocket PC , which would run what would later be known as Windows Mobile .
