For the components of the Periodic Table, see Chemical element .

In mathematics , an element (or member ) of a set is any one of the distinct objects that belong to that set. For example, given a set called A containing the first four positive integers ( A = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } {\displaystyle A=\{1,2,3,4\}} ), one could say that "3 is an element of A ", expressed notationally as 3 ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle 3\in A} .

Sets [ edit ] Writing A = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } {\displaystyle A=\{1,2,3,4\}} means that the elements of the set A are the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Sets of elements of A , for example { 1 , 2 } {\displaystyle \{1,2\}} , are subsets of A .

Sets can themselves be elements. For example, consider the set B = { 1 , 2 , { 3 , 4 } } {\displaystyle B=\{1,2,\{3,4\}\}} . The elements of B are not 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Rather, there are only three elements of B , namely the numbers 1 and 2, and the set { 3 , 4 } {\displaystyle \{3,4\}} .

The elements of a set can be anything. For example the elements of the set C = { r e d , 12 , B } {\displaystyle C=\{\mathrm {\color {Red}red} ,\mathrm {12} ,B\}} are the color red, the number 12, and the set B .

In logic, a set can be defined in terms of the membership of its elements as ( x ∈ ∈ y ) ↔ ↔ ∀ ∀ x [ P x = y ] : x ∈ ∈ D y {\displaystyle (x\in y)\leftrightarrow \forall x[P_{x}=y]:x\in {\mathfrak {D}}y} .  This basically means that there is a general predication of x called membership that is equivalent to the statement ‘x is a member of y if and only if, for all objects x, the general predication of x is identical to y, where x is a member of the domain of y.’  The expression x ∈ 𝔇y makes this definition well-defined by ensuring that x is a bound variable in its predication of membership in y.

In this case, the domain of Px, which is the set containing all dependent logical values x that satisfy the stated conditions for membership in y, is called the Universe (U) of y.  The range of Px, which is the set of all possible dependent set variables y resulting from satisfaction of the conditions of membership for x, is the power set of U such that the binary relation of the membership of x in y is any subset of the cartesian product U × 𝒫(U) (the Cartesian Product of set U with the Power Set of U).

Notation and terminology [ edit ] The binary relation "is an element of", also called set membership , is denoted by the symbol "∈". Writing x ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle x\in A} means that " x is an element of A ".

[ 1 ] Equivalent expressions are " x is a member of A ", " x belongs to A ", " x is in A " and " x lies in A ". The expressions " A includes x " and " A contains x " are also used to mean set membership, although some authors use them to mean instead " x is a subset of A ".

[ 2 ] Logician George Boolos strongly urged that "contains" be used for membership only, and "includes" for the subset relation only.

[ 3 ] For the relation ∈ , the converse relation ∈ T may be written A ∋ ∋ x {\displaystyle A\ni x} meaning " A contains or includes x ".

The negation of set membership is denoted by the symbol "∉". Writing x ∉ ∉ A {\displaystyle x\notin A} means that " x is not an element of A ".

The symbol ∈ was first used by Giuseppe Peano , in his 1889 work Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita .

[ 4 ] Here he wrote on page X: Signum ∈ significat est. Ita a ∈ b legitur a est quoddam b; … which means The symbol ∈ means is . So a ∈ b is read as a is a certain b; … The symbol itself is a stylized lowercase Greek letter epsilon ("ϵ"), the first letter of the word ἐστί , which means "is".

[ 5 ] In the above examples, the cardinality of the set A is 4, while the cardinality of set B and set C are both 3. An infinite set is a set with an infinite number of elements, while a finite set is a set with a finite number of elements. The above examples are examples of finite sets. An example of an infinite set is the set of positive integers {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} .

Formal relation [ edit ] As a relation , set membership must have a domain and a range. Conventionally the domain is called the universe denoted U . The range is the set of subsets of U called the power set of U and denoted P( U ). Thus the relation ∈ ∈ {\displaystyle \in } is a subset of U × P( U ) . The converse relation ∋ ∋ {\displaystyle \ni } is a subset of P( U ) × U .
