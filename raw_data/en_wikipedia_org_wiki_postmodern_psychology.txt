It challenges the modernist view of psychology as the science of the individual, [ 1 ] in favour of seeing humans as a cultural/communal product, dominated by language rather than by an inner self.

[ 2 ] Characteristics [ edit ] Postmodern psychology relies on using a range of different methodologies rather than a singular approach, to embrace the complexity of reality and avoid oversimplification .  Post-modernism challenges a systematic, analytical approach to the understanding of the human psyche, as inherently flawed by the impossibility of taking a detached, 'objective' position; and favours instead a transmutable position which may maintain the possibility of taking conceptual hold of a self that is itself decentered.

[ 3 ] Some would maintain that the very project of a postmodern psychology is self-contradictory, [ 4 ] in the wake of the deconstruction of the unified self [ 5 ] - the fading or aphanisis of the subject that psychology is traditionally supposed to investigate.

[ 6 ] Tetrad and transmodern [ edit ] Postmodern psychology has also been linked to the Tetrad of Marshall McLuhan : [ 7 ] "Tetradic logic" supposedly allowing us to accept knowing without knowing in the context of changingness.

Paul Vitz refers to yet a further development, that of "transmodern" psychology , as a "new mentality that both transcends and transforms modernity ... (where) psychology would be the handmaid of philosophy and theology , as from the beginning it was meant to be" [ 8 ] - aspiring to cure mental problems through integrated intervention into the human mind and body combined.
