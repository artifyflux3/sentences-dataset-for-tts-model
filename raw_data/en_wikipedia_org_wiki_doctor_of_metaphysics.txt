While mainstream universities teach metaphysics as a branch of philosophy, [ 1 ] the Doctor of Metaphysics degree is offered by a number of unaccredited universities and degree mills as a religious-based degree. It is not recognized by the United States Department of Education as a legitimate degree, and is not offered by any accredited institution.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In the United States, Doctor of Metaphysics degrees are offered by purported religious institutions of learning, as well as unrecognised churches and colleges of metaphysics.

[ 6 ] In 1938 the United States Department of the Interior published a book listing the "Doctor of Metaphysics" degree in a section written by Walton C. John, titled "Counterfeit Degrees".

[ 7 ] A 1960 American Psychologist article titled, "Mail-order training in psychotherapy," warned against unaccredited schools purporting to offer "training in a variety of psychological and metapsychological methods" and awarding a Doctor of Metaphysics degree.

[ 2 ] In the field of social work there are counselors who claim the title "Doctor of Metaphysics". In 2019, the Journal of Social Work Education published "Predatory Doctoral Programs: Warnings for Social Workers". The article warned that the majority of doctoral programs in metaphysics are little more than diploma mills which have few requirements other than payments.

One school… grants a PhD after as little as 18-months study with no previous college education… . Corrective action has been made difficult because of the geographical scattering of the schools and the consequently minor problem that they represent to most individual states.
