It was established in 1964 after the amalgamation of Ontario Agricultural College (1874), the MacDonald Institute (1903), and the Ontario Veterinary College (1922), and has since grown to an institution of almost 30,000 students (including those at the Humber campus, Ridgetown campus, off-campus degree enrolments, diploma enrolments and part-time students) and employs 830 full-time faculty (academic staff) as of fall 2019.

[ 6 ] It offers 94 undergraduate degrees, 48 graduate programs, and 6 associate degrees in many different disciplines.

The university conducts a significant degree of research and offers a wide range of undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees. According to the Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research , the university's Hospitality and Tourism Management program has Canada's highest research index.

The faculty at the University of Guelph hold 23 Canada Research Chair positions in the research areas of natural sciences, engineering, health sciences and social sciences.

[ 7 ] Academic achievements include the first scientific validation of water on Mars , Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on board the Curiosity rover , [ 8 ] and the Barcode of Life project for species identification.

History [ edit ] The University of Guelph traces its origins back to when the Ontario government bought 200 hectares (500 acres) of farmland from Frederick William Stone and opened the Ontario School of Agriculture on May 1, 1874, which was renamed the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC) in 1880.

[ 9 ] The Experimental Farm has been part of the original project along with the museum of agriculture and horticulture.

[ 10 ] Its first building was Moreton Lodge, located where Johnston Hall now stands, which included classrooms, residences, a library, and a dining room.  In 1874, the school started an apiculture department, teaching students about bees and beekeeping, in a dedicated building. In more recent years, the program has continued at the Honey Bee Research Centre located in the Arboretum, continuing research on honeybee health, providing apiculture and beekeeping courses and offering "many other educational experiences" including informative videos for beekeepers.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The Ontario Agricultural College and Experimental Farm, Guelph, Canada, 1889 The Macdonald Institute was established in 1903 to house women's home economics programs, nature studies, and some domestic art and science.

[ 9 ] [ 13 ] It was named after its financier, Sir William Macdonald , who worked to promote domestic sciences in rural Canada, and founded Macdonald College and McGill University College of British Columbia . The Ontario Veterinary College (OVC), founded in Mimico in 1862, was moved to Guelph in 1922.

[ 14 ] Economist John Kenneth Galbraith was an undergraduate at the college (graduating in 1931). In 1919 the Ontario Agricultural College aimed at recruiting "farm boys" with a low cost, two-year program ($20.00 per year) and "the lowest possible rate" for room and board.

[ 15 ] This is ad for "farm boys" from the Ontario Agricultural College in 1919 recruiting them by talking about the low cost tuition The Ontario Legislature amalgamated the three colleges into the single body of the University of Guelph on May 8, 1964. The University of Guelph Act [ 16 ] also brought about the Board of Governors to oversee administrative operations and financial management, and the Senate to address academic concerns. The non-denominational graduate and undergraduate institution was, and remains known especially for the agricultural and veterinary programs that shaped it.

[ 13 ] Wellington College was established shortly after the University of Guelph Act, and five years later, was split three ways into the College of Arts (COA), which exists in the present day, the College of Physical Science and the College of Social Science. The Macdonald Institute would also be renamed the College of Family and Consumer Studies during the split.

[ 9 ] After this split, the University of Guelph started reorganizing into its present-day form, starting from the establishment of the College of Biological Sciences (CBS) in 1971. The College of Physical Science would be married to the OAC's School of Engineering in 1989, creating the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS). The College of Social Science and the College of Family and Consumer Studies were joined to create the College of Social and Applied Human Sciences (CSAHS) in 1998. Finally, the College of Management and Economics (CME) would be established from the segregation of offered business, management and economic degrees and courses in 2006.

[ 9 ] The university is named after the city. Guelph comes from the Italian Guelfo and the Bavarian-Germanic Welf also known as Guelf. It is a reference to the reigning British monarch at the time Guelph was founded, King George IV , whose family was from the House of Hanover , a younger branch of the House of Welf was sometimes spelled as Gwelf.

[ 14 ] At one time, courses were offered in English in Guelph, Kemptville and Ridgetown, and in French at Campus d'Alfred near Ottawa. From 1889 to 1961, this college published the OAC Review, a magazine published by and for students, with topics on everything from political and social events to photographs from around campus.

[ 22 ] In 2014, the University of Guelph announced that academic programmes at the Alfred and Kemptville campuses would close after the existing students completed their studies.

[ 23 ] In early 2017, the University of Guelph web site clearly indicated that this institution was no longer offering programs at either location.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] The OAC does operate in Guelph and at the campus in Ridgetown, Ontario at the former Ridgetown College of Agricultural Technology, on over 180 hectares (450 acres). It does not offer degree programs in this location. Instead, the focus is on technology transfer, with two and three year diploma programs. Specialties are agriculture, veterinary technology, environmental management and horticulture. This location also offers one-year certificate programs in performance horse handling and veterinary office administration. There is also an apprenticeship program for Dairy Herdsperson (new for 2017).

Its goal is to strengthen Canada's ability to prevent diseases and solve health issues at the human/animal interface. Supporting the growing role of veterinarians in research and educational initiatives related to public health, this four-storey building includes a lecture theatre, seminar rooms, a teaching lab, and research and laboratory facilities.

[ 35 ] Day Hall, built in 1895 Originally built in the 1940s and expanded in the 1950s, the W.F. Mitchell Athletic Centre was upgraded and expanded to keep up with university and community's needs in the fall of 2016. After a student referendum in 2010, students choose to contribute $45 million to the innovation of the W.F Mitchell Athletic Centre. One of the major focuses on the new building was being able to accommodate the growth in Guelph's population since the 1950s. The new 170,000-square-foot Athletic Centre serves as an all purpose building, supporting students, athletes, and the public in a variety of new spaces such as a 22,000-square-foot fitness room, multiple gymnasiums, and a rock-climbing wall.

[ 62 ] Student life [ edit ] Demographics of student body (2014–15) [ 63 ] Undergraduate Graduate Male 40.1% 43.3% Female 59.9% 56.7% Canadian student 97% 85.4% International student 3% 14.6% Student government on campus is governed officially through the university's Student Organization Policy. This document, created in 2005, provides the basis for accrediting student groups on campus. The student groups listed as Primary Student Organizations under the policy are: The Central Student Association (CSA) The Graduate Students' Association (GSA) The College of Arts Student Union (CA-SU) The College of Biological Science Student Council (CBS-SC) The Gordon S. Lang School of Business and Economics Students' Association (Lang-SA) The College of Engineering & Physical Science Student Council (CEPSSC) The College of Social & Applied Human Sciences Student Alliance (CSAHS-SA) The Student Federation of the Ontario Agricultural College (SF-OAC) The Central Veterinary Students' Association (CVSA) Interhall Council (IHC) Each of the above PSOs accredit and thus are held accountable for many of the various clubs and student groups on campus. The CSA accredits the most student groups, with approximately 70 accredited today. Generally CSA-accredited groups are special interest groups like CHAT (a multi-lingual group), the Jewish Students' Organization (JSO), or the Muslim Students' Association (MSA), catering to those who wish to begin new interest-specific clubs on campus. The College Governments (CASU, CBSSC, LSA, CEPSSC, CSAHS-SA, SFOAC and the CVSA) accredit academically focused groups while IHC accredits 14 groups (includes the temporary residence Gordon Hall for 2022-2027) as hall councils, one for each residence hall on campus.

Across campus, members of the Residence Student Government, known as Interhall Council , contribute to the programming in each hall. This group of 62 elected members works with students within their halls and are also responsible for facilitating a hall council for hall members to attend. During the 2011/2012 year, a council was stricken at the West Residence Family Housing units and the temporary Brock House residence, bringing the total number of councils to 14. Interhall Council also acts as a liaison between students and Student Housing Services, University Administration, and other on-campus organizations.

Organization [ edit ] The governance of the University of Guelph is a bicameral system consisting of the Senate and the Board of Governors. Senate consists of faculty, students, administrative staff, librarians, and alumni. It is responsible for academic policies and programming, including admission requirements, program creation/modification/deletion, examinations, and academic misconduct.

[ 64 ] The Board of Governors consists of a combination of government-appointed representatives, faculty, staff, alumni, and students. It is responsible for the general business and administration of the University, including finance, capital planning, human resources and ancillary services.

[ 65 ] Athletics [ edit ] Main article: Guelph Gryphons The university is represented in the Ontario University Athletics and the Canadian Interuniversity Sport by the Guelph Gryphons . The school colors are red, black and yellow or gold. UofG's mascot is a Gryphon named Gryph. The university offers 15 varsity sports for men and 15 for women. OUA only sports include baseball (men), figure skating (men & women), golf , Nordic skiing , rowing , and rugby union (men). Currently 7 out of every 10 Guelph students participate in athletics, recreation or fitness programming.

Nationally, the OUA is one of the CIS conferences, along with Atlantic University Sport , Canada West Universities Athletic Association , and the Quebec Student Sports Federation . CIS sports which UG participates in include basketball , cross country running , field hockey (women), Canadian football (men), ice hockey , rugby union (women), soccer , swimming , track & field , volleyball and wrestling .

The Gryphon's men's football team won its only national championship in 1984. In 2008 the Gryphon's men's lacrosse team won the Baggataway Cup at the Canadian national field lacrosse champions with a 14–9 win over McGill University at Ron Joyce Stadium in Hamilton. The Gryphons are particularly well known for their exploits in athletics, having won the men's and women's cross-country titles consecutively ten (2006–2014) and eleven (2005–2016) times respectively.

[ 66 ] The field hockey team won the national title in 2011.

[ 67 ] In 2020, the university track-and-field head coach David Scott-Thomas was given a lifetime ban by Athletics Canada for violating its code of conduct.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] The Globe and Mail reported that Scott-Thomas had an alleged sexual relationship with an underage student athlete dating back to 2002-2004 (of consenting age, but unlawful with a person in a position of trust or authority) and he was also accused by multiple students of having fostered a toxic sporting culture for many years.

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] The university faced heavy criticism over its handling of the scandal when the reporting revealed that the administration had been aware of the allegations since 2006, but did little to address them and continued to employ the coach.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] It was reported that the university quietly ended its relationship with Scott-Thomas and assistant coach Guyson Kuruneri in December 2019 after The Globe and Mail presented the university with the allegations against both Scott-Thomas and the administration's handling of the 2006 and more recent complaints, and requested an interview with the school administrators.

[ 70 ] [ 74 ] More than 200 faculty and staff wrote a letter to the university president demanding transparency and an independent review. In the letter, they categorized the content of The Globe and Mail report as "evidence of the worst kind of abuse of power" and indicated that "high-level administrators at the time may have participated in willfully ignoring and minimizing this abuse." [ 74 ] [ 75 ] In 2021, a group of alumni from the university track and field program wrote an open letter expressing concerns that "the systems that enabled the health and well-being of many athletes to be harmed by individuals in positions of power are still in place," and urging the university "to undertake an independent, comprehensive, and transparent investigation to determine how its existing policies failed to protect student-athletes from an abusive environment." [ 76 ] . The University eventually agreed to engage with these alumni in a restorative justice process, which concluded in 2025.

[ 77 ] Campus traditions [ edit ] Painting Old Jeremiah [ edit ] Old Jeremiah is the name of an antique British naval gun that rests along Winegard Walk in Branion Plaza, at the heart of the University of Guelph campus. Rumoured to have seen battle during the War of 1812 , Old Jeremiah was last fired in April 1913. After World War I , the gun's barrel was plugged and it was brought to campus by students as a sign of remembrance for those lost in battle. It is often referred to simply and affectionately as The Cannon . During the 1970s, Old Jeremiah was briefly relocated to Johnston Green and renamed the Big Johnston.

As a result of jovial rivalry between Engineering and Agricultural Science students ("Aggies"), the cannon has enjoyed plenty of movement around the Guelph campus in the past as a result of practical jokes between the two majors. Although it is nearly impossible to determine the cannon's previous locations, it is rumoured to have traveled all over campus, at one point even perching on top of MacNaughton (a prominent university building containing the bookstore), and at another even disappearing altogether and showing up a day later on the University of Western Ontario campus. Eventually, fed up with the movement of Old Jeremiah, university officials cemented the cannon in place where it sits today. However, as a final stab at humour, a group of students shifted the still-mobile direction of the cannon's face, and aimed it at the fourth floor of the University Center, home of the institution's senior administration. Old Jeremiah rests in this position today. Due it appearing at University of Western Ontario ("Western") this started a long rivalry between the 2 universities.

Despite its movement, the cannon enjoyed relative tranquility until the 1950s when an aspiring entrepreneurial student came up with the idea of painting a message on the highly visible landmark. The act of "painting the cannon" has since become a campus tradition with students, residences, sports teams, clubs and others braving the early morning hours to paint messages on the cannon, most often about upcoming events but also including birthday announcements, wedding proposals and insults. The etiquette governing "painting the cannon" is unofficial but well understood: 1) do not begin painting the cannon until the sun has set, 2) be finished by the time the first students arrive for classes in the morning, and 3) avoid profanity or coarse language. It is a well-accepted practice to "guard" the cannon until sunrise so as to avoid another person or group painting over one's message.

[ 78 ] In fall 2010, Master of Fine Arts student and art teacher Dawn Johnston began to strip Old Jeremiah of all the layers of paint it had accumulated since the 1950s as an art project. Calling it "[her] form of sculpture", Johnston completed the project over a week's time within a wooden enclosure to avoid the watchful eyes of passing students. Some students were upset about the removal, claiming Johnston was "taking away [their] history", although the project was done with the approval of university faculty. Upon completion, the enclosure was removed and the bare cannon was revealed; however, the tradition of painting Old Jeremiah has since resumed.

[ 79 ] Old Jeremiah - painted by the European Studies students at the University of Guelph The Pep Rally [ edit ] During the University of Guelph's orientation program, which takes place each year at the beginning of Orientation Week, all new students within each residence are taught a dance–often referred to as the Hall Boogie–which is performed to a variety of mixed popular songs. Awards are presented to the Halls which demonstrate the best spirit, creativity, synchronisation and co-ordination. Many of the dances are very impressive, despite being practised in typically an hour or less.

A University of Guelph dance move, Winding Your Toy, is almost always incorporated into each boogie, usually to a bass-heavy dance track. A winding motion is made with the rear hand–as if winding a wind-up toy–while the knees are bent in rhythm. The origins of "winding the toy" are not well known, yet it retains notoriety among students and friends of students at the university.

A team of Aggies during tug-of-war at College Royal in 2010 The Rally is the kick-off to the remainder of orientation activities. The University of Guelph must apply for a special noise permit for the event as the activity can often be heard for miles.

In 2004, "Student Power" was introduced as a low-key alternative event to the Pep Rally for anyone who may not be as inclined to participate in the highly energetic and boisterous Pep Rally.

During the renovation the location the Pep Rally is held (The School's football field) in 2012, an event named "Rally for Change" was held in place; in which hundreds of University of Guelph students went out into the local community and did street performances to raise money for Cancer research. The Pep Rally was held on a later date. This event has since also become a tradition with plans for it to also be incorporated in the orientation program in 2013.

College Royal [ edit ] An annual feature of the university is its open house, known as College Royal. For a weekend each March, every part of the campus and its programs is exhibited to the public, from the barns of the Agricultural College to the sugar bush in the arboretum. It is highly popular with visitors of all ages, especially families with children who take advantage of the March break (the usual Ontario school break) to have an outing.

The 2006 College Royal was visited by Rick Mercer , taping a segment for his show, the Rick Mercer Report .

Student media [ edit ] Newspapers and magazines The Ontarion – since 1951 and publishes every Thursday The Peak [ 80 ] Hornblower: The HTM Magazine – since 1973, official publication of the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management [ 81 ] At Guelph – university's official newspaper The Portico – magazine sent to alumni each semester to keep them in touch with the university Osnap – monthly humour publication put out by the engineering society covering events Radio CFRU-FM is a community campus station serving the students and community of Guelph.

Former student media The Cannon [ 82 ] – Originally launched in 2002 as a student media website co-founded by the Guelph Campus Co-op and the Central Student Association (CSA), The Cannon featured student-submitted articles, event listings, and opinion pieces. It has since shifted away from student journalism and now primarily operates as a classifieds platform for students to buy and sell housing, textbooks, and other items. The site’s name references Old Jeremiah, a cannon on campus that has traditionally served as a public message board.
