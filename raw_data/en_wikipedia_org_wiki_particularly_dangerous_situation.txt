In weather forecasting in the United States , " particularly dangerous situation " ( PDS ) is the wording used by the National Weather Service and the Storm Prediction Center to convey special urgency in watch or warning messages for unusually extreme and life-threatening severe weather . It is used in the format "This is a particularly dangerous situation..." at the discretion of the issuing forecaster. A watch or warning bearing the phrase is referred to as a PDS watch or PDS warning .

First used by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), a national guidance center of the National Weather Service , for tornado watches , the phrase was later applied to other severe weather watches and warnings by the agency's regional forecast offices. It is most commonly used for major tornado outbreaks or long-lived, extreme derecho events, and has been used for non-convective weather hazards such as exceptional flash flooding , or a wildfire .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] PDS watches and warnings are uncommon. From 1996 to 2005, the SPC issued an average of 24 per year, less than 3% of all watches.

[ 3 ] When a PDS watch is issued, there are often more PDS watches issued for the same weather system, even on the same day during major outbreaks, so the number of days per year that a PDS watch is issued is significantly lower.

Background [ edit ] This section relies largely or entirely upon a single source .

Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page . Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources at this section.

( August 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) During the winter of 1981–82, the Severe Local Storms (SELS) unit switched to a more flexible method of issuing weather products. Ed Ferguson, Deputy Director of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC), suggested to Lead Forecaster Jack Hales that the guidance center could give more resolution to the tornado watch product. Hales suggested the PDS option to identify areas where, a few times each year, conditions are most likely to aid in the development of large and intense tornadoes. The first PDS tornado watch was issued by Robert H. Johns for the April 2, 1982 tornado outbreak across the southern and central Great Plains .

[ 4 ] While historically applied only to severe thunderstorm, tornado and flash flood watches (i.e., severe local storm "polygonal" events), PDS wording could theoretically be applied to other types of weather watches (such as winter storm , high wind , hurricane , or fire weather watches) when an enhanced threat for such conditions exists. These watches have generally (but not always) been issued during a high risk or an upper-end moderate risk either of severe storms from the SPC's convective outlooks or of flash flooding from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC)'s excessive rainfall outlooks.

On April 24, 2011, the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Memphis, Tennessee , issued the first PDS flash flood watch to highlight the threat for widespread, significant and potentially life-threatening flash flooding due to repeated rounds of severe thunderstorms.

On December 19, 2017, and August 3, 2018, the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Reno , Nevada , issued PDS red flag warnings to highlight the threat for potentially life-threatening fire danger due to strong gusty winds and low humidity.

Issuance [ edit ] PDS flash flood watch [ edit ] PDS flash flood watches were issued when there is a higher-than-normal risk of widespread, life-threatening flash flooding . These watches are issued by local NWS Weather Forecast Offices, not the Storm Prediction Center. This would eventually go onto be replaced by  the flood watch in 2021.

Below is the first PDS flash flood watch, which was issued by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Memphis, Tennessee , on April 24, 2011, as mentioned above.

 BORGHOFF PDS flash flood warning [ edit ] PDS flash flood warnings are issued when there is a higher than normal risk of widespread, life-threatening flash flooding . Like PDS flash flood watches, they are issued by the local NWS Weather Forecast Offices, rather than the Storm Prediction Center. Recently, they have been issued as PDS flash flood emergencies , most notably by the National Weather Service offices in Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas.

This strongly-worded flash flood emergency was issued on September 27, 2024, by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Greenville – Spartanburg , South Carolina , in response to devastating flooding in western North Carolina caused by Hurricane Helene .

Flash Flood Warning
National Weather Service Greenville-Spartanburg SC
723 PM EDT Fri Sep 27 2024
 
...FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY FOR CATAWBA RIVER FROM LAKE JAMES TO LAKE 
RHODHISS...

The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued a

* Flash Flood Warning for...
  Central Burke County in western North Carolina...
  Southeastern Caldwell County in western North Carolina...
  East Central McDowell County in western North Carolina...

* Until 200 PM EDT Sunday.

* At 723 PM EDT, Devastating rainfall of 6-25 (twenty-five) inches 
  occurred from Wednesday evening through Friday morning from Lake 
  Hickory to the Catawba River headwaters, with the highest totals 
  exceeding 2 feet along the Blue Ridge Escarpment across the upper 
  Catawba River watershed.  This is resulting in catastrophic and 
  historic inflows into Lake James, and releases from Lake James are 
  causing catastrophic flooding along the Catawba River into Lake 
  Rhodhiss.

* The latest pool elevations for the upper Catawba River lakes are 
  as follows (Full Pool is 100.0 feet):

    Lake James: 110.3 feet and rising steadily. RECORD BROKEN.
    Lake Rhodhiss: 108.1 feet and rising steadily.

* The former record pool elevation at Lake James is 107.36 feet 
  which occurred in September 8, 2004 during Hurricane Frances.  
  Major Flood Stage is 110.0 feet.

* The current record pool elevation at Lake Rhodhiss is 110.10 feet 
  which occurred in August 1940.  Major Flood Stage is 110.0 feet.

* This is an unprecedented and extremely dangerous event.  Residents 
  are urged to heed guidance from emergency management and law 
  enforcement on any potential impacts to property.  We are pleading 
  with drivers to heed any barricades and avoid all flooded areas.  
  There have been numerous swift water rescues because people are 
  choosing to risk their lives and the lives of others by failing to 
  Turn Around Don't Drown.  Please do the right thing and protect 
  your life, the life of your family, and the lives of those who
  risk theirs to save you.


  This is a FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY for Catawba River from Lake James 
  to Lake Rhodhiss.

This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.

SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!

  HAZARD...Life-threatening flash flooding from historic rainfall
           and resultant dam floodgate releases.

  SOURCE...Duke Energy and Burke County Emergency Management.

  IMPACT...

This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.

SEEK
           HIGHER GROUND NOW! Life-threatening flash-flooding of
           Lake James, the Catawba River, and Lake Rhodhiss is
           ongoing.  Structural flooding along Lake James
           continues and is developing along Lake Rhodhiss.
           Downstream of Bridgewater Dam on the Catawba River,
           several structrues are damaged or destroyed, with some
           single-level homes submerged by floodwaters.  These
           floodwaters are causing numerous swift-water rescues.
           Backwater effects are causing significant inundation
           along tributaries, including flooding exceeding 4 ft
           deep at the NC 18/US 64 bridge, blocking a primary
           roadway connecting Morganton and Lenoir.

* Please stay weather aware and monitor lake levels and Duke Energy 
  projections closely for any changes.

* For more information on lake levels or dam releases, people are  
  encouraged to visit https://lakes.duke-energy.com or call 
  1-800-829-5253.

* Residents along the Catawba River are encouraged to stay aware of 
  the latest updates from Burke County by signing up for alerts at: http://smart911.com * McDowell County Emergency Management, Burke County Emergency 
  Management, Caldwell County Emergency Management, and Duke Energy 
  are closely monitoring these high flows and pool levels and 
  additional updates will be provided as new information becomes 
  available.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Move to higher ground now! This is an extremely dangerous and 
life-threatening situation. Do not attempt to travel unless you are 
fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.

If you are in low-lying areas along the Catawba River you should move
to higher ground immediately.

 PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

This is a particularly dangerous situation with low humidity and
 very high winds. New fires will grow rapidly out of control, in
 some cases people may not be able to evacuate safely in time
 should a fire approach. Avoid outdoor activities that can cause a
 spark near dry vegetation, such as yard work, target shooting, or
 campfires. Follow local fire restrictions. Check weather.gov/reno
 for updates and livingwithfire.info for preparedness tips.

PDS severe thunderstorm watch [ edit ] PDS severe thunderstorm watches are issued when there is a higher than normal risk of severe thunderstorm winds capable of major structural damage (in addition to large hail and perhaps a few isolated tornadoes), usually due to a strong and persistent derecho . These watches are very rare (accounting an average of only two each year), as the risk for tornadoes must remain low enough to not warrant a tornado watch (a normal tornado watch would be issued if the tornado risk is significant alongside the extreme wind threat).

[ 3 ] This PDS severe thunderstorm watch shown below was issued by the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma , on May 12, 2022, for a derecho in portions of Iowa , Minnesota , Nebraska , and South Dakota .

 DHOF PDS special weather statement [ edit ] PDS special weather statements are usually issued by the NWS for hazards that do not have a specific code of their own, and pose an exceptionally high risk of damage and loss of life.

The PDS special weather statement below was issued by the National Weather Service in Buffalo, New York , on December 11, 2013, regarding extreme amounts of lake effect snow to impact the defined area.

[ citation needed ] The same office issued multiple PDS Special Weather Statements for hurricane-force winds forecast to hit the Buffalo area on February 24, 2019.

 JAM PDS tornado watch [ edit ] PDS tornado watches are issued when there is a significantly higher than normal risk of multiple EF2 or stronger tornadoes – especially those that are predicted to be long-track in nature, with path lengths of more than 20 miles – in the watch area (usually amounting to damage consistent with EF4 or EF5 tornadoes at maximum), in addition to including significant wind and hail damage. This enhanced wording in a Tornado Watch is meant to alert the public of the potential for very life-threatening severe weather. Under current criteria, such would be issued when the probability for significant tornadoes is 80% or greater. PDS Tornado Watches are often issued on high risk days for severe weather, though have been issued on high-end moderate risk days.

[ 17 ] The PDS tornado watch shown below was issued on April 27 during the tornado outbreak sequence of April 25–28, 2024 .

[ 18 ] PDS tornado watch URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
  Tornado Watch Number 146
  NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
  1240 PM CDT Sat Apr 27 2024
 
  The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a
 
  * Tornado Watch for portions of 
    Western Oklahoma
    Northwest Texas
 
  * Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 1240 PM
    until 800 PM CDT.

...THIS IS A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION...

* Primary threats include...
    Several tornadoes and a few intense tornadoes likely
    Widespread large hail and scattered very large hail events to 3
      inches in diameter likely
    Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
      mph likely

  SUMMARY...Intense thunderstorms are expected to develop this
  afternoon along and east of a dryline over western Oklahoma and
  northwest Texas.  Supercells are expected, capable of very large
  hail and damaging winds.  The most intense cells may also produce
  strong or potentially long-tracked tornadoes.

  The tornado watch area is approximately along and 70 statute miles
  east and west of a line from 35 miles east northeast of Alva OK to
  45 miles southwest of Wichita Falls TX. For a complete depiction of
  the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
  WOU6).

  PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

  REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
  tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
  area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
  threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
  and possible warnings.

  &&

  OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 144...WW 145...

  AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
  surface and aloft to 3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
  gusts to 65 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
  storm motion vector 24035.

  ...Hart PDS tornado warning [ edit ] PDS tornado warnings are currently issued on an experimental basis by the 38 National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices within the Central Region.

[ 19 ] The criteria for a PDS warning are when a strong and/or long-tracked tornado is expected based on radar information and/or spotter reports. While the intention of this experimental warning may be to replace the loosely defined tornado emergency , PDS tornado warnings are structured as the second highest level of tornado warning within the impact based warning system (an experiment – which also includes tags within warning products illustrating radar indications or physical observations of tornadoes, and damage potential – participated by the 33 Weather Forecast Offices within the Central Region, as well as eight additional offices within the Western, Eastern and Southern regions that began utilizing the system in the spring of 2014 [ 20 ] ); a tornado emergency, the highest warning level, is used within the United States for destructive tornadoes approaching more densely populated areas. These are the first warnings issued with PDS wording, and like PDS flash flood watches, are issued by local forecast offices.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Below is an example of a PDS Tornado Warning, issued for the 2025 Somerset–London tornado on May 16, 2025.

Other watches and warnings [ edit ] While the use of PDS wording for other types of watches and warnings has not been used, PDS wording could theoretically be applied to any kind of watch or warning to alert the public to weather events where there exists an increased risk of loss of life or widespread damage to property. Such situations could include PDS watches or warnings for blizzards, ice storms, or extreme heat.
