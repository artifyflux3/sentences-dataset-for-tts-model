He was the first rear admiral, vice admiral, and admiral in the United States Navy.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] He is remembered in U.S. Navy tradition for his bold order at the Battle of Mobile Bay , usually abbreviated to "Damn the torpedoes ... full speed ahead." [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Farragut was born in Knoxville, Tennessee and raised by naval officer David Porter after the death of his mother. When he was 11 years old, Farragut served in the War of 1812 under the command of his adoptive father. He received his first command in 1823 at age 22, and went on to participate in anti-piracy operations in the Caribbean Sea . He then served in the Mexican–American War under the command of Matthew C. Perry , participating in the blockade of Tuxpan . After the war, he oversaw the construction of the Mare Island Navy Yard (now Mare Island Naval Shipyard ), which was the first U.S. Navy base established on the Pacific Ocean .

Farragut resided in Norfolk, Virginia prior to the Civil War , but he was a Southern Unionist who strongly opposed Southern secession and remained loyal to the Union after the outbreak of the Civil War. He was assigned command of an attack on the important Confederate port city of New Orleans , defeating the Confederates at the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip . He captured New Orleans in April 1862. He was promoted to rear admiral after the battle and helped extend Union control up along the Mississippi River , participating in the siege of Port Hudson . He then led a successful attack on Mobile Bay , home to the last major Confederate port on the Gulf of Mexico . Farragut was promoted to admiral following the end of the Civil War and remained on active duty until his death in 1870.

Early life [ edit ] Coat of Arms of David Farragut James Glasgow Farragut was born in 1801 to George Farragut (born Jorge Farragut Mesquida, 1755–1817), a Spanish Balearic merchant captain from the Mediterranean island of Menorca , and his wife Elizabeth (née Shine, 1765–1808), of North Carolina Scotch-Irish American descent, at Lowe's Ferry on the Holston River in Tennessee.

[ 9 ] It was a few miles southeast of Campbell's Station, near Knoxville .

[ 10 ] After serving in the Spanish merchant marine , George Farragut immigrated to North America in 1776 and served as a naval officer during the American Revolutionary War . He was first with the South Carolina Navy , then with the Continental Navy . George and Elizabeth moved west to Tennessee after his service in the Revolution, where he operated Lowe's Ferry and served as a cavalry officer in the Tennessee militia .

[ 6 ] In 1805, George accepted a position at the U.S. port of New Orleans . He traveled there first and his family followed in a 1,700-mile (2,700 km) flatboat journey guided by hired rivermen. It was four-year-old James's first voyage. The family was still living in New Orleans when Elizabeth died of yellow fever . George Farragut made plans to place the young children with friends and family who could better care for them.

In 1808, after his mother's death, James agreed to live with United States Navy officer David Porter , whose father had served with George Farragut during the Revolution.

[ 11 ] In 1812, he adopted the name "David" in honor of his foster father, with whom he went to sea late in 1810. David Farragut grew up in a naval family, with foster brothers David Dixon Porter , a future Civil War admiral, and William D. Porter , who became a Commodore .

Career [ edit ] Farragut as he appears in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.

Farragut's naval career began as a midshipman when he was nine years old, and continued for 60 years until his death at the age of 69. This included service in several wars, most notably during the American Civil War , where he gained fame for winning several decisive naval battles.

War of 1812 [ edit ] Farragut's naval career began when he was added to the U.S. Navy's rolls with the rank of "boy" in the spring of 1810.

[ 12 ] Through the influence of his foster father, Farragut was warranted a midshipman in the U.S. Navy on December 17, 1810, at the age of nine.

[ 13 ] [ note 1 ] A prize master by the age of 11, Farragut fought in the War of 1812 , serving under Captain Porter, his foster father. While serving aboard the frigate USS Essex , Farragut participated in the capture of HMS Alert on August 13, 1812, [ 14 ] [ 15 ] He helped to establish America's first naval base and colony in the Pacific, named Fort Madison , during the ill-fated Nuku Hiva Campaign in the Marquesas Islands . At the same time, the Americans battled the hostile tribes on the islands with the help of their Te I'i allies.

Farragut was 11 years old when, during the War of 1812, he was given the assignment to bring a ship captured by the Essex safely to port.

[ 16 ] He was wounded and captured while serving on the Essex during the engagement at Valparaíso Bay , Chile, against the British on March 28, 1814.

[ 17 ] West Indies [ edit ] In 1823, Farragut was placed in command of USS Ferret , which was his first command of a U.S. naval vessel.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] He served in the Mosquito Fleet , a fleet of ships fitted out to fight pirates in the Caribbean Sea . After learning his old captain, Commodore Porter, would be commander of the fleet, he asked for, and received, orders to serve aboard Greyhound , one of the smaller vessels, commanded by John Porter, brother of David Porter. On February 14, 1823, the fleet set sail for the West Indies where, for the next six months, they would drive the pirates off the sea, and rout them from their hiding places in among the islands.

[ 20 ] He was executive officer aboard the Experiment during its campaign in the West Indies fighting pirates.

[ 21 ] Farragut was promoted to lieutenant in 1825.

[ 19 ] Mexican–American War [ edit ] In 1847, Farragut, now a commander , took command of the sloop-of-war USS Saratoga when she was recommissioned at Norfolk Navy Yard in Norfolk , Virginia . Assigned to the Home Squadron for service in the Mexican–American War , Saratoga departed Norfolk on March 29, 1847, bound for the Gulf of Mexico under Farragut's command and upon arriving off Veracruz , Mexico , on April 26, 1847, reported to the squadron's commander, Commodore Matthew C. Perry , for duty. On April 29, Perry ordered Farragut to sail Saratoga 150 nautical miles (170 mi; 280 km) to the north to blockade Tuxpan , where she operated from April 30 to July 12 before Farragut returned to Veracruz. About two weeks later, Farragut began a round-trip voyage to carry dispatches to Tabasco , returning to Veracruz on August 11, 1847. On September 1, 1847, Farragut and Saratoga returned to blockade duty off Tuxpan, remaining there for two months despite a yellow fever outbreak on board. Farragut then brought the ship back to Veracruz and, after a month there, got underway for the Pensacola Navy Yard in Pensacola , Florida , where Saratoga arrived on January 6, 1848, disembarked all of her seriously sick patients at the base hospital, and replenished her stores. On January 31, 1848, Farragut took the ship out of Pensacola bound for New York City , arriving there on February 19.

Saratoga was decommissioned there on February 26, 1848.

[ 22 ] Mare Island Navy Yard [ edit ] In 1853, Secretary of the Navy James C. Dobbin selected Commander David G. Farragut to create Mare Island Navy Yard near San Francisco in San Pablo Bay . In August 1854, Farragut was called to Washington from his post as assistant inspector of ordnance at Norfolk, Virginia . President Franklin Pierce congratulated Farragut on his naval career and the task he was to undertake. On September 16, 1854, Commander Farragut arrived to oversee the building of the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California , which became the port for ship repairs on the West Coast. Captain Farragut commissioned Mare Island on July 16, 1858. Farragut returned to a hero's welcome at Mare Island on August 11, 1859.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] Civil War service [ edit ] Rear Admiral David G. Farragut, c.

1863 Although he was a Southerner by birth and lived in the South prior to the American Civil War, Farragut made it clear to all who knew him that he regarded secession as treason . Just before the war's outbreak, Farragut moved with his Virginia-born wife to Hastings-on-Hudson , a small town just outside New York City.

[ 9 ] [ 25 ] He offered his services to the Union, and was initially given a seat on the Naval Retirement Board. Offered a command by his foster brother, David Dixon Porter, for a special assignment, he hesitated upon learning the target might be Norfolk. As he had friends and relatives living there, he was relieved to learn the target was changed to his former childhood home of New Orleans.

[ 25 ] Farragut was appointed under secret instructions on February 3, 1862, to command the Gulf Blockading Squadron , sailing from Hampton Roads on the screw steamer USS Hartford , bearing 25 guns, which he made his flagship , accompanied by a fleet of 17 ships. He reached the mouth of the Mississippi River , near Confederate forts St. Philip and Jackson , situated opposite one another along the banks of the river, with a combined armament of more than 100 heavy guns and a complement of 700 men. Now aware of Farragut's approach, the Confederates had amassed a fleet of 16 gunboats just outside New Orleans.

[ 26 ] On April 18, Farragut ordered the mortar boats, under the command of Porter, to commence bombardment on the two forts, inflicting considerable damage, but not enough to compel the Confederates to surrender. After two days of heavy bombardment , Farragut ran past forts Jackson and St. Philip and the Chalmette batteries to take the city and port of New Orleans on April 29, a decisive event in the war.

[ 27 ] Congress honored him by creating the rank of rear admiral on July 16, 1862, a rank never before used in the U.S. Navy. Before this time, the American Navy had resisted the rank of admiral, preferring the term "flag officer", to distinguish the rank from the traditions of the European navies. Farragut was promoted to rear admiral along with 13 other officers – three others on the active list and ten on the retired list. Later that year, Farragut passed the batteries defending Vicksburg, Mississippi , but had no success there. A makeshift Confederate ironclad forced his flotilla of 38 ships to withdraw in July 1862.

While an aggressive commander, Farragut was not always cooperative. At the siege of Port Hudson , the plan was that Farragut's flotilla would pass by the guns of the Confederate stronghold with the help of a diversionary land attack by the Army of the Gulf , commanded by General Nathaniel Banks , to commence at 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 1863. Farragut unilaterally decided to move the timetable up to 9:00 p.m. on March 14, and initiated his run past the guns before Union ground forces were in position. The consequently uncoordinated attack allowed the Confederates to concentrate on Farragut's flotilla and inflict heavy damage to his warships.

Farragut on board Hartford Farragut's flotilla was forced to retreat with only two ships able to pass the heavy cannon of the Confederate bastion. After surviving the gauntlet, Farragut played no further part in the battle for Port Hudson , and General Banks was left to continue the siege without the advantage of naval support. The Union Army made two major attacks on the fort; both were repulsed with heavy losses. Farragut's flotilla was splintered, yet was able to blockade the mouth of the Red River with the two remaining warships; he could not efficiently patrol the section of the Mississippi between Port Hudson and Vicksburg. Farragut's decision proved costly to the Union Navy and the Union Army, which suffered its highest casualty rate of the war at Port Hudson.

Vicksburg surrendered on July 4, 1863, leaving Port Hudson as the last remaining Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. General Banks accepted the surrender of the Confederate garrison at Port Hudson on July 9, ending the longest siege in U.S. military history.

Control of the Mississippi River was the centerpiece of the Union strategy to win the war, and, with the surrender of Port Hudson, the Confederacy was now cut in two.

On August 5, 1864, Farragut won a great victory in the Battle of Mobile Bay .

Mobile, Alabama was then the Confederacy's last major open port on the Gulf of Mexico . The bay was heavily mined (tethered naval mines were then known as "torpedoes").

[ 28 ] Farragut ordered his fleet to charge the bay. As the battle progressed, smoke blocked Farragut's view from his position on the USS Hartford . In a detailed account of the episode, Robert M. Browning reveals that, in order to see better, Farragut climbed the ship's rigging until he reached the futtock shrouds under the main top. Fearing for his safety, the crew lashed him to the mast and rigging.

[ 29 ] Rear admiral David Farragut and General Gordon Granger When the monitor USS Tecumseh struck a mine and sank, the others began to pull back. "What's the trouble?" he shouted through a trumpet to USS Brooklyn . "Torpedoes", was the shouted reply. "Damn the torpedoes.", said Farragut, "Four bells, Captain Drayton , go ahead.

Jouett , full speed." [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The bulk of the fleet succeeded in entering the bay. Farragut triumphed over the opposition of heavy batteries in Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines to defeat the squadron of Admiral Franklin Buchanan . On December 21, 1864, Lincoln promoted Farragut to vice admiral, which made him the senior ranking officer in the United States Navy.

Post-Civil War service [ edit ] After the Civil War, Farragut was elected a companion of the first class of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States on March 18, 1866, and assigned insignia number 231. He served as the commander of the Commandery of New York from May 1866 until his death. Farragut was promoted to full admiral on July 25, 1866, becoming the first U.S. Navy officer to hold that rank.

[ 6 ] His last active service was in command of the European Squadron , from 1867 to 1868, with the screw frigate USS Franklin as his flagship . Farragut remained on active duty for life, an honor accorded to only seven other U.S. Navy officers after the Civil War.

[ 32 ] Death [ edit ] The monument of Admiral David Farragut in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx , New York City Farragut died from a heart attack at the age of 69 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire , while on vacation in the late summer of 1870. He had served almost sixty years in the navy. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery , in The Bronx , New York City .

[ 33 ] His gravesite is listed on the National Register of Historic Places , as is Woodlawn Cemetery itself.

Personal life [ edit ] Farragut married Susan Caroline Marchant on September 2, 1824 following an initial cruise as acting lieutenant commanding USS Ferret .

[ 34 ] She died on December 27, 1840 after 11 years of ill health. Farragut was noted for his kindly treatment of his wife during her illness.

[ 35 ] He married Virginia Dorcas Loyall on December 26, 1843, with whom he had one surviving son named Loyall Farragut, born October 12, 1844.

[ 36 ] Farragut was a Freemason and a Scottish Rite freemason.
