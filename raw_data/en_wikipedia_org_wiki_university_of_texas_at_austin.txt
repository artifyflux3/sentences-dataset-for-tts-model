Founded in 1883, it is the flagship institution of the University of Texas System . With 53,864 students as of fall 2024, it is also the largest institution in the system.

[ 4 ] The university is a major center for academic research, with research expenditures totaling $1.06 billion for the 2023 fiscal year.

[ 11 ] It joined the Association of American Universities in 1929. The university houses seven museums and seventeen libraries, including the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library and the Blanton Museum of Art , and operates various auxiliary research facilities, such as the J. J. Pickle Research Campus and McDonald Observatory .

UT Austin's athletics constitute the Texas Longhorns . The Longhorns have won four NCAA Division I National Football Championships, six NCAA Division I National Baseball Championships, sixteen NCAA Division I National Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, and the school has claimed more titles in men's and women's sports than any other member in the Big 12 .

As of 2020, [update] 13 Nobel Prize winners, 25 Pulitzer Prize winners, 3 Turing Award winners, 2 Fields Medal recipients, 2 Wolf Prize winners, and 3 Abel Prize winners have been affiliated with the school as alumni, faculty members, or researchers. The university has also been affiliated with three Primetime Emmy Award winners, and as of 2021, its students and alumni have earned a total of 155 Olympic medals .

[ 12 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of the University of Texas at Austin Establishment [ edit ] The idea of a public university in Texas was first mentioned in the 1827 constitution of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas , which promised public education in the arts and sciences under Title 6, Article 217, but no action was taken.

[ 13 ] After Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, the Constitution of the Republic emphasized Congress's duty, in Section 5 of its General Provisions, to establish a general system of education when circumstances allowed.

[ 14 ] After Texas was annexed , the Seventh Texas Legislature passed O.B. 102 on February 11, 1858, allocating $100,000 in United States bonds from the Compromise of 1850 for the University of Texas.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] The Civil War delayed fund repayment, leaving the university with only $16,000 by 1865.

[ 17 ] Nevertheless, the Texas Constitution of 1876 reaffirmed the mandate to establish "The University of Texas" by popular vote.

[ 18 ] The university's Old Main building in 1903 On March 30, 1881, the Texas legislature organized the structure of the university and called for a popular vote to determine its location.

[ 19 ] Austin was chosen as the site with 30,913 votes, while Galveston was designated for the medical department.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] On November 17, 1882, the cornerstone of the Old Main building was laid at the original "College Hill" location, and University President Ashbel Smith expressed optimism about Texas's untapped resources.

[ 22 ] The University of Texas officially opened its doors on September 15, 1883.

[ 23 ] Expansion and growth [ edit ] The old Main Building of the university was built in a Victorian - Gothic style and served as the central point of the campus's 40-acre (16 ha) site, and was used for nearly all purposes. But by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934, despite the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] UT Architecture Library In 1916, a contentious dispute erupted between Texas Governor James E. Ferguson and the University of Texas over faculty appointments. Ferguson's attempt to influence these appointments led to a retaliatory veto of the university's budget, jeopardizing its operations. Subsequently, Ferguson was impeached by the Texas House of Representatives , convicted by the Senate on charges including misapplication of public funds, and removed from office.

[ 26 ] In 1921, the legislature appropriated $1.35 million to purchase land next to the main campus. However, expansion was hampered by the restriction against using state revenues to fund construction of university buildings as set forth in Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution. With the completion of Santa Rita No. 1 well [ 27 ] and the discovery of oil on university-owned lands in 1923, the university added significantly to its Permanent University Fund. The additional income from Permanent University Fund investments allowed for bond issues in 1931 and 1947, which allowed the legislature to address funding for the university along with the Agricultural and Mechanical College (now known as Texas A&M University ). With sufficient funds to finance construction on both campuses, on April 8, 1931, the Forty Second Legislature passed H.B. 368.

[ 28 ] which dedicated the Agricultural and Mechanical College a 1/3 interest in the Available University Fund, [ 29 ] the annual income from Permanent University Fund investments.

In 1929, the University of Texas was inducted into the Association of American Universities .

[ 30 ] During World War II , the University of Texas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

[ 31 ] Additionally, to facilitate the wartime effort, academic calendars were compressed, allowing for accelerated graduation.

[ 32 ] After Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Houston, Texas, area teen Marion Ford had been accepted to become one of the first Black attendees. In an interview with a reporter he announced his desire to try-out for the football team. The Ford Crisis would begin and all Black admissions at the time were rescinded until policy could be drawn up.

[ 33 ] In the fall of 1956, the first Black students entered the university's undergraduate class.

[ 34 ] Black students were permitted to live in campus dorms, but were barred from campus cafeterias.

[ 34 ] The University of Texas integrated its facilities and desegregated its dormitories in 1965.

[ 35 ] UT, which had had an open admissions policy, adopted standardized testing for admissions in the mid-1950s, at least in part as a conscious strategy to minimize the number of Black undergraduates, given that they were no longer able to simply bar their entry after the Brown decision.

[ 36 ] Following growth in enrollment after World War II, the university unveiled an ambitious master plan in 1960 designed for "10 years of growth" that was intended to "boost the University of Texas into the ranks of the top state universities in the nation." [ 37 ] In 1965, the Texas Legislature granted the university Board of Regents to use eminent domain to purchase additional properties surrounding the original 40 acres (160,000 m 2 ). The university began buying parcels of land to the north, south, and east of the existing campus, particularly in the Blackland neighborhood to the east and the Brackenridge tract to the southeast, in hopes of using the land to relocate the university's intramural fields, baseball field, tennis courts, and parking lots.

[ 37 ] On March 6, 1967, the Sixtieth Texas Legislature changed the university's official name from "The University of Texas" to "The University of Texas at Austin" to reflect the growth of the University of Texas System .

[ 38 ] 1966 shooting [ edit ] The Tower , completed in 1937, stands 307 ft (94 m) tall and dons different colors of lighting on special occasions.

Main article: University of Texas tower shooting On August 1, 1966, Texas student Charles Whitman barricaded the observation deck in the tower of the Main Building. Armed with multiple firearms, he killed 14 people on campus, 11 from the observation deck and below the clocks on the tower, and three more in the tower, as well as wounding two others inside the observation deck. The massacre ended when Whitman was shot and killed by police after they breached the tower.

After the Whitman event, the observation deck was closed until 1968 and then closed again in 1975 following a series of suicide jumps during the 1970s. In 1999, after installation of security fencing and other safety precautions, the tower observation deck reopened to the public. There is a turtle pond park near the tower dedicated to those affected by the tragedy.

The first presidential library on a university campus was dedicated on May 22, 1971, with former President Johnson , Lady Bird Johnson and then-President Richard Nixon in attendance. Constructed on the eastern side of the main campus, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum is one of 13 presidential libraries administered by the National Archives and Records Administration .

A statue of Martin Luther King Jr.

was unveiled on campus in 1999 and subsequently vandalized.

[ 39 ] By 2004, John Butler, a professor at the McCombs School of Business suggested moving it to Morehouse College , a historically black college, "a place where he is loved".

[ 39 ] Recent history [ edit ] The University of Texas at Austin has experienced a wave of new construction recently with several significant buildings. On April 30, 2006, the school opened the Blanton Museum of Art .

[ 40 ] In August 2008, the AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center opened, with the hotel and conference center forming part of a new gateway to the university. Also in 2008, Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium was expanded to a seating capacity of 100,119, making it the largest stadium (by capacity) in the state of Texas at the time.

[ 41 ] On Tuesday, September 28, 2010, a shooting occurred at the Perry–Castañeda Library (PCL) where student Colton Tooley, armed with an AK-47, fired shots on his walk from Guadalupe Street to the library's front entrance. The student ascended to the sixth floor, before killing himself. No one else was injured, except for one sprained ankle suffered by a student fleeing the scene.

[ 42 ] In early 2020, following a major outbreak of the new coronavirus , the university restricted travel to Wuhan province in China, aligning with the US Department of State's recommendation.

[ 43 ] By March 17, 2020, then-UT President Gregory L. Fenves announced a transition to online classes for the rest of the spring semester after 49 confirmed COVID-19 cases emerged from students' travels to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, during spring break.

[ 44 ] Throughout the summer, the university reported over 400 cases and its first COVID-19-related death, a custodial worker.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] The fall 2020 semester consisted of a majority of online courses through platforms like Zoom. On August 6, 2020, UT Austin initiated plans for free COVID-19 tests for all students. UT Austin returned to primarily in-person classes and campus activities for the fall 2021 semester, implementing safety protocols like testing requirements and vaccination incentives to ensure a safe return amid the ongoing pandemic.

[ 47 ] In 2024, after four years of test-optional admissions for undergraduate applications due to the COVID-19 pandemic, standardized testing scores were once again made a mandatory part of admissions, beginning with applications for the fall 2025 semester.

[ 48 ] Jay Hartzell commented that the SAT and ACT standardized exams were "a proven differentiator that is in each student's and the University's best interest." [ 48 ] On April 2, 2024, the University of Texas at Austin announced additional adjustments in compliance with Senate Bill 17, [ 49 ] particularly in response to a letter from March 26, 2024, from Texas State Senator Brandon Creighton , [ 50 ] which led to the layoff of approximately 60 individuals, most of whom formerly worked in DEI-related programs, and the elimination of the newly renamed Division of Campus and Community Engagement.

[ 51 ] Students, faculty, staff, and outside critics denounced the university's over-compliance with the anti-DEI law, since the university had already been compliant since January 1, 2024.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] At a UT Austin Faculty Council meeting on April 15, 2024, in response to mounting criticism, President Jay Hartzell stated the additional changes were made in response to the threats from the Republican -led State Legislature and the University of Texas System Board of Regents, and to restore "confidence" in the university, reacting to changing tides in public opinion towards higher education amongst Republicans.

[ 54 ] The university's Division of Campus and Community Engagement operated the University of Texas-University Charter School , a charter school system with 23 campuses across Texas, until the closure on April 2, 2024, leading the charter school to be moved to the College of Education .

[ 55 ] 2024 pro-Palestinian protests [ edit ] Main article: 2024 University of Texas at Austin pro-Palestinian campus protests A police group has arrested a protestor with zip ties. Both protestors and student observers and other watchers have surrounded the police in outrage.

On February 4, 2024, a Palestinian-American student at a pro-Palestinian protest at the campus was stabbed, receiving non-life-threatening injuries.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] The attacker used a racial slur against the protestors and the attack was investigated as a hate crime .

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] A month later the attacker was indicted by a grand jury on an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charge but was not charged with any additional hate crime charge.

[ 61 ] Police arrest a protester present at the April 24, 2024, pro-Palestinian protest on the South Lawn of the University of Texas at Austin A large student and faculty Pro-Palestinian protest occurred on April 24, 2024, demanding a ceasefire in the Gaza war and that the university divest from companies profiting from Israel's actions.

[ 62 ] The protests occurred amidst the ongoing nationwide demonstrations on college campuses .

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] In response, the university, under the explicit direction of President Hartzell, [ 65 ] [ 66 ] requested the assistance of the Austin Police Department (APD) and the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) , in coordination with Texas Governor Greg Abbott , in an attempt to quell said protests and an "occupation" of the university, [ 67 ] [ 68 ] in contrast to free speech on campus laws praised by Abbott and the university in prior years.

[ 69 ] The deployment of multiple police units led to the confirmed arrest of 57 protesters, including a photojournalist for Fox 7 Austin, with several more detained.

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Charges were then dismissed against 46 protesters the next day, leading to their subsequent release, [ 75 ] [ 62 ] [ 76 ] with the charges against the remaining 11 protesters dropped on April 26, 2024.

[ 77 ] A protester is tackled by police and arrested at the pro-Palestinian protest on April 24, 2024, at the University of Texas at Austin.

This decision received sharp backlash, including from general faculty, staff, students, several Democratic legislators for the region, and First Amendment advocacy groups, [ 78 ] [ 79 ] including an official statement from the UT Faculty Council Executive Committee denouncing it, [ 80 ] in part due to the extreme, chaotic, and violent police response that ensued and alleged violations of First Amendment rights.

[ 81 ] [ 70 ] The university additionally set new rules for protests on campus, such as banning masks and face coverings and instituting a 10 PM curfew for all protests, directly contradicting prior guidelines.

[ 82 ] Initially, the university told students and faculty that arrested protestors would no longer be allowed on campus, but retracted the statement two hours later, stating that they would be allowed "academic" access, only to then announce a change to full access for university affiliates.

[ 83 ] Additionally, the university temporarily suspended the student organization that organized the protests, the Palestine Solidarity Committee.

[ 84 ] Travis County Attorney Delia Garza stated that the way that the university handled the protests put a strain on the local criminal justice system, specifically reprimanding the sending of protestors to jail for low-level charges.

[ 85 ] A report later released by the UT Austin Committee of Counsel on Academic Freedom and Responsibility (CCAFR) on July 17, 2024, found that UT Austin administrators violated its own institutional rules in clear disregard of freedom of speech and expression protections.

[ 86 ] On April 8, 2025, the University of Texas at Austin announced the removal of its graduation requirement for "Flag" courses, including the Cultural Diversity in the United States Flag. Interim Provost David Vanden Bout stated that while the core curriculum remains required, students are no longer obligated to complete Flag courses to graduate. The decision follows increased scrutiny of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in Texas, including the passage of Senate Bill 17, which banned DEI offices at public universities.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] Campus [ edit ] See also: List of University of Texas at Austin buildings The university's property totals 1,438.5 acres (582.1 ha), comprising the 423.5 acres (171.4 ha) for the Main Campus in central Austin and the J. J. Pickle Research Campus in north Austin and the other properties throughout Texas. The main campus has 150 buildings totaling over 18,000,000 square feet (1,700,000 m 2 ).

Interior lobby of the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library and Museum One of the university's most visible features is the Beaux-Arts Main Building , including a 307-foot (94 m) tower designed by Paul Philippe Cret .

[ 89 ] Completed in 1937, the Main Building is in the middle of campus. The tower usually appears illuminated in white light in the evening but is lit burnt orange for various special occasions, including athletic victories and academic accomplishments; conversely, it is darkened for solemn occasions.

[ 90 ] At the top of the tower is a carillon of 56 bells, the largest in Texas. Songs are played on weekdays by student carillonneurs, [ 91 ] in addition to the usual pealing of Westminster Quarters every quarter-hour between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.

[ 92 ] In 1998, after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation deck reopened to the public indefinitely for weekend tours.

[ 93 ] The university's seven museums and seventeen libraries hold over nine million volumes, making it the seventh-largest academic library in the country.

[ 94 ] The holdings of the university's Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center include one of only 21 remaining complete copies of the Gutenberg Bible and the first permanent photograph, View from the Window at Le Gras , taken by Nicéphore Niépce .

[ 95 ] The newest museum, the 155,000-square-foot (14,400 m 2 ) Blanton Museum of Art , is the largest university art museum in the United States and hosts approximately 17,000 works from Europe, the United States, and Latin America.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] The Perry–Castañeda Library , which houses the central University Libraries operations and the Perry–Castañeda Library Map Collection , is at the heart of campus. The Benson Latin American Collection holds the largest collection of Latin American materials among US university libraries, [ 98 ] and maintains substantial digital collections.

[ 99 ] The University of Texas at Austin has an extensive tunnel system that links the buildings on campus. Constructed c.

1928 under the supervision of UT engineering professor Carl J. Eckhardt Jr., then head of the physical plant, the tunnels have grown along with the campus.

[ 100 ] They measure approximately six miles in length.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] The tunnel system is used for communications and utility service. It is closed to the public and guarded by silent alarms . Since the late 1940s, the university has generated its own electricity. Today its natural gas cogeneration plant has a capacity of 123 MW. The university also operates a TRIGA nuclear reactor at the J. J. Pickle Research Campus .

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] The university continues to expand its facilities on campus. In 2010, the university opened the state-of-the-art Norman Hackerman building (on the site of the former Experimental Sciences Building) housing chemistry and biology research and teaching laboratories. In 2010, the university broke ground on the $120 million Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall and the $51 million Belo Center for New Media, both of which are now complete.

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] The new LEED gold-certified, 110,000-square-foot (10,000 m 2 ) Student Activity Center (SAC) opened in January 2011, housing study rooms, lounges and food vendors. The SAC was constructed as a result of a student referendum passed in 2006 which raised student fees by $65 per semester.

[ 107 ] In 2012, the Moody Foundation awarded the College of Communication $50 million, the largest endowment any communication college has received, so naming it the Moody College of Communication.

The university operates two public radio stations, KUT with news and information, and KUTX with music, via local FM broadcasts as well as live streaming audio over the Internet. The university uses CapMetro to provide bus transportation for students around the campus on the UT Shuttle system and throughout Austin, and UT students, faculty, and staff with an active UT ID card are able to ride public transportation without paying a fare.

[ 108 ] Organization and administration [ edit ] Battle Hall , also known as "The Old Library", was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

The university contains nineteen colleges and schools and one academic unit, each listed with its founding date: [ 109 ] School of Civic Leadership (2023) Cockrell School of Engineering (1894) Dell Medical School (2013) College of Education (1905) College of Fine Arts (1938) College of Liberal Arts (1883) College of Natural Sciences (1883) College of Pharmacy  (1893 in Galveston, moved to Austin 1927) Continuing Education (1909) Graduate Studies (1910) Jackson School of Geosciences (2005) LBJ School of Public Affairs (1970) McCombs School of Business (1922) Moody College of Communication (1965) School of Architecture (1948) School of Information (1948) School of Law (1883) School of Nursing (1976) School of Undergraduate Studies (2008) Steve Hicks School of Social Work (1950) Academics [ edit ] Student Union Building The University of Texas at Austin offers more than 100 undergraduate and 170 graduate degrees. In the 2009–2010 academic year, the university awarded a total of 13,215 degrees: 67.7% bachelor's degrees , 22.0% master's degrees, 6.4% doctoral degrees , and 3.9% Professional degrees.

[ 110 ] In addition, the university has nine honors programs , eight of which span a variety of academic fields: Liberal Arts Honors, the Business Honors Program, the Turing Scholars Program in Computer Science, Engineering Honors, the Dean's Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, the Health Science Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, the Polymathic Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, and the Undergraduate Nursing Honors Program in School of Nursing. The ninth is the Plan II Honors Program, a rigorous interdisciplinary program that is a major in and of itself.

[ 111 ] Many Plan II students pursue a second major, often participating in another department's honors program in addition to Plan II.

[ 112 ] The university also offers programs such as the Freshman Research Initiative and Texas Interdisciplinary Plan.

[ 113 ] Admissions [ edit ] Undergraduate [ edit ] Undergraduate admissions statistics 2021 entering class [ 114 ] Change vs.

2016 [ 115 ] Admit rate 35.4% ( −11.6) Yield rate 47.7 ( +2.2) Test scores middle 50% SAT Total 1230–1480 (among 56% of FTFs ) ACT Composite 29–34 (among 26% of FTFs ) Among students who chose to submit Among students whose school ranked The University of Texas at Austin encourages applicants to submit SAT / ACT scores, but it is not required.

[ 116 ] However, for students applying for admission from fall 2025 onwards, submission of SAT / ACT scores is mandatory as part of their undergraduate admission application.

[ 117 ] As of 2011, the university was one of the most selective universities in the region. Relative to other universities in the state of Texas, UT Austin was second to Rice University in selectivity according to a Business Journal study weighing acceptance rates and the mid-range of the SAT and ACT. The University of Texas at Austin was ranked as the 18th most selective in the South.

[ 118 ] As a state public university, UT Austin was subject to Texas House Bill 588 , which guaranteed Texas high school seniors graduating in the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university. A new state law granting UT Austin (but no other state university) a partial exemption from the top 10% rule, Senate Bill 175, was passed by the 81st Legislature in 2009. It modified this admissions policy by limiting automatically admitted freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state freshman class, starting in 2011. The university will admit the top one percent, the top two percent and so forth until the cap is reached; the university currently admits the top 6%.

[ 119 ] Furthermore, students admitted under Texas House Bill 588 are not guaranteed their choice of college or major, but rather only guaranteed admission to the university as a whole. Many colleges, such as the Cockrell School of Engineering, have secondary requirements that must be met for admission.

[ 120 ] For others who go through the traditional application process, selectivity is deemed "more selective" according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and by U.S. News & World Report .

[ 121 ] [ 122 ] For fall 2023, 66,109 applied and 19,253 were accepted (29.1%), and of those accepted, 48.8% enrolled.

[ 123 ] Among freshman students who enrolled for fall 2024, the average SAT English reading and writing score was 680, with the 25th percentile at 630 and the 75th percentile at 730, while the average SAT Math score was 690, with the 25th percentile at 610 and the 75th percentile at 760.

[ 147 ] The University of Texas at Austin houses the Office of Technology Commercialization, a technology transfer center which serves as the bridge between laboratory research and commercial development. In 2009, the university created nine new start-up companies to commercialize technology developed at the university and has created 46 start-ups in the past seven years. License agreements generated $10.9 million in revenue for the university in 2009.

[ 147 ] In January 2020, the University of Texas Austin's Texas Innovation Center was established to provide support for startups.

[ 148 ] Research at UT Austin is largely focused in the engineering and physical sciences, [ 149 ] and the university is a world-leading research institution in fields such as computer science.

[ 150 ] Energy is a major research thrust, with federally funded projects on biofuels, [ 151 ] battery and solar cell technology, and geological carbon dioxide storage, [ 152 ] water purification membranes, among others. In 2009, the University of Texas founded the Energy Institute, led by former Under Secretary for Science Raymond L. Orbach , to organize and advance multi-disciplinary energy research.

[ 153 ] In addition to its own medical school, it houses medical programs associated with other campuses and allied health professional programs, as well as major research programs in pharmacy, biomedical engineering, neuroscience, and others.

In 2010, the University of Texas at Austin opened the $100 million Dell Pediatric Research Institute to increase medical research at the university and establish a medical research complex, and associated medical school, in Austin.

[ 154 ] [ 155 ] The university operates several major auxiliary research centers. The world's third-largest telescope, the Hobby–Eberly Telescope , and three other large telescopes are part of the university's McDonald Observatory , 450 miles (720 km) west of Austin.

[ 156 ] [ 157 ] The university manages nearly 300 acres (120 ha) of biological field laboratories, including the Brackenridge Field Laboratory in Austin. The Center for Agile Technology focuses on software development challenges.

[ 158 ] The J.J. Pickle Research Campus (PRC) is home to the Texas Advanced Computing Center which operates a series of supercomputers, such as Ranger (from 2008 to 2013 [ 159 ] ), Stampede (2013–2017 [ 160 ] ), Stampede2 (since 2017 [ 161 ] ), and Frontera (since 2019).

[ 162 ] The Pickle campus also hosts the Microelectronics Research Center which houses micro- and nanoelectronics research and features a 15,000 square foot (1,400 m 2 ) cleanroom for device fabrication.

Founded in 1946, the university's Applied Research Laboratories at the PRC has developed or tested the vast majority of the Navy's high-frequency sonar equipment. In 2007, the Navy granted it a research contract funded up to $928 million over ten years.

[ 163 ] [ 164 ] The Institute for Advanced Technology, founded in 1990 and located in the West Pickle Research Building, supports the US Army with basic and applied research in several fields.

The Center for Transportation Research is a nationally recognized research institution focusing on transportation research, education, and public service.

[ 165 ] In 2013, the University of Texas at Austin announced the naming of the O'Donnell Building for Applied Computational Engineering and Sciences. The O'Donnell Foundation of Dallas, headed by Peter O'Donnell and his wife, Edith Jones O'Donnell, has given more than $135 million to the university between 1983 and 2013. University president William C. Powers declared the O'Donnells "among the greatest supporters of the University of Texas in its 130-year history. Their transformative generosity is based on the belief in our power to change society for the better." [ 166 ] In 2008, O'Donnell pledged $18 million to finance the hiring of university faculty members undertaking research in mathematics, computers, and multiple scientific disciplines; his pledge was matched by W. A. "Tex" Moncrief Jr., an oilman and philanthropist from Fort Worth .

[ 167 ] In addition, UT Austin and Amazon established a new science hub in 2023.

[ 168 ] [ 169 ] The University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute is located on the Gulf coast in Port Aransas. Established in 1941, UTMSI was the first permanent marine research facility in the state of Texas and has since contributed significantly to our understanding of marine ecosystems. Research at the Marine Science Institute ranges from locally-important work on mariculture and estuarine ecosystems to the investigation of global issues in marine science, from the Arctic to the tropics.

Endowment [ edit ] The Norman Hackerman Building Main article: Permanent University Fund The University of Texas System is entitled to at least 30% of the distributions from the Permanent University Fund (PUF), with over $33 billion in assets as of year-end 2021.

[ 170 ] [ 171 ] The University of Texas System gets two-thirds of the Available University Fund (the name of the annual distribution of PUF's income), and the Texas A&M University System gets the other third. A regental policy [ 172 ] requires at least 45 percent of UT System's share of this money go to the University of Texas at Austin for "program enrichment". By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, UT gets 30 percent, which is the minimum amount of AUF income that can be distributed to the school under current policies. The Regents, however, can decide to allocate additional amounts to the university. Also, the majority of the University of Texas system share of the AUF is used for its debt service bonds , some of which were issued for the benefit of the Austin campus.

[ 173 ] The Regents can change the 45 percent minimum of the University of Texas System share that goes to the Austin campus at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.

Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas' two university systems, the University of Texas System and the Texas A&M University System ; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities' annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the university's total endowment.

The University of Texas System also has about $22 billion of assets in its General Endowment Fund.

[ 174 ] Student life [ edit ] Undergraduate demographics as of Fall 2023 [ 175 ] Race and ethnicity Total White 32% Hispanic 28% Asian 25% Black 5% International student 4% Two or more races 4% Unknown 2% Economic diversity Low-income [ b ] 25% Affluent [ c ] 75% Student profile [ edit ] For fall 2024, the university enrolled 43,165 undergraduate students and 10,699 postgraduate students, bringing the total student count to 53,864. Out-of-state students accounted for 9.2% of the total student body, and international students comprised 9.7% of the total student body.

[ 179 ] On-campus housing can hold more than 7,100 students.

[ 180 ] Jester Center is the largest residence hall with its capacity of 2,945.

[ 181 ] Academic enrollment exceeds the on-campus housing capacity; as a result, most students must live in private residence halls, housing cooperatives , apartments, or with Greek organizations and other off-campus residences. University Housing and Dining, which already has the largest market share of 7,000 of the estimated 27,000 beds in the campus area, plans to expand to 9,000 beds.

[ 182 ] Greek life [ edit ] See also: List of fraternities and sororities at University of Texas at Austin The University of Texas at Austin is home to an active Greek community. Approximately 14 percent of undergraduate students are in fraternities or sororities.

[ 183 ] With more than 65 national chapters, the university's Greek community is one of the nation's largest.

[ 183 ] These chapters are under the authority of one of the school's six Greek council communities, Interfraternity Council , National Pan-Hellenic Council , Texas Asian Pan-Hellenic Council, Latino Pan-Hellenic Council, Multicultural Greek Council and University Panhellenic Council.

[ 184 ] Other registered student organizations also name themselves with Greek letters and are called affiliates. They are not a part of one of the six councils but have all of the same privileges and responsibilities of any other organization.

[ 185 ] Most Greek houses are west of the Drag in the West Campus neighborhood.

Media [ edit ] See also: Texas Student Media Students express their opinions in and out of class through periodicals including Study Breaks magazine, Longhorn Life, The Daily Texan (the most award-winning daily college newspaper in the United States), [ 186 ] and the Texas Travesty .

[ 200 ] On June 12, 2020, UT student-athletes banded together with their #WeAreOne statement on Twitter. Among the list of changes included: renaming certain campus buildings, replacing statues, starting outreach programs, and replacing "The Eyes of Texas". UT Interim President Jay Hartzell released a statement on July 13, 2020, announcing the changes to be implemented in light of these demands from UT student-athletes. Hartzell said the university would make a multi-million dollar investment to programs that recruit, retain and support Black students; rename the Robert L. Moore Building as the Physics, Math and Astronomy Building; honor Heman M. Sweatt in numerous ways, including placing a statue of Sweatt near the entrance of  T.S. Painter Hall; honor the Precursors, the first Black undergraduates to attend the University of Texas at Austin, by commissioning a new monument on the East Mall; erect a statue for Julius Whittier , the Longhorns' first Black football letterman, at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium; and more. However, one of the most controversial topics on the list – replacing "The Eyes of Texas" as UT's alma mater – remained untouched.
