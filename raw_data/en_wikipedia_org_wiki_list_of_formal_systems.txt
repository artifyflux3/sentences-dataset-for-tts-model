Mathematical [ edit ] Functional calculus , a way to apply various types of functions to operators Matrix calculus , a specialized notation for multivariable calculus over spaces of matrices Umbral calculus , the combinatorics of certain operations on polynomials Vector calculus (also called vector analysis), comprising specialized notations for multivariable analysis of vectors in an inner-product space Logical [ edit ] Predicate calculus , specifies the rules of inference governing the logic of predicates Propositional calculus , specifies the rules of inference governing the logic of propositions In theoretical computer science ( Formal language ) [ edit ] Modal μ-calculus , a common temporal logic used by formal verification methods such as model checking Lambda calculus , a formulation of the theory of reflexive functions that has deep connections to computational theory Kappa calculus , a reformulation of the first-order fragment of typed lambda calculus Rho calculus, introduced as a general means to uniformly integrate rewriting into lambda calculus Process calculus , a set of approaches to formulating formal models of concurrent systems Ambient calculus , a family of models for concurrent systems based on the concept of agent mobility Join calculus , a theoretical model for the design of distributed programming languages π-calculus , a formulation of the theory of concurrent, communicating processes, that was invented by Robin Milner Relational calculus , a calculus for the relational data model Domain relational calculus Tuple calculus , inspired the SQL language Refinement calculus , a way of refining models of programs into efficient programs Other formal systems [ edit ] Formal ethics – Formal logical system Music is a formal system too. Please have editors illuminate on this.
