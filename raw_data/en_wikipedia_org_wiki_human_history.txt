Modern humans evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago and initially lived as hunter-gatherers . They migrated out of Africa during the Last Ice Age and had spread across Earth's continental land except Antarctica by the end of the Ice Age 12,000 years ago. Soon afterward, the Neolithic Revolution in West Asia brought the first systematic husbandry of plants and animals, and saw many humans transition from a nomadic life to a sedentary existence as farmers in permanent settlements . The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing .

These developments paved the way for the emergence of early civilizations in Mesopotamia , Egypt , the Indus Valley , and China , marking the beginning of the ancient period in 3500 BCE. These civilizations supported the establishment of regional empires and acted as a fertile ground for the advent of transformative philosophical and religious ideas, initially Hinduism during the late Bronze Age , and – during the Axial Age : Buddhism , Confucianism , Greek philosophy , Jainism , Judaism , Taoism , and Zoroastrianism . The subsequent post-classical period , from about 500 to 1500 CE, witnessed the rise of Islam and the continued spread and consolidation of Christianity while civilization expanded to new parts of the world and trade between societies increased. These developments were accompanied by the rise and decline of major empires, such as the Byzantine Empire , the Islamic caliphates , the Mongol Empire , and various Chinese dynasties . This period's invention of gunpowder and of the printing press greatly affected subsequent history.

During the early modern period , spanning from approximately 1500 to 1800 CE, European powers explored and colonized regions worldwide, intensifying cultural and economic exchange. This era saw substantial intellectual, cultural, and technological advances in Europe driven by the Renaissance , the Reformation in Germany giving rise to Protestantism , the Scientific Revolution , and the Enlightenment . By the 18th century, the accumulation of knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that brought about the Industrial Revolution , substantial to the Great Divergence , and began the modern period starting around 1800 CE. The rapid growth in productive power further increased international trade and colonization , linking the different civilizations in the process of globalization , and cemented European dominance throughout the 19th century. Over the last 250 years, which included two devastating world wars , there has been a great acceleration in many spheres, including human population , agriculture, industry, commerce, scientific knowledge, technology, communications, military capabilities, and environmental degradation .

The study of human history relies on insights from academic disciplines including history , archaeology , anthropology , linguistics , and genetics . To provide an accessible overview, researchers divide human history by a variety of periodizations.

Prehistory Main articles: Prehistory and Timeline of prehistory Human origins Further information: Human evolution and Lower Paleolithic Humans evolved in Africa from great apes through the lineage of hominins , which arose 7–5 million years ago.

[ 1 ] The ability to walk on two legs emerged in early hominins after the split from chimpanzees , as an adaptation possibly associated with a shift from forest to savanna habitats.

[ 2 ] Hominins began to use rudimentary stone tools c.

3.3 million years ago, [ a ] marking the advent of the Paleolithic era.

[ 6 ] The genus Homo evolved from Australopithecus .

[ 7 ] The earliest record of Homo is the 2.8 million-year-old specimen LD 350-1 from Ethiopia, [ 8 ] and the earliest named species is Homo habilis which evolved by 2.3 million years ago.

[ 9 ] The most important difference between Homo habilis and Australopithecus was a 50% increase in brain size.

[ 10 ] H. erectus [ b ] evolved about 2 million years ago [ 11 ] [ c ] and was the first hominin species to leave Africa and disperse across Eurasia.

[ 13 ] Perhaps as early as 1.5 million years ago, but certainly by 250,000 years ago, hominins began to use fire for heat and cooking.

[ 14 ] Beginning about 500,000 years ago, Homo diversified into many new species of archaic humans such as the Neanderthals in Europe, the Denisovans in Siberia , and the diminutive H. floresiensis in Indonesia .

[ 15 ] Human evolution was not a simple linear or branched progression but involved interbreeding between related species .

[ 16 ] Genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages was common in human evolution.

[ 17 ] DNA evidence suggests that several genes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non- sub-Saharan African populations. Neanderthals and other hominins, such as Denisovans, may have contributed up to 6% of their genome to present-day non-sub-Saharan African humans.

[ 18 ] Early humans Main articles: Early modern human and Early human migrations Successive dispersals of Homo erectus (yellow), Homo neanderthalensis (ochre) during Out of Africa I and Homo sapiens (red, Out of Africa II ), with the numbers of years since they appeared before present .

Homo sapiens emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago [ d ] from the species Homo heidelbergensis .

[ e ] [ 20 ] Humans continued to develop over the succeeding millennia, and by 100,000 years ago, were using jewelry and ocher to adorn the body.

[ 21 ] By 50,000 years ago, they buried their dead, used projectile weapons, and engaged in seafaring.

[ 22 ] One of the most important changes (the date of which is unknown) was the development of syntactic language , which dramatically improved the human ability to communicate.

[ 23 ] Signs of early artistic expression can be found in the form of cave paintings and sculptures made from ivory, stone, and bone, implying a form of spirituality generally interpreted as animism [ 24 ] or shamanism .

[ 25 ] The earliest known musical instruments besides the human voice are bone flutes from the Swabian Jura in Germany, dated around 40,000 years old.

[ 26 ] Paleolithic humans lived as hunter-gatherers and were generally nomadic .

[ 27 ] Anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa in multiple waves beginning 194,000–177,000 years ago.

[ 28 ] [ f ] The dominant view among scholars is that the early waves of migration died out, and all modern non-Africans are descended from a single group that left Africa 70,000–50,000 years ago.

[ 32 ] [ g ] H. sapiens proceeded to colonize all the continents and larger islands, arriving in Australia 65,000 years ago, [ 34 ] Europe 45,000 years ago, [ 35 ] and the Americas 21,000 years ago.

[ 36 ] These migrations occurred during the most recent Ice Age , when various temperate regions of today were inhospitable.

[ 37 ] Nevertheless, by the end of the Ice Age some 12,000 years ago, humans had colonized nearly all ice-free parts of the globe.

[ 38 ] Human expansion coincided with both the Quaternary extinction event and the Neanderthal extinction .

[ 39 ] These extinctions were probably caused by climate change, human activity, or a combination of the two.

[ 40 ] Rise of agriculture Main article: Neolithic Beginning around 10,000 BCE, the Neolithic Revolution marked the development of agriculture , which fundamentally changed the human lifestyle.

[ 41 ] Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, [ 42 ] and included a diverse range of taxa , in at least 11 separate centers of origin .

[ 43 ] Cereal crop cultivation and animal domestication had occurred in Mesopotamia by at least 8500 BCE in the form of wheat, barley , sheep, and goats.

[ 44 ] The Yangtze River Valley in China domesticated rice around 8000–7000 BCE; the Yellow River Valley may have cultivated millet by 7000 BCE.

[ 45 ] Pigs were the most important domesticated animal in early China.

[ 46 ] People in Africa's Sahara cultivated sorghum and several other crops between 8000 and 5000 BCE, [ h ] while other agricultural centers arose in the Ethiopian Highlands and the West African rainforests.

[ 48 ] In the Indus River Valley , crops were cultivated by 7000 BCE and cattle were domesticated by 6500 BCE.

[ 49 ] In the Americas, squash was cultivated by at least 8500 BCE in South America, and domesticated arrowroot appeared in Central America by 7800 BCE.

[ 50 ] Potatoes were first cultivated in the Andes of South America, where the llama was also domesticated.

[ 51 ] It is likely that women played a central role in plant domestication throughout these developments.

[ 52 ] A pillar at Neolithic Göbekli Tepe Various explanations of the causes of the Neolithic Revolution have been proposed.

[ 53 ] Some theories identify population growth as the main factor, leading people to seek out new food sources. Others see population growth not as the cause but as the effect of the associated improvements in food supply.

[ 54 ] Further suggested factors include climate change, resource scarcity, and ideology.

[ 55 ] The transition to agriculture created food surpluses that could support people not directly engaged in food production, [ 56 ] permitting far denser populations and the creation of the first cities and states .

[ 57 ] Cities were centers of trade , manufacturing , and political power .

[ 58 ] They developed mutually beneficial relationships with the inhabitants of the surrounding countrysides , receiving agricultural products and providing manufactured goods and varying degrees of political control in return.

[ 59 ] Pastoral societies based on nomadic animal herding also developed, mostly in dry areas unsuited to plant cultivation, such as the Eurasian Steppe and the African Sahel .

[ 60 ] Conflict between nomadic herders and sedentary agriculturalists was frequent and became a recurring theme in world history.

[ 61 ] Metalworking was first used in the creation of copper tools and ornaments around 6400 BCE.

[ 48 ] Gold and silver soon followed, primarily for use in ornaments.

[ 48 ] The first signs of bronze , an alloy of copper and tin , date to around 4500 BCE, [ 62 ] but the alloy was not widely used until the 3rd millennium BCE.

[ 63 ] Ancient history Main articles: Ancient history and Timeline of ancient history Cradles of civilization Main articles: Cradle of civilization , Bronze Age , and Iron Age Great Pyramids of Giza , Egypt The Bronze Age saw the development of cities and civilizations .

[ 64 ] Early civilizations arose close to rivers, first in Mesopotamia (3300 BCE) with the Tigris and Euphrates , [ 65 ] followed by the Egyptian civilization along the Nile River (3200 BCE), [ 66 ] the Norte Chico civilization in coastal Peru (3100 BCE), [ 67 ] the Indus Valley civilization in Pakistan and northwestern India (2500 BCE), [ 68 ] and the Chinese civilization along the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers (2200 BCE).

[ 69 ] [ i ] These societies developed a number of shared characteristics, including a central government, a complex economy and social structure, and systems for keeping records.

[ 72 ] These cultures variously invented the wheel, [ 73 ] mathematics, [ 74 ] bronze-working, [ 75 ] sailing boats, [ 76 ] the potter's wheel , [ 75 ] woven cloth, [ 77 ] construction of monumental buildings, [ 77 ] and writing.

[ 78 ] Polytheistic religions developed, centered on temples where priests and priestesses performed sacrificial rites.

[ 79 ] Cuneiform inscription, eastern Turkey Writing facilitated the administration of cities, the expression of ideas, and the preservation of information.

[ 80 ] It may have independently developed in at least four ancient civilizations: Mesopotamia (3300 BCE), [ 81 ] Egypt (around 3250 BCE), [ 82 ] China (1200 BCE), [ 83 ] and lowland Mesoamerica (by 650 BCE).

[ 84 ] The earliest system of writing [ j ] was the Mesopotamian cuneiform script , which began as a system of pictographs , whose pictorial representations eventually became simplified and more abstract.

[ 86 ] [ k ] Other influential early writing systems include Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Indus script .

[ 88 ] In China, writing was first used during the Shang dynasty (1766–1045 BCE).

[ 89 ] Transport was facilitated by waterways, including rivers and seas, which fostered the projection of military power and the exchange of goods, ideas, and inventions.

[ 90 ] The Bronze Age also saw new land technologies, such as horse-based cavalry and chariots , that allowed armies to move faster.

[ 91 ] Trade became increasingly important as urban societies exchanged manufactured goods for raw materials from distant lands, creating vast commercial networks and the beginnings of archaic globalization .

[ 92 ] Bronze production in Southwest Asia, for example, required the import of tin from as far away as England.

[ 93 ] The growth of cities was often followed by the establishment of states and empires.

[ 94 ] In Egypt, the initial division into Upper and Lower Egypt was followed by the unification of the whole valley around 3100 BCE.

[ 95 ] Around 2600 BCE, the Indus Valley civilization built major cities at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro .

[ 96 ] Mesopotamian history was characterized by frequent wars between city-states, leading to shifts in hegemony from one city to another.

[ 97 ] In the 25th–21st centuries BCE, the empires of Akkad and the Neo-Sumerians arose in this area.

[ 98 ] In Crete, the Minoan civilization emerged by 2000 BCE and is regarded as the first civilization in Europe.

[ 99 ] Over the following millennia, civilizations developed across the world.

[ 100 ] By 1600 BCE, Mycenaean Greece began to develop.

[ 101 ] It flourished until the Late Bronze Age collapse that affected many Mediterranean civilizations between 1300 and 1000 BCE.

[ 102 ] The foundations of many cultural aspects in India were laid in the Vedic period (1750–600 BCE), including the emergence of Hinduism .

[ 103 ] [ l ] From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the Mahajanapadas were established across the subcontinent.

[ 105 ] Olmec colossal head , now at the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa Speakers of the Bantu languages began expanding across Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa as early as 3000 BCE until 1000 CE.

[ 106 ] Their expansion and encounters with other groups resulted in the displacement of the Pygmy peoples and the Khoisan , and in the spread of mixed farming and ironworking throughout sub-Saharan Africa, laying the foundations for later states.

[ 107 ] The Lapita culture emerged in the Bismarck Archipelago near New Guinea around 1500 BCE and colonized many uninhabited islands of Remote Oceania , reaching as far as Samoa by 700 BCE.

[ 108 ] In the Americas, the Norte Chico culture emerged in Peru around 3100 BCE.

[ 67 ] The Norte Chico built public monumental architecture at the city of Caral , dated 2627–1977 BCE.

[ 109 ] The later Chavín polity is sometimes described as the first Andean state, [ 110 ] centered on the religious site at Chavín de Huantar .

[ 111 ] Other important Andean cultures include the Moche , whose ceramics depict many aspects of daily life, and the Nazca , who created animal-shaped designs in the desert called Nazca lines .

[ 112 ] The Olmecs of Mesoamerica developed by about 1200 BCE [ 113 ] and are known for the colossal stone heads that they carved from basalt .

[ 114 ] They also devised the Mesoamerican calendar that was used by later cultures such as the Maya and Teotihuacan .

[ 115 ] Societies in North America were primarily egalitarian hunter-gatherers, supplementing their diet with the plants of the Eastern Agricultural Complex .

[ 116 ] They built earthworks such as Watson Brake (4000 BCE) and Poverty Point (3600 BCE), both in Louisiana.

[ 117 ] Axial Age Main article: Axial Age Standing Buddha from Gandhara , 2nd century CE From 800 to 200 BCE, [ 118 ] the Axial Age saw the emergence of transformative philosophical and religious ideas that developed in many different places mostly independently of each other.

[ 119 ] Chinese Confucianism , [ 120 ] Indian Buddhism and Jainism , [ 121 ] and Jewish monotheism all arose during this period.

[ 122 ] Persian Zoroastrianism began earlier, perhaps around 1000 BCE, but was institutionalized by the Achaemenid Empire during the Axial Age.

[ 123 ] New philosophies took hold in Greece during the 5th century BCE, epitomized by thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle .

[ 124 ] The first Olympic Games were held in 776 BCE, marking a period known as " classical antiquity ".

[ 125 ] In 508 BCE, the world's first democratic system of government was instituted in Athens .

[ 126 ] Axial Age ideas shaped subsequent intellectual and religious history. Confucianism was one of the three schools of thought that came to dominate Chinese thinking, along with Taoism and Legalism .

[ 127 ] The Confucian tradition, which would become particularly influential, looked for political morality not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition.

[ 128 ] Confucianism would later spread to Korea and Japan.

[ 129 ] Buddhism reached China in about the 1st century CE [ 130 ] and spread widely, with 30,000 Buddhist temples in northern China alone by the 7th century CE.

[ 131 ] Buddhism became the main religion in much of South, Southeast, and East Asia.

[ 132 ] The Greek philosophical tradition [ 133 ] diffused throughout the Mediterranean world and as far as India, starting in the 4th century BCE after the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon .

[ 134 ] Both Christianity and Islam developed from the beliefs of Judaism .

[ 135 ] Regional empires The millennium from 500 BCE to 500 CE saw a series of empires of unprecedented size develop. Well-trained professional armies, unifying ideologies, and advanced bureaucracies created the possibility for emperors to rule over large domains whose populations could attain numbers upwards of tens of millions of subjects.

[ 136 ] International trade also expanded, most notably the massive trade routes in the Mediterranean Sea, the maritime trade web in the Indian Ocean , and the Silk Road .

[ 137 ] Carving of Persian and Median soldiers, Persepolis , Achaemenid Empire , 5th century BCE The kingdom of the Medes helped to destroy the Assyrian Empire in tandem with the nomadic Scythians and the Babylonians .

[ 138 ] Nineveh , the capital of Assyria, was sacked by the Medes in 612 BCE.

[ 139 ] The Median Empire gave way to successive Iranian states, including the Achaemenid (550–330 BCE), [ 140 ] Parthian (247 BCE – 224 CE), [ 141 ] and Sasanian Empires (224–651 CE).

[ 142 ] Two major empires began in modern-day Greece . In the late 5th century BCE, several Greek city states checked the Achaemenid Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars . These wars were followed by the Golden Age of Athens , the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization , including the first theatrical performances .

[ 143 ] The wars led to the creation of the Delian League , founded in 477 BCE, [ 144 ] and eventually the Athenian Empire (454–404 BCE), which was defeated by a Spartan-led coalition during the Peloponnesian War .

[ 145 ] Philip of Macedon unified the Greek city-states into the Hellenic League and his son Alexander the Great (356–323 BCE) founded an empire extending from present-day Greece to India.

[ 146 ] The empire divided into several successor states shortly after his death, resulting in the founding of many cities and the spread of Greek culture throughout conquered regions, a process referred to as Hellenization .

[ 147 ] The Hellenistic period lasted from the death of Alexander in 323 BCE until 31 BCE, when Ptolemaic Egypt fell to Rome.

[ 148 ] The Colosseum in Rome In Europe, the Roman Republic was founded in the 6th century BCE [ 149 ] and began expanding its territory in the 3rd century BCE.

[ 150 ] Prior to this, the Carthaginian Empire had dominated the Mediterranean, however lost three successive wars to the Romans. The Republic became an empire and by the time of Augustus (63 BCE – 14 CE), it had established dominion over most of the Mediterranean Sea.

[ 151 ] The empire continued to grow and reached its peak under Trajan (53–117 CE), controlling much of the land from England to Mesopotamia.

[ 152 ] The two centuries that followed are known as the Pax Romana , a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and political stability in most of Europe.

[ 153 ] Christianity was legalized by Constantine I in 313 CE after three centuries of imperial persecution . It became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 CE while the emperor Theodosius outlawed pagan religions in 391–392 CE.

[ 154 ] In South Asia, Chandragupta Maurya founded the Maurya Empire (320–185 BCE), which flourished under Ashoka the Great .

[ 155 ] From the 4th to 6th centuries CE, the Gupta Empire oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's golden age.

[ 156 ] The resulting stability helped usher in a flourishing period for Hindu and Buddhist culture in the 4th and 5th centuries, as well as major advances in science and mathematics.

[ 157 ] In South India , three prominent Dravidian kingdoms emerged: the Cheras , Cholas , and Pandyas .

[ 158 ] Pillar erected by Ashoka , a Mauryan Emperor in India In China, Qin Shi Huang put an end to the chaotic Warring States period by uniting all of China under the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE).

[ 159 ] Qin Shi Huang was an adherent of the Legalist school of thought and he displaced the hereditary aristocracy by creating an efficient system of administration staffed by officials appointed according to merit.

[ 160 ] The harshness of the Qin dynasty led to rebellions and the dynasty's fall.

[ 161 ] It was followed by the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE), which combined the Legalist bureaucratic system with Confucian ideals.

[ 162 ] The Han dynasty was comparable in power and influence to the Roman Empire that lay at the other end of the Silk Road.

[ 163 ] As economic prosperity fueled their military expansion, the Han conquered parts of Mongolia, Central Asia, Manchuria , Korea, and northern Vietnam.

[ 164 ] As with other empires during the classical period, Han China advanced significantly in the areas of government, education, science, and technology.

[ 165 ] The Han invented the compass , one of China's Four Great Inventions .

[ 166 ] Obelisk of Axum , Ethiopia In Africa, the Kingdom of Kush prospered through its interactions with both Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa.

[ 167 ] It ruled Egypt as the Twenty-fifth Dynasty from 712 to 650 BCE, then continued as an agricultural and trading state based in the city of Meroë until the fourth century CE.

[ 168 ] The Kingdom of Aksum , centered in present-day Ethiopia, established itself by the 1st century CE as a major trading empire, dominating its neighbors in South Arabia and Kush and controlling the Red Sea trade.

[ 169 ] It minted its own currency and carved enormous monolithic stelae to mark its emperors' graves.

[ 170 ] Successful regional empires were also established in the Americas, arising from cultures established as early as 2500 BCE.

[ 171 ] In Mesoamerica, vast pre-Columbian societies were built, the most notable being the Zapotec civilization (700 BCE – 1521 CE), [ 172 ] and the Maya civilization, which reached its highest state of development during the Mesoamerican classic period ( c.

250–900 CE ), [ 173 ] but continued throughout the post-classic period.

[ 174 ] The great Maya city-states slowly rose in number and prominence, and Maya culture spread throughout the Yucatán and surrounding areas.

[ 175 ] The Maya developed a writing system and used the concept of zero in their mathematics.

[ 176 ] West of the Maya area, in central Mexico, the city of Teotihuacan prospered due to its control of the obsidian trade.

[ 177 ] Its power peaked around 450 CE, when its 125,000–150,000 inhabitants made it one of the world's largest cities.

[ 178 ] Technology developed sporadically in the ancient world.

[ 179 ] There were periods of rapid technological progress, such as the Greco-Roman era in the Mediterranean region.

[ 180 ] Greek science , technology , and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period, typified by devices such as the Antikythera mechanism .

[ 181 ] There were also periods of technological decay, such as the Roman Empire's decline and fall and the ensuing early medieval period.

[ 182 ] Two of the most important innovations were paper (China, 1st and 2nd centuries CE) [ 183 ] and the stirrup (India, 2nd century BCE and Central Asia, 1st century CE), [ 184 ] both of which diffused widely throughout the world. The Chinese learned to make silk and built massive engineering projects such as the Great Wall of China and the Grand Canal .

[ 185 ] The Romans were also accomplished builders, inventing concrete , perfecting the use of arches in construction, and creating aqueducts to transport water over long distances to urban centers.

[ 186 ] Most ancient societies practiced slavery , [ 187 ] which was particularly prevalent in Athens and Rome , where slaves made up a large proportion of the population and were foundational to the economy.

[ 188 ] Patriarchy was also common, with men controlling more political and economic power than women.

[ 189 ] Declines, falls, and resurgence European migrations by mostly Germanic peoples , 2nd–6th centuries The ancient empires faced common problems associated with maintaining huge armies and supporting a central bureaucracy .

[ 190 ] In Rome and Han China, the state began to decline, and barbarian pressure on the frontiers hastened internal dissolution.

[ 190 ] The Han dynasty fell into civil war in 220 CE, beginning the Three Kingdoms period, while its Roman counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the same time in what is known as the Crisis of the Third Century .

[ 191 ] From the Eurasian steppe, horse-based nomads dominated a large part of the continent.

[ 192 ] The development of the stirrup and the use of horse archers made the nomads a constant threat to sedentary civilizations.

[ 193 ] In the 4th century CE, the Roman Empire split into western and eastern regions, with usually separate emperors.

[ 194 ] The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 CE to German influence under Odoacer in the Migration Period of the Germanic peoples .

[ 194 ] The Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire , was more long-lasting.

[ 195 ] In China, dynasties rose and fell, but, in sharp contrast to the Mediterranean-European world, political unity was always eventually restored.

[ 196 ] After the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty and the demise of the Three Kingdoms, nomadic tribes from the north began to invade, causing many Chinese people to flee southward.

[ 197 ] Post-classical history Main articles: Post-classical history and Timeline of post-classical history Portrait of Alfraganus in the Compilatio astronomica , 1493.

Islamic astronomers began just before the 9th century to collect and translate Indian , Persian and Greek astronomical texts, adding their own astronomy and enabling later, particularly European astronomy to build on.

[ 198 ] Symbolic for the post-classical period, a period of an increasing trans-regional literary culture, particularly in the sciences, spreading and building on methods of science.

The post-classical period, dated roughly from 500 to 1500 CE, [ m ] was characterized by the rise and spread of major religions while civilization expanded to new parts of the world and trade between societies intensified.

[ 200 ] From the 10th to 13th centuries, the Medieval Warm Period in the northern hemisphere aided agriculture and led to population growth in parts of Europe and Asia.

[ 201 ] It was followed by the Little Ice Age , which, along with the plagues of the 14th century, put downward pressure on the population of Eurasia.

[ 201 ] Major inventions of the period were gunpowder , guns, and printing, all of which originated in China.

[ 202 ] The post-classical period encompasses the early Muslim conquests , the Islamic Golden Age , and the commencement and expansion of the Arab slave trade , followed by the Mongol invasions and the founding of the Ottoman Empire.

[ 203 ] South Asia had a series of middle kingdoms , followed by the establishment of Islamic empires in India.

[ 204 ] In West Africa, the Mali and Songhai Empires rose.

[ 436 ] The Korean Joseon dynasty (1392–1910) ruled throughout this period, repelling invasions from Japan and China in the 16th and 17th centuries.

[ 437 ] Expanded maritime trade with Europe significantly affected China and Japan during this period, particularly through the Portuguese in Macau and the Dutch in Nagasaki .

[ 438 ] However, China and Japan later pursued isolationist policies [ t ] designed to eliminate foreign influences.

[ 439 ] Southeast Asia In 1511, the Portuguese overthrew the Malacca Sultanate in present-day Malaysia and Indonesian Sumatra .

[ 440 ] The Portuguese held this important trading territory (and the valuable associated navigational strait) until overthrown by the Dutch in 1641.

[ 376 ] The Johor Sultanate , centered on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, became the dominant trading power in the region.

[ 441 ] European colonization expanded with the Dutch in Indonesia , the Portuguese in Timor , and the Spaniards in the Philippines .

[ 442 ] Oceania The Pacific Islands of Oceania were also affected by European contact, starting with the circumnavigational voyage of Ferdinand Magellan (1519–1522), [ u ] who landed in the Marianas and other islands.

[ 443 ] Abel Tasman (1642–1644) sailed to present-day Australia , New Zealand , and nearby islands.

[ 444 ] James Cook (1768–1779) made the first recorded European contact with Hawaii .

[ 445 ] In 1788, Britain founded its first Australian colony .

[ 446 ] Americas Several European powers colonized the Americas, largely displacing the native populations and conquering the advanced civilizations of the Aztecs and Inca.

[ 447 ] Diseases introduced by Europeans devastated American societies, killing 60–90 million people by 1600 and reducing the population by 90–95%.

[ 448 ] In some cases, colonial policies included the deliberate genocide of indigenous peoples .

[ 449 ] Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France all made extensive territorial claims, and undertook large-scale settlement, including the importation of large numbers of African slaves.

[ 450 ] One side-effect of the slave trade was cultural exchange through which various African traditions found their way to the Americas, including cuisine, music, and dance.

[ 451 ] [ v ] Portugal claimed Brazil , while Spain seized the rest of South America, Mesoamerica, and southern North America.

[ 452 ] The Spaniards mined and exported prodigious amounts of gold and silver, leading to a surge in inflation known as the Price Revolution in the 16th and 17th centuries in Western Europe.

[ 453 ] In North America, Britain colonized the east coast while France settled the central region.

[ 454 ] Russia made incursions into the northwest coast of North America, with its first colony in present-day Alaska in 1784, [ 455 ] and the outpost of Fort Ross in present-day California in 1812.

[ 456 ] France lost its North American territory to England and Spain after the Seven Years' War (1756–1763).

[ 457 ] Britain's Thirteen Colonies declared independence as the United States in 1776, ratified by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, ending the American Revolutionary War .

[ 458 ] In 1791, African slaves launched a successful rebellion in the French colony of Saint-Domingue . France won back its continental claims from Spain in 1800, but sold them to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.

[ 459 ] Modern era Main articles: Modern era , 19th century , 20th century , and 21st century Long nineteenth century Main article: Long nineteenth century See also: Age of Revolution and New Imperialism James Watt 's steam engine powered the Industrial Revolution .

The long nineteenth century traditionally starts with the French Revolution in 1789, [ w ] and lasts until the outbreak of World War I in 1914.

[ 462 ] It saw the global spread of the Industrial Revolution, the greatest transformation of the world economy since the Neolithic Revolution.

[ 463 ] The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain around 1770 and used new modes of production—the factory, mass production , and mechanization —to manufacture a wide array of goods faster while using less labor than previously required.

[ 464 ] Industrialization raised the global standard of living but caused upheaval as factory owners and workers clashed over wages and working conditions.

[ 465 ] Along with industrialization came modern globalization , the increasing interconnection of world regions in the economic, political, and cultural spheres.

[ 466 ] Globalization began in the early 19th century and was enabled by improved transportation technologies such as railroads and steamships .

[ 467 ] Empires of the world in 1898 European empires lost territories in Latin America , which won independence by the 1820s through military campaigns, [ 468 ] but expanded elsewhere as their industrial economies gave them an advantage over the rest of the world.

[ 469 ] Britain gained control of the Indian subcontinent, Burma, Malaya, North Borneo, Hong Kong , and Aden ; the French took Indochina; and the Dutch cemented their rule over Indonesia.

[ 470 ] The British also colonized Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa with large numbers of British colonists emigrating to these colonies.

[ 471 ] Russia colonized large pre-agricultural areas of Siberia.

[ 472 ] The United States completed its westward expansion , establishing control over the territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast.

[ 473 ] In the late 19th century to early 20th century, the European powers, driven by the Second Industrial Revolution , rapidly conquered and colonized almost the entirety of Africa .

[ 474 ] Only Ethiopia and Liberia remained independent.

[ 475 ] Imperial rule in Africa involved many atrocities such as those in the Congo Free State and the Herero and Nama genocide .

[ 476 ] Within Europe, economic and military competition fostered the creation and consolidation of nation-states, and other ethno-cultural communities began to identify themselves as distinctive nations with aspirations for their own cultural and political autonomy.

[ 477 ] This nationalism became important to peoples across the world in the 19th and 20th centuries.

[ 478 ] In the first wave of democratization , between 1828 and 1926,  democratic institutions were established in 33 countries worldwide.

[ 479 ] Most of the world abolished slavery and serfdom in the 19th century.

[ 480 ] Over several decades, beginning in the late 19th century and continuing throughout the 20th, [ 481 ] in many countries the women's suffrage movement won women the right to vote, [ 482 ] and women began to enjoy greater access to education and to professions beyond domestic employment.

[ 483 ] The first airplane, the Wright Flyer , flew on 17 December 1903.

In response to encroachment by European powers, several countries undertook programs of industrialization and political reform along Western lines.

[ 484 ] The Meiji Restoration in Japan led to the establishment of a colonial empire , while the tanzimat reforms in the Ottoman Empire did little to slow the Ottoman decline.

[ 485 ] China achieved some success with its Self-Strengthening Movement but was devastated by the Taiping Rebellion , history's bloodiest civil war, which between 1850 and 1864 killed 20–30 million people.

[ 486 ] By the end of the century, the United States became the world's largest economy.

[ 487 ] During the Second Industrial Revolution , new technological advances, involving electric power , the internal combustion engine , and assembly-line manufacturing, further increased productivity.

[ 488 ] Technological innovations also provided new avenues for artistic expression through the media of photography , sound recording , and film .

[ 489 ] Meanwhile, industrial pollution and environmental degradation accelerated drastically.

[ 490 ] Balloon flight had been invented in the late 18th century, but it was only at the beginning of the 20th century that powered aircraft were developed .

[ 491 ] The 20th century opened with Europe at an apex of wealth and power.

[ 492 ] Much of the world was under its direct colonial control or its indirect influence through heavily Europeanized nations like the United States and Japan.

[ 493 ] As the century unfolded, however, the global system dominated by rival powers experienced severe strains and ultimately yielded to a more fluid structure of independent nation states .

[ 494 ] World wars Main articles: World War I and World War II This transformation was catalyzed by wars of unparalleled scope and devastation.

World War I was a global conflict from 1914 to 1918 between the Allies , led by France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and the Central Powers , led by Germany, Austria-Hungary , the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. It had an estimated death toll ranging from 10 to 22.5 million and resulted in the collapse of four empires – the Austro-Hungarian , German , Ottoman, and Russian Empires.

[ 495 ] Its new emphasis on industrial technology had made traditional military tactics obsolete.

[ 496 ] The Armenian , Assyrian , and Greek genocides saw the systematic destruction, mass murder, and expulsion of those populations in the Ottoman Empire.

[ 497 ] From 1918 to 1920, the Spanish flu caused the deaths of at least 25 million people.

[ 498 ] Atomic bombing of Nagasaki , 1945 In the war's aftermath a League of Nations was formed in the hope of averting future international conflicts; [ 499 ] and powerful ideologies rose to prominence. The Russian Revolution of 1917 created the first communist state, [ 500 ] while the 1920s and 1930s saw fascist political parties gain control in Italy and Germany .

[ 501 ] [ x ] The Soviet Union, during Joseph Stalin 's rule from 1924 to 1953, committed countless atrocities against its own people, including mass purges , forced labor camps , and widespread famine caused by state policies.

[ 503 ] Ongoing national rivalries, exacerbated by the economic turmoil of the Great Depression , helped precipitate World War II .

[ 504 ] In that war, the vast majority of the world's countries, including all the great powers , fought as part of two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . The leading Axis powers were Germany, Japan, and Italy; [ 505 ] while the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union , and the Republic of China were the " Big Four " Allied powers.

[ 506 ] The militaristic governments of Germany and Japan pursued an ultimately doomed course of imperialist expansionism . In the course of doing so, Germany orchestrated the genocide of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust , and of millions of non-Jews across German-occupied Europe , [ 507 ] while Japan murdered millions of Chinese.

[ 508 ] The war also saw the introduction and use of nuclear weapons , which brought unprecedented destruction and ultimately led to Japan's surrender.

[ 509 ] Estimates of the war's total casualties range from 55 to 80 million.

[ 510 ] Contemporary history Main article: Contemporary history When World War II ended in 1945, the United Nations was founded in the hope of preventing future wars, [ 511 ] as the League of Nations had been formed following World War I.

[ 512 ] The United Nations championed the human rights movement , in 1948 adopting a Universal Declaration of Human Rights .

[ 513 ] Several European countries formed what would evolve into a 27-member-state economic and political  community, the European Union .

[ 514 ] World War II had opened the way for the advance of communism into Eastern and Central Europe, China, North Korea , North Vietnam , and Cuba .

[ 515 ] To contain this advance, the United States established a global network of alliances.

[ 516 ] The largest, NATO , was established in 1949 and eventually grew to include 32 member states .

[ 517 ] In response, in 1955 the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies formed the Warsaw Pact mutual-defense treaty.

[ 518 ] Fall of the Berlin Wall , 1989 The United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the primary global powers in the aftermath of World War II.

[ 519 ] Both nations harbored deep suspicions and fears about the global spread of the other's political-economic system — capitalism for the United States and communism for the Soviet Union.

[ 520 ] This mutual distrust sparked the Cold War , a 45-year stand-off and arms race between the two nations and their allies.

[ 521 ] With the development of nuclear weapons during World War II and their subsequent proliferation , all of humanity was put at risk of nuclear war between the two superpowers, as demonstrated by many incidents , most prominently the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis .

[ 522 ] Such war being viewed as impractical , the superpowers instead waged proxy wars in non-nuclear-armed Third World countries.

[ 523 ] The Cold War ended peacefully in 1991 after the Soviet Union collapsed , [ 524 ] partly due to its inability to compete economically with the United States and Western Europe.

[ 525 ] Cold War preparations to deter or fight a third world war accelerated advances in technologies that, though conceptualized before World War II, had been implemented for that war's exigencies, such as jet aircraft , [ 526 ] rocketry , [ 527 ] and computers.

[ 528 ] In the decades after World War II, these advances led to jet travel; [ 526 ] artificial satellites with innumerable applications, [ 529 ] including GPS ; [ 530 ] and the Internet , [ 529 ] which in the 1990s began to gain traction as a form of communication.

[ 531 ] These inventions revolutionized the movement of people, ideas, and information.

[ 532 ] Last Moon landing: Apollo 17 (1972) The second half of the 20th century also saw groundbreaking scientific and technological developments such as the discovery of the structure of DNA [ 533 ] and DNA sequencing , [ 534 ] the worldwide eradication of smallpox , [ 535 ] the Green Revolution in agriculture, [ 536 ] the discovery of plate tectonics , [ 537 ] the moon landings , [ 538 ] crewed and uncrewed exploration of space , [ 539 ] advances in energy technologies , [ 540 ] and foundational discoveries in physics phenomena ranging from the smallest entities ( particle physics ) to the greatest ( physical cosmology ).

[ 537 ] These technical innovations had far-reaching effects.

[ 541 ] During the 20th century the world's population quadrupled to six billion, while world economic output increased by a factor of 20.

[ 542 ] Toward the end of the 20th century, the rate of population growth started to decline, in part because of increased awareness of family planning and better access to contraceptives .

[ 543 ] Parts of the world now have sub-replacement fertility rates.

[ 544 ] Public health measures and advances in medical science contributed to a sharp increase in global life expectancy at birth from about 31 years in 1900 to over 66 years in 2000.

[ 545 ] [ y ] In 1820, 75% of humanity lived on less than one dollar a day, while in 2001 only about 20% did.

[ 547 ] At the same time, economic inequality increased both within individual countries and between rich and poor countries.

[ 548 ] The importance of public education had already begun to increase in the 18th and 19th centuries [ z ] but it was not until the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century that compulsory free education was provided to most children worldwide .

[ 550 ] [ aa ] In China, the Maoist government implemented industrialization and collectivization policies as part of the Great Leap Forward (1958–1962), leading to the starvation deaths (1959–1961) of 30–40 million people.

[ 552 ] After these policies were rescinded, China entered a period of economic liberalization and rapid growth, with the economy expanding by 6.6% per year from 1978 to 2003.

[ 553 ] Shanghai . China urbanized rapidly in the 21st century.

In the postwar decades, in a process of decolonization , the African , Asian , and Oceanian colonies of European empires won their formal independence.

[ 554 ] Postcolonial states in Africa struggled to grow their economies, facing structural barriers such as reliance on the export of commodities rather than manufactured goods.

[ 555 ] Sub-Saharan Africa was the world region hit hardest by the HIV/AIDS pandemic of the late 20th century.

[ 556 ] Moreover, Africa experienced high levels of violence, as in the Second Congo War (1998–2003), the deadliest conflict since World War II.

[ 557 ] The Near East experienced numerous conflicts, including the Iran-Iraq War , the first and second Gulf wars , and the Syrian Civil War , as well as tensions and conflicts between Israel and Palestine .

[ 558 ] Development efforts in Latin America were hindered by over-reliance on commodity exports [ 559 ] and by political instability, some of it caused by United States involvement in regime change in Latin America .

[ 560 ] COVID-19 pandemic , 2020 The early 21st century was marked by growing economic globalization and integration , [ 561 ] which brought both benefits and risks to interlinked economies, as exemplified by the Great Recession of the late 2000s and early 2010s.

[ 562 ] Communications expanded, with smartphones and social media becoming ubiquitous worldwide by the mid-2010s. By the early 2020s, artificial intelligence systems improved to the point of outperforming humans at many circumscribed tasks.

[ 563 ] The influence of religion continued to decline in many Western countries, while some parts of the Muslim world saw the rise of fundamentalist movements .

[ 564 ] In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic substantially disrupted global trading, caused recessions in the global economy, and spurred cultural paradigm shifts .

[ 565 ] Concerns grew as existential threats from environmental degradation and global warming became increasingly evident, [ 566 ] while mitigation efforts , including a shift to sustainable energy , made gradual progress.

[ 567 ] Academic research The study of human history has a long tradition and early precursors were already practiced in the ancient period as attempts to provide comprehensive accounts of the history of the world.

[ ab ] Most research before the 20th century focused on histories of individual communities and societies after the prehistoric period. This changed in the late 20th century, when attempts to integrate the diverse narratives into a common context reaching back to the emergence of the first humans became a central research topic.

[ 569 ] This transition to a widened perspective was accompanied by questioning Eurocentrism and the Western-focused perspective that had previously dominated academic history.

[ 570 ] Like in other historical disciplines, the methodology of analyzing textual sources to construct narratives and interpretations of past events plays a central role in the study of human history. The scope of its topic poses the unique challenge of synthesizing a coherent and comprehensive narrative spanning different cultures, regions, and time periods while taking diverse individual perspectives into account. This is also reflected in its interdisciplinary approach by integrating insights from fields belonging to the humanities and the social , biological, and physical sciences , such as other historical disciplines , archaeology , anthropology , linguistics , genetics , paleontology , and geology . The interdisciplinary approach is of particular importance to the study of human history before the invention of writing.

[ 571 ] Periodization To provide an accessible overview, historians divide human history into different periods organized around key themes, events, or developments that have shaped human societies over time. The number of periods and their time frames depend on the chosen topics, and the transitions between periods are often more fluid than static periodization schemes suggest.

[ 572 ] A traditionally influential periodization in European scholarship distinguishes between the ancient, medieval, and modern periods [ 573 ] organized around historical events responsible for major shifts in political, economic, and cultural structures to mark the transitions between the periods: first the fall of the Western Roman Empire and later the emergence of the Renaissance.

[ 574 ] Another periodization divides human history into three periods based on the way humans engage with nature to produce goods. The first transition happened with the emergence of agriculture and husbandry to replace hunting and gathering as the main means of food production. The Industrial Revolution constitutes the second transition.

[ 575 ] A further approach uses the relations between societies to divide the history of the world into the periods of Middle Eastern dominance before 500 BCE, Eurasian cultural balance until 1500 CE, and Western dominance afterwards.

[ 576 ] The invention of writing is often used to demark prehistory from the ancient period while another approach divides early history based on the type of tools used in the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages.

[ 577 ] Historians focusing on religion and culture identify the Axial Age as a key turning point that laid the spiritual and philosophical foundations of many of the world's major civilizations. Some historians draw on elements from different approaches to arrive at a more nuanced periodization.
