To the east are the mainland of Scotland and the northern Inner Hebrides (including Skye and the Small Isles ); to the west are the southern Outer Hebrides islands, principally South Uist , Eriskay , and Barra . To the north is the Little Minch , a channel connecting it with the Minch .

[ 2 ] The Sea of the Hebrides forms part of the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland , as defined by the International Hydrographic Organization , [ 3 ] and part of the Seas west of Scotland as far as fisheries management is concerned.

Ending on 30 August 2019, the Scottish Government consulted on a proposal to designate the Sea of the Hebrides a Marine Protected Area (MPA).

[ 4 ] The designation was confirmed in December 2020.

[ 5 ] The designated area of the MPA covers 1,003,900 hectares (10,039 km 2 ), mainly to protect the area's population of basking sharks and minke whales .
