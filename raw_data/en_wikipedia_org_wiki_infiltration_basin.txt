It is essentially a shallow artificial pond that is designed to infiltrate stormwater through permeable soils into the groundwater aquifer .  Infiltration basins do not release water except by infiltration, evaporation or emergency overflow during flood conditions.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] It is distinguished from a detention basin , sometimes called a dry pond , which is designed to discharge to a downstream water body (although it may incidentally infiltrate some of its volume to groundwater); and from a retention basin , which is designed to include a permanent pool of water.

Design considerations [ edit ] Infiltration basins must be carefully designed to infiltrate the soil on a given site at a rate that will not cause flooding.  They may be less effective in areas with: High groundwater levels, close to the infiltrating surface Compacted soils High levels of sediment in stormwater High clay soil content.

[ 6 ] At some sites infiltration basins have worked effectively where the installation also includes an extended detention basin as a pretreatment stage, to remove sediment.

[ 7 ] The basins may fail where they cannot be frequently maintained, and their use is discouraged in some areas of the United States . For example, they are not recommended for use in the U.S. state of Georgia , which has many areas with high clay soil content, unless soil on the particular site is modified ("engineered soil") during construction, to improve the infiltration characteristics.
