Space burials launch cremated remains out of the atmosphere.

Space burial is the launching of human remains into space. Missions may go into orbit around the Earth or to extraterrestrial bodies such as the Moon, or farther into space.

Remains are sealed until the spacecraft burns up upon re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere or they reach their extraterrestrial destinations. Suborbital flights briefly transport them into space then return to Earth where they can be recovered. Small samples of remains are usually launched to minimize the cost of launching mass into space, thereby making such services more affordable.

History and typology [ edit ] The concept of launching human remains into space using conventional rockets was proposed by the science fiction author Neil R. Jones in the novella "The Jameson Satellite", which was published in the pulp magazine Amazing Stories in 1931.

[ 1 ] It was later proposed as a commercial service in the 1965 movie, The Loved One , [ 2 ] and by Richard DeGroot in a Seattle Times newspaper article on April 3, 1977.

[ 3 ] Since 1997, the private company Celestis has conducted numerous space burials flying as secondary payloads .

[ 4 ] Gene Roddenberry (third from the right) in 1976 with most of the cast of Star Trek at the rollout of the Space Shuttle Enterprise at the Rockwell International plant at Palmdale, California , US Maiden flights [ edit ] The first space burial occurred in 1992 when the NASA Space Shuttle Columbia (mission STS-52 ) carried a sample of Gene Roddenberry 's cremated remains into space and returned them to Earth.

[ 5 ] The first private space burial, Celestis' Earthview 01: The Founders Flight , was launched on April 21, 1997. An aircraft departing from the Canary Islands carried a Pegasus rocket containing samples of the remains of 24 people to an altitude of 11 km (6.8 mi) above the Atlantic Ocean. The rocket then carried the remains into an elliptical orbit with an apogee of 578 km (359 mi) and a perigee of 551 km (342 mi), orbiting the Earth once every 96 minutes until re-entry on May 20, 2002, northeast of Australia.  Famous people on this flight included Roddenberry and Timothy Leary .

[ 6 ] Suborbital flights [ edit ] Short flights that cross the boundary of space without attempting to reach orbital velocity are a cost-effective method of space burial. The remains do not burn up and are either recovered or lost.

Moon burial [ edit ] The first Moon burial was that of Eugene Merle Shoemaker , a portion of whose cremated remains were flown to the Moon by NASA.

[ 7 ] Shoemaker's former colleague Carolyn Porco , a University of Arizona professor, proposed and produced the tribute of having Shoemaker's ashes launched aboard the NASA's Lunar Prospector spacecraft.

[ 8 ] Ten days after Shoemaker's passing, Porco had the go-ahead from NASA administrators and delivered the ashes to the Lunar Prospector Mission Director Scott Hubbard at the NASA Ames Research Center .

[ 7 ] [ 9 ] The ashes were accompanied by a piece of brass foil inscribed with an image of Comet Hale–Bopp , an image of a Meteor Crater in northern Arizona, and a passage from William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet .

[ 7 ] The Lunar Prospector spacecraft was launched on January 6, 1998, and impacted the south polar region of the Moon on July 31, 1999.

[ 10 ] Missions to the Moon are proposed by both Elysium Space [ 11 ] and Celestis as part of a mission by Astrobotic Technology of Pittsburgh. The first mission in January 2024 failed to reach the Moon due to a failure of the spacecraft and instead reentered Earth's atmosphere shortly after.

[ 12 ] Pet burial [ edit ] In 2014, Celestis launched Celestis Pets, a pet memorial spaceflight service for animal cremated remains.

[ 13 ] Prior to then, Bismarck, a Monroe, Washington police dog may have flown on a 2012 memorial spaceflight. When this news broke, Celestis' president said that if dog ashes were on the rocket, the person who supplied the cremated remains likely violated the contract they signed with Celestis.

[ 14 ] Dedicated spacecraft [ edit ] On May 17, 2017, Elysium Space announced the world's first memorial flight involving a dedicated spacecraft. The CubeSat was placed as a secondary payload on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of a dedicated rideshare mission called SSO-A planned by Spaceflight . The launch took place from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on December 3, 2018.

[ 15 ] The launch was successful, however, industry sources have noted that the Elysium Star spacecraft remained attached to the deployer due to a failure to procure proper licensing.

[ 16 ] Space burial businesses [ edit ] Space burial businesses generally refer to their service offering as "Memorial Spaceflight".
