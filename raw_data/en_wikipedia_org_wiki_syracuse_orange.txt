Archbold , what was publicized as the "Greatest Athletic Arena in America" opened in 1907. Designed to resemble the Roman Colosseum and to never become outdated, Archbold Stadium became a trademark of Syracuse football. The stadium formed a massive concrete oval, 670 feet (204 m) long and 475 feet (145 m) wide. It was 100 feet (30 m) longer and only 22 feet (7 m) thinner than the JMA Wireless Dome, and more than 6 million Orangemen football fans passed through its gates.

From 1907 until 1978, Archbold Stadium was the home of SU football. Archbold opened up with a bang when the Orange defeated Hobart 28–0. It went out in style 71 years later, with an improbable victory over second-ranked Navy 20–17. Syracuse posted a record of 265–112–50 at Archbold, and it housed many great teams. It was home of the 1915 squad, which was invited to play in the prestigious Rose Bowl and outscored its opponents 331 to 16.

Prior to that time, the school's colors were rose pink and pea green. In 1898, a proposition to add secondary blue color was vehemently opposed by students and alumni.

[ 27 ] Orange, blue, and white are traditionally used for athletic uniforms.

[ 28 ] According to an 1890 newspaper article uncovered by the Syracuse Post Standard , the orange was originally a reference to the Netherlands , which first colonized New York State.

[ 29 ] It's common in upstate New York for place names to make reference to the Dutch heritage. In a similar way, the original settlement that became Albany was called Fort Orange .

The athletic nickname derives from the official color. Prior to 2004, the official nicknames of the athletic teams were the "Orangemen" and "Orangewomen." These former nicknames are still affectionately used by some fans. However, beginning with the 2004–2005 school year, the official nickname was changed to the "Orange." This revision is gender-neutral , concise, and reflects the basis of the nickname as being the school color.

Other nicknames over the years have included the "Hilltoppers," for the school's location on a hill, and the " Saltine Warriors ," for a former mascot.

[ citation needed ] Mascot [ edit ] The Saltine Warrior [ edit ] Main article: The Saltine Warrior In 1931, a Native American warrior known as Nathan March aka: " Saltine Warrior " became the athletic mascot. The name derived from an article describing an archaeological dig on campus allegedly uncovering the artifacts of a Native American warrior.

[ 30 ] The warrior was called the "Saltine Warrior" because of the abundant salt deposits in the Syracuse, New York area. The article was later revealed to be a hoax, but the mascot remained for next four decades.

In the mid-1950s, the father of a Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity brother owned a cheerleading camp. He made a Saltine Warrior costume for his son to wear at Syracuse football games.

[ 31 ] Thus began a nearly forty-year tradition of Lambda Chi brothers serving as the university's mascot.

In 1978, the Saltine Warrior was banned by the university as part of the national movement to eliminate Native American motifs, becoming one of the first colleges to do so. The mascot briefly morphed into a Roman warrior, but was eventually replaced unofficially in 1982 by a giant, cartoon-style Orange.

[ 31 ] Otto the Orange [ edit ] Main article: Otto the Orange The cheerleaders and mascots were at a UCA Cheerleading Camp in Tennessee that summer, and narrowed the field down to two potential names—"Opie" and "Otto." Figuring the name "Opie" would lead to the inevitable rhyme with "dopey," they settled on "Otto." Later that fall, word got out that the cheerleaders were calling the latest mascot costume Otto, and the name stuck.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Otto the Orange was adopted by the university in 1995 as the university's official mascot, selected over a wolf and a lion also under consideration.
