The late 18th and early 19th century saw a flow of Swiss farmers forming colonies such as Şaba ( Bessarabia , at the Dniester Liman , now part of Ukraine ). The Russian-Swiss generally prospered, partly merging with German diaspora populations. As at the end of 2016, 776 Swiss citizens live in Russia.

[ 17 ] Before the year 1820 some estimated 25,000 to 30,000 Swiss entered British North America. Most of them settled in what is now Pennsylvania , as well as North and South Carolina .

Most Swiss preferred the rural villages of the Midwest and the Pacific Coast, where Italian-speaking Swiss played a significant role in California's winegrowing culture.

[ 18 ] Swiss immigration diminished after 1930 because of the Great Depression and World War II.

In 1999 New Glarus, Wisconsin , was chosen as the future home of the Swiss Center of North America, a cultural center dedicated to the preservation and celebration of Swiss culture. New Glarus was chosen because of its central location and the large concentration of Swiss Americans in the vicinity.  Funds for the centre came from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development , the state of Wisconsin , the canton of Glarus , and corporations, including General Casualty Insurance , Nestlé USA , Novartis , Phillip Morris Europe , and Victorinox .

Main article: Swiss Brazilians The history of Swiss immigration to Brazil began with the foundation of the colony of Nova Friburgo [ 21 ] in 1819. Nova Friburgo was the first colonial company contracted by the Portuguese government. The immigrant colonists wrote letters for publication in Swiss newspapers of the period, and these documents reveal the migrants' perceptions, information and expectations.

[ citation needed ] On 4 July 1819 1,088 Swiss, including 830 from the Canton of Fribourg, departed from Estavayer-le-Lac on Lake Neuchâtel. They included Jean-Claude Marchon, his wife Marie Prostasie Chavannaz Marchon, his brother Antoine Marchon and fiancée Marieanne Elizabeth Clerc. They travelled first to Basle , the meeting point of the Swiss Transmigration for Brasil. And then 2.000 Swiss, by the Rhein River, go to Holland and after a lot of peripetia they depart from St. Gravendeel, near Dordrecht, in the Daphne, for the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, on September 11. Their arrival in Rio de Janeiro was on November 4, spending 55 days, a very good time for the epoch. And, finally, they arrive in Morro-Queimado (Burnt Mount) on November 15, 1819 – about 12000 kilometers in 105 days, approximately 114 kilometers a day.

This is because their linguistic and cultural characteristics are commonly confused with Germans , Italians and French .

It is estimated that more than 8,000 families received grants of land.

[ 25 ] Between April 1876 and May 1877 a contingent of Swiss immigrants comprising 119 families came to the area of Magallanes ( Punta Arenas and Fresh Water), mostly peasants from the canton of Fribourg .

[ 26 ] Later, during the period from 1915 to 1950, was the last recorded mass exodus of Swiss to Chile. 30,000 people settled in the central area of the country, primarily in Santiago and Valparaíso .

[ 27 ] There are currently 5,000 Swiss citizens residing in Chile and between 90,000 and 100,000 Swiss descendants.
