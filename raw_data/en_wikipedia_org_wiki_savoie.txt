Located in the French Alps , its prefecture is Chambéry . In 2019, Savoie had a population of 436,434.

[ 3 ] Together with Haute-Savoie , it is one of the two departments of the historical region of Savoy ; the Duchy of Savoy was annexed by France in 1860, following the signing of the Treaty of Turin . The area is known for its numerous ski resorts and contribution to French cuisine , with culinary specialities such as fondue savoyarde , tartiflette , génépi , as well as various sorts of saucisson .

History [ edit ] It is widely accepted [ citation needed ] that Savoie takes its name from the Latin Sapaudia or Sabaudia , meaning land covered in fir trees. Savoie was long part of the states of Savoy ; though beginning in the 16th century, it was occupied by France several times. It was integrated into the Mont-Blanc department from 1792 to 1815 (and partially into the Léman department from 1798 to 1814). The province was annexed by France in 1860. The former Duchy of Savoy became the two departments of Savoie and Haute-Savoie .

Moûtiers , capital of the former province of Tarentaise Valley (French: Vallée de la Tarentaise ), ceased to be a subprefecture following a law that took effect on 10 September 1926.

Savoie hosted the 1992 Winter Olympics , based in Albertville with ski events at Tarentaise and Beaufortain . The coat of arms for Savoie was used as a pattern for the flames in the official emblem of the games.

[ 4 ] The other main alpine valley is the Maurienne , connected to the Tarentaise  valley by two passes, the col de la Madeleine and the highest pass in Europe, the col de l'Iseran . The Maurienne valley was through the col du Mont Cenis , the major commercial route between France and Italy. It is one of the longest intra-alpine valleys in the Alps.

Geography [ edit ] Savoie is part of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region established on 1 January 2016. It was previously part of Rhône-Alpes . It borders the departments of Haute-Savoie , Ain , Isère and Hautes-Alpes in addition to the Aosta Valley and the Metropolitan City of Turin in Italy .

Much of Savoie is covered by mountains: Mont Blanc Massif Belledonne Massif Lauzière massif Aiguilles d'Arves Massif Massif des Cerces Aravis Range Mont Cenis Massif Bauges Massif Chartreuse Massif Vanoise Massif Beaufortain Massif The department is crossed by the Isère river , which has its source in the Iseran pass. Its two main lakes are Lac du Bourget (the largest and deepest lake entirely in France) and Lac d'Aiguebelette , one of the least polluted in France due to a 1976 law forbidding any use of motorboats on the lake.

Relief map of Savoy Low elevation: the Savoie frontcountry Mid elevation: Mariet plateau in the Bauges Massif High elevation: the village of Aime Climate [ edit ] Most of the department features an alpine climate or a subalpine climate . At lower altitudes and in the valleys, the climate is humid continental ( Köppen : Dfb) or even oceanic in the frontcounrty and lake Bourget area ( Köppen : Cfb), using the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm.

Economy [ edit ] According to the Chambéry chamber of commerce, close to 50% of the department's wealth comes from tourism. Each year, Savoie hosts over 30 million visitor-nights of tourists. Savoie also profits from its natural resources with particular strengths in ore processing and hydroelectric power .

Savoie had an exceptionally high export/import ratio of 214% in 2005. Its exports rose to €1.768 billion and €825 million in imports. Its leading exports were steel , aluminum , and electric and electronic components.

Agriculture [ edit ] Savoie is famous for its cows, which produce numerous cheeses , some of them are: Beaufort Savoie gruyère Reblochon Abbaye de Tamié Tome des Bauges Tomme de Savoie Numerous wine grapes are also grown in Savoie. The most famous wines are made of Gamay , Pinot noir and Mondeuse grapes. Fruit production is the third largest component of agriculture in Savoie.

Apples and pears are also produced in the region and are well known for their qualities.

Principal towns [ edit ] The most populous commune is Chambéry , the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 8 communes with more than 7,000 inhabitants: [ 3 ] Commune Population (2019) Chambéry † 58,917 Aix-les-Bains † 30,463 Albertville 19,502 La Motte-Servolex † 12,120 La Ravoire † 8,530 Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne 7,621 Bourg-Saint-Maurice 7,195 Ugine 7,096 † part of Chambéry agglomeration The "average" (see arithmetic mean ) population density is not a good indicator: the valleys tend to be much more densely populated, whereas the mountains tend to be near-completely uninhabited.

Religion [ edit ] The Catholic Church in Savoie is divided into three dioceses : Chambéry, Maurienne, and Tarentaise. Together, they form an archdiocese , in which the bishop of Chambéry is the archbishop .

[ citation needed ] The increase in the popularity of skiing in the 20th century made Savoie home to the largest number of ski hills in France, including many famous ones: Val-d'Isère Tignes Les Arcs La Plagne Courchevel Méribel Valmorel Les Menuires Val Thorens Les Saisies Savoie Grand Revard Bramans Bessans Valloire Hydrotherapy , practised in the region since antiquity , is also quite developed.
