For series [ edit ] In calculus , the comparison test for series typically consists of a pair of statements about infinite series with non-negative ( real-valued ) terms: [ 1 ] If the infinite series ∑ ∑ b n {\displaystyle \sum b_{n}} converges and 0 ≤ ≤ a n ≤ ≤ b n {\displaystyle 0\leq a_{n}\leq b_{n}} for all sufficiently large n (that is, for all n > N {\displaystyle n>N} for some fixed value N ), then the infinite series ∑ ∑ a n {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}} also converges.

If the infinite series ∑ ∑ b n {\displaystyle \sum b_{n}} diverges and 0 ≤ ≤ b n ≤ ≤ a n {\displaystyle 0\leq b_{n}\leq a_{n}} for all sufficiently large n , then the infinite series ∑ ∑ a n {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}} also diverges.

Note that the series having larger terms is sometimes said to dominate (or eventually dominate ) the series with smaller terms.

[ 2 ] Alternatively, the test may be stated in terms of absolute convergence , in which case it also applies to series with complex terms: [ 3 ] If the infinite series ∑ ∑ b n {\displaystyle \sum b_{n}} is absolutely convergent and | a n | ≤ ≤ | b n | {\displaystyle |a_{n}|\leq |b_{n}|} for all sufficiently large n , then the infinite series ∑ ∑ a n {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}} is also absolutely convergent.

If the infinite series ∑ ∑ b n {\displaystyle \sum b_{n}} is not absolutely convergent and | b n | ≤ ≤ | a n | {\displaystyle |b_{n}|\leq |a_{n}|} for all sufficiently large n , then the infinite series ∑ ∑ a n {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}} is also not absolutely convergent.

Note that in this last statement, the series ∑ ∑ a n {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}} could still be conditionally convergent ; for real-valued series, this could happen if the a n are not all nonnegative.

The second pair of statements are equivalent to the first in the case of real-valued series because ∑ ∑ c n {\displaystyle \sum c_{n}} converges absolutely if and only if ∑ ∑ | c n | {\displaystyle \sum |c_{n}|} , a series with nonnegative terms, converges.

Proof [ edit ] The proofs of all the statements given above are similar. Here is a proof of the third statement.

Let ∑ ∑ a n {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}} and ∑ ∑ b n {\displaystyle \sum b_{n}} be infinite series such that ∑ ∑ b n {\displaystyle \sum b_{n}} converges absolutely (thus ∑ ∑ | b n | {\displaystyle \sum |b_{n}|} converges), and without loss of generality assume that | a n | ≤ ≤ | b n | {\displaystyle |a_{n}|\leq |b_{n}|} for all positive integers n . Consider the partial sums S n = | a 1 | + | a 2 | + … … + | a n | , T n = | b 1 | + | b 2 | + … … + | b n | .

{\displaystyle S_{n}=|a_{1}|+|a_{2}|+\ldots +|a_{n}|,\ T_{n}=|b_{1}|+|b_{2}|+\ldots +|b_{n}|.} Since ∑ ∑ b n {\displaystyle \sum b_{n}} converges absolutely, lim n → → ∞ ∞ T n = T {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }T_{n}=T} for some real number T . For all n , 0 ≤ ≤ S n = | a 1 | + | a 2 | + … … + | a n | ≤ ≤ | a 1 | + … … + | a n | + | b n + 1 | + … … = S n + ( T − − T n ) ≤ ≤ T .

{\displaystyle 0\leq S_{n}=|a_{1}|+|a_{2}|+\ldots +|a_{n}|\leq |a_{1}|+\ldots +|a_{n}|+|b_{n+1}|+\ldots =S_{n}+(T-T_{n})\leq T.} S n {\displaystyle S_{n}} is a nondecreasing sequence and S n + ( T − − T n ) {\displaystyle S_{n}+(T-T_{n})} is nonincreasing.
Given m , n > N {\displaystyle m,n>N} then both S n , S m {\displaystyle S_{n},S_{m}} belong to the interval [ S N , S N + ( T − − T N ) ] {\displaystyle [S_{N},S_{N}+(T-T_{N})]} , whose length T − − T N {\displaystyle T-T_{N}} decreases to zero as N {\displaystyle N} goes to infinity.
This shows that ( S n ) n = 1 , 2 , … … {\displaystyle (S_{n})_{n=1,2,\ldots }} is a Cauchy sequence , and so must converge to a limit. Therefore, ∑ ∑ a n {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}} is absolutely convergent.

For integrals [ edit ] The comparison test for integrals may be stated as follows, assuming continuous real-valued functions f and g on [ a , b ) {\displaystyle [a,b)} with b either + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } or a real number at which f and g each have a vertical asymptote: [ 4 ] If the improper integral ∫ ∫ a b g ( x ) d x {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}g(x)\,dx} converges and 0 ≤ ≤ f ( x ) ≤ ≤ g ( x ) {\displaystyle 0\leq f(x)\leq g(x)} for a ≤ ≤ x < b {\displaystyle a\leq x<b} , then the improper integral ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d x {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx} also converges with ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d x ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ a b g ( x ) d x .

{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx\leq \int _{a}^{b}g(x)\,dx.} If the improper integral ∫ ∫ a b g ( x ) d x {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}g(x)\,dx} diverges and 0 ≤ ≤ g ( x ) ≤ ≤ f ( x ) {\displaystyle 0\leq g(x)\leq f(x)} for a ≤ ≤ x < b {\displaystyle a\leq x<b} , then the improper integral ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d x {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx} also diverges.

Ratio comparison test [ edit ] Another test for convergence of real-valued series, similar to both the direct comparison test above and the ratio test , is called the ratio comparison test : [ 5 ] If the infinite series ∑ ∑ b n {\displaystyle \sum b_{n}} converges and a n > 0 {\displaystyle a_{n}>0} , b n > 0 {\displaystyle b_{n}>0} , and a n + 1 a n ≤ ≤ b n + 1 b n {\displaystyle {\frac {a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}}\leq {\frac {b_{n+1}}{b_{n}}}} for all sufficiently large n , then the infinite series ∑ ∑ a n {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}} also converges.

If the infinite series ∑ ∑ b n {\displaystyle \sum b_{n}} diverges and a n > 0 {\displaystyle a_{n}>0} , b n > 0 {\displaystyle b_{n}>0} , and a n + 1 a n ≥ ≥ b n + 1 b n {\displaystyle {\frac {a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}}\geq {\frac {b_{n+1}}{b_{n}}}} for all sufficiently large n , then the infinite series ∑ ∑ a n {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}} also diverges.
