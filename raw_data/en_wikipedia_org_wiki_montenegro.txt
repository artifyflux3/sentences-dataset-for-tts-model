Montenegro [ d ] is a country in Southeast Europe , on the Balkan Peninsula .

[ 10 ] Its 25 municipalities have a total population of 633,158 people in an area of 13,883 km 2 (5,360 sq mi). It is bordered by Serbia to the northeast, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Kosovo to the east, Albania to the southeast, and Croatia to the west, and has a coastline along the Adriatic Sea to the southwest.

[ 11 ] The capital and largest city is Podgorica , while Cetinje is the Old Royal Capital and cultural centre.

[ 12 ] In June 2006 Montenegro declared its independence from Serbia and Montenegro following an independence referendum , creating Montenegro and Serbia as they exist today.

[ 13 ] Before the arrival of the Slav peoples in the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries CE, the area now known as Montenegro was inhabited principally by people known as Illyrians .
During the Early Medieval period, three principalities were located on the territory of modern-day Montenegro: Duklja , roughly corresponding to the southern half; Travunia , the west; and Rascia proper, the north.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] The Principality of Zeta emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries. From the late 14th century to the late 18th century, large parts of southern Montenegro were ruled by the Venetian Republic and incorporated into Venetian Albania .

[ 17 ] The name Montenegro was first used to refer to the country in the late 15th century. After falling under Ottoman Empire rule, Montenegro gained semi-autonomy in 1696 under the rule of the House of Petrović-Njegoš , first as a theocracy and later as a secular principality . Montenegro's independence was recognised by the Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. In 1910, the country became a kingdom . After World War I , the kingdom became part of Yugoslavia . Following the breakup of Yugoslavia , the republics of Serbia and Montenegro together proclaimed a federation .

Montenegro has an upper-middle-income economy , mostly service-based , and is in late transition to a market economy .

[ 18 ] It is a member of the United Nations , NATO , the World Trade Organization , the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe , the Council of Europe , and the Central European Free Trade Agreement .

[ 19 ] Montenegro is also a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean , [ 20 ] and has been in the process of joining the European Union since 2012.

[ 21 ] Etymology Montenegro's ( / ˌ m ɒ n t ɪ ˈ n iː ɡ r oʊ , - ˈ n eɪ ɡ r oʊ , - ˈ n ɛ ɡ r oʊ / ⓘ MON -tin- E(E)G -roh, -⁠ AY -groh ; [ 22 ] Montenegrin : Crna Gora [ e ] / Црна Гора ; [ f ] Albanian : Mali i Zi ) [ 23 ] [ 24 ] English name derives from a Venetian calque of the Montenegrin phrase " Crna Gora ", meaning literally "Black Mountain", deriving from the appearance of Mount Lovćen , which was covered in dense evergreen forests.

[ 25 ] Crna Gora was mentioned for the first time in edicts issued by Stefan Uroš I to the Serbian Orthodox Zeta Episcopate seat at Vranjina island in Lake Skadar .

[ 26 ] It came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century.

[ 27 ] Duklja in the 11th century Modern-day Montenegro was more and more known by that name in the historical period following the fall of the Serbian Despotate in 1459.

[ 28 ] Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the Paštrovići tribe, but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the Crnojević noble family took power in Upper Zeta .

[ 27 ] The aforementioned region became known as Stara Crna Gora ' Old Montenegro ' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of Brda (the "Highlands"). Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the Ottoman Empire , which saw the annexation of Old Herzegovina and parts of Metohija and southern Raška . Its borders have changed little since then, losing Metohija and gaining the Bay of Kotor .

[ 29 ] After the second session of the AVNOJ during World War II in Yugoslavia , the contemporary modern state of Montenegro was founded as the Federal State of Montenegro ( Montenegrin : Савезна држава Црне Горе / Savezna država Crne Gore ) on 15 November 1943 within the Yugoslav Federation by the ZAVNOCGB . After the war, Montenegro became a republic under its name, the People's Republic of Montenegro ( Montenegrin : Народна Република Црна Гора / Narodna Republika Crna Gora ) on 29 November 1945. In 1963, it was renamed to the Socialist Republic of Montenegro ( Montenegrin : Социјалистичка Република Црна Гора / Socijalistička Republika Crna Gora ). As the breakup of Yugoslavia occurred, the SRCG was renamed to the Republic of Montenegro ( Montenegrin : Република Црна Гора / Republika Crna Gora ) on 27 April 1992 within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by removing the adjective "socialist" from the republic's title. Since 22 October 2007, a year after its independence, the name of the country became simply known as Montenegro. The country is known as Mali i Zi (lit. black mountain) in Albanian , [ 30 ] while it is known as Crna Gora in Montenegrin, Serbian, Bosnian , and Croatian .

History Main article: History of Montenegro Antiquity Main articles: Illyria , Illyricum (Roman province) , Dalmatia (Roman province) , and Praevalitana Modern-day Montenegro was part of Illyria and populated by the Indo-European-speaking Illyrians .

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The Illyrian kingdom was conquered by the Roman Republic in the Illyro-Roman Wars and the region was incorporated into the province of Illyricum (later Dalmatia and Praevalitana ).

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Arrival of the Slavs Main articles: Duklja , Principality of Zeta , and Tribes of Montenegro Three principalities were located on the territory: Duklja , roughly corresponding to the southern half, Travunia , the west, and Raška , the north.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Duklja gained its independence from the Byzantine Roman Empire in 1042.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia, and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, Mihailo (1046–1081), and his grandson Constantine Bodin (1081–1101).

[ 39 ] Fortifications of Kotor . Built between the 9th and 19th centuries, UNESCO World Heritage Site .

As the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, the territory of modern-day Montenegro became part of the state ruled by Stefan Nemanja and was a part of various state formations ruled by the Nemanjić dynasty for the next two centuries. After the Serbian Empire collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the Balšićs , became sovereigns of Zeta.

[ 40 ] By the 13th century, Zeta had replaced Duklja when referring to the realm.

[ 41 ] In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ( Zeta ) came under the rule of the Balšić noble family , then the Crnojević noble family , and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as Crna Gora .

[ 42 ] In 1421, Zeta was annexed to the Serbian Despotate , but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the Crnojevićs , became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the Ottomans in 1496, and got annexed to the sanjak of Shkodër . For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous sanjak in 1514–1528 ( Sanjak of Montenegro ). Also, Old Herzegovina region was part of Sanjak of Herzegovina .

[ citation needed ] Early modern period Main articles: Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro and Venetian Albania From 1392, numerous parts of the territory were controlled by Republic of Venice , including the city of Budva , in that time known as "Budua". 
The Venetian territory was centred on the Bay of Kotor , and the Republic introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics.

[ 43 ] Venice controlled territories in present-day Montenegro until its fall in 1797.

[ 17 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Large portions fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1496 to 1878. In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire that permitted Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, repeatedly rebelled, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the Great Turkish War at the end of that century.

[ citation needed ] Left: Petar I Petrović-Njegoš was the most popular spiritual and military leader from the Petrović dynasty .

Right: Petar II Petrović-Njegoš was a Prince-Bishop ( vladika ) of Montenegro and the national poet and philosopher. Oil painting of Njegoš as vladika , c. 1837 Montenegrin territories were controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain ( knez ), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. An assembly of Montenegrin clans ( Zbor ) was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part.

[ 46 ] In 1515, Montenegro became a theocracy led by the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral , which flourished after the Petrović-Njegoš of Cetinje became the prince-bishop (whose title was "Vladika of Montenegro").

[ citation needed ] People from Montenegro in this historical period were described as Orthodox Serbs.

[ 47 ] Principality and Kingdom of Montenegro Main articles: Principality of Montenegro and Kingdom of Montenegro In 1858, one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the Battle of Grahovac .

Grand Duke Mirko Petrović , elder brother of Knjaz Danilo , led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans with 15,000 troops at Grahovac on 1 May 1858. This forced the Great Powers to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, de facto recognising Montenegro's independence.

[ citation needed ] Battle of Vučji Do , 1876, major battle of the Montenegrin-Ottoman War Royal family of Montenegro : King Nicholas I with his family. The Petrović-Njegoš dynasty ruled Montenegro continuously for almost 200 years.

In the Battle of Vučji Do Montenegrins inflicted a major defeat on the Ottoman Army under Grand Vizier Ahmed Muhtar Pasha . In the aftermath of the Russian victory against the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 , the major powers restructured the map of the Balkan region. The Ottoman Empire recognised the independence of Montenegro in the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.

[ 48 ] The first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855. Under Nicholas I (ruled 1860–1918), the principality was enlarged several times in the Montenegro-Turkish Wars and was recognised as independent in 1878. Nicholas I established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire.

[ citation needed ] Minor border skirmishes excepted, diplomacy ushered in about 30 years of peace between the two states until the deposition of Abdul Hamid II in 1909.

[ 49 ] Expansion of Montenegro from 1711 to 1918 within present borders The political skills of Abdul Hamid II and Nicholas I played a major role in the mutually amicable relations.

[ 49 ] Modernization of the state followed, culminating with the draft of a Constitution in 1905. However, political rifts emerged between the reigning People's Party , who supported the process of democratisation and union with Serbia, and those of the True People's Party , who were monarchist.

[ citation needed ] In 1910, Montenegro became a kingdom , and as a result of the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, a common border with Serbia was established, with Shkodër being awarded to Albania , though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia. Montenegro became one of the Allied Powers during World War I (1914–1918). In the Battle of Mojkovac fought in January 1916 between Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Montenegro, Montenegrins achieved a decisive victory even though they were outnumbered five to one. The Austro-Hungarians accepted military surrender on 25 January 1916.

[ 50 ] From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and established a government-in-exile in Bordeaux .

[ citation needed ] Kingdom of Yugoslavia Main article: Kingdom of Yugoslavia Locator map of Zeta Banovina in Kingdom of Yugoslavia In 1922, Montenegro formally became the Oblast of Cetinje in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes , with the addition of the coastal areas around Budva and Bay of Kotor . In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger Zeta Banate of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia that reached the Neretva River.

[ citation needed ] Nicholas's grandson, the Serb King Alexander I , dominated the Yugoslav government.

Zeta Banovina was one of nine banovinas that formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.

Construction of the Belgrade–Bar railway started in the 1950s and was completed in 1976. The line was opened in 1976 by the Yugoslavian President Josip Broz Tito .

In May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for guerrilla warfare . According to some historians, the first armed uprising in Nazi -occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.

[ 51 ] Unexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nikšić), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.

Fighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included Arso Jovanović , Sava Kovačević , Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo , Milovan Đilas , Peko Dapčević , Vlado Dapčević , Veljko Vlahović , and Blažo Jovanović . Those loyal to the Karađorđević dynasty and opposing communism went on to become Chetniks , and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.

War broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of "anti-communist militia" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to Mostar , where they fought in the Battle of Neretva against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.

During German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed many Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon occupied by German forces , and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.

Montenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed Titograd in honour of President Josip Broz Tito . After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the University of Montenegro was established. Greater autonomy was established until the Socialist Republic of Montenegro ratified a new constitution in 1974.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] Montenegro within FR Yugoslavia Main articles: Serbia and Montenegro and Republic of Montenegro (1992–2006) After the formal dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro remained part of a smaller Federal Republic of Yugoslavia along with Serbia. In the referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992 , 96% of the votes cast were in favour of the federation with Serbia. The referendum was boycotted by opposition parties such as the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro , [ 54 ] the Social Democratic and Socialist Parties, [ 55 ] as well as minority parties such as the Democratic League in Montenegro , [ 56 ] leading to a relatively low turnout of 66%.

[ 54 ] Map of the disintegration of Yugoslavia until 2008.

During the 1991–1995 Bosnian War and Croatian War , Montenegrin police and military forces, under orders of president Momir Bulatovic [ 57 ] and Interior Minister Pavle Bulatovic [ 58 ] joined Serbian troops in attacks on Dubrovnik , Croatia.

[ 59 ] These operations, aimed at acquiring more territory, were characterised by large-scale violations of human rights.

[ 60 ] Montenegrin General Pavle Strugar was convicted for his part in the bombing of Dubrovnik.

[ 61 ] Bosnian refugees were arrested by Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Foča , where they were subjected to systematic torture and executed.

[ 62 ] In 1996, Milo Đukanović 's government severed ties between Montenegro and its partner Serbia, which was led by Slobodan Milošević . Montenegro formed its own economic policy and adopted the German Deutsche Mark as its currency and subsequently adopted the euro , although not part of the Eurozone . Subsequent governments pursued pro-independence policies, and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite political changes in Belgrade .

Targets in Montenegro were bombed by NATO forces during Operation Allied Force in 1999, although the extent of these attacks was limited in both time and area affected.

[ 63 ] In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro came to a new agreement for continued cooperation and entered into negotiations regarding the future status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . This resulted in the Belgrade Agreement, which saw the country's transformation into a more decentralised state union named Serbia and Montenegro in 2003. The Belgrade Agreement also contained a provision delaying any future referendum on the independence of Montenegro for at least three years.

The status of the union between Montenegro and Serbia was decided by a referendum on Montenegrin independence on 21 May 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the electorate; 230,661 votes (55.5%) were for independence and 185,002 votes (44.5%) were against.

[ 64 ] This narrowly surpassed the 55% threshold needed to validate the referendum under the rules set by the European Union. According to the electoral commission, the 55% threshold was passed by only 2,300 votes. Serbia, the member-states of the European Union, and the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council all recognised Montenegro's independence.

The 2006 referendum was monitored by five international observer missions, headed by an OSCE / ODIHR team, and around 3,000 observers in total (including domestic observers from CDT (OSCE PA), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe (CLRAE), and the European Parliament (EP) to form an International Referendum Observation Mission (IROM). The IROM—in its preliminary report—"assessed compliance of the referendum process with OSCE commitments, Council of Europe commitments, other international standards for democratic electoral processes, and domestic legislation." Furthermore, the report stated that the competitive pre-referendum environment was marked by an active and generally peaceful campaign and that "there were no reports of restrictions on fundamental civil and political rights".

On 3 June 2006, the Montenegrin Parliament declared the independence of Montenegro, [ 65 ] formally confirming the result of the referendum.

On 28 June 2006, Montenegro joined the United Nations as its 192nd member state.

[ 66 ] Montenegro has been dominated since the breakup of Yugoslavia by Milo Đukanović (four-time prime minister and twice president), accused of having established an authoritarianism and clientelist regime, while maintaining close relations with organized crime .

[ 67 ] The massive privatizations of the Đukanović era lead to the enrichment of him and oligarchs close to him. His brother Aleksandar, owner of Montenegro's first private bank, oversaw the privatizations, while his sister, Ana Kolarevic, has long controlled the judiciary. The clientelist networks of the ruling party dominated all segments of social life. A party card was required to start a business or obtain a position in the administration. This policy also contributed to the reinforcement of regional disparities and social inequalities. Unemployment climbs to 36.6 per cent in the northern part of the country, compared to 3.9 per cent in the coastal region, while a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line (2018).

[ 68 ] The Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petrović Njegoš Dynasty was passed by the Parliament of Montenegro on 12 July 2011. It rehabilitated the Royal House of Montenegro and recognised limited symbolic roles within the constitutional framework of the republic.

In 2015, the investigative journalists' network OCCRP named Montenegro's long-time President and Prime Minister Milo Đukanović "Person of the Year in Organized Crime".

The coastal area is traditionally a representative of Mediterranean cuisine , with seafood being a common dish. The traditional dishes of Montenegro's Adriatic coast , unlike its heartland, have been significantly influenced by Italian cuisine.
