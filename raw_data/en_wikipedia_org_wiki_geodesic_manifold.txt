Formally, a manifold M {\displaystyle M} is (geodesically) complete if for any maximal geodesic ℓ ℓ : I → → M {\displaystyle \ell :I\to M} , it holds that I = ( − − ∞ ∞ , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle I=(-\infty ,\infty )} .

[ 1 ] A geodesic is maximal if its domain cannot be extended.

Equivalently, M {\displaystyle M} is (geodesically) complete if for all points p ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle p\in M} , the exponential map at p {\displaystyle p} is defined on T p M {\displaystyle T_{p}M} , the entire tangent space at p {\displaystyle p} .

[ 1 ] Hopf–Rinow theorem [ edit ] Main article: Hopf–Rinow theorem The Hopf–Rinow theorem gives alternative characterizations of completeness. Let ( M , g ) {\displaystyle (M,g)} be a connected Riemannian manifold and let d g : M × × M → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle d_{g}:M\times M\to [0,\infty )} be its Riemannian distance function .

The Hopf–Rinow theorem states that ( M , g ) {\displaystyle (M,g)} is (geodesically) complete if and only if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions: [ 2 ] The metric space ( M , d g ) {\displaystyle (M,d_{g})} is complete (every d g {\displaystyle d_{g}} - Cauchy sequence converges), All closed and bounded subsets of M {\displaystyle M} are compact .

Examples and non-examples [ edit ] Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , the sphere S n {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{n}} , and the tori T n {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{n}} (with their natural Riemannian metrics ) are all complete manifolds.

All compact Riemannian manifolds and all homogeneous manifolds are geodesically complete.  All symmetric spaces are geodesically complete.

Non-examples [ edit ] The punctured plane R 2 ∖ ∖ { ( 0 , 0 ) } {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}\backslash \{(0,0)\}} is not geodesically complete because the maximal geodesic with initial conditions p = ( 1 , 1 ) {\displaystyle p=(1,1)} , v = ( 1 , 1 ) {\displaystyle v=(1,1)} does not have domain R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } .

A simple example of a non-complete manifold is given by the punctured plane R 2 ∖ ∖ { 0 } {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}\smallsetminus \lbrace 0\rbrace } (with its induced metric). Geodesics going to the origin cannot be defined on the entire real line. By the Hopf–Rinow theorem, we can alternatively observe that it is not a complete metric space: any sequence in the plane converging to the origin is a non-converging Cauchy sequence in the punctured plane.

There exist non-geodesically complete compact pseudo-Riemannian (but not Riemannian) manifolds. An example of this is the Clifton–Pohl torus .

In the theory of general relativity , which describes gravity in terms of a pseudo-Riemannian geometry, many important examples of geodesically incomplete spaces arise, e.g.

non-rotating uncharged black-holes or cosmologies with a Big Bang . The fact that such incompleteness is fairly generic in general relativity is shown in the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems .

Extendibility [ edit ] If M {\displaystyle M} is geodesically complete, then it is not isometric to an open proper submanifold of any other Riemannian manifold. The converse does not hold.
