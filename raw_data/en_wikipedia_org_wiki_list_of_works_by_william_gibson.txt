Primarily renowned as a novelist and short fiction writer in the cyberpunk milieu, Gibson invented the metaphor of cyberspace in " Burning Chrome " (1982) and emerged from obscurity in 1984 with the publication of his debut novel Neuromancer .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Gibson's early short fiction is recognized as cyberpunk's finest work, [ 3 ] effectively renovating the science fiction genre which had been hitherto considered widely insignificant.

[ 4 ] At the turn of the 1990s, after the completion of his Sprawl trilogy of novels, Gibson contributed the text to a number of performance art pieces and exhibitions, [ 2 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] as well as writing lyrics for musicians Yellow Magic Orchestra and Debbie Harry .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] He wrote the critically acclaimed artist's book Agrippa (a book of the dead) in 1992 before [ citation needed ] co-authoring The Difference Engine , an alternate history novel that would become a central work of the steampunk genre.

[ 9 ] He then spent an unfruitful period as a Hollywood screenwriter , with few of his projects seeing the light of day and those that did being critically unsuccessful.

[ 10 ] Although he had largely abandoned short fiction by the mid-1990s, Gibson returned to writing novels, completing his second trilogy, the Bridge trilogy at the close of the millennium. After writing two episodes of the television series The X-Files around this time, Gibson was featured as the subject of a documentary film, No Maps for These Territories , in 2000.

[ 11 ] Gibson has been invited to address the National Academy of Sciences (1993) and the Directors Guild of America (2003) and has had a plethora of articles published in outlets such as Wired , Rolling Stone and The New York Times . His third trilogy of novels, Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007) and Zero History (2010) have put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.
