Facilities [ edit ] View of the multi-sport stadium at Assumption University Assumption built a $3.2 million multi-sport stadium, which opened in September 2005. The stadium was the key capital project of the second phase of the Centennial Campaign. The stadium was constructed on the previous site of Assumption’s football/lacrosse field. The new facility supports six athletic teams (football, men's and women's lacrosse, men's and women’s soccer, and field hockey) and an outdoor intramural sports program on an infilled, synthetic turf field. It includes lights, elevated grandstand seating for approximately 1,200 spectators, a press box and a president's box.
