The symbol **-**, known in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") as **hyphen-minus**, is the form of [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen") most commonly used in digital [documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document "Document"). On most keyboards, it is the only character that resembles a [minus sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minus_sign "Minus sign") or a [dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash "Dash"), so it is also used for these.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-1) The name _hyphen-minus_ derives from the original [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") standard,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-2) where it was called _hyphen (minus)_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-3) The character is referred to as a _hyphen_, a _minus sign_, or a _dash_ according to the context where it is being used.

Description

| hyphen-minus, plus, minus, and en-dash characters in proportional and monospaced fonts |

In early [typewriters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter") and [character encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encodings "Character encodings"), a single key/code was almost always used for hyphen, minus, various dashes, and strikethrough, since they all have a similar appearance. The current [Unicode Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_Standard "Unicode Standard") specifies distinct characters for several different [dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash "Dash"), an unambiguous [minus sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minus_sign "Minus sign") (sometimes called the _Unicode minus_) at [code point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point") U+2212, an unambiguous [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen") (sometimes called the _Unicode hyphen_) at U+2010, the hyphen-minus at U+002D and a [variety of other hyphen symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Unicode "Hyphen") for various uses. When a hyphen is called for, the hyphen-minus is a common choice as it is well known, easy to enter on [keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard "Computer keyboard"), and still the only form recognized by many data formats and computer languages. Though the Unicode Standard states that the U+2010 hyphen is "preferred" over the hyphen-minus,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-4) the standard itself uses the hyphen-minus as its hyphen character.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-5)

In most modern [computer fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_font "Computer font"), the hyphen-minus is either identical or very similar to the Unicode hyphen.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-6)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-7)

In mathematical texts that include the plus sign, the Unicode minus is preferred to the hyphen-minus, because its metrics match the plus sign in level and length.[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-8)

Uses
----

### Typing

This character is typed when a hyphen or a minus sign is wanted. Based on old typewriter conventions, it is common to use a pair -- to represent an [em dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_dash "Em dash")—,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-9) and to put spaces around it - to represent a [spaced en dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#En_dash_versus_em_dash "Dash")–; this practice is deprecated in professional [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-10) Some [word processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor "Word processor")[automatically convert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrection "Autocorrection") these to the correct dash. The character can also be typed multiple times to simulate a horizontal line (though in most cases, repeated entry of the [underscore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#Modern_use "Underscore") will produce a solid line). Alternating the hyphen-minus with spaces produces a "dashed" line, often to indicate where paper is to be cut. On a typewriter, over-striking a section of text with this is used for [strikethrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikethrough "Strikethrough").

### Programming languages

Some [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") use the hyphen-minus for denoting subtraction and [additive inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_inverse "Additive inverse"), often called _negation_[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-11) in this context.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-c-12)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_note-haskell-13) It is rarely used to indicate a range, due to ambiguity with subtraction. Generally, other characters, such as the Unicode U+2212−[MINUS SIGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#Minus_sign "Plus and minus signs") are not recognized as an [operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming) "Operator (computer programming)").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In some programming languages (for example [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL "MySQL")) `--` (two hyphen-minus) mark the beginning of a [comment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming) "Comment (computer programming)"). It can be used to start the [signature block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_block "Signature block") in [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet "Usenet") news system. [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML "YAML") uses `---` (three hyphen-minuses) to end a section.

### Command line

The hyphen-minus character is often used when specifying [command-line options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_option "Command-line option"), a convention popularized by [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix"). Examples of the "short" form are `-R` or `-q`. A user can specify both by using `-Rq`. Some implementations allow two hyphen-minuses to specify "long" option names as `--recursive` or `--quiet`. These are easier to understand when reading commands (some software does not care about the number of hyphen-minuses, and either does not allow combinations of single-letter options, or requires the user to rearrange them, so they do not match a long option). A double hyphen-minus by itself (followed by a space) indicates that there are no more options, which is useful when one needs to specify a filename that starts with a hyphen-minus. An option of just a hyphen-minus (followed by a space) may be recognized [in lieu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_lieu "wikt:in lieu") of a filename and indicates that [stdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdin "Stdin") is to be read.

### `diff` output

`-` is used to denote deleted lines in [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff "Diff") output in the [context format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Context_format "Diff") or the [unified format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format "Diff").

Encoding
--------

The glyph has a [code point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point") in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") as U+002D-HYPHEN-MINUS. It is also in [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") with the same value.

Explanatory notes
-----------------

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_ref-7)**In [Lucida Sans Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucida_Sans_Unicode "Lucida Sans Unicode"), the hyphen-minus is drawn identically to the [en dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_dash "En dash").
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus#cite_ref-8)**The precise relationships depend on [typeface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface "Typeface") design choices.

For example, 27 hex is defined in ANSI X3.4 as apostrophe (closing single quotation mark; acute accent), and 2D hex as hyphen minus. In general, the Unicode standard provides the same interpretation for the equivalent code values, without adding to or subtracting from their semantics. The Unicode standard supplies unambiguous codes elsewhere for the most useful particular interpretations of these ASCII values; the corresponding unambiguous characters are cross-referenced in the character names list for this block. In a few cases, the Unicode standard indicates the generic interpretation of an ASCII code in the name of the corresponding Unicode character, for example U+0027 is APOSTROPHE-QUOTE'.

Retrieved 10 November 2020. In typescript, a double hyphen (--) is often used for a long dash. Double hyphens in a typeset document are a sure sign that the type was set by a typist, not a typographer. A typographer will use an em dash, three-quarter em, or en dash, depending on context or personal style. The em dash is the nineteenth-century standard, still prescribed in many editorial style books, but the em dash is too long for use with the best text faces. Like the oversized space between sentences, it belongs to the padded and corseted aesthetic of Victorian typography.
