Originally inspired by varsity matches between Oxford University and Cambridge University in England, Yale and Harvard influenced the development of college sports in the United States.

[ 2 ] In 1970 the NCAA banned Yale from participating in all NCAA sports for two years, in reaction to Yale—against the wishes of the NCAA—playing Jack Langer in college games after Langer had played for Team United States at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel with the approval of Yale President Kingman Brewster .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The decision impacted 300 Yale students, every Yale student on its sports teams, over the next two years.

Perhaps Yale's most notable baseball player, however, was future U.S. president George H. W. Bush , who played for the Bulldogs in the late 1940s.

Breslow led the Ivy League with a 2.56 ERA in 2002.

[ 8 ] Lavarnway led the NCAA in batting average (.467) and slugging percentage (.873) in 2007, set the Ivy League hitting-streak record (25), and through 2010 held the Ivy League record in career home runs (33).

[ 9 ] In August 2012, Breslow and Lavarnway, playing for the Red Sox, became the first Yale grads to be Major League teammates since 1949.

The Bulldogs were the dominant team in the early days of intercollegiate football, winning 27 college football national championships , including 26 in 38 years between 1872 and 1909.

[ 13 ] Walter Camp , known as the "Father of Football," graduated from Hopkins Grammar School in 1876, and played college football at Yale College from 1876 to 1882.  He later served as the head football coach at Yale from 1888 to 1892.

[ 14 ] It was Camp who pioneered the fundamental transition of American football from rugby when in 1880, he succeeded in convincing the Intercollegiate Football Association to discontinue the rugby "scrum", and instead have players line up along a "line of scrimmage" for individual plays, which begin with the snap of the ball and conclude with the tackling of the ballcarrier.

[ 15 ] Men's golf [ edit ] Robert Hunter The Yale Men's Golf Team has won 21 collegiate team championships (all except 1943 were bestowed by the National Intercollegiate Golf Association): 1897, 1898 (spring), [ 16 ] 1902 (spring), 1905–13, 1915, 1924–26, 1931–33, 1936, 1943.

[ 20 ] Nevertheless, after a rugby football played v Harvard in 1875, Yale dropped the association football in favor of rugby.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Before the NCAA began its tournament in 1959, the annual national champion was declared by the Intercollegiate Association Football League (IAFL) — from 1911 to 1926 — and then the Intercollegiate Soccer Football Association (ISFA), from 1927 to 1958. From 1911 to 1958, Yale won four national championships.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] This protest was noted by newspapers around the world, including The New York Times .

[ 28 ] [ 27 ] By 1977, a women's locker room was added to Yale's boathouse.

[ 29 ] (Previously,  there was no bathroom available for the women's crew team, so they had to wait on the bus after practice while the men showered before they could return to campus.

[ 30 ] ) This protest was chronicled in the 1999 documentary A Hero For Daisy .

[ 29 ] [ 31 ] Women's ice hockey [ edit ] Main article: Yale Bulldogs women's ice hockey Women's soccer [ edit ] Main article: Yale Bulldogs women's soccer The Bulldogs women's soccer team won the NCAA College Cup in 2002, 2004 and 2005.

[ 33 ] He pled guilty.

[ 33 ] Because he is cooperating with prosecutors, he may avoid the maximum penalties of 20 years in prison and $250,000 fines each of the charges carry, but he will have to forfeit the $850,000 in bribes he took in the scheme.

Perhaps more than any other two colleges, Harvard and Yale gave form to American intercollegiate athletics--a form that was inspired by the Oxford-Cambridge rivalry overseas, and that was imitated by colleges and universities throughout the United States. Focusing on the influence of these prestigious eastern institutions, this fascinating study traces the origins and development of intercollegiate athletics in America from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century.
