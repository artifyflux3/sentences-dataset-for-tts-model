[ 11 ] Founded in 1885 as Territorial Normal School by the 13th Arizona Territorial Legislature , the university is one of the largest public universities by enrollment in the United States.

[ 12 ] It was one of about 180 " normal schools " founded in the late 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools.  Some closed, but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century, then state universities in the late 20th century.

[ 13 ] One of three universities governed by the Arizona Board of Regents , Arizona State University is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity". ASU has over 183,000 [ 3 ] students attending classes, with more than 74,000 [ 3 ] students attending online, and 142,000 [ 3 ] undergraduates and over 41,000 [ 3 ] postgraduates across its four campuses [ 14 ] and four regional learning centers throughout Arizona.

[ 3 ] ASU offers more than 400 undergraduate degree programs [ 15 ] from its 16 colleges [ 15 ] and over 170 cross-discipline centers and institutes for students.

[ 16 ] It also offers more than 450 graduate degree and certificate programs.

[ 15 ] The Arizona State Sun Devils compete in 26 varsity-level sports in NCAA Division I as a member of the Big 12 Conference . Sun Devil teams have won 165 national championships, including 24 NCAA trophies. 179 Sun Devils have made Olympic teams, winning 60 Olympic medals : 25 gold, 12 silver and 23 bronze.

As of February 2024, [update] ASU had more than 5,000 faculty members.

[ 3 ] This included 5 Nobel laureates, 11 MacArthur Fellows , 10 Pulitzer Prize winners, 11 National Academy of Engineering members, 26 National Academy of Sciences members, 28 American Academy of Arts and Sciences members, 41 Guggenheim fellows, 163 National Endowment for the Humanities fellows, and 289 Fulbright Program American Scholars.

[ 17 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Arizona State University President Theodore Roosevelt addresses a crowd of students on the steps of the Old Main at Tempe Normal School (future Arizona State University), March 20, 1911.

1885–1929 [ edit ] Old Main on the Arizona Territorial Normal School (future Arizona State University) campus, c.

1890 Arizona State University was established as the Territorial Normal School at Tempe on March 12, 1885, when the 13th Arizona Territorial Legislature passed an act to create a normal school to train teachers for the Arizona Territory . The campus consisted of a single, four-room schoolhouse on a 20-acre plot largely donated by Tempe residents George and Martha Wilson. Classes started with 33 students on February 8, 1886. The curriculum evolved over the years and the name was changed several times; the institution was also known as Tempe Normal School of Arizona (1889–1903), Tempe Normal School (1903–1925), Tempe State Teachers College (1925–1929), Arizona State Teachers College (1929–1945), Arizona State College (1945–1958) and, by a 2–1 margin of the state's voters, Arizona State University in 1958.

In 1923, the school stopped offering high school courses and added a high school diploma to the admissions requirements. In 1925, the school became the Tempe State Teachers College and offered four-year Bachelor of Education degrees as well as two-year teaching certificates. In 1929, the 9th Arizona State Legislature authorized Bachelor of Arts in Education degrees as well, and the school was renamed the Arizona State Teachers College .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Under the 30-year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews (1900–1930), the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision in 1902. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still in use. Matthews envisioned an "evergreen campus", with many shrubs brought to the campus, and implemented the planting of 110 Mexican Fan Palms on what is now known as Palm Walk , a century-old landmark of the Tempe campus.

During the Great Depression , Ralph Waldo Swetman was hired to succeed President Matthews, coming to Arizona State Teachers College in 1930 from Humboldt State Teachers College where he had served as president. He served a three-year term, during which he focused on improving teacher-training programs.

[ 20 ] During his tenure, enrollment at the college doubled, topping the 1,000 mark for the first time.

[ 21 ] Matthews also conceived of a self-supported summer session at the school at Arizona State Teachers College, a first for the school.

1930–1989 [ edit ] ASU's Gammage Auditorium , designed by Frank Lloyd Wright In 1933, Grady Gammage , then president of Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff , became president of Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe, beginning a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years, second only to Swetman's 30 years at the college's helm. Like President Porter Eric Gasvoda before him, Gammage oversaw the construction of several buildings on the Tempe campus. He also guided the development of the university's graduate programs; the first Master of Arts in Education was awarded in 1938, the first Doctor of Education degree in 1954 and 10 non-teaching master's degrees were approved by the Arizona Board of Regents in 1956. During his presidency, the school's name was changed to Arizona State College in 1945, and finally to Arizona State University in 1958. At the time, two other names were considered: Tempe University and State University at Tempe .

[ 22 ] Among Gammage's greatest achievements in Tempe was the Frank Lloyd Wright -designed construction of what is Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium/ASU Gammage . One of the university's hallmark buildings, ASU Gammage was completed in 1964, five years after the president's (and Wright's) death.

Gammage was succeeded by Harold D. Richardson , who had served the school earlier in a variety of roles beginning in 1939, including director of graduate studies, college registrar, dean of instruction, dean of the College of Education and academic vice president. Although filling the role of acting president of the university for just nine months (Dec. 1959 to Sept. 1960), Richardson laid the groundwork for the future recruitment and appointment of well-credentialed research science faculty.

By the 1960s, under G. Homer Durham , the university's 11th president, ASU began to expand its curriculum by establishing several new colleges and, in 1961, the Arizona Board of Regents authorized doctoral degree programs in six fields, including Doctor of Philosophy .

[ 23 ] By the end of his nine-year tenure, ASU had more than doubled enrollment, reporting 23,000 in 1969.

The next three presidents— Harry K. Newburn (1969–71), John W. Schwada (1971–81) and J. Russell Nelson (1981–89), including and Interim President Richard Peck (1989)—led the university to increased academic stature, the establishment of the ASU West Valley campus in 1984 and its subsequent construction in 1986, a focus on computer-assisted learning and research, and rising enrollment.

1990–present [ edit ] Example of a new academic village, taken at Barrett, The Honors College on the Tempe Campus Under the leadership of Lattie F. Coor , president from 1990 to 2002, ASU grew through the creation of the Polytechnic campus and extended education sites. Increased commitment to diversity, quality in undergraduate education , research, and economic development occurred over his 12-year tenure. Part of Coor's legacy to the university was a successful fundraising campaign: through private donations, more than $500 million was invested in areas that would significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of Barrett, The Honors College , and the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts ; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.

[ 24 ] ASU's Biodesign Institute on Tempe campus In 2002, Michael M. Crow became the university's 16th president. At his inauguration, he outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a " New American University " [ 25 ] —one that would be open and inclusive, and set a goal for the university to meet Association of American Universities criteria and to become a member.

[ 10 ] Crow initiated the idea of transforming ASU into "One university in many places"—a single institution comprising several campuses, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation. Subsequent reorganizations [ 26 ] combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced staff and administration as the university expanded its West Valley and Polytechnic campuses. ASU's Downtown Phoenix campus was also expanded, with several colleges and schools relocating there. The university established learning centers throughout the state, including the ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City and programs in Thatcher, Yuma, and Tucson. Students at these centers can choose from several ASU degree and certificate programs.

During Crow's tenure, and aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU began a years-long research facility capital building effort that led to the establishment of the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability , and several large interdisciplinary research buildings. Along with the research facilities, the university faculty was expanded, including the addition of five Nobel Laureates .

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Since 2002, the university's research expenditures have tripled and more than 1.5 million square feet of space has been added to the university's research facilities.

[ 29 ] The economic downturn that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU's budget. In response to these cuts, ASU capped enrollment, closed some four dozen academic programs, combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced university faculty, staff and administrators; [ 30 ] with an economic recovery underway in 2011, however, the university continued its campaign to expand the West Valley and Polytechnic Campuses, [ 31 ] and establish a low-cost, teaching-focused extension campus in Lake Havasu City .

[ 32 ] As of 2011, an article in Slate reported that, "the bottom line looks good", noting that: [ 33 ] Since Crow's arrival, ASU's research funding has almost tripled to nearly $350 million. Degree production has increased by 45 percent. And thanks to an ambitious aid program, enrollment of students from Arizona families below poverty is up 647 percent.

On May 1, 2014, ASU was listed as one of fifty-five higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights "for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints" by Barack Obama's White House Task Force To Protect Students from Sexual Assault.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] The publicly announced investigation followed two Title IX suits.

[ 36 ] In July 2014, a group of at least nine current and former students who alleged they were harassed or assaulted asked the federal investigation be expanded.

[ 37 ] In August 2014 ASU president Michael Crow appointed a task force [ 38 ] comprising faculty and staff, students, and members of the university police force to review the university's efforts to address sexual violence. Crow accepted the recommendations of the task force in November 2014.

[ 39 ] In 2015, the Thunderbird School of Global Management became the Thunderbird School of Global Management at ASU. Partnerships for education and research with Mayo Clinic established collaborative degree programs in health care and law, and shared administrator positions, laboratories and classes at the Mayo Clinic Arizona campus.

The Beus Center for Law and Society, the new home of ASU's Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law , opened in fall 2016 on the Downtown Phoenix campus, relocating faculty and students from the Tempe campus to the state capital.

[ 40 ] In September 2024, ASU announced several cuts in response to state budget cuts, including the closure of the Lake Havasu City campus, a reduction of the Arizona Teachers Academy and the addition of a "tuition surcharge".

[ 42 ] The board is composed of 12 members including 11 who are voting members, and one non-voting member. Members of the board include the state governor and superintendent of public instruction acting as ex-officio members, eight volunteer Regents members with eight-year terms who are appointed by the governor, and two student regents, each with two-year terms, and each serving a one-year term as non-voting apprentices.

[ 43 ] ABOR provides policy guidance to the state universities of Arizona. ASU has four campuses in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona , including the Tempe campus in Tempe ; the West Valley campus in Glendale ; the Downtown Phoenix campus; and the Polytechnic campus in Mesa . ASU also offers courses and degrees through ASU Online and at the ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City in western Arizona, and offers regional learning programs in Thatcher, Yuma and Tucson.

The Arizona Board of Regents appoints and elects the president of the university, who is considered the institution's chief executive officer and the chief budget officer.

[ 44 ] The president executes measures enacted by the Board of Regents, controls the university's property, and acts as the university's official representative to the Board of Regents.

[ 45 ] The chief executive officer is assisted through the administration of the institution by the provost, vice presidents, deans, faculty, directors, department chairs, and other officers.

[ 46 ] The president also selects and appoints administrative officers and general counsels. The 16th ASU president is Michael M. Crow , who has served since July 1, 2002.

[ 173 ] Libraries [ edit ] The underground entrance to Hayden Library, [ 175 ] Tempe campus ASU's faculty and students are served by nine libraries across five campuses: Hayden Library, Noble Library, Music Library and Design and the Arts Library on the Tempe campus; Fletcher Library on the West campus; Downtown Phoenix campus library and Ross-Blakley Law Library at the Downtown Phoenix campus; Polytechnic campus library; and the Thunderbird Library at the Thunderbird campus.

[ 176 ] As of 2013 [update] , ASU's libraries held 4.5 million volumes.

[ 177 ] The Arizona State University library system is ranked the 34th largest research library in the United States and Canada, according to criteria established by the Association of Research Libraries that measures various aspects of quality and size of the collection.

[ 178 ] The university continues to grow its special collections , such as the recent addition of a privately held collection of manuscripts by poet Rubén Darío .

[ 179 ] Hayden Library is on Cady Mall in the center of the Tempe campus and is currently under renovation. It opened in 1966 and is the largest library facility at ASU.

[ 175 ] An expansion in 1989 created the subterranean entrance underneath Hayden Lawn and is attached to the above-ground portion of the original library. There are two floors underneath Hayden Lawn with a landmark known as the "Beacon of Knowledge" rising from the center. The underground library lights the beacon at night.

The 2013 Capital Improvement Plan , approved by the Arizona Board of Regents , incorporates a $35 million repurposing and renovation project for Hayden Library.

[ 180 ] The open air moat area that serves as an outdoor study space will be enclosed to increase indoor space for the library. Along with increasing space and renovating the facility, the front entrance of Hayden Library was rebuilt.

Sustainability [ edit ] Solar panel array on the roof deck of ASU's parking structure on Apache Blvd. in Tempe, Arizona As of March 2014 [update] , ASU was the top institution of higher education in the United States for solar generating capacity .

[ 181 ] Today, the university generates over 24 megawatts (MW) of electricity from on-campus solar arrays.

[ 182 ] This is an increase over the June 2012 total of 15.3 MW.

[ 183 ] [ 184 ] ASU has 88 solar photovoltaic (PV) installations containing 81,424 solar panels across four campuses and the ASU Research Park .

[ 185 ] An additional 29 MWdc solar installation was dedicated at Red Rock, Pinal County, Arizona , in January 2017, bringing the university's solar generating capacity to 50 MWdc.

[ 185 ] Additionally, six wind turbines installed on the roof of the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability building on the Tempe campus have operated since October 2008. Under normal conditions, the six turbines produce enough electricity to power approximately 36 computers.

[ 186 ] In 2021, ASU researchers installed a passive radiative cooling film to local Tempe bus shelters to cool temperatures during the daytime by radiating heat to space with zero energy use. The film was produced by 3M and cooled shelter temperatures by 4 °C. It was one of the first applications of the cooling film in the country.

[ 187 ] [ 188 ] ASU's School of Sustainability was the first school in the United States to introduce degrees in the field of sustainability . ASU's School of Sustainability is part of the Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability.

[ 189 ] The School was established in spring 2007 and began enrolling undergraduates in fall 2008. The school offers majors, minors, and a number of certificates in sustainability. ASU is also home to the Sustainability Consortium, which was founded by Jay Golden in 2009.

[ 190 ] The School of Sustainability has been essential in establishing the university as "a leader in the academics of sustainable business".

[ 191 ] The university is widely considered to be one of the most ambitious and principled organizations for embedding sustainable practices into its operating model .

[ 192 ] The university has embraced several challenging sustainability goals.

[ 193 ] Among the numerous benchmarks outlined in the university's prospectus , is the creation of a large recycling and composting operation that will eliminate 30% and divert 90% of waste from landfills.

[ 194 ] This endeavor will be aided by educating students about the benefits of avoiding overconsumption that contributes to excessive waste. Sustainability courses have been expanded to attain this goal and many of the university's individual colleges and schools have integrated such material into their lectures and courses.

[ 195 ] [ 196 ] Second, ASU is on track to reduce its rate of water consumption by 50%. The university's most aggressive benchmark is to be the first, large research university to achieve carbon neutrality as it pertains to its Scope 1, 2 and non-transportation Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions .

[ 192 ] ASU's College of Integrative Sciences and Arts (CISA) offers degrees and certifications focused on sustainable horticulture, natural resource ecology, indoor farming, desert food production and wildlife management, through its College of Applied Sciences and Arts at ASU's Polytechnic campus. CISA's Burrowing Owl Conservation Project at the Polytechnic campus was noted as one of the distinctive features of ASU in The Sierra Club magazine's ranking of ASU as the top "cool school" for sustainability in 2021.

CISA faculty at the Polytechnic campus in disciplines such as applied biological sciences, and technical communication and user experience, are involved in research and community outreach to promote sustainable use of resources and preservation of species and habitat.

Vertical farming Archived September 7, 2023, at the Wayback Machine , indoor farming, and water conservation efforts are just a few of the sustainability initiatives being driven by CISA faculty.

Traditions [ edit ] Maroon and gold [ edit ] Gold is the oldest color associated with Arizona State University and dates back to 1896 when the school was named the Tempe Normal School.

[ 197 ] Maroon and white were later added to the color scheme in 1898. Gold signifies the "golden promise" of ASU. The promise includes every student receiving a valuable educational experience. Gold also signifies the sunshine Arizona is famous for; including the power of the sun and its influence on the climate and the economy. The first uniforms worn by athletes associated with the university were black and white when the "Normals" were the name of the athletic teams. The student section, known as The Inferno, wears gold on game days.

[ 198 ] Maroon signifies sacrifice and bravery while white represents the balance of negativity and positivity. As it is in the city of Tempe, Arizona , the school's colors adorn the neighboring buildings during big game days and festive events.

[ 199 ] Mascot and Spirit Squad [ edit ] Main article: Sparky the Sun Devil Sparky the Sun Devil is the mascot of Arizona State University and was named by vote of the student body on November 8, 1946.

[ 200 ] Sparky often travels with the team across the country and has been at every football bowl game in which the university has participated. The university's mascot is not to be confused with the athletics department's logo, the Pitchfork or hand gesture used by those associated with the university. The new logo is used on various sport facilities, uniforms and athletics documents.

[ 201 ] [ 202 ] Arizona State Teacher's College had a different mascot and the sports teams were known as the Owls and later, the Bulldogs.

When the school was first established, the Tempe Normal School's teams were simply known as the Normals.

[ 203 ] Sparky is visible on the sidelines of every home game played in Sun Devil Stadium or other ASU athletic facilities. His routine at football games includes pushups after every touchdown scored by the Sun Devils. He is aided by Sparky's Crew, male yell leaders that must meet physical requirements to participate as members. The female members are known as the Spirit Squad and are categorized into a dance line and spirit line. They are the official squad that represents ASU. The spirit squad competes every year at the ESPN Universal Dance Association (UDA) College Nationals in the Jazz and Hip-Hop categories. They were chosen by the UDA to represent the US at the World Dance Championship 2013 in the Jazz category.

[ 204 ] "A" Mountain [ edit ] Main article: Tempe Butte Hayden Butte , also known as "A" Mountain "Echo from the Buttes", the annual painting of the "A" by freshmen A letter has existed on the slope of the mountain since 1918. A "T" followed by an "N" were the first letters to grace the landmark.

Tempe Butte , home to "A" Mountain, has had the "A" installed on the slope of its south face since 1938 and is visible from campus just to the south. The original "A" was destroyed by vandals in 1952 with pipe bombs, and a new "A", constructed of reinforced concrete, was built in 1955.

[ 205 ] The vandals were never identified, but many speculate the conspirators were students from the rival in-state university (University of Arizona). Many ancient Hohokam petroglyphs were destroyed by the bomb; nevertheless, many of these archeological sites around the mountain remain. There are many traditions surrounding "A" Mountain, including a revived "guarding of the 'A'" in which students camp on the mountainside before games with rival schools.

[ 205 ] "Echo from the Buttes" is a tradition in which incoming freshmen paint the letter white during orientation week; it is repainted gold before the first football game of the season.

[ 206 ] The practice dated back to the 1930s and grew in popularity, with thousands of students going up to paint the "A" every year.

[ 207 ] Lantern Walk and Homecoming [ edit ] Old newspaper clipping describing the Lantern Walk tradition at ASU, May 30, 1929 The Lantern Walk is one of the oldest traditions at ASU and dates back to 1917.

[ 208 ] It is considered one of ASU's "most cherished" traditions and is an occasion used to mark the work of those associated with ASU throughout history. Anyone associated with ASU is free to participate in the event, including students, alumni, faculty, employees, and friends. This differs slightly from the original tradition in which the seniors would carry lanterns up "A" Mountain followed by the freshman. The senior class president would describe ASU's traditions and the freshman would repeat an oath of allegiance to the university. It was described as a tradition of "good will between the classes" and a way of ensuring new students would continue the university's traditions with honor. In modern times, the participants walk through campus and follow a path up to "A" Mountain to "light up" Tempe. Keynote speakers, performances, and other events are used to mark the occasion. The night is culminated with a fireworks display. The Lantern Walk was held after the Spring Semester (June) but is now held the week before Homecoming , a tradition that dates to 1924 at ASU. It is held in the fall and in conjunction with a football game.

[ 209 ] Victory Bell [ edit ] Ringing of the Victory Bell, Arizona State University c.

1956 In 2012, Arizona State University reintroduced the tradition of ringing a bell after each win for the football team.

[ 210 ] The ROTC cadets associated with the university transport the bell to various events and ring it after Sun Devil victories. The first Victory Bell, in various forms, was used in the 1930s but the tradition faded in the 1970s when the bell was removed from Memorial Union for renovations.

[ 211 ] The bell cracked and was no longer capable of ringing. That bell is on the southeast corner of Sun Devil Stadium, near the entrance to the student section. That bell, given to the university in the late 1960s, is painted gold and is a campus landmark.

Sun Devil Marching Band, Devil Walk and songs of the university [ edit ] Main article: Sun Devil Marching Band Sun Devil Marching Band Battery, performing the pregame drum cadence in 2007 The Arizona State University Sun Devil Marching Band , created in 1915 and known as the "Pride of the Southwest", was the first of only two marching bands in the Pac-12 to receive the prestigious Sudler Trophy .

[ 212 ] The John Philip Sousa Foundation awarded the band the trophy in 1991. The Sun Devil Marching Band remains one of only 28 bands in the nation to have earned the designation. The band performs at every football game played in Sun Devil Stadium. In addition, the Sun Devil Marching Band has made appearances in the Fiesta Bowl, the Rose Bowl, the Holiday Bowl, and the Super Bowl XLII , in addition to many others.

[ 212 ] Smaller ensembles of band members perform at other sport venues including basketball games at Wells Fargo Arena and baseball games. The Devil Walk is held in Wells Fargo Arena by the football team and involves a more formal introduction of the players to the community; a new approach to the tradition added in 2012 with the arrival of head coach Todd Graham .

[ 213 ] It begins 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the game and allows the players to establish rapport with the fans. The walk ends as the team passes the band and fans lined along the path to Sun Devil Stadium. The walk was discontinued when Graham was fired. However, in 2022, interim coach Shaun Aguano announced that the Sun Devil Walk is returning.

[ 214 ] [ 215 ] The most recognizable songs played by the band are "Alma Mater" and ASU's fight songs titled " Maroon and Gold " and the "Al Davis Fight Song". "Alma Mater" was composed by former Music Professor and Director of Sun Devil Marching Band (then known as Bulldog Marching Band), Miles A. Dresskell, in 1937.

[ 216 ] "Maroon and Gold" was authored by former Director of Sun Devil Marching Band, Felix E. McKernan, in 1948. The "Al Davis Fight Song" (also known as "Go, Go Sun Devils" and "Arizona State University Fight Song") was composed by ASU alumnus Albert Oliver Davis in the 1940s without any lyrics. Recently lyrics were added to the song.

[ 212 ] Curtain of Distraction [ edit ] The Curtain of Distraction is a tradition that appears at every men's and women's basketball game. The tradition started in 2013 in order to get fans to the games. In the second half of basketball games, a portable "curtain" opens up in front of the opponents shooting a free throw and students pop out of the curtain to try to distract the opponent. Some of the skits include an Elvis impersonator, people rubbing mayonnaise on their chest, and people wearing unicorn heads.

[ 217 ] In 2016, former Olympian Michael Phelps came out of the curtain wearing a Speedo during a game against Oregon State.

[ 218 ] ESPN estimated that distraction may give ASU a one-to-three point advantage.
