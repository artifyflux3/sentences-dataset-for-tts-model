Some of these lists link to hundreds of articles; some link only to a few. The template below includes links to alphabetical lists of all mathematical articles. This article brings together the same content organized in a manner better suited for browsing.
Lists cover aspects of basic and advanced mathematics, methodology, mathematical statements, integrals, general concepts, mathematical objects, and reference tables.
They also cover equations named after people, societies, mathematicians, journals, and meta-lists.

The purpose of this list is not similar to that of the Mathematics Subject Classification formulated by the American Mathematical Society . Many mathematics journals ask authors of research papers and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The subject codes so listed are used by the two major reviewing databases, Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt MATH . This list has some items that would not fit in such a classification, such as list of exponential topics and list of factorial and binomial topics , which may surprise the reader with the diversity of their coverage.

Pure mathematics [ edit ] Main article: Pure mathematics Algebra [ edit ] Algebra includes the study of algebraic structures, which are sets and operations defined on these sets satisfying certain axioms. The field of algebra is further divided according to which structure is studied; for instance, group theory concerns an algebraic structure called group .

Geometry and topology [ edit ] Ford circles —A circle rests upon each fraction in lowest terms. Each touches its neighbors without crossing.

Geometry is initially the study of spatial figures like circles and cubes, though it has been generalized considerably.

Topology developed from geometry; it looks at those properties that do not change even when the figures are deformed by stretching and bending, like dimension.

Aspects include "counting" the objects satisfying certain criteria ( enumerative combinatorics ), deciding when the criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria (as in combinatorial designs and matroid theory ), finding "largest", "smallest", or "optimal" objects ( extremal combinatorics and combinatorial optimization ), and finding algebraic structures these objects may have ( algebraic combinatorics ).

Outline of combinatorics Glossary of graph theory List of graph theory topics Logic [ edit ] Venn diagrams are illustrations of set theoretical, mathematical or logical relationships.

Logic is the foundation that underlies mathematical logic and the rest of mathematics. It tries to formalize valid reasoning. In particular, it attempts to define what constitutes a proof.

List of Boolean algebra topics List of first-order theories List of large cardinal properties List of mathematical logic topics List of set theory topics Glossary of order theory Number theory [ edit ] The branch of mathematics deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, especially positive integers.

Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss said, "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics."
Number theory also studies the natural, or whole, numbers. One of the central concepts in number theory is that of the prime number , and there are many questions about primes that appear simple but whose resolution continues to elude mathematicians.

A differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function and its derivatives.

In a dynamical system , a fixed rule describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space. The mathematical models used to describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, or the number of fish each spring in a lake are examples of dynamical systems.

List of dynamical systems and differential equations topics List of nonlinear partial differential equations List of partial differential equation topics Mathematical physics [ edit ] Mathematical physics is concerned with "the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories".

Historically, information theory was developed to find fundamental limits on compressing and reliably communicating data.

Signal processing is the analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of signals . Signals of interest include sound , images , biological signals such as ECG , radar signals, and many others. Processing of such signals includes filtering , storage and reconstruction, separation of information from noise , compression , and feature extraction .

List of algebraic coding theory topics List of information theory topics List of cryptography topics Probability and statistics [ edit ] The "bell curve"—the probability density function of the normal distribution .

Main article: Lists of statistics topics Probability theory is the formalization and study of the mathematics of uncertain events or knowledge. The related field of mathematical statistics develops statistical theory with mathematics.

Statistics , the science concerned with collecting and analyzing data, is an autonomous discipline (and not a subdiscipline of applied mathematics ).
