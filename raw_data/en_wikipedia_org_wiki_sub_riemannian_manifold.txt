Roughly speaking, to measure distances in a sub-Riemannian manifold, you are allowed to go only along curves tangent to so-called horizontal subspaces .

Sub-Riemannian manifolds (and so, a fortiori , Riemannian manifolds) carry a natural intrinsic metric called the metric of Carnot–Carathéodory . The Hausdorff dimension of such metric spaces is always an integer and larger than its topological dimension (unless it is actually a Riemannian manifold).

Sub-Riemannian manifolds often occur in the study of constrained systems in classical mechanics , such as the motion of vehicles on a surface, the motion of robot arms, and the orbital dynamics of satellites. Geometric quantities such as the Berry phase may be understood in the language of sub-Riemannian geometry. The Heisenberg group , important to quantum mechanics , carries a natural sub-Riemannian structure.

Definitions [ edit ] By a distribution on M {\displaystyle M} we mean a subbundle of the tangent bundle of M {\displaystyle M} (see also distribution ).

Given a distribution H ( M ) ⊂ ⊂ T ( M ) {\displaystyle H(M)\subset T(M)} a vector field in H ( M ) {\displaystyle H(M)} is called horizontal . A curve γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } on M {\displaystyle M} is called horizontal if γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) ∈ ∈ H γ γ ( t ) ( M ) {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}(t)\in H_{\gamma (t)}(M)} for any t {\displaystyle t} .

A distribution on H ( M ) {\displaystyle H(M)} is called completely non-integrable or bracket generating if for any x ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} we have that any tangent vector can be presented as a linear combination of Lie brackets of horizontal fields, i.e. vectors of the form A ( x ) , [ A , B ] ( x ) , [ A , [ B , C ] ] ( x ) , [ A , [ B , [ C , D ] ] ] ( x ) , … … ∈ ∈ T x ( M ) {\displaystyle A(x),\ [A,B](x),\ [A,[B,C]](x),\ [A,[B,[C,D]]](x),\dotsc \in T_{x}(M)} where all vector fields A , B , C , D , … … {\displaystyle A,B,C,D,\dots } are horizontal. This requirement is also known as Hörmander's condition .

A sub-Riemannian manifold is a triple ( M , H , g ) {\displaystyle (M,H,g)} , where M {\displaystyle M} is a differentiable manifold , H {\displaystyle H} is a completely non-integrable "horizontal" distribution and g {\displaystyle g} is a smooth section of positive-definite quadratic forms on H {\displaystyle H} .

Any (connected) sub-Riemannian manifold carries a natural intrinsic metric , called the metric of Carnot–Carathéodory, defined as d ( x , y ) = inf ∫ ∫ 0 1 g ( γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) , γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) ) d t , {\displaystyle d(x,y)=\inf \int _{0}^{1}{\sqrt {g({\dot {\gamma }}(t),{\dot {\gamma }}(t))}}\,dt,} where infimum is taken along all horizontal curves γ γ : [ 0 , 1 ] → → M {\displaystyle \gamma :[0,1]\to M} such that γ γ ( 0 ) = x {\displaystyle \gamma (0)=x} , γ γ ( 1 ) = y {\displaystyle \gamma (1)=y} .
Horizontal curves can be taken either Lipschitz continuous , Absolutely continuous or in the Sobolev space H 1 ( [ 0 , 1 ] , M ) {\displaystyle H^{1}([0,1],M)} producing the same metric in all cases.

The fact that the distance of two points is always finite (i.e. any two points are connected by an horizontal curve) is a consequence of Hörmander's condition known as Chow–Rashevskii theorem .

Examples [ edit ] A position of a car on the plane is determined by three parameters: two coordinates x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} for the location and an angle α α {\displaystyle \alpha } which describes the orientation of the car. Therefore, the position of the car can be described by a point in a manifold R 2 × × S 1 .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}\times S^{1}.} One can ask, what is the minimal distance one should drive to get from one position to another? This defines a Carnot–Carathéodory metric on the manifold R 2 × × S 1 .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}\times S^{1}.} A closely related example of a sub-Riemannian metric can be constructed on a Heisenberg group : Take two elements α α {\displaystyle \alpha } and β β {\displaystyle \beta } in the corresponding Lie algebra such that { α α , β β , [ α α , β β ] } {\displaystyle \{\alpha ,\beta ,[\alpha ,\beta ]\}} spans the entire algebra. The distribution H {\displaystyle H} spanned by left shifts of α α {\displaystyle \alpha } and β β {\displaystyle \beta } is completely non-integrable . Then choosing any smooth positive quadratic form on H {\displaystyle H} gives a sub-Riemannian metric on the group.

Properties [ edit ] For every sub-Riemannian manifold, there exists a Hamiltonian , called the sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian , constructed out of the metric for the manifold. Conversely, every such quadratic Hamiltonian induces a sub-Riemannian manifold.

Solutions of the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi equations for the sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian are called geodesics, and generalize Riemannian geodesics .
