Statement of the inequality [ edit ] Let X be a random compact set in R n ; that is, a Borel – measurable function from some probability space (Ω, Σ, Pr) to the space of non-empty , compact subsets of R n equipped with the Hausdorff metric . A random vector V : Ω → R n is called a selection of X if Pr( V ∈ X ) = 1. If K is a non-empty, compact subset of R n , let ‖ ‖ K ‖ ‖ = max { ‖ ‖ v ‖ ‖ R n | v ∈ ∈ K } {\displaystyle \|K\|=\max \left\{\left.\|v\|_{\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\right|v\in K\right\}} and define the set-valued expectation E[ X ] of X to be E [ X ] = { E [ V ] | V is a selection of X and E ‖ ‖ V ‖ ‖ < + ∞ ∞ } .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {E} [X]=\{\mathrm {E} [V]|V{\mbox{ is a selection of }}X{\mbox{ and }}\mathrm {E} \|V\|<+\infty \}.} Note that E[ X ] is a subset of R n . In this notation, Vitale's random Brunn–Minkowski inequality is that, for any random compact set X with E [ ‖ ‖ X ‖ ‖ ] < + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle E[\|X\|]<+\infty } , ( v o l n ( E [ X ] ) ) 1 / n ≥ ≥ E [ v o l n ( X ) 1 / n ] , {\displaystyle \left(\mathrm {vol} _{n}\left(\mathrm {E} [X]\right)\right)^{1/n}\geq \mathrm {E} \left[\mathrm {vol} _{n}(X)^{1/n}\right],} where " v o l n {\displaystyle vol_{n}} " denotes n -dimensional Lebesgue measure .

Relationship to the Brunn–Minkowski inequality [ edit ] If X takes the values (non-empty, compact sets) K and L with probabilities 1 − λ and λ respectively, then Vitale's random Brunn–Minkowski inequality is simply the original Brunn–Minkowski inequality for compact sets.
