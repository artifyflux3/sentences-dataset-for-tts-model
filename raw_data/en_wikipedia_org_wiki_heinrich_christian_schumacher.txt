[ 2 ] He cooperated with Carl Friedrich Gauss for the baseline measurement ( Braak Base Line ) in the village Braak near Hamburg in 1820.

He was elected a Foreign Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1821, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1822.

[ 3 ] Schumacher was chiefly occupied with the publication of Ephemerides (11 parts, 1822–1832) and of the journal Astronomische Nachrichten (founded by himself in 1821 and still being published), of which he edited thirty-one volumes.

Their son, Richard Schumacher (1827–1902), was his assistant from 1844 to 1850 at the conservatory at Altona. Having become assistant to Carlos Guillermo Moesta (1825–1884), director of the observatory at Santiago , in 1859, he was associated with the Chilean geodesic survey in 1864. Returning in 1869, he was appointed assistant astronomer at Altona in 1873, and afterwards at Kiel .
