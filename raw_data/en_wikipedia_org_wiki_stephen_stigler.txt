Biography [ edit ] Stigler was born in Minneapolis.

[ 2 ] He received his Ph.D. in 1967 from the University of California, Berkeley . His dissertation was on linear functions of order statistics , and his advisor was Lucien Le Cam . His research has focused on statistical theory of robust estimators and the history of statistics .

Stigler taught at University of Wisconsin–Madison until 1979 when he joined the University of Chicago. In 2006, he was elected to membership of the American Philosophical Society , [ 3 ] and is a past president (1994) of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics .

His father was the economist George Stigler , who was a close friend of Milton Friedman .
