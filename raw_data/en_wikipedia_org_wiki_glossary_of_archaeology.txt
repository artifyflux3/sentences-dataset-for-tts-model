Usually presented vertically, with the shallowest samples at the top and the deepest at the bottom, to represent a pollen core or other stratified deposit. The depth of the sample corresponds roughly to how old it is, and therefore the vertical axis may also contain an estimate of its absolute age. Used to visualise the environmental history of the place where the sample was taken.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] positive geoglyph See geoglyph .

posthole Cut feature that once held an upright timber or stone structural member, which can be recognised even after the (wooden) post has decayed because its fill differs from the sediment around it.

[ citation needed ] potassium–argon dating See K–Ar dating .

potsherd A fragment of pottery.

[ 32 ] In specialised usage sherd is preferred over the more common spelling shard , where sherd refers to ceramics and shard to glass.

[ 33 ] profile Vertical exposure of an excavated area, feature or artefact (as seen from the side), possibly also in section ; a drawing or photograph of the same.

Q [ edit ] quarter sectioning Sometimes called digging by quadrant, it is a procedure for excavating discrete features (especially those circular or ovoid in shape) where two diagonally opposite quadrants are removed, resulting in two complete cross-sections of a feature.

R [ edit ] radiocarbon dating absolute dating technique used to determine the age of organic materials less than 50,000 years old.  Age is determined by examining the loss of the unstable carbon-14 isotope, which is absorbed by all living organisms during their lifespan.  The rate of decay of this unstable isotope after the organism has died is assumed to be constant, and is measured in half-lives of 5730 + 40 years, meaning that the amount of carbon-14 is reduced to half the amount after about 5730 years. Dates generated by radiocarbon dating have to be calibrated using dates derived from other absolute dating methods, such as dendrochronology and ice cores.

section A section is a view of the archaeological sequence showing it in the vertical plane, as a cross section, showing the stratigraphy.

shovelbum A colloquial term for professional excavators working in cultural resources management in the United States.

sieving The use of sieves , screens, and meshes to improve the recovery rate of artefacts from excavated sediments ( spoil ). Can be divided into dry sieving and wet sieving .

[ 11 ] spoil Loose sediment excavated from a trench.

spoil heap A pile of sediment from an excavation, usually located next to a trench.

T [ edit ] trial trenching A method of archaeological evaluation used to estimate the archaeological potential of a site.

[ 34 ] typology The classification of objects according to their physical characteristics.

U [ edit ] An underwater archaeologist recording a feature in plan underwater archaeology Subdiscipline devoted to the study of archaeological remains submerged under seas, lakes, or rivers.

[ 11 ] Wheeler–Kenyon method box–grid method Excavation strategy where an area is divided into a grid of square trenches and baulks are left between each square, exposing the site in both plan and profile . Developed by Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Wheeler at Verulamium (1930–35) and refined by Kathleen Kenyon at Jericho (1952–58).
