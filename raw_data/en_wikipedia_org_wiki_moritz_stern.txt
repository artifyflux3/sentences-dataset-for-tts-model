Stern became Ordinarius (full professor) at Göttingen University in 1858, succeeding Carl Friedrich Gauss . Stern was the first Jewish full professor at a German university who attained the position without changing his Jewish religion.

[ 1 ] Although Carl Gustav Jacobi preceded him (by three decades) as the first Jew to obtain a math professorial chair in Germany, Jacobi's family had converted to Christianity long before then.

As a professor, Stern taught Gauss's student Bernhard Riemann . Stern was very helpful to Gotthold Eisenstein in formulating a proof of the quadratic reciprocity theorem. Stern was interested in primes that cannot be expressed as the sum of a prime and twice a square (now known as Stern primes ).

He is known for formulating Stern's diatomic series [ 2 ] 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, … (sequence A002487 in the OEIS ) that counts the number of ways to write a number as a sum of powers of two with no power used more than twice.

He is also known for the Stern–Brocot tree , which he wrote about in 1858 and which Brocot independently discovered in 1861.
