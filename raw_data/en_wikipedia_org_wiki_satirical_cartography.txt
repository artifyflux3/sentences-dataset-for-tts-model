Rose, from 1899 Satirical cartography is a form of art, exposing stereotypes and political messages with comical geopolitical illustrations.

[ 1 ] Satirical cartography dates back to the late 18th century and early 19th century. Hanna Humphrey and Frederick W. Rose are among the earliest pioneers in cartoon-ish maps.

[ 2 ] In some cases, satirical cartography is meant to critique places and peoples or alternatively the stereotypes forming around given places and peoples.

[ 3 ] They are often used as a way to communicate a message or influence ideas, rather than present objective geographic features.

[ 4 ] Examples [ edit ] Satire maps often parody the knowledge of political figures like Donald Trump , where world maps are labeled according to the views of a satirized Trump. These world maps often include a United States inflated in size, and generalized views on Africa and Muslims , as a means of ridicule to Trump's various policies.

[ 5 ] In the midst of the 2014 Crimean crisis , Yanko Tsvetkov would create a map of Europe "according to Putin ", where countries were labeled humorously and with an exaggerated pro-Russian and pro- USSR ideology.
