The parker Solar Probe captured evidence of a passible dust-free zone, hinting at rings, along with insights into “magnetic islands” and plasma “blobs” 
These weird solar features are described in one of four new papers published in Nature on Wednesday, based on dispatches from a record- breaking NASA space craft called the Parker Solar Probe.
