[ 1 ] The simplest oxonium ion is the hydronium ion ( H 3 O + ).

[ 2 ] Alkyloxonium [ edit ] Hydronium is one of a series of oxonium ions with the formula R n H 3− n O + .
Oxygen is usually pyramidal with an sp 3 hybridization . Those with n = 1 are called primary oxonium ions, an example being protonated alcohol (e.g.

methanol ). In acidic media, the oxonium functional group produced by protonating an alcohol can be a leaving group in the E2 elimination reaction. The product is an alkene . Extreme acidity, heat, and dehydrating conditions are usually required. Other hydrocarbon oxonium ions are formed by protonation or alkylation of alcohols or ethers (R−C− + O −R 1 R 2 ).

Secondary oxonium ions have the formula R 2 OH + , an example being protonated ethers.

Tertiary oxonium ions have the formula R 3 O + , an example being trimethyloxonium .

[ 3 ] Tertiary alkyloxonium salts are useful alkylating agents . For example, triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate ( Et 3 O + )( BF − 4 ), a white crystalline solid, can be used, for example, to produce ethyl esters when the conditions of traditional Fischer esterification are unsuitable.

[ 4 ] It is also used for preparation of enol ethers and related functional groups.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] general pyramidal oxonium ion skeletal formula of the trimethyloxonium cation ball-and-stick model of trimethyloxonium space-filling model of trimethyloxonium Oxatriquinane and oxatriquinacene are unusually stable oxonium ions, first described in 2008. Oxatriquinane does not react with boiling water or with alcohols , thiols , halide ions , or amines , although it does react with stronger nucleophiles such as hydroxide , cyanide , and azide .

Oxocarbenium ions [ edit ] Another class of oxonium ions encountered in organic chemistry is the oxocarbenium ions, obtained by protonation or alkylation of a carbonyl group e.g. R−C= + O −R′ which forms a resonance structure with the fully-fledged carbocation R− + C −O−R′ and is therefore especially stable: Gold-stabilized species [ edit ] An unusually stable oxonium species is the gold complex tris[triphenylphosphinegold(I)]oxonium tetrafluoroborate, [(Ph 3 PAu) 3 O][BF 4 ], where the intramolecular aurophilic interactions between the gold atoms are believed responsible for the stabilisation of the cation.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] This complex is prepared by treatment of Ph 3 PAuCl with Ag 2 O in the presence of NaBF 4 : [ 9 ] 3 Ph 3 PAuCl + Ag 2 O + NaBF 4 → [(Ph 3 PAu) 3 O] + [BF 4 ] − + 2 AgCl + NaCl It has been used as a catalyst for the propargyl Claisen rearrangement .

[ 10 ] Relevance to natural product chemistry [ edit ] Complex bicyclic and tricyclic oxonium ions have been proposed as key intermediates in the biosynthesis of a series of natural products by the red algae of the genus Laurencia .

[ 11 ] Several members of these elusive species have been prepared explicitly by total synthesis, demonstrating the possibility of their existence.

[ 11 ] The key to their successful generation was the use of a weakly coordinating anion (Krossing's anion, [Al(pftb) 4 ] − , pftb = perfluoro- tert -butoxy) as the counteranion.

[ 12 ] As shown in the example below, this was executed by a transannular halide abstraction strategy through the reaction of the oxonium ion precursor (an organic halide ) with the silver salt of the Krossing's anion Ag[Al(pftb) 4 ]•CH 2 Cl 2 , generating the desired oxonium ion with simultaneous precipitation of inorganic silver halides . The resulting oxonium ions were characterized comprehensively by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at low temperature (−78 °C) with support from density functional theory computation.

These oxonium ions were also demonstrated to directly give rise to multiple related natural products by reacting with various nucleophiles , such as water, bromide, chloride, and acetate.
