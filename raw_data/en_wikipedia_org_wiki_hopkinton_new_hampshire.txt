The population was 5,914 at the 2020 census.

[ 2 ] The town has three distinct communities: Hopkinton village, mainly a residential area in the center of the town; Contoocook , the town's business hub, located in the north; and West Hopkinton , within the more agricultural portion of the town. The town is home to the Hopkinton State Fair , adjacent to Contoocook village, and to the historic Contoocook Railroad Depot and the Contoocook Railroad Bridge , the oldest covered railroad bridge in the United States.

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] The town's first framed house built in 1745, as seen in 1901 The town was granted by colonial Governor Jonathan Belcher in 1735 as "Number 5" to settlers from Hopkinton, Massachusetts , who renamed it "New Hopkinton". First settled in 1736, colonists were required to build homes, fence in their land, plant it with English grass, and provide a home for a minister, all within seven years. The community was incorporated in 1765 by Governor Benning Wentworth , [ 4 ] predating the establishment of counties in the colonial province. Built in 1789, the Congregational Church has a Revere bell.

[ 5 ] The state legislature met in Hopkinton occasionally between 1798 and 1807. In 1808, the town competed for the coveted position of state capital, but was defeated by neighboring Concord . Since 1823, the town has been within Merrimack County.

W. S. Davis Building 1889 A substantial portion of the town in the north was named "Contoocook Village", for a tribe of the Pennacook people who once lived there. Due to its position along the Contoocook River , it became a center for water-powered industry, particularly lumber and textiles . The Contoocook covered railroad bridge in the village is a remnant of the Boston & Maine Railroad and is the oldest covered bridge of its kind still standing in the United States.

[ 3 ] Next to the bridge is the Contoocook Railroad Depot , one of the original railroad depots for the Concord and Claremont Railroad .

Since 1915, Hopkinton has been home to the Hopkinton State Fair , an event which attracts thousands of visitors each year during the Labor Day weekend.

[ 6 ] Geography [ edit ] According to the United States Census Bureau , the town has a total area of 45.1 square miles (116.8 km 2 ), of which 43.3 square miles (112.1 km 2 ) are land and 1.8 square miles (4.6 km 2 ) are water, comprising 3.97% of the town.

[ 1 ] Hopkinton is drained by the Contoocook River and its tributary, the Warner River , except for the southeast part of town, which drains to the Turkey River . The highest point in town is Shaker Hill, on the border with Henniker , with an elevation of 923 feet (281 m) above sea level . Hopkinton lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed .
