It states that the geometric mean of those two segments equals the altitude.

Theorem and its converse [ edit ] geometric mean theorem as a special case of the intersecting chords theorem : | C D | | D E | = | A D | | D B | ⇔ ⇔ h 2 = p q {\displaystyle |CD||DE|=|AD||DB|\Leftrightarrow h^{2}=pq} If h denotes the altitude in a right triangle and p and q the segments on the hypotenuse then the theorem can be stated as: [ 1 ] h = p q {\displaystyle h={\sqrt {pq}}} or in term of areas: h 2 = p q .

{\displaystyle h^{2}=pq.} The converse statement is true as well. Any triangle, in which the altitude equals the geometric mean of the two line segments created by it, is a right triangle.

The theorem can also be thought of as a special case of the intersecting chords theorem for a circle, since the converse of Thales' theorem ensures that the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle is the diameter of its circumcircle .

[ 1 ] Applications [ edit ] Construction of ⁠ p {\displaystyle {\sqrt {p}}} ⁠ by setting q to 1 AM-GM inequality The formulation in terms of areas yields a method to square a rectangle with ruler and compass , that is to construct a square of equal area to a given rectangle. For such a rectangle with sides p and q we denote its top left vertex with D (see the Proof > Based on similarity section for a graphic of the construction). Now we extend the segment q to its left by p (using arc AE centered on D ) and draw a half circle with endpoints A and B with the new segment p + q as its diameter. Then we erect a perpendicular line to the diameter in D that intersects the half circle in C . Due to Thales' theorem C and the diameter form a right triangle with the line segment DC as its altitude, hence DC is the side of a square with the area of the rectangle. The method also allows for the construction of square roots (see constructible number ), since starting with a rectangle that has a width of 1 the constructed square will have a side length that equals the square root of the rectangle's length.

[ 1 ] Another application of this theorem provides a geometrical proof of the AM–GM inequality in the case of two numbers, since the half-circle's radius is the arithmetic mean of p and q . This radius can be drawn parallel to the geometric mean constructed as above, which shows that geometric mean is always smaller or equal to the radius, and yields the inequality.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The theorem is usually attributed to Euclid (ca. 360–280 BC), who stated it as a corollary to proposition 8 in book VI of his Elements . In proposition 14 of book II Euclid gives a method for squaring a rectangle, which essentially matches the method given here. Euclid however provides  a different slightly more complicated proof for the correctness of the construction rather than relying on the geometric mean theorem.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] Proof [ edit ] Based on similarity [ edit ] △ △ A B C ∼ ∼ △ △ A D C ∼ ∼ △ △ D B C {\displaystyle \triangle ABC\sim \triangle ADC\sim \triangle DBC} Proof of theorem : The triangles △ ADC , △ BCD are similar , since: consider triangles △ ABC , △ ACD ; here we have ∠ ∠ A C B = ∠ ∠ A D C = 90 ∘ ∘ , ∠ ∠ B A C = ∠ ∠ C A D ; {\displaystyle \angle ACB=\angle ADC=90^{\circ },\quad \angle BAC=\angle CAD;} therefore by the AA postulate △ △ A B C ∼ ∼ △ △ A C D .

{\displaystyle \triangle ABC\sim \triangle ACD.} further, consider triangles △ ABC , △ BCD ; here we have ∠ ∠ A C B = ∠ ∠ B D C = 90 ∘ ∘ , ∠ ∠ A B C = ∠ ∠ C B D ; {\displaystyle \angle ACB=\angle BDC=90^{\circ },\quad \angle ABC=\angle CBD;} therefore by the AA postulate △ △ A B C ∼ ∼ △ △ B C D .

{\displaystyle \triangle ABC\sim \triangle BCD.} Therefore, both triangles △ ACD , △ BCD are similar to △ ABC and themselves, i.e.

△ △ A C D ∼ ∼ △ △ A B C ∼ ∼ △ △ B C D .

{\displaystyle \triangle ACD\sim \triangle ABC\sim \triangle BCD.} Because of the similarity we get the following equality of ratios and its algebraic rearrangement yields the theorem: [ 1 ] h p = q h ⇔ ⇔ h 2 = p q ⇔ ⇔ h = p q ( h , p , q > 0 ) {\displaystyle {\frac {h}{p}}={\frac {q}{h}}\,\Leftrightarrow \,h^{2}=pq\,\Leftrightarrow \,h={\sqrt {pq}}\qquad (h,p,q>0)} Proof of converse: For the converse we have a triangle △ ABC in which h 2 = p q {\displaystyle h^{2}=pq} holds and need to show that the angle at C is a right angle. Now because of h 2 = p q {\displaystyle h^{2}=pq} we also have h p = q h .

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {h}{p}}={\tfrac {q}{h}}.} Together with ∠ ∠ A D C = ∠ ∠ C D B {\displaystyle \angle ADC=\angle CDB} the triangles △ ADC , △ BDC have an angle of equal size and have corresponding pairs of legs with the same ratio. This means the triangles are similar, which yields: ∠ ∠ A C B = ∠ ∠ A C D + ∠ ∠ D C B = ∠ ∠ A C D + ( 90 ∘ ∘ − − ∠ ∠ D B C ) = ∠ ∠ A C D + ( 90 ∘ ∘ − − ∠ ∠ A C D ) = 90 ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\angle ACB&=\angle ACD+\angle DCB\\&=\angle ACD+(90^{\circ }-\angle DBC)\\&=\angle ACD+(90^{\circ }-\angle ACD)\\&=90^{\circ }\end{aligned}}} Based on the Pythagorean theorem [ edit ] Proof with the Pythagorean theorem In the setting of the geometric mean theorem there are three right triangles △ ABC , △ ADC and △ DBC in which the Pythagorean theorem yields: h 2 = a 2 − − q 2 h 2 = b 2 − − p 2 c 2 = a 2 + b 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}h^{2}&=a^{2}-q^{2}\\h^{2}&=b^{2}-p^{2}\\c^{2}&=a^{2}+b^{2}\end{aligned}}} Adding the first 2 two equations and then using the third then leads to: 2 h 2 = a 2 + b 2 − − p 2 − − q 2 = c 2 − − p 2 − − q 2 = ( p + q ) 2 − − p 2 − − q 2 = 2 p q ∴ ∴ h 2 = p q .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}2h^{2}&=a^{2}+b^{2}-p^{2}-q^{2}\\&=c^{2}-p^{2}-q^{2}\\&=(p+q)^{2}-p^{2}-q^{2}\\&=2pq\\\therefore \ h^{2}&=pq.\end{aligned}}} which finally yields the formula of the geometric mean theorem.

[ 4 ] Based on dissection and rearrangement [ edit ] Dissecting the right triangle along its altitude h yields two similar triangles, which can be augmented and arranged in two alternative ways into a larger right triangle with perpendicular sides of lengths p + h and q + h . One such arrangement requires a square of area h 2 to complete it, the other a rectangle of area pq . Since both arrangements yield the same triangle, the areas of the square and the rectangle must be identical.

Based on shear mappings [ edit ] A square constructed on the altitude can be transformed into a rectangle of equal area with sides p and q with the help of three shear mappings (shear mappings preserve the area): Shear mappings with their associated fixed lines (dotted), starting with the original square as preimage each parallelogram displays the image of a shear mapping of the figure left of it References [ edit ] ^ a b c d e *Hartmut Wellstein, Peter Kirsche: Elementargeometrie .
