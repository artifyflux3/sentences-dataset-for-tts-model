ISED is responsible for a number of the federal government's functions in regulating industry and commerce , promoting science and innovation, and supporting economic development . The department was known as Industry Canada ( IC ) prior to 2015.

The department is led by the Minister of Industry (currently Mélanie Joly [ 4 ] ), who also serves as the Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. Several other ministerial portfolios are associated with the department.

[ 5 ] While the minister is head of the department, and provides policy/political direction, the day-to-day operations of the department are managed by the deputy minister , who is a public servant . The department headquarters are located at the C.D. Howe Building at 235 Queen Street in Ottawa , Ontario .

History [ edit ] The Department of Trade and Commerce was created in statute on 23 June 1887 and proclaimed into force on 3 December 1892. In 1969, the department was replaced by the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce , which itself was replaced in 1990 by Industry, Science and Technology . This new department also absorbed the offices of Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion and Minister of State for Science and Technology , marking the inclusion of regional approaches and scientific emphasis in the development of Canadian industries. In 1993, the department expanded its portfolio further to include Consumer and Corporate Affairs.

[ 6 ] In March 1995, the department was renamed Industry Canada .

Upon the November 2015 installation of the 29th Canadian Ministry led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , the position Minister of Industry was renamed Minister of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development . Subsequently, applied title under the Federal Identity Program was changed from Industry Canada to Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] In May 2025, following the installation of the 30th Canadian Ministry led by Prime Minister Mark Carney , the Ministerial title responsible for the ISED portfolio was reverted back to Minister of Industry. In addition, the Carney administration brought major reforms to the federal cabinet, including a historically smaller cabinet [ 9 ] and the establishment, for the first-time in Canadian history, [ 10 ] of a minister responsible for artificial intelligence and digital innovation.
