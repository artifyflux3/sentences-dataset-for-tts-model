The Saints play at Appleton Arena and are part of the Eastern College Athletic Conference . In 2001, St. Lawrence participated in the inaugural NCAA Championship tournament. Their current head coach is St. Lawrence alumnus Chris Wells, who played for the 1992 men's championship ice hockey team.

History [ edit ] Beginning as a club team, the women's program has seen great success since entering Division I in 1997.  Currently, the team has made five Frozen Four appearances in the eight years since the creation of a Women's NCAA Division I tournament. With the women's appearance in inaugural Frozen Four (2001), St. Lawrence became the first school to have both their men and women's programs in the NCAA Division I ice hockey tournament in the same year.

[ 2 ] The women's team also recorded the first ever win in the history of the NCAA Women's Frozen Four.

[ 3 ] The first women's hockey game was played in 1974, as a club program.  The women's team transitioned to a Division III program in 1979, and won three consecutive ECAC Division III tournaments in 1990, 1991, and 1992.

[ 4 ] Following the 2007–08 season, Head Coach Paul Flanagan left St. Lawrence to a position with Syracuse University . Flanagan was the women's program's all-time winningest coach with a nine-season record of 230–83–24.  Then Men's Associate Head Coach, Chris Wells was appointed to replace him [ 4 ] and in his first season coached the team to a berth in the national championship tournament with a record of 24–11–3.
