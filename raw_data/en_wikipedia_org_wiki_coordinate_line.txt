The [spherical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system "Spherical coordinate system") is commonly used in _physics_. It assigns three numbers (known as coordinates) to every point in Euclidean space: radial distance _r_, polar angle _θ_ ([theta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta "Theta")), and azimuthal angle _φ_ ([phi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi "Phi")). The symbol _ρ_ ([rho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho "Rho")) is often used instead of _r_.

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **coordinate system** is a system that uses one or more [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number"), or **coordinates**, to uniquely determine and standardize the [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(geometry) "Position (geometry)") of the [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") or other geometric elements on a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") such as [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-2) The coordinates are not interchangeable; they are commonly distinguished by their position in an ordered [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple"), or by a label, such as in "the _x_-coordinate". The coordinates are taken to be [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") in [elementary mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_mathematics "Elementary mathematics"), but may be [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") or elements of a more abstract system such as a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring"). The use of a coordinate system allows problems in geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and _vice versa_; this is the basis of [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-3)

Common coordinate systems
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coordinate_system&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Common coordinate systems")]

The simplest example of a coordinate system is the identification of points on a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") with real numbers using the _[number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number\_line "Number line")_. In this system, an arbitrary point _O_ (the _origin_) is chosen on a given line. The coordinate of a point _P_ is defined as the signed distance from _O_ to _P_, where the signed distance is the distance taken as positive or negative depending on which side of the line _P_ lies. Each point is given a unique coordinate and each real number is the coordinate of a unique point.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-4)

### Cartesian coordinate system

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coordinate_system&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Cartesian coordinate system")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg/250px-Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Rectangular_coordinates.svg/250px-Rectangular_coordinates.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rectangular_coordinates.svg)

The Cartesian coordinate system in three-dimensional space

The prototypical example of a coordinate system is the [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"). In the [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)"), two [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") lines are chosen and the coordinates of a point are taken to be the signed distances to the lines.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-5) In three dimensions, three mutually [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality "Orthogonality") planes are chosen and the three coordinates of a point are the signed distances to each of the planes.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-6) This can be generalized to create _n_ coordinates for any point in _n_-dimensional Euclidean space.

Depending on the direction and order of the [coordinate axes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#Coordinate_axis), the three-dimensional system may be a [right-handed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule "Right-hand rule") or a left-handed system.

### Polar coordinate system

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coordinate_system&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Polar coordinate system")]

Another common coordinate system for the plane is the _polar coordinate system_.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-7) A point is chosen as the _pole_ and a ray from this point is taken as the _polar axis_. For a given angle _θ_, there is a single line through the pole whose angle with the polar axis is _θ_ (measured counterclockwise from the axis to the line). Then there is a unique point on this line whose signed distance from the origin is _r_ for given number _r_. For a given pair of coordinates (_r_,_θ_) there is a single point, but any point is represented by many pairs of coordinates. For example, (_r_,_θ_), (_r_,_θ_+2 _π_) and (−_r_,_θ_+_π_) are all polar coordinates for the same point. The pole is represented by (0, _θ_) for any value of _θ_.

### Cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coordinate_system&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Cylindrical_Coordinates.svg/250px-Cylindrical_Coordinates.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cylindrical_Coordinates.svg)

Cylindrical coordinate system

There are two common methods for extending the polar coordinate system to three dimensions. In the **cylindrical coordinate system**, a _z_-coordinate with the same meaning as in Cartesian coordinates is added to the _r_ and _θ_ polar coordinates giving a triple (_r_,_θ_,_z_).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-8) Spherical coordinates take this a step further by converting the pair of cylindrical coordinates (_r_,_z_) to polar coordinates (_ρ_,_φ_) giving a triple (_ρ_,_θ_,_φ_).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-9)

### Homogeneous coordinate system

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coordinate_system&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Homogeneous coordinate system")]

A point in the plane may be represented in _homogeneous coordinates_ by a triple (_x_,_y_,_z_) where _x_/_z_ and _y_/_z_ are the Cartesian coordinates of the point.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-10) This introduces an "extra" coordinate since only two are needed to specify a point on the plane, but this system is useful in that it represents any point on the [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane") without the use of [infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity"). In general, a homogeneous coordinate system is one where only the ratios of the coordinates are significant and not the actual values.

### Other commonly used systems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coordinate_system&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Other commonly used systems")]

Some other common coordinate systems are the following:

*   [Curvilinear coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates "Curvilinear coordinates") are a generalization of coordinate systems generally; the system is based on the intersection of curves. 
    *   [Orthogonal coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_coordinates "Orthogonal coordinates"): [coordinate surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_surface "Coordinate surface") meet at right angles
    *   [Skew coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_coordinates "Skew coordinates"): [coordinate surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_surface "Coordinate surface") are not orthogonal

*   The [log-polar coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-polar_coordinates "Log-polar coordinates") represents a point in the plane by the logarithm of the distance from the origin and an angle measured from a reference line intersecting the origin.
*   [Plücker coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%BCcker_coordinates "Plücker coordinates") are a way of representing lines in 3D Euclidean space using a six-tuple of numbers as [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates "Homogeneous coordinates").
*   [Generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates "Generalized coordinates") are used in the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") treatment of mechanics.
*   [Canonical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_coordinates "Canonical coordinates") are used in the [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") treatment of mechanics.
*   [Barycentric coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system "Barycentric coordinate system") as used for [ternary plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot "Ternary plot") and more generally in the analysis of [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle").
*   [Trilinear coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilinear_coordinates "Trilinear coordinates") are used in the context of triangles.

There are ways of describing curves without coordinates, using [intrinsic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_equation "Intrinsic equation") that use invariant quantities such as [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature") and [arc length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length "Arc length"). These include:

*   The [Whewell equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whewell_equation "Whewell equation") relates arc length and the [tangential angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_angle "Tangential angle").
*   The [Cesàro equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ces%C3%A0ro_equation "Cesàro equation") relates arc length and curvature.

Coordinates of geometric objects
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coordinate_system&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Coordinates of geometric objects")]

Coordinates systems are often used to specify the position of a point, but they may also be used to specify the position of more complex figures such as lines, planes, [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") or [spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"). For example, [Plücker coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%BCcker_coordinates "Plücker coordinates") are used to determine the position of a line in space.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-11) When there is a need, the type of figure being described is used to distinguish the type of coordinate system, for example the term _[line coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line\_coordinates "Line coordinates")_ is used for any coordinate system that specifies the position of a line.

It may occur that systems of coordinates for two different sets of geometric figures are equivalent in terms of their analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems in a case like this are said to be _dualistic_. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the _principle of [duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality\_(mathematics) "Duality (mathematics)")_.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-12)

There are often many different possible coordinate systems for describing geometrical figures. The relationship between different systems is described by _coordinate transformations_, which give formulas for the coordinates in one system in terms of the coordinates in another system. For example, in the plane, if Cartesian coordinates (_x_,_y_) and polar coordinates (_r_,_θ_) have the same origin, and the polar axis is the positive _x_ axis, then the coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by _x_=_r_ cos _θ_ and _y_=_r_ sin _θ_.

With every [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") from the space to itself two coordinate transformations can be associated:

*   Such that the new coordinates of the image of each point are the same as the old coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping are the inverse of those for the coordinate transformation)
*   Such that the old coordinates of the image of each point are the same as the new coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping are the same as those for the coordinate transformation)

For example, in [1D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension"), if the mapping is a translation of 3 to the right, the first moves the origin from 0 to 3, so that the coordinate of each point becomes 3 less, while the second moves the origin from 0 to −3, so that the coordinate of each point becomes 3 more.

Coordinate lines/curves
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coordinate_system&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Coordinate lines/curves")]

"Coordinate line" redirects here; not to be confused with [Line coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_coordinates "Line coordinates").

Given a coordinate system, if one of the coordinates of a point varies while the other coordinates are held constant, then the resulting curve is called a **coordinate curve**. If a coordinate curve is a [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line"), it is called a **coordinate line**. A coordinate system for which some coordinate curves are not lines is called a _[curvilinear coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear\_coordinate\_system "Curvilinear coordinate system")_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-13)_[Orthogonal coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal\_coordinates "Orthogonal coordinates")_ are a special but extremely common case of curvilinear coordinates.

A coordinate line with all other constant coordinates equal to zero is called a **coordinate axis**, an [oriented line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_line "Oriented line") used for assigning coordinates. In a [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), all coordinates curves are lines, and, therefore, there are as many coordinate axes as coordinates. Moreover, the coordinate axes are pairwise [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal "Orthogonal").

A polar coordinate system is a curvilinear system where coordinate curves are lines or [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"). However, one of the coordinate curves is reduced to a single point, the origin, which is often viewed as a circle of radius zero. Similarly, spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems have coordinate curves that are lines, circles or circles of radius zero.

Many curves can occur as coordinate curves. For example, the coordinate curves of [parabolic coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_coordinates "Parabolic coordinates") are [parabolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola").

Coordinate planes/surfaces
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coordinate_system&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Coordinate planes/surfaces")]

"Coordinate plane" redirects here; not to be confused with [Plane coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_coordinates "Plane coordinates").

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Parabolic_coordinates_3D.png/250px-Parabolic_coordinates_3D.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parabolic_coordinates_3D.png)

Coordinate surfaces of the three-dimensional paraboloidal coordinates.

In three-dimensional space, if one coordinate is held constant and the other two are allowed to vary, then the resulting surface is called a **coordinate surface**. For example, the coordinate surfaces obtained by holding _ρ_ constant in the [spherical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system "Spherical coordinate system") are the spheres with center at the origin. In three-dimensional space the intersection of two coordinate surfaces is a coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate system we may speak of **coordinate planes**. Similarly, **coordinate hypersurfaces** are the (_n_ − 1)-dimensional spaces resulting from fixing a single coordinate of an _n_-dimensional coordinate system.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-14)

The concept of a _coordinate map_, or _coordinate chart_ is central to the theory of manifolds. A coordinate map is essentially a coordinate system for a subset of a given space with the property that each point has exactly one set of coordinates. More precisely, a coordinate map is a [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") from an open subset of a space _X_ to an open subset of **R**_n_.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-15) It is often not possible to provide one consistent coordinate system for an entire space. In this case, a collection of coordinate maps are put together to form an [atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology) "Atlas (topology)") covering the space. A space equipped with such an atlas is called a _manifold_ and additional structure can be defined on a manifold if the structure is consistent where the coordinate maps overlap. For example, a [differentiable manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold") is a manifold where the change of coordinates from one coordinate map to another is always a differentiable function.

Orientation-based coordinates
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coordinate_system&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Orientation-based coordinates")]

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") and [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics"), coordinate systems are used to describe the (linear) position of points and the [angular position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") of axes, planes, and [rigid bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line#cite_note-16) In the latter case, the orientation of a second (typically referred to as "local") coordinate system, fixed to the node, is defined based on the first (typically referred to as "global" or "world" coordinate system). For instance, the orientation of a rigid body can be represented by an orientation [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"), which includes, in its three columns, the [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") of three points. These points are used to define the orientation of the axes of the local system; they are the tips of three [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") aligned with those axes.

The Earth as a whole is one of the most common geometric spaces requiring the precise measurement of location, and thus coordinate systems. Starting with the Greeks of the [Hellenistic period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period "Hellenistic period"), a variety of coordinate systems have been developed based on the types above, including:

*   [Geographic coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system "Geographic coordinate system"), the [spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system "Spherical coordinate system") of [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude")
*   [Projected coordinate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_reference_system "Grid reference system"), including thousands of [cartesian coordinate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), each based on a [map projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection "Map projection") to create a planar surface of the world or a region.
*   [Geocentric coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_coordinate_system "Geocentric coordinate system"), a three-dimensional [cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") that models the earth as an object, and are most commonly used for modeling the orbits of [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite"), including the [Global Positioning System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System "Global Positioning System") and other [satellite navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation "Satellite navigation") systems.
