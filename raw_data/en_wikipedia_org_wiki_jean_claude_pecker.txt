He served as the secretary-general of the International Astronomical Union from 1964 to 1967. Pecker was the President of the Société astronomique de France (SAF) , the French amateur astronomical society, from 1973–1976.

[ 2 ] He was awarded the Prix Jules Janssen by the French Astronomical Society in 1967. A minor planet ( 1629 Pecker ) is named after him.

[ 3 ] Pecker was a vocal opponent of astrology and pseudo-science [ 4 ] [ 5 ] and was the president of the Association française pour l'information scientifique (AFIS) , a skeptical organisation which promotes scientific enquiry in the face of quackery and obscurantism .

Early life [ edit ] Jean-Claude Pecker was born 10 May 1923, in Reims , to Victor-Noël Pecker and Nelly Catherine née Hermann (a teacher of Philosophy and Literature), in the department of Marne , France.

[ 6 ] The grandson of Joseph Hermann, rabbi of Valenciennes and later Reims , Pecker was born in his maternal grandparents' house, moving later to Bordeaux . In the summer of 1941 they moved to the Hermann house in Paris because of anti-Jewish restrictions placed on his parents during the Vichy regime .

[ 7 ] In May 1944 both his parents were transported to Auschwitz where they died, while his grandmother, absent during the raid, was hidden by neighbour Ida Barrett who was later designated by the state of Israel as one of the Righteous Among the Nations for her actions to conceal the old lady until the liberation of Paris .

[ 8 ] Pecker was interested in astronomy from a young age. He studied at the Lycée Michel de Montaigne de Bordeaux but was forced to go into hiding during the Second World War.

[ 9 ] After the Liberation of France he attended the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. In October 1946 he joined the Institut d'astrophysique de Paris and studied for the agrégation of physics and chemistry, [ 10 ] where he studied under, and had his doctoral thesis judged by Nobel Prize winning physicist Alfred Kastler . He earned his doctorate in May 1950.

[ 11 ] At the Institut d’Astrophysique he got to know and shared an office with Evry Schatzman with whom he collaborated for many years.

[ 10 ] Professional career [ edit ] From 1952 to 1955 Pecker was associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Clermont-Ferrand . From early in his career he held many international appointments including fellow of the High Altitude Observatory in Colorado, USA.

[ 10 ] [ 12 ] In 1955 he became astronomer for the Paris Observatory followed by director of the Nice Observatory in 1961. In 1963 Pecker became professor of theoretical astrophysics at the Collège de France in Paris, a position he held until 1988 when he became honorary professor . He was also director of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) Institute of Astrophysics from 1972–1978.

[ 13 ] His main fields of work within astrophysics were solar and stellar atmospheres and Sun-Earth interactions. He was also known for questioning the standard Big Bang theory , positing "alternative but partial solutions" (a quasi-static model) [ 5 ] and was signatory, with 33 other scientists, to an open letter to the scientific community expressing concern over the dominance of the Big Bang and expansion of the Universe theories. They complained that the tired light theory in particular was generally discounted or ignored by most cosmologists at the time of writing.

[ citation needed ] When asked what astrophysics is for he replied, Nothing, fortunately!..Astrophysics brings no financial reward, but nowadays the only reward that counts is economic! Astrophysics is used to understand the Universe. It is essentially an intellectual discipline, for the pleasure of understanding, the pleasure of knowing, for the accumulation of knowledge. Astrophysics is for creating happiness.
