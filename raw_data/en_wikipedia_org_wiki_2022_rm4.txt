Discovery [ 1 ] Discovered by Pan-STARRS 2 Discovery date 12 September 2022 Designations MPC designation 2022 RM 4 Minor planet category Apollo NEO PHA [ 2 ] Orbital characteristics [ 2 ] Epoch 2022-Aug-09 ( JD 2459800.5) Uncertainty parameter 5 Observation arc 50 days Aphelion 3.90 AU (Q) Perihelion 0.988 44 AU (q) Semi-major axis 2.446 AU (a) Eccentricity 0.596 (e) Orbital period (sidereal) 3.83 years Mean anomaly 337.8 ° (M) Inclination 38.31° (i) Longitude of ascending node 218.2° (Ω) Time of perihelion 3 November 2022 Argument of perihelion 181.7° (ω) Earth MOID 0.0032 AU (480 thousand km; 1.2 LD) Jupiter MOID 1.5 AU (220 million km) Physical characteristics Dimensions ≈400 m (1,000 ft) [ 3 ] [ a ] 290–650 meters [ b ] Absolute magnitude (H) 19.8 [ 4 ] 2022 RM 4 is categorized as a potentially hazardous asteroid because it is around 400 meters in diameter [ 3 ] [ a ] and makes close approaches to Earth. It was discovered on 12 September 2022 when it was 0.61 AU (91 million km ) from Earth and located at declination +65 near the northern circumpolar star Zeta Draconis .

[ 1 ] At 1 November 2022 18:26 UT it passed 0.01536 AU (2,298,000 km ; 5.98 LD ) from Earth.

[ 2 ] As of 1 November 2022 the uncertainty in the close approach distance was ± 77 km .

[ 5 ] The asteroid should have brighten to about apparent magnitude 14.3 which is roughly the brightness of Pluto and was around 75 degrees from the Sun.

[ 6 ] It may have been viewable by experienced amateur observers with a telescope that has an aperture of around 8-inches or better.

[ 7 ] Earth Approach on 1 November 2022 [ 2 ] Date JPL Horizons nominal geocentric distance ( AU ) uncertainty region ( 3-sigma ) 2022-11-01 18:26 ± 00:01 0.01536 AU (2.298 million km ) [ 2 ] ± 77 km [ 8 ] By 2 November 2022 the asteroid was better placed for the southern hemisphere with a declination of –32.

[ 6 ] Goldstone Solar System Radar using the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex 70–meter Deep Space Station 43 and Australia Telescope Compact Array observed the asteroid on 2 November 2022.

[ 9 ] It then came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) on 3 November 2022.

^ Diameter range based on Minor Planet Center absolute magnitude value of 19.8 and assumed albedo range of 0.25 to 0.05.
