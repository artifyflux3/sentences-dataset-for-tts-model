[ 2 ] [ 3 ] (For mixtures of gases, the letter y is recommended.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] ) It is a dimensionless quantity with dimension of N / N {\displaystyle {\mathsf {N}}/{\mathsf {N}}} and dimensionless unit of moles per mole ( mol/mol or mol ⋅ mol −1 ) or simply 1; metric prefixes may also be used (e.g., nmol/mol for 10 −9 ).

[ 5 ] When expressed in percent , it is known as the mole percent or molar percentage (unit symbol %, sometimes "mol%", equivalent to cmol/mol for 10 −2 ).
The mole fraction is called amount fraction by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) [ 1 ] and amount-of-substance fraction by the U.S.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

[ 6 ] This nomenclature is part of the International System of Quantities (ISQ), as standardized in ISO 80000-9 , [ 4 ] which deprecates "mole fraction" based on the unacceptability of mixing information with units when expressing the values of quantities.

[ 6 ] The sum of all the mole fractions in a mixture is equal to 1: ∑ ∑ i = 1 N n i = n t o t ; ∑ ∑ i = 1 N x i = 1 {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{N}n_{i}=n_{\mathrm {tot} };\ \sum _{i=1}^{N}x_{i}=1} Mole fraction is numerically identical to the number fraction , which is defined as the number of particles ( molecules ) of a constituent N i divided by the total number of all molecules N tot . 
Whereas mole fraction is a ratio of amounts to amounts (in units of moles per moles), molar concentration is a quotient of amount to volume (in units of moles per litre).
Other ways of expressing the composition of a mixture as a dimensionless quantity are mass fraction and volume fraction .

Properties [ edit ] Mole fraction is used very frequently in the construction of phase diagrams . It has a number of advantages: it is not temperature dependent (as is molar concentration ) and does not require knowledge of the densities of the phase(s) involved a mixture of known mole fraction can be prepared by weighing off the appropriate masses of the constituents the measure is symmetric : in the mole fractions x = 0.1 and x = 0.9, the roles of 'solvent' and 'solute' are reversed.

In a mixture of ideal gases , the mole fraction can be expressed as the ratio of partial pressure to total pressure of the mixture In a ternary mixture one can express mole fractions of a component as functions of other components mole fraction and binary mole ratios: x 1 = 1 − − x 2 1 + x 3 x 1 x 3 = 1 − − x 2 1 + x 1 x 3 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x_{1}&={\frac {1-x_{2}}{1+{\frac {x_{3}}{x_{1}}}}}\\[2pt]x_{3}&={\frac {1-x_{2}}{1+{\frac {x_{1}}{x_{3}}}}}\end{aligned}}} Differential quotients can be formed at constant ratios like those above: ( ∂ ∂ x 1 ∂ ∂ x 2 ) x 1 x 3 = − − x 1 1 − − x 2 {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial x_{1}}{\partial x_{2}}}\right)_{\frac {x_{1}}{x_{3}}}=-{\frac {x_{1}}{1-x_{2}}}} or ( ∂ ∂ x 3 ∂ ∂ x 2 ) x 1 x 3 = − − x 3 1 − − x 2 {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial x_{3}}{\partial x_{2}}}\right)_{\frac {x_{1}}{x_{3}}}=-{\frac {x_{3}}{1-x_{2}}}} The ratios X , Y , and Z of mole fractions can be written for ternary and multicomponent systems: X = x 3 x 1 + x 3 Y = x 3 x 2 + x 3 Z = x 2 x 1 + x 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}X&={\frac {x_{3}}{x_{1}+x_{3}}}\\[2pt]Y&={\frac {x_{3}}{x_{2}+x_{3}}}\\[2pt]Z&={\frac {x_{2}}{x_{1}+x_{2}}}\end{aligned}}} These can be used for solving PDEs like: ( ∂ ∂ μ μ 2 ∂ ∂ n 1 ) n 2 , n 3 = ( ∂ ∂ μ μ 1 ∂ ∂ n 2 ) n 1 , n 3 {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \mu _{2}}{\partial n_{1}}}\right)_{n_{2},n_{3}}=\left({\frac {\partial \mu _{1}}{\partial n_{2}}}\right)_{n_{1},n_{3}}} or ( ∂ ∂ μ μ 2 ∂ ∂ n 1 ) n 2 , n 3 , n 4 , … … , n i = ( ∂ ∂ μ μ 1 ∂ ∂ n 2 ) n 1 , n 3 , n 4 , … … , n i {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \mu _{2}}{\partial n_{1}}}\right)_{n_{2},n_{3},n_{4},\ldots ,n_{i}}=\left({\frac {\partial \mu _{1}}{\partial n_{2}}}\right)_{n_{1},n_{3},n_{4},\ldots ,n_{i}}} This equality can be rearranged to have differential quotient of mole amounts or fractions on one side.

( ∂ ∂ μ μ 2 ∂ ∂ μ μ 1 ) n 2 , n 3 = − − ( ∂ ∂ n 1 ∂ ∂ n 2 ) μ μ 1 , n 3 = − − ( ∂ ∂ x 1 ∂ ∂ x 2 ) μ μ 1 , n 3 {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \mu _{2}}{\partial \mu _{1}}}\right)_{n_{2},n_{3}}=-\left({\frac {\partial n_{1}}{\partial n_{2}}}\right)_{\mu _{1},n_{3}}=-\left({\frac {\partial x_{1}}{\partial x_{2}}}\right)_{\mu _{1},n_{3}}} or ( ∂ ∂ μ μ 2 ∂ ∂ μ μ 1 ) n 2 , n 3 , n 4 , … … , n i = − − ( ∂ ∂ n 1 ∂ ∂ n 2 ) μ μ 1 , n 2 , n 4 , … … , n i {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \mu _{2}}{\partial \mu _{1}}}\right)_{n_{2},n_{3},n_{4},\ldots ,n_{i}}=-\left({\frac {\partial n_{1}}{\partial n_{2}}}\right)_{\mu _{1},n_{2},n_{4},\ldots ,n_{i}}} Mole amounts can be eliminated by forming ratios: ( ∂ ∂ n 1 ∂ ∂ n 2 ) n 3 = ( ∂ ∂ n 1 n 3 ∂ ∂ n 2 n 3 ) n 3 = ( ∂ ∂ x 1 x 3 ∂ ∂ x 2 x 3 ) n 3 {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial n_{1}}{\partial n_{2}}}\right)_{n_{3}}=\left({\frac {\partial {\frac {n_{1}}{n_{3}}}}{\partial {\frac {n_{2}}{n_{3}}}}}\right)_{n_{3}}=\left({\frac {\partial {\frac {x_{1}}{x_{3}}}}{\partial {\frac {x_{2}}{x_{3}}}}}\right)_{n_{3}}} Thus the ratio of chemical potentials becomes: ( ∂ ∂ μ μ 2 ∂ ∂ μ μ 1 ) n 2 n 3 = − − ( ∂ ∂ x 1 x 3 ∂ ∂ x 2 x 3 ) μ μ 1 {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \mu _{2}}{\partial \mu _{1}}}\right)_{\frac {n_{2}}{n_{3}}}=-\left({\frac {\partial {\frac {x_{1}}{x_{3}}}}{\partial {\frac {x_{2}}{x_{3}}}}}\right)_{\mu _{1}}} Similarly the ratio for the multicomponents system becomes ( ∂ ∂ μ μ 2 ∂ ∂ μ μ 1 ) n 2 n 3 , n 3 n 4 , … … , n i − − 1 n i = − − ( ∂ ∂ x 1 x 3 ∂ ∂ x 2 x 3 ) μ μ 1 , n 3 n 4 , … … , n i − − 1 n i {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \mu _{2}}{\partial \mu _{1}}}\right)_{{\frac {n_{2}}{n_{3}}},{\frac {n_{3}}{n_{4}}},\ldots ,{\frac {n_{i-1}}{n_{i}}}}=-\left({\frac {\partial {\frac {x_{1}}{x_{3}}}}{\partial {\frac {x_{2}}{x_{3}}}}}\right)_{\mu _{1},{\frac {n_{3}}{n_{4}}},\ldots ,{\frac {n_{i-1}}{n_{i}}}}} Related quantities [ edit ] Mass fraction [ edit ] The mass fraction w i can be calculated using the formula w i = x i M i M ¯ ¯ = x i M i ∑ ∑ j x j M j {\displaystyle w_{i}=x_{i}{\frac {M_{i}}{\bar {M}}}=x_{i}{\frac {M_{i}}{\sum _{j}x_{j}M_{j}}}} where M i is the molar mass of the component i and M̄ is the average molar mass of the mixture.

Molar mixing ratio [ edit ] The mixing of two pure components can be expressed introducing the amount or molar mixing ratio of them r n = n 2 n 1 {\displaystyle r_{n}={\frac {n_{2}}{n_{1}}}} . Then the mole fractions of the components will be: x 1 = 1 1 + r n x 2 = r n 1 + r n {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x_{1}&={\frac {1}{1+r_{n}}}\\[2pt]x_{2}&={\frac {r_{n}}{1+r_{n}}}\end{aligned}}} The amount ratio equals the ratio of mole fractions of components: n 2 n 1 = x 2 x 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {n_{2}}{n_{1}}}={\frac {x_{2}}{x_{1}}}} due to division of both numerator and denominator by the sum of molar amounts of components. This property has consequences for representations of phase diagrams using, for instance, ternary plots .

Mixing binary mixtures with a common component to form ternary mixtures [ edit ] Mixing binary mixtures with a common component gives a ternary mixture with certain mixing ratios between the three components. These mixing ratios from the ternary and the corresponding mole fractions of the ternary mixture x 1(123) , x 2(123) , x 3(123) can be expressed as a function of several mixing ratios involved, the mixing ratios between the components of the binary mixtures and the mixing ratio of the binary mixtures to form the ternary one.

x 1 ( 123 ) = n ( 12 ) x 1 ( 12 ) + n 13 x 1 ( 13 ) n ( 12 ) + n ( 13 ) {\displaystyle x_{1(123)}={\frac {n_{(12)}x_{1(12)}+n_{13}x_{1(13)}}{n_{(12)}+n_{(13)}}}} Mole percentage [ edit ] Multiplying mole fraction by 100 gives the mole percentage, also referred as amount/amount percent [abbreviated as (n/n)% or mol %].

Mass concentration [ edit ] The conversion to and from mass concentration ρ i is given by: x i = ρ ρ i ρ ρ M ¯ ¯ M i ⇔ ⇔ ρ ρ i = x i ρ ρ M i M ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x_{i}&={\frac {\rho _{i}}{\rho }}{\frac {\bar {M}}{M_{i}}}\\[3pt]\Leftrightarrow \rho _{i}&=x_{i}\rho {\frac {M_{i}}{\bar {M}}}\end{aligned}}} where M̄ is the average molar mass of the mixture.

Molar concentration [ edit ] The conversion to molar concentration c i is given by: c i = x i c = x i ρ ρ M ¯ ¯ = x i ρ ρ ∑ ∑ j x j M j {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}c_{i}&=x_{i}c\\[3pt]&={\frac {x_{i}\rho }{\bar {M}}}={\frac {x_{i}\rho }{\sum _{j}x_{j}M_{j}}}\end{aligned}}} where M̄ is the average molar mass of the solution, c is the total molar concentration and ρ is the density of the solution.

Mass and molar mass [ edit ] The mole fraction can be calculated from the masses m i and molar masses M i of the components: x i = m i M i ∑ ∑ j m j M j {\displaystyle x_{i}={\frac {\frac {m_{i}}{M_{i}}}{\sum _{j}{\frac {m_{j}}{M_{j}}}}}} Spatial variation and gradient [ edit ] In a spatially non-uniform mixture, the mole fraction gradient triggers the phenomenon of diffusion .
