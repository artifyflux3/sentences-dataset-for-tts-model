[ 1 ] This viewpoint questions the boundaries conventionally imposed between self and other , mind and body , observer and observed , [ 2 ] and other dichotomies that shape our perception of reality. As a field of study, nondualism delves into the concept of nonduality [ 2 ] and the state of nondual awareness , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] encompassing a diverse array of interpretations, not limited to a particular cultural or religious context; instead, nondualism emerges as a central teaching across various belief systems, inviting individuals to examine reality beyond the confines of dualistic thinking.

Nondualism emphasizes direct experience as a path to understanding . While intellectual comprehension has its place, nondualism emphasizes the transformative power of firsthand encounters with the underlying unity of existence. Through practices like meditation and self-inquiry , practitioners aim to bypass the limitations of conceptual understanding and directly apprehend the interconnectedness that transcends superficial distinctions.

[ 5 ] This experiential aspect of nondualism challenges the limitations of language and rational thought , aiming for a more immediate, intuitive form of knowledge.

Nondualism is distinct from monism , [ 6 ] another philosophical concept that deals with the nature of reality . While both philosophies challenge the conventional understanding of dualism, they approach it differently. Nondualism emphasizes unity amid diversity. In contrast, monism posits that reality is ultimately grounded in a singular substance or principle , reducing the multiplicity of existence to a singular foundation. The distinction lies in their approach to the relationship between the many and the one .

[ 7 ] Each nondual tradition presents unique interpretations of nonduality.

Upanishadic and Vedanta philosophies of Hinduism focuses on the realization of the unity between the individual self ( Ātman ) and the ultimate reality ( Brahman ), which is beyond all constraints, duality, and boundaries, and is the absolute ground from which time, space, and natural law emerge.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] In Zen Buddhism , the emphasis is on the direct experience of interconnectedness that goes beyond conventional thought constructs.

Dzogchen , found in Tibetan Buddhism , highlights the recognition of an innate nature free from dualistic limitations.

[ 10 ] Taoism embodies nondualism by emphasizing the harmony and interconnectedness of all phenomena, transcending dualistic distinctions, [ 11 ] [ 12 ] towards a pure state of awareness free of conceptualizations.

[ 13 ] Etymology [ edit ] "Dual" comes from Latin "duo", two, prefixed with "non-" meaning "not"; "non-dual" means "not-two". When referring to nonduality, Hinduism generally uses the Sanskrit term Advaita, while Buddhism uses Advaya (Tibetan: gNis-med, Chinese: pu-erh, Japanese: fu-ni ) .

[ 14 ] "Advaita" (अद्वैत) is from Sanskrit roots a , not; dvaita , dual. As Advaita , it means "not-two" [ 5 ] [ 15 ] or "one without a second", [ 15 ] and is usually translated as "nondualism", "nonduality" or "nondual". The term "nondualism" and the term " advaita " from which it originates are polyvalent terms.

[ note 1 ] "Advaya" (अद्वय) is also a Sanskrit word that means "identity, unique, not two, without a second", and typically refers to the two truths doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism , especially Madhyamaka .

The English term "nondual" was informed by early translations of the Upanishads in Western languages other than English from 1775. These terms have entered the English language from literal English renderings of " advaita " subsequent to the first wave of English translations of the Upanishads . These translations commenced with the work of Müller (1823–1900), in the monumental Sacred Books of the East (1879). He rendered "advaita" as " Monism ", as have many recent scholars.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] However, some scholars state that "advaita" is not really monism.

[ 24 ] Definitions [ edit ] See also: Monism , Mind-body dualism , Dualistic cosmology , and Pluralism (philosophy) The term nonduality is used across various spiritual and philosophical traditions but lacks a single, universally accepted definition.

[ 25 ] It broadly refers to the rejection of fundamental distinctions between concepts such as self and other, subject and object, or absolute and relative. Scholars often discuss multiple forms of nonduality, each emphasizing different aspects of metaphysics , epistemology , and mystical experience .

[ 25 ] Conceptualizing nonduality [ edit ] David Loy argues that rather than a singular concept, nonduality should be understood as a family of related ideas, varying across traditions such as Advaita Vedanta , Mahayana Buddhism , and Taoism .

[ 26 ] He proposes five major perspectives: Nondual awareness – The nondifference of subject and object, where the observer and the observed are ultimately inseparable.

[ 27 ] This idea is central to Buddhist Zen , Advaita Vedanta, and Taoism, which describe reality as a unified field of experience beyond conceptual thought.

[ 26 ] The nonplurality of the world – Although reality appears as a multiplicity of distinct entities, some traditions describe it as fundamentally one essence.

[ 9 ] This is seen in Advaita Vedanta's assertion that Brahman alone is real, with the world appearing as an illusory manifestation.

[ 28 ] The negation of dualistic thinking – Some nondual traditions reject binary oppositions such as self/other, good/evil, or existence/non-existence. The yin-yang symbol of Taoism reflects this transcendence of opposites.

[ 9 ] The identity of phenomena and the absolute – Nonduality in Madhyamaka Buddhism and the two truths doctrine asserts that phenomena (relative truth) and emptiness (ultimate truth) are inseparable.

[ 29 ] This differs from monistic nonduality, as it denies a singular, unchanging essence.

[ 29 ] Mysticism and divine unity – Some mystical traditions describe a direct experience of unity between the individual and the divine, such as Sufism ’s fana (self-annihilation), Christian mystical union , and Kabbalistic Ein Sof .

[ 9 ] However, this perspective differs from nondual frameworks that reject theism altogether.

[ 30 ] While Loy suggests that these perspectives stem from a shared experience of reality, other scholars challenge this claim, arguing that nondualism takes different forms in different traditions.

[ 31 ] Nondual awareness [ edit ] "Nondual awareness" refers to a state of consciousness described in contemplative traditions as a background field of unified, immutable awareness that exists prior to conceptual thought.

[ 3 ] This state is described in various ways across different traditions: In Advaita Vedanta , nondual awareness is pure consciousness ( Atman ), which is identical to Brahman .

[ 28 ] In Mahayana Buddhism , it is rigpa (Tibetan Dzogchen ) or shunyata (emptiness), where awareness remains but is empty of intrinsic identity.

[ 29 ] In Samkhya philosophy, it is Purusha , the eternal witness-consciousness that observes the fluctuations of Prakriti (the material world).

[ 4 ] Scientific perspectives [ edit ] Recent neuroscientific and phenomenological studies have examined nondual awareness as a distinct cognitive and experiential state. Josipovic describes it as a non-representational mode of consciousness, distinct from other mental states.

[ 4 ] Gamma & Metzinger (2021) propose that nondual awareness can be mapped phenomenologically, identifying factors such as luminosity, absence of egoic boundaries, and self-reflexivity.

[ 3 ] However, scholars such as Robert Sharf argue that scientific studies risk reifying nonduality as a purely neurocognitive phenomenon, stripping it of its cultural and soteriological contexts.

[ 32 ] Hinduism [ edit ] According to Signe Cohen, the notion of the highest truth lying beyond all dualistic constructs of reality finds its origins in ancient Indian philosophical thought. One of the earliest articulations of this concept is evident in the renowned Nasadiya ("Non-Being") hymn of the Ṛigveda , which contemplates a primordial state of undifferentiated existence, devoid of both being and non-being.

[ 33 ] The Mahāvākyas , as documented in the Upanishads, explain the unity of Brahman and Atman and form the basis of the Advaita Vedanta tradition.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] Vedanta [ edit ] Main article: Vedanta Several schools of Vedanta are informed by Samkhya , the earliest Indian school of dualism , but teach a form of nondualism. The best-known is Advaita Vedanta, but other nondual Vedanta schools also have a significant influence and following, such as Vishishtadvaita Vedanta and Dvaitadvaita , [ 36 ] both of which are bhedabheda .

[ 36 ] Although the term is best known from the Advaita Vedanta school of Adi Shankara , "Advaita" is used in treatises by numerous medieval era Indian scholars, as well as modern schools and teachers.

The Hindu concept of Advaita refers to the idea that all of the universe is one essential reality, and that all facets and aspects of the universe is ultimately an expression or appearance of that one reality.

[ 36 ] According to Dasgupta and Mohanta, non-dualism developed in various strands of Indian thought, both Vedic and Buddhist, from the Upanishadic period onward.

[ 37 ] The oldest traces of nondualism in Indian thought may be found in the Chandogya Upanishad , which pre-dates the earliest Buddhism.

Pre-sectarian Buddhism may also have been responding to the teachings of the Chandogya Upanishad , rejecting some of its Atman-Brahman related metaphysics.

[ 38 ] [ note 2 ] Advaita appears in different shades in various schools of Hinduism such as in Advaita Vedanta , Vishishtadvaita Vedanta ( Vaishnavism ), Suddhadvaita Vedanta (Vaishnavism), non-dual Shaivism and Shaktism .

[ 36 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In the Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara , advaita implies that all of reality is one with Brahman , [ 36 ] that the Atman (self) and Brahman (ultimate unchanging reality) are one.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] The advaita ideas of some Hindu traditions contrasts with the schools that defend dualism or Dvaita , such as that of Madhvacharya who stated that the experienced reality and God are two (dual) and distinct.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] Advaita Vedanta [ edit ] Main article: Advaita Vedanta Swans are important figures in Advaita.

The nonduality of the Advaita Vedanta is of the identity of Brahman and the Atman .

[ 47 ] As in Samkhya, Atman is awareness, the witness-consciousness. Advaita has become a broad current in Indian culture and religions, influencing subsequent traditions like Kashmir Shaivism .

The oldest surviving manuscript on Advaita Vedanta is by Gauḍapāda (6th century CE), [ 48 ] who has traditionally been regarded as the teacher of Govinda bhagavatpāda and the grandteacher of Adi Shankara . Advaita is best known from the Advaita Vedanta tradition of Adi Shankara (788-820 CE), who states that Brahman , the single unified eternal truth, is pure Being, Consciousness and Bliss ( Sat-cit-ananda ).

[ 49 ] Advaita, states Murti, is the knowledge of Brahman and self-consciousness (Vijnana) without differences.

[ 50 ] The goal of Vedanta is to know the "truly real" and thus become one with it.

[ 51 ] According to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is the highest Reality , [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] The universe, according to Advaita philosophy, does not simply come from Brahman, it is Brahman. Brahman is the single binding unity behind the diversity in all that exists in the universe.

[ 53 ] Brahman is also that which is the cause of all changes.

[ 53 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Brahman is the "creative principle which lies realized in the whole world".

[ 57 ] The nondualism of Advaita, relies on the Hindu concept of Ātman which is a Sanskrit word that means "essence" [ 58 ] or "real self" of the individual; [ 59 ] [ 60 ] it is also appropriated as " soul ".

[ 59 ] [ 61 ] Ātman is the first principle , [ 62 ] the true self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. Atman is the Universal Principle, one eternal undifferentiated self-luminous consciousness, asserts Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism.

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] Advaita Vedanta philosophy considers Atman as self-existent awareness, limitless, non-dual and same as Brahman.

[ 65 ] Advaita school asserts that there is "soul, self" within each living entity which is fully identical with Brahman .

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] The nondualism concept of Advaita Vedanta asserts that each soul is non-different from the infinite Brahman.

[ 68 ] Three levels of reality [ edit ] Advaita Vedanta adopts sublation as the criterion to postulate three levels of ontological reality: [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Pāramārthika ( paramartha , absolute), the Reality that is metaphysically true and ontologically accurate. It is the state of experiencing that "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved". This experience can't be sublated (exceeded) by any other experience.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] Vyāvahārika ( vyavahara ), or samvriti-saya , [ 71 ] consisting of the empirical or pragmatic reality. It is ever-changing over time, thus empirically true at a given time and context but not metaphysically true. It is "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake". It is the level in which both jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Iswara are true; here, the material world is also true.

[ 70 ] Prāthibhāsika ( pratibhasika , apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone". It is the level of experience in which the mind constructs its own reality. A well-known example is the perception of a rope in the dark as being a snake.

[ 70 ] Similarities and differences with Buddhism [ edit ] Scholars state that Advaita Vedanta was influenced by Mahayana Buddhism , given the common terminology and methodology and some common doctrines.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] Eliot Deutsch and Rohit Dalvi state: In any event a close relationship between the Mahayana schools and Vedanta did exist, with the latter borrowing some of the dialectical techniques, if not the specific doctrines, of the former.

[ 74 ] Advaita Vedanta is related to Buddhist philosophy , which promotes ideas like the two truths doctrine and the doctrine that there is only consciousness ( vijñapti-mātra ) . It is possible that the Advaita philosopher Gaudapada was influenced by Buddhist ideas.

[ 48 ] Shankara harmonised Gaudapada 's ideas with the Upanishadic texts, and developed a very influential school of orthodox Hinduism.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] The Buddhist term vijñapti-mātra is often used interchangeably with the term citta-mātra , but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is "consciousness-only" or "mind-only". Advaita Vedanta has been called "idealistic monism" by scholars, but some disagree with this label.

[ 77 ] [ 78 ] Another concept found in both Madhyamaka Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta is Ajativada ("ajāta"), which Gaudapada adopted from Nagarjuna 's philosophy.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ note 3 ] Gaudapada "wove [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the Mandukaya Upanisad , which was further developed by Shankara.

[ 82 ] [ note 4 ] Michael Comans states there is a fundamental difference between Buddhist thought and that of Gaudapada, in that Buddhism has as its philosophical basis the doctrine of Dependent Origination according to which "everything is without an essential nature ( nihsvabhāva ), and everything is empty of essential nature ( svabhava-shunya )", while Gaudapada does not rely on this principle at all. Gaudapada's Ajativada is an outcome of reasoning applied to an unchanging nondual reality according to which "there exists a Reality ( sat ) that is unborn ( aja )" that has essential nature ( svabhava ), and this is the "eternal, fearless, undecaying Self (Atman) and Brahman".

[ 84 ] Thus, Gaudapada differs from Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna, states Comans, by accepting the premises and relying on the fundamental teaching of the Upanishads.

[ 84 ] Among other things, Vedanta school of Hinduism holds the premise, "Atman exists, as self evident truth", a concept it uses in its theory of nondualism. Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, "Atman does not exist (or, An-atman) as self evident".

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] Mahadevan suggests that Gaudapada adopted Buddhist terminology and adapted its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and adapted its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings.

[ 88 ] Dasgupta and Mohanta note that Buddhism and Shankara's Advaita Vedanta are not opposing systems, but "different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara".

[ 37 ] Vishishtadvaita Vedanta [ edit ] See also: Bhedabheda Vishishtadvaita Vedanta is another main school of Vedanta and teaches the nonduality of the qualified whole, in which Brahman alone exists, but is characterized by multiplicity. It can be described as "qualified monism", or "qualified non-dualism", or "attributive monism ".

According to this school, the world is real, yet underlying all the differences is an all-embracing unity, of which all "things" are an "attribute".

Ramanuja , the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy contends that the Prasthanatrayi ("The three courses") – namely the Upanishads , the Bhagavad Gita , and the Brahma Sutras – are to be interpreted in a way that shows this unity in diversity , for any other way would violate their consistency.

Vedanta Desika defines Vishishtadvaita using the statement: Asesha Chit-Achit Prakaaram Brahmaikameva Tatvam – " Brahman , as qualified by the sentient and insentient modes (or attributes), is the only reality." Neo-Vedanta [ edit ] Main articles: Neo-Vedanta , Swami Vivekananda , and Ramakrishna Mission Neo-Vedanta, also called "neo-Hinduism" [ 89 ] is a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and orientalism , and aims to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism" [ 90 ] with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.

[ 91 ] Unitarian Universalism had a strong impact on Ram Mohan Roy and the Brahmo Samaj, and subsequently on Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda was one of the main representatives of Neo-Vedanta , a modern interpretation of Hinduism in line with western esoteric traditions , especially Transcendentalism , New Thought and Theosophy .

[ 92 ] His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India, [ 92 ] and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West.

[ 93 ] Narendranath Datta (Swami Vivekananda) became a member of a Freemasonry lodge "at some point before 1884" [ 94 ] and of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore .

[ 95 ] Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833), the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians, [ 96 ] who were closely connected to the Transcendentalists , who in turn were interested in and influenced by Indian religions early on.

[ 97 ] It was in this cultic [ 98 ] milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western esotericism .

[ 99 ] Debendranath Tagore brought this "neo-Hinduism" closer in line with western esotericism , a development which was furthered by Keshab Chandra Sen , [ 100 ] who was also influenced by transcendentalism , which emphasised personal religious experience over mere reasoning and theology.

[ 101 ] Sen's influence brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.

[ 102 ] Vivekananda's acquaintance with western esotericism made him very successful in western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like Transcendentalism and New thought .

[ 103 ] In 1897 he founded the Ramakrishna Mission , which was instrumental in the spread of Neo-Vedanta in the west, and attracted people like Alan Watts .

Aldous Huxley , author of The Perennial Philosophy , was associated with another neo-Vedanta organisation, the Vedanta Society of Southern California, founded and headed by Swami Prabhavananda . Together with Gerald Heard , Christopher Isherwood , and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.

[ 104 ] Neo-Vedanta, as represented by Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan , is indebted to Advaita vedanta, but also reflects Advaya-philosophy. A main influence on neo-Advaita was Ramakrishna , himself a bhakta and tantrika, and the guru of Vivekananda. According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of formlessness and form.

[ 105 ] Ramakrishna regarded the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive: When I think of the Supreme Being as inactive – neither creating nor preserving nor destroying – I call Him Brahman or Purusha, the Impersonal God. When I think of Him as active – creating, preserving and destroying – I call Him Sakti or Maya or Prakriti, the Personal God. But the distinction between them does not mean a difference. The Personal and Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its whiteness, the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling motion. It is impossible to conceive of the one without the other. The Divine Mother and Brahman are one.

[ 106 ] Radhakrishnan acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman.

[ 107 ] [ note 5 ] According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita "reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism": [ 109 ] The Neo-Vedanta is also Advaitic inasmuch as it holds that Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, is one without a second, ekamevadvitiyam . But as distinguished from the traditional Advaita of Sankara, it is a synthetic Vedanta which reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism and also other theories of reality. In this sense it may also be called concrete monism in so far as it holds that Brahman is both qualified, saguna , and qualityless, nirguna .

[ 109 ] Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara's notion of maya . According to Radhakrishnan, maya is not a strict absolute idealism, but "a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real".

[ 107 ] According to Sarma, standing in the tradition of Nisargadatta Maharaj , Advaitavāda means "spiritual non-dualism or absolutism", [ 110 ] in which opposites are manifestations of the Absolute, which itself is immanent and transcendent: [ 111 ] All opposites like being and non-being, life and death, good and evil, light and darkness, gods and men, soul and nature are viewed as manifestations of the Absolute which is immanent in the universe and yet transcends it.

[ 111 ] Neo-Vedanta was well-received among Theosophists, Christian Science , and the New Thought movement; [ 112 ] [ 113 ] Christian Science in turn influenced the self-study teaching A Course in Miracles .

Kashmir Shaivism is a school of Śaivism , described by Abhinavagupta [ note 6 ] as "paradvaita", meaning "the supreme and absolute non-dualism".

[ 115 ] It is categorized by various scholars as monistic [ 116 ] idealism ( absolute idealism , theistic monism, [ 117 ] realistic idealism, [ 118 ] transcendental physicalism or concrete monism [ 118 ] ).

[ inconsistent ] Kashmir Saivism is based on a strong monistic interpretation of the Bhairava Tantras and its subcategory the Kaula Tantras , which were tantras written by the Kapalikas .

[ 119 ] There was additionally a revelation of the Siva Sutras to Vasugupta .

[ 119 ] Kashmir Saivism claimed to supersede the dualistic Shaiva Siddhanta .

[ 120 ] Somananda , the first theologian of monistic Saivism, was the teacher of Utpaladeva , who was the grand-teacher of Abhinavagupta , who in turn was the teacher of Ksemaraja .

[ 119 ] [ 121 ] The philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism can be seen in contrast to Shankara's Advaita.

[ 122 ] Advaita Vedanta holds that Brahman is inactive ( niṣkriya ) and the phenomenal world is a false appearance ( māyā ) of Brahman, like snake seen in semi-darkness is a false appearance of Rope lying there. In Kashmir Shavisim, all things are a manifestation of the Universal Consciousness, Chit or Brahman .

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] Kashmir Shavisim sees the phenomenal world ( Śakti ) as real: it exists, and has its being in Consciousness ( Chit ).

[ 125 ] Kashmir Shaivism was influenced by, and took over doctrines from, several orthodox and heterodox Indian religious and philosophical traditions.

[ 126 ] These include Vedanta, Samkhya, Patanjali Yoga and Nyayas, and various Buddhist schools, including Yogacara and Madhyamika, [ 126 ] but also Tantra and the Nath-tradition.

[ 127 ] Contemporary Indian traditions [ edit ] Primal awareness is also part of other Indian traditions, which are less strongly, or not all, organised in monastic and institutional organisations. Although often called "Advaita Vedanta", these traditions have their origins in vernacular movements and " householder " traditions, and have close ties to the Nath , Nayanars and Sant Mat traditions.

[ citation needed ] Natha Sampradaya [ edit ] Main article: Nath The Natha Sampradaya, with Nath yogis such as Gorakhnath , introduced Sahaja , the concept of a spontaneous spirituality. According to Ken Wilber, this state reflects nonduality.

[ 128 ] Neo-Advaita [ edit ] Main article: Neo-Advaita Neo-Advaita is a new religious movement based on a modern Western interpretation of Advaita Vedanta , especially the teachings of Ramana Maharshi .

[ 129 ] According to Arthur Versluis , neo-Advaita is part of a larger religious current which he calls immediatism .

[ 130 ] Neo-Advaita has been criticized for this immediatism and its lack of preparatory practices.

[ 131 ] [ note 7 ] [ 132 ] [ note 8 ] Notable neo-advaita teachers are H. W. L. Poonja [ 133 ] [ 129 ] and his students Gangaji , [ 134 ] Andrew Cohen , [ note 9 ] and Eckhart Tolle .

[ 129 ] Buddhism [ edit ] “As people approach Me, so do I receive them. All paths, O Arjuna, are Mine.” Bhagavad Gītā 4.11 “All Buddhist paths, whether presented as Hīnayāna or Mahāyāna, are in truth skillful means leading to the one Buddha-vehicle, the single path culminating in perfect enlightenment.” Lotus Sutra Over time, Buddhism began shifting toward a more unified view of reality, moving away from the earlier pluralistic outlook of schools of Hīnayāna Buddhism, particularly the Sarvāstivāda. Concepts such as tathāgatagarbha (Buddha-nature) and ālaya-vijñāna (storehouse consciousness) were introduced into Buddhism, signaling not only a philosophical transformation but also a weakening of Buddhism’s social influence. This period saw a growing absorption of Brahmanical ideas, often described as the “Brahmanization” of Buddhism. An example of this is found in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, where tathāgatagarbha is at times equated with ālaya-vijñāna, and its description bears a striking resemblance to the Vedāntic concept of Brahman. Terms like Brahman, Viṣṇu, and Īśvara are even used as synonyms for tathāgata, with the highest Brahman being presented as the ultimate reality.

[ 136 ] There are different Buddhist views which resonate with the concepts and experiences of primordial awareness and non-duality or "not two" ( advaya ). The Buddha does not use the term advaya in the earliest Buddhist texts , but it does appear in some of the Mahayana sutras , such as the Vimalakīrti .

[ 137 ] The Buddha taught meditative inquiry ( dhyana ) and nondiscursive attention ( samadhi ).

Indian Buddhism [ edit ] Nirvana [ edit ] See also: Transcendental Nirvana In archaic Buddhism , Nirvana may have been a kind of transformed and transcendent consciousness or discernment ( viññana ) that has "stopped" ( nirodhena ).

[ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] According to Harvey this nirvanic consciousness is said to be "objectless", "infinite" ( anantam ), "unsupported" ( appatiṭṭhita ) and "non-manifestive" ( anidassana ) as well as "beyond time and spatial location".

[ 138 ] [ 139 ] Stanislaw Schayer , a Polish scholar, argued in the 1930s that the Nikayas preserve elements of an archaic form of Buddhism which is close to Brahmanical beliefs, [ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] and survived in the Mahayana tradition.

[ 145 ] [ 146 ] Schayer's view, possibly referring to texts where "'consciousness' ( vinnana ) seems to be the ultimate reality or substratum" as well as to luminous mind , [ 147 ] saw nirvana as an immortal, deathless sphere, a transmundane reality or state.

[ 148 ] [ note 10 ] A similar view is also defended by C. Lindtner, who argues that in precanonical Buddhism nirvana is an actual existent.

[ 141 ] [ note 11 ] The original and early Buddhist concepts of nirvana may have been similar to those found in competing Śramaṇa (strivers/ascetics) traditions such as Jainism and Upanishadic Vedism.

[ 149 ] Similar ideas were proposed by Edward Conze [ 146 ] and M. Falk, [ 150 ] citing sources which speak of an eternal and "invisible infinite consciousness, which shines everywhere" as point to the view that nirvana is a kind of Absolute , [ 146 ] and arguing that the nirvanic element, as an "essence" or pure consciousness, is immanent within samsara , [ 150 ] an "abode" or "place" of prajña , which is gained by the enlightened.

[ 151 ] [ 150 ] [ note 12 ] In the Theravada tradition, nibbāna is regarded as an uncompounded or unconditioned ( asankhata ) dhamma (phenomenon, event) which is "transmundane", [ 153 ] [ note 13 ] and which is beyond our normal dualistic conceptions.

[ note 14 ] Luminous mind [ edit ] Another influential concept in Indian Buddhism is the idea of luminous mind which became associated with Buddha-nature. In the Early Buddhist Texts there are various mentions of luminosity or radiance which refer to the development of the mind in meditation . In the Saṅgīti-sutta for example, it relates to the attainment of samadhi , where the perception of light ( āloka sañña ) leads to a mind endowed with luminescence ( sappabhāsa ).

[ 155 ] According to Analayo, the Upakkilesa-sutta and its parallels mention that the presence of defilements "results in a loss of whatever inner light or luminescence (obhāsa) had been experienced during meditation".

[ 155 ] The Pali Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta uses the metaphor of refining gold to describe equanimity reached through meditation, which is said to be "pure, bright, soft, workable, and luminous".

[ 14 ] The Pali Anguttara Nikaya (A.I.8-10) states: [ 156 ] Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming defilements. The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns that as it actually is present, which is why I tell you that — for the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones — there is development of the mind.

[ 157 ] The term is given no direct doctrinal explanation in the Pali discourses, but later Buddhist schools explained it using various concepts developed by them.

[ 158 ] The Theravada school identifies the "luminous mind" with the bhavanga , a concept first proposed in the Theravāda Abhidhamma .

[ 159 ] The later schools of the Mahayana identify it with both the Mahayana concepts of bodhicitta and tathagatagarbha .

[ 158 ] The notion is of central importance in the philosophy and practice of Dzogchen .

[ 160 ] Buddha-nature [ edit ] Buddha nature or tathagata-garbha (literally "Buddha womb") is that which allows sentient beings to become Buddhas.

[ 161 ] Various Mahayana texts such as the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras focus on this idea and over time it became a very influential doctrine in Indian Buddhism, as well in East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism. The Buddha nature teachings may be regarded as a form of nondualism. According to Sally B King, all beings are said to be or possess tathagata-garbha , which is nondual Thusness or Dharmakaya . This reality, states King, transcends the "duality of self and not-self", the "duality of form and emptiness" and the "two poles of being and non being".

[ 162 ] There various interpretations and views on Buddha-nature and the concept became very influential in India, China and Tibet, where it also became a source of much debate. In later Indian Yogācāra, a new sub-school developed which adopted the doctrine of tathagata-garbha into the Yogācāra system.

[ 163 ] The influence of this hybrid school can be seen in texts like the Lankavatara Sutra and the Ratnagotravibhaga . This synthesis of Yogācāra tathagata-garbha became very influential in later Buddhist traditions, such as Indian Vajrayana , Chinese Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism .

[ 164 ] [ 163 ] Advaya [ edit ] According to Kameshwar Nath Mishra, one connotation of advaya in Indic Sanskrit Buddhist texts is that it refers to the middle way between two opposite extremes (such as eternalism and annihilationism ), and thus it is "not two".

[ 165 ] The layman Vimalakīrti debates Manjusri , Dunhuang Mogao Caves .

One of these Sanskrit Mahayana sutras , the Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra contains a chapter on the "Dharma gate of non-duality" ( advaya dharma dvara pravesa ) which is said to be entered once one understands how numerous pairs of opposite extremes are to be rejected as forms of grasping. These extremes which must be avoided in order to understand ultimate reality are described by various characters in the text, and include: Birth and extinction, 'I' and 'Mine', Perception and non-perception, defilement and purity, good and not-good, created and uncreated, worldly and unworldly, samsara and nirvana, enlightenment and ignorance, form and emptiness and so on.

[ 166 ] The final character to attempt to describe ultimate reality is the bodhisattva Manjushri , who states: It is in all beings wordless, speechless, shows no signs, is not possible of cognizance, and is above all questioning and answering.

[ 167 ] Vimalakīrti responds to this statement by maintaining completely silent, therefore expressing that the nature of ultimate reality is ineffable ( anabhilāpyatva ) and inconceivable ( acintyatā ), beyond verbal designation ( prapañca ) or thought constructs ( vikalpa ).

[ 167 ] The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra , a text associated with Yogācāra Buddhism, also uses the term " advaya " extensively.

[ 168 ] In the Mahayana Buddhist philosophy of Madhyamaka , the two truths or ways of understanding reality, are said to be advaya (not two). As explained by the Indian philosopher Nagarjuna , there is a non-dual relationship, that is, there is no absolute separation, between conventional and ultimate truth, as well as between samsara and nirvana .

[ 169 ] [ 10 ] The concept of nonduality is also important in the other major Indian Mahayana tradition, the Yogacara school, where it is seen as the absence of duality between the perceiving subject (or "grasper") and the object (or "grasped"). It is also seen as an explanation of emptiness and as an explanation of the content of the awakened mind which sees through the illusion of subject-object duality. However, in this conception of non-dualism, there are still a multiplicity of individual mind streams ( citta santana ) and thus Yogacara does not teach an idealistic monism.

[ 170 ] These basic ideas have continued to influence Mahayana Buddhist doctrinal interpretations of Buddhist traditions such as Dzogchen , Mahamudra , Zen , Huayan and Tiantai as well as concepts such as Buddha-nature , luminous mind , Indra's net , rigpa and shentong .

Madhyamaka [ edit ] Main article: Madhyamika Nagarjuna (right), Aryadeva (middle) and the Tenth Karmapa (left) Madhyamaka, also known as Śūnyavāda (the emptiness teaching), refers primarily to a Mahāyāna Buddhist school of philosophy [ 171 ] founded by Nāgārjuna . In Madhyamaka, Advaya refers to the fact that the two truths are not separate or different., [ 172 ] as well as the non-dual relationship of s aṃsāra (the round of rebirth and suffering ) and nirvāṇa (cessation of suffering, liberation ).

[ 36 ] According to Murti, in Madhyamaka, Advaya is an epistemological theory, unlike the metaphysical view of Hindu Advaita.

[ 50 ] Madhyamaka advaya is closely related to the classical Buddhist understanding that all things are impermanent ( anicca ) and devoid of self ( anatta ) or essenceless ( niḥsvabhāva ), [ 173 ] [ 174 ] [ 175 ] and that this emptiness does not constitute an absolute reality in itself.

[ note 15 ] In Madhyamaka, the two truths doctrine refer to conventional ( saṃvṛti ) and ultimate ( paramārtha ) truth.

[ 176 ] The ultimate truth is emptiness , or non-existence of inherently existing things, [ 177 ] and the "emptiness of emptiness": emptiness does not in itself constitute an absolute reality. Conventionally, things exist, but ultimately, they are empty of any existence on their own, as described in Nagarjuna's magnum opus, the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (MMK).

[ 178 ] As Jay Garfield notes, for Nagarjuna, to understand the two truths as totally different from each other is to reify and confuse the purpose of this doctrine, since it would either destroy conventional realities such as the Buddha's teachings and the empirical reality of the world (making Madhyamaka a form of nihilism ) or deny the dependent origination of phenomena (by positing eternal essences ). Thus the non-dual doctrine of the middle way lies beyond these two extremes.

[ 179 ] Emptiness is a consequence of pratītyasamutpāda (dependent arising), [ 180 ] the teaching that no dharma ("thing", "phenomena") has an existence of its own, but always comes into existence in dependence on other dharmas . According to Madhyamaka all phenomena are empty of substance or essence ( Sanskrit : svabhāva ) because they are dependently co-arisen . Likewise it is because they are dependently co-arisen that they have no intrinsic, independent reality of their own. Madhyamaka also rejects the existence of absolute realities or beings such as Brahman or Self.

[ 181 ] In the highest sense, "ultimate reality" is not an ontological Absolute reality that lies beneath an unreal world, nor is it the non-duality of a personal self ( atman ) and an absolute Self (cf.

Purusha ). Instead, it is the knowledge which is based on a deconstruction of such reifications and Conceptual proliferations .

[ 182 ] However, according to Nagarjuna, even the very schema of ultimate and conventional, samsara and nirvana, is not a final reality, and he thus famously deconstructs even these teachings as being empty and not different from each other in the MMK where he writes: [ 183 ] The limit ( koti ) of nirvāṇa is that of saṃsāra The subtlest difference is not found between the two.

According to Nancy McCagney, what this refers to is that the two truths depend on each other; without emptiness, conventional reality cannot work, and vice versa. It does not mean that samsara and nirvana are the same, or that they are one single thing, as in Advaita Vedanta, but rather that they are both empty, open, without limits, and merely exist for the conventional purpose of teaching the Buddha Dharma .

[ 183 ] The later Madhyamikas, states Yuichi Kajiyama, developed the Advaya definition as a means to Nirvikalpa-Samadhi by suggesting that "things arise neither from their own selves nor from other things, and that when subject and object are unreal, the mind, being not different, cannot be true either; thereby one must abandon attachment to cognition of nonduality as well, and understand the lack of intrinsic nature of everything".

[ 184 ] Thus, the Buddhist nondualism or Advaya concept became a means to realizing absolute emptiness .

[ 184 ] Yogācāra tradition [ edit ] Main article: Yogacara See also: Svasaṃvedana Asaṅga (fl. 4th century C.E.), a Mahayana scholar who wrote numerous works which discuss the Yogacara view and practice In the Mahayana tradition of Yogācāra ( Skt ; "yoga practice"), adyava (Tibetan: gnyis med ) refers to overcoming the conceptual and perceptual dichotomies of cognizer and cognized, or subject and object.

[ 36 ] [ 185 ] [ 186 ] [ 187 ] The concept of adyava in Yogācāra is an epistemological stance on the nature of experience and knowledge, as well as a phenomenological exposition of yogic cognitive transformation. Early Buddhism schools such as Sarvastivada and Sautrāntika , that thrived through the early centuries of the common era, postulated a dualism ( dvaya) between the mental activity of grasping ( grāhaka , "cognition", "subjectivity") and that which is grasped ( grāhya , "cognitum", intentional object).

[ 188 ] [ 184 ] [ 188 ] [ 189 ] Yogacara postulates that this dualistic relationship is a false illusion or superimposition ( samaropa ).

[ 184 ] Yogācāra also taught the doctrine which held that only mental cognitions really exist ( vijñapti-mātra ), [ 190 ] [ note 16 ] instead of the mind-body dualism of other Indian Buddhist schools.

[ 184 ] [ 188 ] [ 190 ] This is another sense in which reality can be said to be non-dual, because it is "consciousness-only".

[ 192 ] There are several interpretations of this main theory, which has been widely translated as representation-only, ideation-only, impressions-only and perception-only.

[ 193 ] [ 190 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Some scholars see it as a kind of subjective or epistemic Idealism (similar to Kant's theory) while others argue that it is closer to a kind of phenomenology or representationalism . According to Mark Siderits the main idea of this doctrine is that we are only ever aware of mental images or impressions which manifest themselves as external objects, but "there is actually no such thing outside the mind." [ 196 ] For Alex Wayman, this doctrine means that "the mind has only a report or representation of what the sense organ had sensed." [ 194 ] Jay Garfield and Paul Williams both see the doctrine as a kind of Idealism in which only mentality exists.

[ 197 ] [ 198 ] However, even the idealistic interpretation of Yogācāra is not an absolute monistic idealism like Advaita Vedanta or Hegelianism , since in Yogācāra, even consciousness "enjoys no transcendent status" and is just a conventional reality.

[ 163 ] Indeed, according to Jonathan Gold, for Yogācāra, the ultimate truth is not consciousness, but an ineffable and inconceivable "thusness" or "thatness" ( tathatā ).

[ 185 ] Also, Yogācāra affirms the existence of individual mindstreams , and thus Kochumuttom also calls it a realistic pluralism .

[ 78 ] The Yogācārins defined three basic modes by which we perceive our world. These are referred to in Yogācāra as the three natures ( trisvabhāva ) of experience. They are: [ 199 ] [ 185 ] Parikalpita (literally, "fully conceptualized"): "imaginary nature", wherein things are incorrectly comprehended based on conceptual and linguistic construction, attachment and the subject object duality. It is thus equivalent to samsara .

Paratantra (literally, "other dependent"): "dependent nature", by which the dependently originated nature of things, their causal relatedness or flow of conditionality. It is the basis which gets erroneously conceptualized, Pariniṣpanna (literally, "fully accomplished"): "absolute nature", through which one comprehends things as they are in themselves, that is, empty of subject-object and thus is a type of non-dual cognition. This experience of "thatness" ( tathatā ) is uninfluenced by any conceptualization at all.

To move from the duality of the Parikalpita to the non-dual consciousness of the Pariniṣpanna, Yogācāra teaches that there must be a transformation of consciousness, which is called the "revolution of the basis" ( parāvṛtty-āśraya).

According to Dan Lusthaus , this transformation which characterizes awakening is a "radical psycho-cognitive change" and a removal of false "interpretive projections" on reality (such as ideas of a self, external objects, etc.).

[ 200 ] The Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra , a Yogācāra text, also associates this transformation with the concept of non-abiding nirvana and the non-duality of samsara and nirvana. Regarding this state of Buddhahood , it states: Its operation is nondual ( advaya vrtti ) because of its abiding neither in samsara nor in nirvana ( samsaranirvana-apratisthitatvat ), through its being both conditioned and unconditioned ( samskrta-asamskrtatvena ).

[ 201 ] This refers to the Yogācāra teaching that even though a Buddha has entered nirvana, they do no "abide" in some quiescent state separate from the world but continue to give rise to extensive activity on behalf of others.

[ 201 ] This is also called the non-duality between the compounded ( samskrta , referring to samsaric existence) and the uncompounded ( asamskrta , referring to nirvana). It is also described as a "not turning back" from both samsara and nirvana.

[ 202 ] For the later thinker Dignaga , non-dual knowledge or advayajñāna is also a synonym for prajñaparamita (transcendent wisdom) which liberates one from samsara.

[ 203 ] Tantric Buddhism [ edit ] Buddhist Tantra , also known as Vajrayana, Mantrayana or Esoteric Buddhism, drew upon all these previous Indian Buddhist ideas and nondual philosophies to develop innovative new traditions of Buddhist practice and new religious texts called the Buddhist tantras (from the 6th century onwards).

[ 204 ] Tantric Buddhism was influential in China and is the main form of Buddhism in the Himalayan regions , especially Tibetan Buddhism .

Saṃvara with Vajravārāhī in Yab-Yum . These tantric Buddhist depictions of sexual union symbolize the non-dual union of compassion and emptiness.

The concept of advaya has various meanings in Buddhist Tantra. According to Tantric commentator Lilavajra, Buddhist Tantra's "utmost secret and aim" is Buddha nature. This is seen as a "non-dual, self-originated Wisdom ( jnana ), an effortless fount of good qualities".

[ 205 ] In Buddhist Tantra, there is no strict separation between the sacred (nirvana) and the profane (samsara), and all beings are seen as containing an immanent seed of awakening or Buddhahood.

[ 206 ] The Buddhist Tantras also teach that there is a non-dual relationship between emptiness and compassion ( karuna ), this unity is called bodhicitta .

[ 207 ] They also teach a "nondual pristine wisdom of bliss and emptiness".

[ 208 ] Advaya is also said to be the co-existence of Prajña (wisdom) and Upaya (skill in means).

[ 209 ] These nondualities are also related to the idea of yuganaddha , or "union" in the Tantras. This is said to be the "indivisible merging of innate great bliss (the means) and clear light (emptiness)" as well as the merging of relative and ultimate truths and the knower and the known, during Tantric practice.

[ 210 ] Buddhist Tantras also promote certain practices which are antinomian , such as sexual rites or the consumption of disgusting or repulsive substances (the "five ambrosias", feces, urine, blood, semen, and marrow.). These are said to allow one to cultivate nondual perception of the pure and impure (and similar conceptual dualities) and thus it allows one to prove one's attainment of nondual gnosis ( advaya jñana ).

[ 211 ] Indian Buddhist Tantra also views humans as a microcosmos which mirrors the macrocosmos.

[ 212 ] Its aim is to gain access to the awakened energy or consciousness of Buddhahood, which is nondual, through various practices.

[ 212 ] East-Asian Buddhism [ edit ] Chinese [ edit ] Main article: Buddhism in China A 3D rendering of Indra's net , an illustration of the Huayan concept of interpenetration Chinese Buddhism was influenced by the philosophical strains of Indian Buddhist nondualism such as the Madhymaka doctrines of emptiness and the two truths as well as Yogacara and tathagata-garbha . For example, Chinese Madhyamaka philosophers like Jizang , discussed the nonduality of the two truths.

[ 213 ] Chinese Yogacara also upheld the Indian Yogacara views on nondualism. One influential text in Chinese Buddhism which synthesizes Tathagata-garbha and Yogacara views is the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana , which may be a Chinese composition.

In Chinese Buddhism, the polarity of absolute and relative realities is also expressed as " essence-function ". This was a result of an ontological interpretation of the two truths as well as influences from native Taoist and Confucian metaphysics.

[ 214 ] In this theory, the absolute is essence, the relative is function. They can't be seen as separate realities, but interpenetrate each other.

[ 215 ] This interpretation of the two truths as two ontological realities would go on to influence later forms of East Asian metaphysics.

As Chinese Buddhism continued to develop in new innovative directions, it gave rise to new traditions like Tiantai and Chan (Zen) , which also upheld their own unique teachings on non-duality.

[ 216 ] The Tiantai school for example, taught a threefold truth, instead of the classic "two truths" of Indian Madhyamaka. Its "third truth" was seen as the nondual union of the two truths which transcends both.

[ 217 ] Tiantai metaphysics is an immanent holism , which sees every phenomenon, moment or event as conditioned and manifested by the whole of reality. Every instant of experience is a reflection of every other, and hence, suffering and nirvana, good and bad, Buddhahood and evildoing, are all "inherently entailed" within each other.

[ 217 ] Each moment of consciousness is simply the Absolute itself, infinitely immanent and self reflecting.

Two doctrines of the Huayan school (Flower Garland), which flourished in China during the Tang period , are considered nondual by some scholars. King writes that the Fourfold Dharmadhatu and the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena ( dharmas ) or "perfect interfusion" ( yuanrong , 圓融) are classic nondual doctrines.

[ 216 ] This can be described as the idea that all phenomena "are representations of the wisdom of Buddha without exception" and that "they exist in a state of mutual dependence, interfusion and balance without any contradiction or conflict." [ 218 ] According to this theory, any phenomenon exists only as part of the total nexus of reality, its existence depends on the total network of all other things, which are all equally connected to each other and contained in each other.

[ 218 ] Another Huayan metaphor used to express this view, called Indra's net , is also considered nondual by some.

[ citation needed ] Zen [ edit ] Main articles: Zen , Buddha-nature , Kenshō , and Shikan-taza See also: Bodhicitta , Karuṇā , and Ten Bulls Dogen The Buddha-nature and Yogacara philosophies have had a strong influence on Chán and Zen. The teachings of Zen are expressed by a set of polarities: Buddha-nature – sunyata; [ 219 ] [ 220 ] absolute-relative; [ 221 ] sudden and gradual enlightenment.

[ 222 ] The Lankavatara-sutra, a popular sutra in Zen, endorses the Buddha-nature and emphasizes purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The Diamond-sutra, another popular sutra, emphasizes sunyata, which "must be realized totally or not at all".

[ 223 ] The Prajnaparamita Sutras emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the Heart Sutra says.

[ 221 ] According to Chinul , Zen points not to mere emptiness, but to suchness or the dharmadhatu .

[ 224 ] The idea that the ultimate reality is present in the daily world of relative reality fitted into the Chinese culture which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not explain how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as the Five Ranks of Tozan [ 225 ] and the Oxherding Pictures .

The continuous pondering of the break-through kōan ( shokan [ 226 ] ) or Hua Tou , "word head", [ 227 ] leads to kensho , an initial insight into "seeing the (Buddha-)nature ".

[ 228 ] According to Victor Sogen Hori, a central theme of many koans is the "identity of opposites", and point to the original nonduality.

[ 229 ] [ 230 ] Hori describes kensho , when attained through koan-study , as the absence of subject–object duality.

[ 231 ] The aim of the so-called break-through koan is to see the "nonduality of subject and object", [ 229 ] [ 230 ] in which "subject and object are no longer separate and distinct".

[ 232 ] Zen Buddhist training does not end with kenshō. Practice is to be continued to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life, [ 233 ] [ 234 ] [ 235 ] [ 236 ] to fully manifest the nonduality of absolute and relative.

[ 237 ] [ 238 ] To deepen the initial insight of kensho, shikantaza and kōan-study are necessary. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by Linji Yixuan in his Three Mysterious Gates , the Four Ways of Knowing of Hakuin , [ 239 ] the Five Ranks , and the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures [ 240 ] which detail the steps on the Path .

Korean [ edit ] See also: Korean Buddhism and Essence-Function The polarity of absolute and relative is also expressed as "essence-function". The absolute is essence, the relative is function. They can't be seen as separate realities, but interpenetrate each other. The distinction does not "exclude any other frameworks such as neng-so or 'subject-object' constructions", though the two "are completely different from each other in terms of their way of thinking".

[ 215 ] In Korean Buddhism, essence-function is also expressed as "body" and "the body's functions".

[ 241 ] A metaphor for essence-function is "a lamp and its light", a phrase from the Platform Sutra , where Essence is lamp and Function is light.

[ 242 ] Tibetan Buddhism [ edit ] Main article: Tibetan Buddhism Prasangika Madhyamaka [ edit ] The Gelugpa school, following Tsongkhapa, adheres to the adyava Prasaṅgika Mādhyamaka view, which states that all phenomena are sunyata , empty of self-nature, and that this "emptiness" is itself only a qualification, not a concretely existing "absolute" reality.

[ 243 ] Shentong [ edit ] Main article: Rangtong-Shentong In Tibetan Buddhism, the essentialist position is represented by shentong , while the nominalist, or non-essentialist position, is represented by rangtong .

Shentong is a philosophical sub-school found in Tibetan Buddhism . Its adherents generally hold that the nature of mind ( svasaṃvedana ), the substratum of the mindstream , is "empty" ( Wylie : stong ) of "other" ( Wylie : gzhan ), i.e., empty of all qualities other than an inherently existing, ineffable nature. Shentong has often been incorrectly associated with the Cittamātra ( Yogacara ) position, but is in fact also Madhyamaka, [ 244 ] and is present primarily as the main philosophical theory of the Jonang school, although it is also taught by the Sakya [ 245 ] and Kagyu schools.

[ 246 ] [ 247 ] According to Shentongpa (proponents of shentong), the emptiness of ultimate reality should not be characterized in the same way as the emptiness of apparent phenomena because it is prabhāśvara - saṃtāna , or "luminous mindstream" endowed with limitless Buddha qualities.

[ 248 ] It is empty of all that is false, not empty of the limitless Buddha qualities that are its innate nature.

The contrasting Prasaṅgika view that all phenomena are sunyata , empty of self-nature, and that this "emptiness" is not a concretely existing "absolute" reality, is labeled rangtong , "empty of self-nature".

[ 243 ] The shentong-view is related to the Ratnagotravibhāga sutra and the Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis of Śāntarakṣita . The truth of sunyata is acknowledged, but not considered to be the highest truth, which is the empty nature of mind. Insight into sunyata is preparatory for the recognition of the nature of mind.

Dzogchen [ edit ] Main articles: Dzogchen and Rigpa Dzogchen is concerned with the "natural state" and emphasizes direct experience. The state of nondual awareness is called rigpa .

[ 249 ] This primordial nature is clear light, unproduced and unchanging, free from all defilements. Through meditation, the Dzogchen practitioner experiences that thoughts have no substance. Mental phenomena arise and fall in the mind, but fundamentally they are empty. The practitioner then considers where the mind itself resides. Through careful examination one realizes that the mind is emptiness.

[ 250 ] Ekajati is one of the main protectors of the Dzogchen teachings.

Karma Lingpa (1326–1386) revealed "Self-Liberation through seeing with naked awareness" ( rigpa ngo-sprod , [ note 17 ] ) which is attributed to Padmasambhava .

[ 251 ] [ note 18 ] The text gives an introduction, or pointing-out instruction ( ngo-spro ), into rigpa , the state of presence and awareness.

[ 251 ] In this text, Karma Lingpa writes the following regarding the unity of various terms for nonduality: With respect to its having a name, the various names that are applied to it are inconceivable (in their numbers).

Some call it "the nature of the mind " or "mind itself".

Some Tirthikas call it by the name Atman or "the Self".

The Sravakas call it the doctrine of Anatman or "the absence of a self".

The Chittamatrins call it by the name Chitta or "the Mind".

Some call it the Prajnaparamita or "the Perfection of Wisdom".

Some call it the name Tathagata-garbha or "the embryo of Buddhahood".

Some call it by the name Mahamudra or "the Great Symbol".

Some call it by the name "the Unique Sphere".

Some call it by the name Dharmadhatu or "the dimension of Reality".

Some call it by the name Alaya or "the basis of everything".

And some simply call it by the name "ordinary awareness".

[ 256 ] Garab Dorje's three statements [ edit ] Garab Dorje or Prehebajra, a Dzogchen master Garab Dorje (c. 665) epitomized the Dzogchen teaching in three principles, known as "Striking the Vital Point in Three Statements" ( Tsik Sum Né Dek ), said to be his last words. These three statements are believed to convey the heart of his teachings and serve as a concise and profound encapsulation of Dzogchen's view , its practice of contemplation, and the role of conduct . They give in short the development a student has to undergo: [ 257 ] [ 258 ] Garab Dorje's three statements were integrated into the Nyingthig traditions, the most popular of which in the Longchen Nyingthig by Jigme Lingpa (1730–1798).

[ 259 ] The statements are: [ 257 ] Introducing directly the face of rigpa itself ( ngo rang tok tu tré ). Dudjom Rinpoche states this refers to: "Introducing directly the face of the naked mind as the rigpa itself, the innate primordial wisdom." Deciding upon one thing and one thing only ( tak chik tok tu ché ). Dudjom states: "Because all phenomena, whatever manifests, whether saṃsāra or nirvāṇa, are none other than the rigpa’s own play, there is complete and direct decision that there is nothing other than the abiding of the continual flow of rigpa." Confidence directly in the liberation of rising thoughts ( deng drol tok tu cha ). Dudjom comments: "In the recognition of namtok [arising thoughts], whatever arises, whether gross or subtle, there is direct confidence in the simultaneity of the arising and dissolution in the expanse of dharmakāya, which is the unity of rigpa and śūnyatā ." Other eastern religions [ edit ] Sikhism [ edit ] Many newer, contemporary Sikhs have suggested that human souls and the monotheistic God are two different realities (dualism), [ 260 ] distinguishing it from the monistic and various shades of nondualistic philosophies of other Indian religions.

[ 261 ] However, some Sikh scholars have attempted to explore nondualism exegesis of Sikh scriptures, [ 262 ] such as during the neocolonial reformist movement by Bhai Vir Singh . According to Mandair, Singh interprets the Sikh scriptures as teaching nonduality.

[ 263 ] Sikh scholar Bhai Mani Singh is quoted as saying that Sikhism has all the essence of Vedanta philosophy. Historically, the Sikh symbol of Ik Oankaar has had a monistic meaning, and has been reduced to simply meaning, "There is but One God", which is incorrect.

[ 264 ] Older exegesis of Sikh scripture, such as the Faridkot Teeka , has always described Sikh metaphysics as a non-dual, panentheistic universe.

[ 265 ] Taoism [ edit ] Main article: Taoism Taijitu Taoism's wu wei (Chinese wu , not; wei , doing) is a term with various translations [ note 19 ] and interpretations designed to distinguish it from passivity. Commonly understood as "effortless action", this concept intersects with the core notions of nondualism.

Wu wei encourages individuals to flow with the natural rhythms of existence, moving beyond dualistic perspectives and embracing a harmonious unity with the universe. This holistic approach to life, characterized by spontaneous and unforced action, aligns with the essence of nondualism, emphasizing interconnectedness, oneness, and the dissolution of dualistic boundaries. By seamlessly integrating effortless action in both physical deeds and mental states, wu wei embodies the nondual philosophy's essence.

[ 266 ] The concept of Yin and Yang , often mistakenly conceived of as a symbol of dualism, is actually meant to convey the notion that all apparent opposites are complementary parts of a non-dual whole.

[ 267 ] Western traditions [ edit ] See also: Spirituality , New Age , Neo-Advaita , Western esotericism , Perennialism , and Syncretism Part of a series on Universalism Philosophical Moral universalism Universal value Universality Universalizability Economic and societal Cultural universal Universal basic income Universal basic services Universal design Universal health care Universal preschool Universal suffrage Christian Beliefs Apocatastasis Theosis Trinitarian universalism Universal reconciliation Churches and groups Unitarian Universalism International Council of Unitarians and Universalists Primitive Baptist Universalists Universalist Church of America Other History Unlimited atonement Other religions Baháʼí Faith Brahmoism Hinduism (Neo-Vedanta) Sufism Universalism and the Latter Day Saint movement Spiritual Mysticism Nondualism Perennialism Theosophy Category v t e A modern strand of thought sees "nondual consciousness" as a universal psychological state, which is a common stratum and of the same essence in different spiritual traditions.

[ 15 ] It is derived from Neo-Vedanta and neo-Advaita , but has historical roots in neo-Platonism , Western esotericism , and Perennialism . The idea of nondual consciousness as "the central essence" [ 268 ] is a universalistic and perennialist idea, which is part of a modern mutual exchange and synthesis of ideas between western spiritual and esoteric traditions and Asian religious revival and reform movements.

[ note 20 ] Central elements in the western traditions are Neo-Platonism , which had a strong influence on Christian contemplation or mysticism , and its accompanying apophatic theology .

[ 271 ] Medieval Abrahamic religions [ edit ] Christian contemplation and mysticism [ edit ] Main articles: Christian contemplation , Christian Mysticism , and Apophatic theology The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine, St John the Baptist, St Antony Abbot In Christian mysticism, contemplative prayer and Apophatic theology are central elements. In contemplative prayer, the mind is focused by constant repetition a phrase or word. Saint John Cassian recommended use of the phrase "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me".

[ 272 ] [ 273 ] Another formula for repetition is the name of Jesus [ 274 ] [ 275 ] or the Jesus Prayer , which has been called "the mantra of the Orthodox Church", [ 273 ] although the term "Jesus Prayer" is not found in the Fathers of the Church.

[ 276 ] The author of The Cloud of Unknowing recommended use of a monosyllabic word, such as "God" or "Love".

[ 277 ] Apophatic theology is derived from Neo-Platonism via Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite . In this approach, the notion of God is stripped from all positive qualifications, leaving a "darkness" or "unground", it had a strong influence on western mysticism. A notable example is Meister Eckhart , who also attracted attention from Zen-Buddhists like D.T. Suzuki in modern times, due to the similarities between Buddhist thought and Neo-Platonism.

The Cloud of Unknowing – an anonymous work of Christian mysticism written in Middle English in the latter half of the 14th century – advocates a mystic relationship with God. The text describes a spiritual union with God through the heart. The author of the text advocates centering prayer , a form of inner silence. According to the text, God can not be known through knowledge or from intellection. It is only by emptying the mind of all created images and thoughts that we can arrive to experience God. Continuing on this line of thought, God is completely unknowable by the mind. God is not known through the intellect but through intense contemplation , motivated by love, and stripped of all thought.

[ 278 ] Thomism , though not non-dual in the ordinary sense, considers the unity of God so absolute that even the duality of subject and predicate , to describe him, can be true only by analogy . In Thomist thought, even the Tetragrammaton is only an approximate name, since "I am" involves a predicate whose own essence is its subject.

[ 279 ] The former nun and contemplative Bernadette Roberts is considered a nondualist by Jerry Katz.

[ 15 ] Hypostatic-union is an incomplete form of non-duality applied to a tertiary entity, neglecting the subjective self .

Jewish Hasidism and Kabbalism [ edit ] Main articles: Judaism , Hasidism , and Kabbalah According to Jay Michaelson , nonduality begins to appear in the medieval Jewish textual tradition which peaked in Hasidism : [ 280 ] Judaism has within it a strong and very ancient mystical tradition that is deeply nondualistic. " Ein Sof "  or infinite nothingness is considered the ground face of all that is. God is considered beyond all proposition or preconception. The physical world is seen as emanating from the nothingness as the many faces " partzufim " of god that are all a part of the sacred nothingness.

[ 281 ] One of the most striking contributions of the Kabbalah, which became a central idea in Chasidic thought, was a highly innovative reading of the monotheistic idea. The belief in one God is no longer perceived as the mere rejection of other deities or intermediaries, but a denial of any existence outside of God.

[ note 21 ] Western philosophy [ edit ] Baruch Spinoza 's formulation of pantheism in the 17th century constitutes a seminal European manifestation of nondualism. His philosophical work, especially expounded in Ethics posits a radical idea that fuses divinity with the material world, suggesting that God and the universe are not separate entities but different facets of a single underlying substance. In his worldview, the finite and the infinite are harmoniously interwoven, challenging René Descartes ' dualistic perspective .

[ 282 ] One of Friedrich Nietzsche 's philosophical insights also resonates with nondualism. Nietzsche wrote that "We cease to think when we refuse to do so under the constraint of language." [ note 22 ] This idea is explored in his book On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense . His scrutiny of conventional thought and language urges a departure from linguistic boundaries.

[ 284 ] This perspective aligns with the nondual notion of transcending dualistic concepts and engaging with reality in a more immediate, intuitive manner.

Academic views [ edit ] Orientalism [ edit ] Main article: Orientalism The western world has been exposed to Indian religions since the late 18th century.

[ 285 ] The first western translation of a Sanskrit text was made in 1785.

[ 285 ] It marked a growing interest in Indian culture and languages.

[ 286 ] The first translation of the dualism and nondualism discussing Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802 [ 287 ] and influenced Arthur Schopenhauer , who called them "the consolation of my life".

[ 288 ] Early translations also appeared in other European languages.

[ 289 ] Common-core thesis [ edit ] The common-core thesis suggests that different mystical traditions may describe similar, if not identical, experiences, despite using different conceptual frameworks and terminologies.

[ 290 ] Proponents of Perennialism , such as Aldous Huxley , argue that a universal mystical core underlies all religious traditions. Huxley, influenced by Vivekananda 's Neo-Vedanta and Universalism , promoted this idea in his book The Perennial Philosophy .

[ 104 ] However, scholarly critiques of this thesis argue that religious experiences are often culturally and doctrinally mediated, rather than pointing to a single, universal experience.

[ 31 ] Elias Amidon describes this common essence as an "indescribable but definitely recognizable reality" [ 291 ] that serves as the ground of all being. He suggests that various spiritual traditions refer to this reality by different names, including: [ 291 ] [N]ondual awareness, pure awareness, open awareness, presence-awareness, unconditioned mind, rigpa, primordial experience, This, the basic state, the sublime, buddhanature, original nature, spontaneous presence, the oneness of being, the ground of being, the Real, clarity, God-consciousness, divine light, the clear light, illumination, realization and enlightenment.

While some scholars, such as Jean-Marc Renard, argue that nondual awareness is rooted in direct experience or intuition of "the Real", they also emphasize that nondualism differs from monism .

[ 30 ] Unlike monism, which may conceptualize reality as a unified whole, nondualism is understood as fundamentally "nonconceptual" and "not graspable in an idea".

[ 30 ] Alan Watts is credited with popularizing this distinction between nondualism and monism, particularly in The Supreme Identity (1950) and The Way of Zen (1957).

[ 292 ] He explained that monism often leads to conceptualizing reality as a single entity, whereas nondualism points beyond conceptual frameworks entirely.

[ 30 ] Critiques of the common-core thesis [ edit ] Critics of the common-core thesis, often referred to as diversity theorists, argue that mystical experiences are not universal but instead culturally and doctrinally shaped. Scholars such as S. T. Katz and Wayne Proudfoot assert that all religious experiences are mediated by language, tradition, and conceptual frameworks rather than reflecting an unconditioned, universal mystical reality.

[ 31 ] Katz, in particular, writes that "[N]o unmediated experience is possible, and that in the extreme, language is not simply used to interpret experience but in fact constitutes experience." [ 31 ] This position challenges the idea that nondual awareness is a common mystical essence, arguing instead that what one experiences in religious practice is shaped by their specific cultural and doctrinal background.

Philosopher Keith Yandell further critiques the common-core thesis by distinguishing five distinct categories of religious experiences, each tied to a specific doctrinal framework: [ 293 ] Numinous experiences – Found in monotheistic traditions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Vedantic Hinduism.

Nirvanic experiences – Found in Buddhism, where one perceives the self as a bundle of fleeting states rather than a fixed entity.

Kevala experiences – Found in Jainism, where the self is understood as an indestructible subject of experience.

Moksha experiences – Found in Hinduism, with Brahman conceptualized either as a cosmic person or as an impersonal, qualityless absolute.

Nature mystical experiences – Found in traditions emphasizing union with nature rather than a transcendental or metaphysical realization.

This classification suggests that religious experiences vary significantly across traditions, contradicting the claim that all mystical experiences point to the same nondual essence.

Further criticism comes from Richard King and Robert Sharf, who argue that what one experiences in meditation or mystical practice is largely shaped by pre-existing doctrinal expectations.

[ 294 ] In this view, mystical experiences are not independent proofs of a given tradition's truth but are instead a result of the teachings and practices within that tradition.

[ 294 ] For example, Bronkhorst traces the historical development of "liberating insight" in Buddhism, demonstrating that the concept evolved significantly over time. Early Buddhist texts did not provide a clear definition of what constituted enlightenment. Later, the Four Noble Truths became the dominant framework for understanding liberation. Over time, this emphasis shifted again; in some Hinayana schools, liberation was increasingly understood through the doctrine of no-self (anatta) as a fundamental realization. Schmithausen further observes that Buddhist scriptures contain multiple interpretations of enlightenment, suggesting that even within a single tradition, the nature of ultimate realization was not fixed but subject to doctrinal development and reinterpretation.

[ 295 ] These variations challenge the idea that nondual awareness is a universal and timeless mystical experience, instead suggesting that different traditions construct different understandings of what constitutes ultimate reality.

Phenomenology [ edit ] Nondual awareness, also called pure consciousness or awareness, [ 296 ] contentless consciousness, [ 297 ] consciousness-as-such, [ 4 ] and Minimal Phenomenal Experience, [ 296 ] is a topic of phenomenological research. As described in Samkhya-Yoga and other systems of meditation, and referred to as, for example, Turya and Atman, [ 298 ] [ 297 ] pure awareness manifests in advanced states of meditation.

[ 298 ] [ 296 ] Pure consciousness is distinguished from the workings of the mind, and "consists in nothing but the being seen of what is seen".

[ 298 ] Gamma & Metzinger (2021) present twelve factors in their phenomenological analysis of pure awareness experienced by meditators, including luminosity; emptiness and non-egoic self-awareness; and witness-consciousness.

( December 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Notes [ edit ] ^ One of the earliest uses of the word Advaita is found in verse 4.3.32 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (~800 BCE), and in verses 7 and 12 of the Mandukya Upanishad (variously dated to have been composed between 500 BCE to 200 BCE).

[ 16 ] The term appears in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.3.32, in the section with a discourse of the oneness of Atman (individual soul) and Brahman (universal consciousness), as follows: [ 17 ] "An ocean is that one seer, without any duality [Advaita]; this is the Brahma-world, O King. Thus did Yajnavalkya teach him. This is his highest goal, this is his highest success, this is his highest world, this is his highest bliss. All other creatures live on a small portion of that bliss.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] ^ Edward Roer translates the early medieval era Brihadaranyakopnisad-bhasya as, "(...) Lokayatikas and Bauddhas who assert that the soul does not exist. There are four sects among the followers of Buddha: 1. Madhyamicas who maintain all is void; 2. Yogacharas, who assert except sensation and intelligence all else is void; 3. Sautranticas, who affirm actual existence of external objects no less than of internal sensations; 4. Vaibhashikas, who agree with later (Sautranticas) except that they contend for immediate apprehension of exterior objects through images or forms represented to the intellect." [ 39 ] [ 40 ] ^ "A" means "not", or "non"; "jāti" means "creation" or "origination"; [ 81 ] "vāda" means "doctrine" [ 81 ] ^ The influence of Mahayana Buddhism on other religions and philosophies was not limited to Advaita Vedanta. Kalupahana notes that the Visuddhimagga contains "some metaphysical speculations, such as those of the Sarvastivadins, the Sautrantikas, and even the Yogacarins ".

[ 83 ] ^ Neo-Vedanta seems to be closer to Bhedabheda -Vedanta than to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with the acknowledgement of the reality of the world. Nicholas F. Gier: "Ramakrsna, Svami Vivekananda, and Aurobindo (I also include M.K. Gandhi) have been labeled "neo-Vedantists", a philosophy that rejects the Advaitins' claim that the world is illusory. Aurobindo, in his The Life Divine , declares that he has moved from Sankara's  "universal illusionism" to his own "universal realism" (2005: 432), defined as metaphysical realism in the European philosophical sense of the term." [ 108 ] ^ Abhinavgupta (between 10th – 11th century AD) who summarized the view points of all previous thinkers and presented the philosophy in a logical way along with his own thoughts in his treatise Tantraloka.

[ 115 ] ^ Marek: "Wobei der Begriff Neo-Advaita darauf hinweist, dass sich die traditionelle Advaita von dieser Strömung zunehmend distanziert, da sie die Bedeutung der übenden Vorbereitung nach wie vor als unumgänglich ansieht. (The term Neo-Advaita indicating that the traditional Advaita increasingly distances itself from this movement, as they regard preparational practicing still as inevitable) [ 131 ] ^ Alan Jacobs: "Many firm devotees of Sri Ramana Maharshi now rightly term this western phenomenon as 'Neo-Advaita'. The term is carefully selected because 'neo' means 'a new or revived form'. And this new form is not the Classical Advaita which we understand to have been taught by both of the Great Self Realised Sages, Adi Shankara and Ramana Maharshi. It can even be termed 'pseudo' because, by presenting the teaching in a highly attenuated form, it might be described as purporting to be Advaita, but not in effect actually being so, in the fullest sense of the word. In this watering down of the essential truths in a palatable style made acceptable and attractive to the contemporary western mind, their teaching is misleading." [ 132 ] ^ Presently Cohen has distanced himself from Poonja, and calls his teachings "Evolutionary Enlightenment".

[ 135 ] ^ According to Alexander Wynne, Schayer "referred to passages in which "consciousness" ( vinnana ) seems to be the ultimate reality or substratum (e.g. A I.10) 14 as well as the Saddhatu Sutra , which is not found in any canonical source but is cited in other Buddhist texts — it states that the personality (pudgala) consists of the six elements (dhatu) of earth, water, fire, wind, space and consciousness; Schayer noted that it related to other ancient Indian ideas. Keith's argument is also based on the Saddhatu Sutra as well as "passages where we have explanations of Nirvana which echo the ideas of the Upanishads regarding the ultimate reality". He also refers to the doctrine of "a consciousness, originally pure , defiled by adventitious impurities".

[ 147 ] ^ Lindtner: "... a place one can actually go to. It is called nirvanadhatu , has no border-signs ( animitta ), is localized somewhere beyond the other six dhatus (beginning with earth and ending with vijñana ) but is closest to akasa and vijñana . One cannot visualize it, it is anidarsana , but it provides one with firm ground under one's feet, it is dhruva; once there one will not slip back, it is acyutapada . As opposed to this world, it is a pleasant place to be in, it is sukha, things work well.

[ 141 ] Cited in Wynne (2007 , p. 99).

^ See Digha Nikaya 15, Mahanidana Sutta , which describes a nine-fold chain of causation. Mind-and-body ( nama-rupa ) and consciousness ( vijnana ) do condition here each other (verse 2 & 3). In verse 21 and 22, it is stated that consciousness comes into the mother's womb, and finds a resting place in mind-and-body.

[ 152 ] ^ According to Peter Harvey, the Theravada-tradition tends to minimize mystical tendencies, but there is also a tendency to stress the complete otherness of nirvana from samsara . The Pāli Canon provides good grounds for this minimalistic approach, bit it also contains material suggestive of a Vijnavada-type interpretation of nirvāṇa , namely as a radical transformation of consciousness .

[ 154 ] ^ Rahula 2007 , Kindle Locations 1105-1113: "Nirvāṇa is beyond all terms of duality and relativity. It is therefore beyond our conceptions of good and evil, right and wrong, existence and non-existence. Even the word 'happiness' (sukha) which is used to describe Nirvāṇa has an entirely different sense here. Sāriputta once said: 'O friend, Nirvāṇa is happiness! Nirvāṇa is happiness!' Then Udāyi asked: 'But, friend Sāriputta, what happiness can it be if there is no sensation?' Sāriputta's reply was highly philosophical and beyond ordinary comprehension: "That there is no sensation itself is happiness'." ^ See also essence and function and Absolute-relative on Chinese Chán ^ "Representation-only" [ 190 ] or "mere representation".

And even after He brought into being everything which exists, there is nothing but Him, and you cannot find anything that existed apart from Him, G-d forbid. For nothing existed devoid of G-d's power, for if there were, He would be limited and subject to duality, G-d forbid. Rather, G-d is everything that exists, but everything that exists is not G-d...

The idea that the highest truth lies beyond all dualistic constructions of reality has ancient roots in Indian thought. One of the oldest articulations of this idea can be found in the famous Nasadīya ("Non-Being") hymn of the Ṛgveda: "There was neither being nor non-being then …" While the Vedic poem describes an undifferentiated reality in the beginning of the world, several Upaniṣads, including the Īśā, hint at a similar sort of undifferentiated oneness as the ultimate goal of the human spiritual quest.
