That is, the theory forms a bridge between the areas of algebraic topology and differential geometry . It was developed in the late 1940s by Shiing-Shen Chern and André Weil , in the wake of proofs of the generalized Gauss–Bonnet theorem . This theory was an important step in the theory of characteristic classes .

Let G be a real or complex Lie group with Lie algebra g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} , and let C [ g ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [{\mathfrak {g}}]} denote the algebra of C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } -valued polynomials on g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} (exactly the same argument works if we used R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } instead of C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } ).

Let C [ g ] G {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [{\mathfrak {g}}]^{G}} be the subalgebra of fixed points in C [ g ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [{\mathfrak {g}}]} under the adjoint action of G ; that is, the subalgebra consisting of all polynomials f such that f ( Ad g ⁡ ⁡ x ) = f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(\operatorname {Ad} _{g}x)=f(x)} , for all g in G and x in g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} , Given a principal G-bundle P on M , there is an associated homomorphism of C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } -algebras, C [ g ] G → → H ∗ ∗ ( M ; C ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [{\mathfrak {g}}]^{G}\to H^{*}(M;\mathbb {C} )} , called the Chern–Weil homomorphism , where on the right cohomology is de Rham cohomology .  This homomorphism is obtained by taking invariant polynomials in the curvature of any connection on the given bundle.  If G is either compact  or semi-simple, then the cohomology ring of the classifying space for G -bundles, B G {\displaystyle BG} , is isomorphic to the algebra C [ g ] G {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [{\mathfrak {g}}]^{G}} of invariant polynomials: H ∗ ∗ ( B G ; C ) ≅ ≅ C [ g ] G .

{\displaystyle H^{*}(BG;\mathbb {C} )\cong \mathbb {C} [{\mathfrak {g}}]^{G}.} (The cohomology ring of BG can still be given in the de Rham sense: H k ( B G ; C ) = lim → → ⁡ ⁡ ker ⁡ ⁡ ( d : : Ω Ω k ( B j G ) → → Ω Ω k + 1 ( B j G ) ) / im ⁡ ⁡ d .

{\displaystyle H^{k}(BG;\mathbb {C} )=\varinjlim \operatorname {ker} (d\colon \Omega ^{k}(B_{j}G)\to \Omega ^{k+1}(B_{j}G))/\operatorname {im} d.} when B G = lim → → ⁡ ⁡ B j G {\displaystyle BG=\varinjlim B_{j}G} and B j G {\displaystyle B_{j}G} are manifolds.) Definition of the homomorphism [ edit ] Choose any connection form ω in P , and let Ω be the associated curvature form ; i.e., Ω Ω = D ω ω {\displaystyle \Omega =D\omega } , the exterior covariant derivative of ω. If f ∈ ∈ C [ g ] G {\displaystyle f\in \mathbb {C} [{\mathfrak {g}}]^{G}} is a homogeneous polynomial function of degree k ; i.e., f ( a x ) = a k f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(ax)=a^{k}f(x)} for any complex number a and x in g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} , then, viewing f as a symmetric multilinear functional on ∏ ∏ 1 k g {\textstyle \prod _{1}^{k}{\mathfrak {g}}} (see the ring of polynomial functions ), let f ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle f(\Omega )} be the (scalar-valued) 2 k -form on P given by f ( Ω Ω ) ( v 1 , … … , v 2 k ) = 1 ( 2 k ) !

∑ ∑ σ σ ∈ ∈ S 2 k ϵ ϵ σ σ f ( Ω Ω ( v σ σ ( 1 ) , v σ σ ( 2 ) ) , … … , Ω Ω ( v σ σ ( 2 k − − 1 ) , v σ σ ( 2 k ) ) ) {\displaystyle f(\Omega )(v_{1},\dots ,v_{2k})={\frac {1}{(2k)!}}\sum _{\sigma \in {\mathfrak {S}}_{2k}}\epsilon _{\sigma }f(\Omega (v_{\sigma (1)},v_{\sigma (2)}),\dots ,\Omega (v_{\sigma (2k-1)},v_{\sigma (2k)}))} where v i are tangent vectors to P , ϵ ϵ σ σ {\displaystyle \epsilon _{\sigma }} is the sign of the permutation σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } in the symmetric group on 2 k numbers S 2 k {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {S}}_{2k}} (see Lie algebra-valued forms#Operations as well as Pfaffian ).

If, moreover, f is invariant; i.e., f ( Ad g ⁡ ⁡ x ) = f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(\operatorname {Ad} _{g}x)=f(x)} , then one can show that f ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle f(\Omega )} is a closed form , it descends to a unique form on M and that the de Rham cohomology class of the form is independent of ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } . First, that f ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle f(\Omega )} is a closed form follows from the next two lemmas: [ 1 ] Lemma 1: The form f ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle f(\Omega )} on P descends to a (unique) form f ¯ ¯ ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle {\overline {f}}(\Omega )} on M ; i.e., there is a form on M that pulls-back to f ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle f(\Omega )} .

Lemma 2: If a form of φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } on P descends to a form on M , then d φ φ = D φ φ {\displaystyle d\varphi =D\varphi } .

Indeed, Bianchi's second identity says D Ω Ω = 0 {\displaystyle D\Omega =0} and, since D is a graded derivation, D f ( Ω Ω ) = 0.

{\displaystyle Df(\Omega )=0.} Finally, Lemma 1 says f ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle f(\Omega )} satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 2.

To see Lemma 2, let π π : : P → → M {\displaystyle \pi \colon P\to M} be the projection and h be the projection of T u P {\displaystyle T_{u}P} onto the horizontal subspace. Then Lemma 2 is a consequence of the fact that d π π ( h v ) = d π π ( v ) {\displaystyle d\pi (hv)=d\pi (v)} (the kernel of d π π {\displaystyle d\pi } is precisely the vertical subspace.) As for Lemma 1, first note f ( Ω Ω ) ( d R g ( v 1 ) , … … , d R g ( v 2 k ) ) = f ( Ω Ω ) ( v 1 , … … , v 2 k ) , R g ( u ) = u g ; {\displaystyle f(\Omega )(dR_{g}(v_{1}),\dots ,dR_{g}(v_{2k}))=f(\Omega )(v_{1},\dots ,v_{2k}),\,R_{g}(u)=ug;} which is because R g ∗ ∗ Ω Ω = Ad g − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ Ω Ω {\displaystyle R_{g}^{*}\Omega =\operatorname {Ad} _{g^{-1}}\Omega } and f is invariant. Thus, one can define f ¯ ¯ ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle {\overline {f}}(\Omega )} by the formula: f ¯ ¯ ( Ω Ω ) ( v 1 ¯ ¯ , … … , v 2 k ¯ ¯ ) = f ( Ω Ω ) ( v 1 , … … , v 2 k ) , {\displaystyle {\overline {f}}(\Omega )({\overline {v_{1}}},\dots ,{\overline {v_{2k}}})=f(\Omega )(v_{1},\dots ,v_{2k}),} where v i {\displaystyle v_{i}} are any lifts of v i ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {v_{i}}}} : d π π ( v i ) = v ¯ ¯ i {\displaystyle d\pi (v_{i})={\overline {v}}_{i}} .

Next, we show that the de Rham cohomology class of f ¯ ¯ ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle {\overline {f}}(\Omega )} on M is independent of a choice of connection.

[ 2 ] Let ω ω 0 , ω ω 1 {\displaystyle \omega _{0},\omega _{1}} be arbitrary connection forms on P and let p : : P × × R → → P {\displaystyle p\colon P\times \mathbb {R} \to P} be the projection. Put ω ω ′ = t p ∗ ∗ ω ω 1 + ( 1 − − t ) p ∗ ∗ ω ω 0 {\displaystyle \omega '=t\,p^{*}\omega _{1}+(1-t)\,p^{*}\omega _{0}} where t is a smooth function on P × × R {\displaystyle P\times \mathbb {R} } given by ( x , s ) ↦ ↦ s {\displaystyle (x,s)\mapsto s} . Let Ω Ω ′ , Ω Ω 0 , Ω Ω 1 {\displaystyle \Omega ',\Omega _{0},\Omega _{1}} be the curvature forms of ω ω ′ , ω ω 0 , ω ω 1 {\displaystyle \omega ',\omega _{0},\omega _{1}} . Let i s : M → → M × × R , x ↦ ↦ ( x , s ) {\displaystyle i_{s}:M\to M\times \mathbb {R} ,\,x\mapsto (x,s)} be the inclusions. Then i 0 {\displaystyle i_{0}} is homotopic to i 1 {\displaystyle i_{1}} . Thus, i 0 ∗ ∗ f ¯ ¯ ( Ω Ω ′ ) {\displaystyle i_{0}^{*}{\overline {f}}(\Omega ')} and i 1 ∗ ∗ f ¯ ¯ ( Ω Ω ′ ) {\displaystyle i_{1}^{*}{\overline {f}}(\Omega ')} belong to the same de Rham cohomology class by the homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology . Finally, by naturality and by uniqueness of descending, i 0 ∗ ∗ f ¯ ¯ ( Ω Ω ′ ) = f ¯ ¯ ( Ω Ω 0 ) {\displaystyle i_{0}^{*}{\overline {f}}(\Omega ')={\overline {f}}(\Omega _{0})} and the same for Ω Ω 1 {\displaystyle \Omega _{1}} . Hence, f ¯ ¯ ( Ω Ω 0 ) , f ¯ ¯ ( Ω Ω 1 ) {\displaystyle {\overline {f}}(\Omega _{0}),{\overline {f}}(\Omega _{1})} belong to the same cohomology class.

The construction thus gives the linear map: (cf. Lemma 1) C [ g ] k G → → H 2 k ( M ; C ) , f ↦ ↦ [ f ¯ ¯ ( Ω Ω ) ] .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [{\mathfrak {g}}]_{k}^{G}\to H^{2k}(M;\mathbb {C} ),\,f\mapsto \left[{\overline {f}}(\Omega )\right].} In fact, one can check that the map thus obtained: C [ g ] G → → H ∗ ∗ ( M ; C ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [{\mathfrak {g}}]^{G}\to H^{*}(M;\mathbb {C} )} is an algebra homomorphism .

Example: Chern classes and Chern character [ edit ] Let G = GL n ⁡ ⁡ ( C ) {\displaystyle G=\operatorname {GL} _{n}(\mathbb {C} )} and g = g l n ( C ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}={\mathfrak {gl}}_{n}(\mathbb {C} )} its Lie algebra. For each x in g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} , we can consider its characteristic polynomial in t : [ 3 ] det ( I − − t x 2 π π i ) = ∑ ∑ k = 0 n f k ( x ) t k , {\displaystyle \det \left(I-t{x \over 2\pi i}\right)=\sum _{k=0}^{n}f_{k}(x)t^{k},} where i is the square root of -1. Then f k {\displaystyle f_{k}} are invariant polynomials on g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} , since the left-hand side of the equation is. The k -th Chern class of a smooth complex-vector bundle E of rank n on a manifold M : c k ( E ) ∈ ∈ H 2 k ( M , Z ) {\displaystyle c_{k}(E)\in H^{2k}(M,\mathbb {Z} )} is given as the image of f k {\displaystyle f_{k}} under the Chern–Weil homomorphism defined by E (or more precisely the frame bundle of E ). If t = 1, then det ( I − − x 2 π π i ) = 1 + f 1 ( x ) + ⋯ ⋯ + f n ( x ) {\displaystyle \det \left(I-{x \over 2\pi i}\right)=1+f_{1}(x)+\cdots +f_{n}(x)} is an invariant polynomial. The total Chern class of E is the image of this polynomial; that is, c ( E ) = 1 + c 1 ( E ) + ⋯ ⋯ + c n ( E ) .

{\displaystyle c(E)=1+c_{1}(E)+\cdots +c_{n}(E).} Directly from the definition, one can show that c j {\displaystyle c_{j}} and c given above satisfy the axioms of Chern classes. For example, for the Whitney sum formula, we consider c t ( E ) = [ det ( I − − t Ω Ω / 2 π π i ) ] , {\displaystyle c_{t}(E)=[\det \left(I-t{\Omega /2\pi i}\right)],} where we wrote Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } for the curvature 2-form on M of the vector bundle E (so it is the descendent of the curvature form on the frame bundle of E ). The Chern–Weil homomorphism is the same if one uses this Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } . Now, suppose E is a direct sum of vector bundles E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} 's and Ω Ω i {\displaystyle \Omega _{i}} the curvature form of E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} so that, in the matrix term, Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is the block diagonal matrix with Ω I 's on the diagonal. Then, since det ( I − − t Ω Ω 2 π π i ) = det ( I − − t Ω Ω 1 2 π π i ) ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ det ( I − − t Ω Ω m 2 π π i ) {\textstyle \det(I-t{\frac {\Omega }{2\pi i}})=\det(I-t{\frac {\Omega _{1}}{2\pi i}})\wedge \dots \wedge \det(I-t{\frac {\Omega _{m}}{2\pi i}})} , we have: c t ( E ) = c t ( E 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ c t ( E m ) {\displaystyle c_{t}(E)=c_{t}(E_{1})\cdots c_{t}(E_{m})} where on the right the multiplication is that of a cohomology ring: cup product . For the normalization property, one computes the first Chern class of the complex projective line ; see Chern class#Example: the complex tangent bundle of the Riemann sphere .

Since Ω Ω E ⊗ ⊗ E ′ = Ω Ω E ⊗ ⊗ I E ′ + I E ⊗ ⊗ Ω Ω E ′ {\displaystyle \Omega _{E\otimes E'}=\Omega _{E}\otimes I_{E'}+I_{E}\otimes \Omega _{E'}} , [ 4 ] we also have: c 1 ( E ⊗ ⊗ E ′ ) = c 1 ( E ) rank ⁡ ⁡ ( E ′ ) + rank ⁡ ⁡ ( E ) c 1 ( E ′ ) .

{\displaystyle c_{1}(E\otimes E')=c_{1}(E)\operatorname {rank} (E')+\operatorname {rank} (E)c_{1}(E').} Finally, the Chern character of E is given by ch ⁡ ⁡ ( E ) = [ tr ⁡ ⁡ ( e − − Ω Ω / 2 π π i ) ] ∈ ∈ H ∗ ∗ ( M , Q ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {ch} (E)=[\operatorname {tr} (e^{-\Omega /2\pi i})]\in H^{*}(M,\mathbb {Q} )} where Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is the curvature form of some connection on E (since Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is nilpotent, it is a polynomial in Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } .) Then ch is a ring homomorphism : ch ⁡ ⁡ ( E ⊕ ⊕ F ) = ch ⁡ ⁡ ( E ) + ch ⁡ ⁡ ( F ) , ch ⁡ ⁡ ( E ⊗ ⊗ F ) = ch ⁡ ⁡ ( E ) ch ⁡ ⁡ ( F ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {ch} (E\oplus F)=\operatorname {ch} (E)+\operatorname {ch} (F),\,\operatorname {ch} (E\otimes F)=\operatorname {ch} (E)\operatorname {ch} (F).} Now suppose, in some ring R containing the cohomology ring H ∗ ∗ ( M , C ) {\displaystyle H^{*}(M,\mathbb {C} )} , there is the factorization of the polynomial in t : c t ( E ) = ∏ ∏ j = 0 n ( 1 + λ λ j t ) {\displaystyle c_{t}(E)=\prod _{j=0}^{n}(1+\lambda _{j}t)} where λ λ j {\displaystyle \lambda _{j}} are in R (they are sometimes called Chern roots.) Then ch ⁡ ⁡ ( E ) = e λ λ j {\displaystyle \operatorname {ch} (E)=e^{\lambda _{j}}} .

Example: Pontrjagin classes [ edit ] If E is a smooth real vector bundle on a manifold M , then the k -th Pontrjagin class of E is given as: p k ( E ) = ( − − 1 ) k c 2 k ( E ⊗ ⊗ C ) ∈ ∈ H 4 k ( M ; Z ) {\displaystyle p_{k}(E)=(-1)^{k}c_{2k}(E\otimes \mathbb {C} )\in H^{4k}(M;\mathbb {Z} )} where we wrote E ⊗ ⊗ C {\displaystyle E\otimes \mathbb {C} } for the complexification of E . Equivalently, it is the image under the Chern–Weil homomorphism of the invariant polynomial g 2 k {\displaystyle g_{2k}} on g l n ( R ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {gl}}_{n}(\mathbb {R} )} given by: det ⁡ ⁡ ( I − − t x 2 π π ) = ∑ ∑ k = 0 n g k ( x ) t k .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {det} \left(I-t{x \over 2\pi }\right)=\sum _{k=0}^{n}g_{k}(x)t^{k}.} The homomorphism for holomorphic vector bundles [ edit ] Let E be a holomorphic (complex-)vector bundle on a complex manifold M . The curvature form Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } of E , with respect to some hermitian metric, is not just a 2-form, but is in fact a (1, 1)-form (see holomorphic vector bundle#Hermitian metrics on a holomorphic vector bundle ). Hence, the Chern–Weil homomorphism assumes the form: with G = GL n ⁡ ⁡ ( C ) {\displaystyle G=\operatorname {GL} _{n}(\mathbb {C} )} , C [ g ] k → → H k , k ( M ; C ) , f ↦ ↦ [ f ( Ω Ω ) ] .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [{\mathfrak {g}}]_{k}\to H^{k,k}(M;\mathbb {C} ),f\mapsto [f(\Omega )].} See also [ edit ] ∞-Chern–Weil theory Notes [ edit ] ^ Kobayashi & Nomizu 1969 , Ch. XII.
