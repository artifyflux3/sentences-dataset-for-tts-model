These interactions are mediated by the Z boson . The discovery of weak neutral currents was a significant step toward the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force , and led to the discovery of the W and Z bosons .

In simple terms [ edit ] The weak force is  best known for its role in nuclear decay. It has very short range but (apart from gravity) is the only force to interact with neutrinos . Like other subatomic forces, the weak force is mediated via exchange particles. Perhaps the most well known of the exchange particles for the weak force is the W particle which is involved in beta decay . W particles have electric charge – there are both positive and negative W particles – however the Z boson is also an exchange particle for the weak force but does not have any electrical charge.

Exchange of a Z boson transfers momentum , spin , and energy , but leaves the interacting particles' quantum numbers unaffected – charge, flavor , baryon number , lepton number , etc. Because there is no transfer of electrical charge involved, exchange of Z particles is referred to as "neutral" in the phrase "neutral current". However the word "current" here has nothing to do with electricity – it simply refers to the exchange of the Z particle.

[ 1 ] The Z boson's neutral current interaction is determined by a derived quantum number called weak charge , which acts similarly to weak isospin for interactions with the W bosons.

Definition [ edit ] The neutral current that gives the interaction its name is that of the interacting particles.

For example, the neutral current contribution to the ν e e − → ν e e − elastic scattering amplitude is M N C ∝ ∝ J μ μ ( N C ) ( ν ν e ) J ( N C ) μ μ ( e − − ) , {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {M}}^{\mathsf {NC}}~\propto ~J_{\mu }^{\mathsf {(NC)}}(\nu _{\mathrm {e} })\;J^{{\mathsf {(NC)}}\ \mu }(\mathrm {e^{-}} )\ ,} where the neutral currents describing the flow of the neutrino and of the electron are given by: [ 2 ] J ( N C ) μ μ ( f ) = u ¯ ¯ f γ γ μ μ 1 2 ( g V f − − g A f γ γ 5 ) u f , {\displaystyle J^{{\mathsf {(NC)}}\ \mu }(f)={\bar {u}}_{f}\ \gamma ^{\mu }\ {\frac {1}{2}}\left(g_{\mathsf {V}}^{f}-g_{\mathsf {A}}^{f}\ \gamma ^{5}\right)\ u_{f}\ ,} where: [ 2 ] g V f = T 3 ( f ) − − 2 sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ W Q ( f ) = 1 2 Q W ( f ) {\displaystyle g_{\mathsf {V}}^{f}=T_{3}(f)-2\sin ^{2}\theta _{\mathsf {W}}\ Q(f)={\frac {1}{2}}\ Q_{\mathsf {W}}(f)} and g A f = T 3 ( f ) {\displaystyle \ g_{\mathsf {A}}^{f}=T_{3}(f)\ } are the vector and axial couplings for fermion f .

{\displaystyle \ f~.} T 3 {\displaystyle \ T_{3}\ } denotes the weak isospin of the fermions, Q their electric charge and Q W {\displaystyle \ Q_{\mathsf {W}}\ } their weak charge . These couplings amount to  essentially left chiral for neutrinos and axial for charged leptons .

The Z boson can couple to any Standard Model particle, except gluons and photons ( sterile neutrinos would also be an exception, if they were found to exist). However, any interaction between two charged particles that can occur via the exchange of a virtual Z boson can also occur via the exchange of a virtual photon . Unless the interacting particles have energies on the order of the Z boson mass (91 GeV) or higher, the virtual Z boson exchange has an effect of a tiny correction, ( E / M Z ) 2 , {\displaystyle \ (E/M_{\mathrm {Z} })^{2}\ ,} to the amplitude of the electromagnetic process.

Particle accelerators with energies necessary to observe neutral current interactions and to measure the mass of Z boson weren't available until 1983.

On the other hand, Z boson interactions involving neutrinos have distinctive signatures: They provide the only known mechanism for elastic scattering of neutrinos in matter; neutrinos are almost as likely to scatter elastically (via Z boson exchange) as inelastically (via W boson exchange), of major experimental significance, in, e.g. , the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory experiment.

Weak neutral currents were predicted by electroweak theory developed mainly by Abdus Salam , John Clive Ward , Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg , [ 3 ] and confirmed shortly thereafter in 1973, in a neutrino experiment in the Gargamelle bubble chamber at CERN .
