This type of definition is often used where the term is difficult to define verbally, either because the words will not be understood (as with children and new speakers of a language) or because of the nature of the term (such as colors or sensations). It is usually accompanied with a gesture pointing to the object serving as an example, and for this reason is also often referred to as " definition by pointing ".

Overview [ edit ] An ostensive definition assumes the  questioner has sufficient understanding to recognize the type of information being given.

Ludwig Wittgenstein writes: So one might say: the ostensive definition explains the use—the meaning—of the word when the overall role of the word in language is clear. Thus if I know that someone means to explain a colour-word to me the ostensive definition "That is called 'sepia' " will help me to understand the word.... One has already to know (or be able to do) something in order to be capable of asking a thing's name. But what does one have to know?

[ 1 ] The limitations of ostensive definition are exploited in a famous argument from Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations (which deal primarily with the philosophy of language ), the private language argument , in which he asks if it is possible to have a private language that no one else can understand.

[ 2 ] John Passmore states that the term was first defined by the British logician William Ernest Johnson (1858–1931): "His neologisms, as rarely happens, have won wide acceptance: such phrases as "ostensive definition", such contrasts as those between ... "determinates" and "determinables", "continuants" and "occurrents", are now familiar in philosophical literature" (Passmore 1966, p. 344.)
