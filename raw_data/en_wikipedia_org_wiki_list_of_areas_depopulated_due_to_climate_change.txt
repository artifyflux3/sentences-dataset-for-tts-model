Satellite imaging of Cartí Sugtupu , Panama in 2022, showing rising sea levels submerging the island and forcing hundreds of indigenous Guna people to relocate.

This article lists several areas, regions, and municipalities that have either been completely or markedly depopulated, or are involved in plans for depopulation or relocation due to anthropogenic climate change . Several factors created or worsened by climate change can be responsible for necessitating managed retreat or the relocation of people and/or infrastructure. These include rising sea levels , increased flooding risk , changes to the makeup of the land (e.g. a habitable area becoming a wetland ), coastal erosion , increased susceptibility to dangerous cyclones , droughts , water shortages , wildfires , and other factors, all of which can overlap with each other to enhance the risk of danger or inhabitability of a formerly populated region.

The lists contain a general number of the number of people moved or at risk of being moved due to climate change-related causes, as well as rough dates for when programs to relocate were first created or for when a climate disaster first caused significant forcible displacement of a population.
