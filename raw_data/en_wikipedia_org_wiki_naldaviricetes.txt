[ 1 ] Members of Naldaviricetes are characterized by large enveloped rod-shaped virions, circular double-stranded DNA genomes, and replication in the nucleus of the host cell. All of them (including the unassigned Polydnaviridae family) share a set of unique genes not found in other viruses, which include the presence of multiple interspersed direct repeats, various subunits of DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase , four late expression factor genes, and infectivity factor genes suggesting a common host entry mechanism.

[ 2 ] Phylogenetics [ edit ] These viruses encompass several genes that are distantly related to core genes of the Nucleocytoviricota and thus could be highly derived members of the DJR-MCP viruses (kingdom Bamfordvirae of the realm Varidnaviria ), despite the absence of the DJR-MCP and formation of odd-shaped virions. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis of several essential genes that are shared by all these arthoropod viruses and the Nucleocytoviricota , such as PolB, RNAP subunits, helicase-primase and thiol oxidoreductase, has suggested that this group of viruses might be a highly derived offshoot of the Nucleocytoviricota .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Classification [ edit ] Naldaviricetes contains one order and a family unassigned to an order. This taxonomy is shown hereafter: [ 1 ] Class: Naldaviricetes Order: Lefavirales Unassigned family: Nimaviridae The unassigned family Polydnaviridae is a potential member of the group because they share the characteristic genes of Naldaviricetes and appear to have evolved from nudiviruses of the order Lefavirales .
