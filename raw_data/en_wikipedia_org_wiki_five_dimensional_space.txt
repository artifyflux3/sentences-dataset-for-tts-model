( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A 2D orthogonal projection of a 5-cube A five-dimensional (5D) space is a mathematical or physical concept referring to a space that has five independent dimensions . In physics and geometry, such a space extends the familiar three spatial dimensions plus time (4D spacetime) by introducing an additional degree of freedom, which is often used to model advanced theories such as higher-dimensional gravity, extra spatial directions, or connections between different points in spacetime.

Concepts [ edit ] Concepts related to five-dimensional spaces include super-dimensional or hyper-dimensional spaces, which generally refer to any space with more than four dimensions. These ideas appear in theoretical physics , cosmology , and science fiction to explore phenomena beyond ordinary perception.

Important related topics include: 5-manifold — a generalization of a surface or volume to five dimensions.

5-cube — also called a penteract, a specific five-dimensional hypercube.

Hypersphere — the generalization of a sphere to higher dimensions, including five-dimensional space.

List of regular 5-polytopes — regular geometric shapes that exist in five-dimensional space.

Four-dimensional space — a foundational step to understanding five-dimensional extensions.

Five-dimensional Euclidean geometry [ edit ] 5D Euclidean geometry designated by the mathematical sign: E {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} } 5 [ 1 ] is dimensions beyond two ( planar ) and three ( solid ). Shapes studied in five dimensions include counterparts of regular polyhedra and of the sphere .

Polytopes [ edit ] Main article: 5-polytope In five or more dimensions, only three regular polytopes exist. In five dimensions, they are: The 5-simplex of the simplex family, {3,3,3,3}, with 6 vertices, 15 edges, 20 faces (each an equilateral triangle ), 15 cells (each a regular tetrahedron ), and 6 hypercells (each a 5-cell ).

The 5-cube of the hypercube family, {4,3,3,3}, with 32 vertices, 80 edges, 80 faces (each a square ), 40 cells (each a cube ), and 10 hypercells (each a tesseract ).

The 5-orthoplex of the cross polytope family, {3,3,3,4}, with 10 vertices, 40 edges, 80 faces (each a triangle ), 80 cells (each a tetrahedron ), and 32 hypercells (each a 5-cell ).

An important uniform 5-polytope is the 5-demicube , h{4,3,3,3} has half the vertices of the 5-cube (16), bounded by alternating 5-cell and 16-cell hypercells. The expanded or stericated 5-simplex is the vertex figure of the A 5 lattice , . It and has a doubled symmetry from its symmetric Coxeter diagram. The kissing number of the lattice, 30, is represented in its vertices.

[ 2 ] The rectified 5-orthoplex is the vertex figure of the D 5 lattice , . Its 40 vertices represent the kissing number of the lattice and the highest for dimension 5.

The time dimension is mathematically distinguished from the spatial dimensions by a modification in the formula for computing the "distance" between events. Ordinary Minkowski spacetime has four dimensions in all, three of space and one of time. However, higher-dimensional generalizations of the concept have been employed in various proposals.

Kaluza–Klein theory , a speculative attempt to develop a unified theory of gravity and electromagnetism , relied upon a spacetime with four dimensions of space and one of time.

[ 4 ] Geometries can also be constructed in which the coordinates are something other than real numbers. For example, one can define a space in which the points are labeled by tuples of 5 complex numbers . This is often denoted C 5 {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{5}} . In quantum information theory , quantum systems described by quantum states belonging to C 5 {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{5}} are sometimes called ququints.
