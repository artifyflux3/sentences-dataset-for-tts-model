Press Doctoral students Arlie Petters Julianne Dalcanton Hiranya Peiris Shirley Ho [ 1 ] Blake Daniel Sherwin William Coulton [ 2 ] Katharine R. Long [ 3 ] David Nathaniel Spergel is an American theoretical astrophysicist and the Emeritus Charles A. Young Professor of Astronomy on the Class of 1897 Foundation at Princeton University . Since 2021, he has been the President of the Simons Foundation .

[ 5 ] He is known for his work on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) project. In 2022, Spergel accepted the chair of NASA's UAP independent study team .

Early life and education [ edit ] Spergel was born to a Jewish family [ 6 ] in Rochester , New York . His father, Martin Spergel, was also a physicist and a professor at York College , City University of New York ; he died in 2021.

[ 7 ] His mother was a high school home-economics teacher.

[ 8 ] The junior Spergel attended John Glenn High School in Huntington, New York .

[ 9 ] He has a brother and a sister.

[ 10 ] He considered his father, who had "a really satisfying career as a college teacher" a role model, especially the aspect of his father's work in mentoring students who were "first in their family" to attend college.

[ 8 ] Spergel graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts (AB) from Princeton University in 1982, [ 11 ] after completing a senior thesis on red giants under the supervision of Gillian R. Knapp .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] He then went to the University of Oxford as a visiting scholar in 1983, where he studied with James Binney .

[ 11 ] He obtained his Master of Arts (AM) in 1984 and his PhD in 1985, both from Harvard University .

[ 13 ] Career [ edit ] At the invitation of John N. Bahcall , Spergel joined the Institute for Advanced Studies after his PhD . He left and moved to Princeton University in 1987 as an assistant professor .

[ 6 ] [ 10 ] [ 14 ] He was promoted to associate professor in 1992 and full professor in 1997. In 2007, he was appointed the Charles A. Young Professor of Astronomy on the Class of 1897 Foundation.

[ 11 ] Spergel joined the Flatiron Institute in 2016 as the founding director of the Center for Computational Astrophysics.

[ 15 ] Citing the hesitance to hold onto 2 positions, [ 6 ] he retired from Princeton University in 2019 at the age of 59, and has remained as emeritus professor since.

[ 16 ] Spergel is a 2001 MacArthur Fellow , [ 13 ] and was a member of the NASA Advisory Council and chair of the Space Studies Board.

[ 17 ] He was the Keck Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study from 2000 to 2001.

[ 11 ] Since 1994, Spergel is part of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) project consortium.

[ 10 ] [ 18 ] Currently, he is a member of the Simons Observatory , [ 19 ] chairs the Science Definition Team of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly known as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope), [ 20 ] and sits on the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie Institution for Science (since 2022).

[ 21 ] In 2022, Spergel was invited to lead NASA's UAP independent study team of sixteen members to provide guidance in better understanding "unidentified anomalous phenomena".

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] Honors and awards [ edit ] Helen B. Warner Prize for Astronomy (1994) [ 24 ] Member of the National Academy of Sciences (2007) [ 25 ] Shaw Prize in Astronomy (2010) [ 26 ] Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2012) [ 4 ] 25 Most Influential Space Scientists, Time (2012) [ 27 ] Nature's 10 (2014) [ 28 ] Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics (2015) [ 29 ] NASA Exceptional Public Service Medal (2017) [ 30 ] Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics (2018) [ 31 ] Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society (2020) [ 32 ] NASA Exceptional Public Service Medal (2022) (received the second time) [ 17 ] American Philosophical Society (2022) [ 33 ] Nikolaos Kylafis Lecturer (2024) [1] References [ edit ] ^ "David Nathaniel Spergel" .
