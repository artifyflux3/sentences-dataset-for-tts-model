(zoology) Dodson Peter Dodson (born August 20, 1946) is an American paleontologist who has published many papers and written and collaborated on books about dinosaurs . An authority on Ceratopsians , he has also authored several papers and textbooks on hadrosaurs and sauropods , and is a co-editor of The Dinosauria , widely considered the definitive scholarly reference on dinosaurs. Dodson described Avaceratops in 1986; Suuwassea in 2004, and many others, while his students have named Paralititan and Auroraceratops . He has conducted field research in Canada, the United States, India, Madagascar, Egypt, Argentina, and China. A professor of vertebrate paleontology and of veterinary anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania , Dodson has also taught courses in geology, history, history and sociology of science , and religious studies. Dodson is also a research associate at the Academy of Natural Sciences . In 2001, two former students named an ancient frog species, Nezpercius dodsoni , after him (as well as after the Native American Nez Perce people ).

[ 1 ] Dodson has also been skeptical to the theory of a dinosaurian origin of birds , [ 2 ] but more recently has come down on the side of this theory.

Religious views [ edit ] Describing himself as a "deeply committed Christian," [ 3 ] Dodson is a Roman Catholic [ 4 ] [ 5 ] who subscribes to theistic evolution and has argued that there is no real conflict between religion and science , writing that: "I have found little if anything to support or necessitate the warlike antagonism between science and religion pictured by Dawkins and like-minded scientists, who are animated by motives other than pure, disinterested science." [ 3 ] Dodson has written numerous essays on the topic of religious belief and science, and has served on the Board of Directors for the nonprofit New York City-based Metanexus Institute .
