With a population of 148,620 and a metropolitan area of 662,057, [ 6 ] it is the fifth-most populated city and 13th-most populated municipality in the state of New York .

[ a ] Formally established in 1820, Syracuse was named after the classical Greek city Syracuse ( Siracusa in Italian), a city on the eastern coast of the Italian island of Sicily , for its similar natural features. Surrounding brine springs made the city a major producer of commercial salt into the late 19th century, earning the nickname "The Salt City"; it subsequently became a major industrial center until the mid-20th century, and has since become a hub for higher education, research, and services.

Syracuse has historically functioned as a major crossroads in the state, first between the Erie Canal and its branches, then of the New York Central Railroad network established in the mid 19th century. Today, the city is at the intersection of Interstates 81 and 90 , and its airport is the largest in Central New York , a five-county region of over one million inhabitants.

Syracuse is the economic and educational hub of Central New York. It hosts a number of convention sites, including a large downtown convention complex , and is home to prominent institutions such as Syracuse University , SUNY Upstate Medical University , SUNY ESF , Le Moyne College and Onondaga Community College .

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Syracuse, New York French missionaries were the first Europeans to come to this area, arriving to work with and convert the Native Americans in the mid-17th century. At the invitation of the Onondaga Nation , one of the five nations of the Iroquois Confederacy , a Jesuit priest by the name of Simon Le Moyne , accompanied by soldiers and coureurs des bois , including Pierre Esprit Radisson , set up a mission, known as Ste. Marie de Gannentaha , on the northeast shore of Onondaga Lake .

Jesuit missionaries reported salty brine springs around the southern end of what they referred to as "Salt Lake", known today as Onondaga Lake in honor of the historic tribe. French fur traders established trade throughout the New York area among the Iroquois. Dutch and English colonists also were traders, and the English nominally claimed the area, from their upstate base at Albany, New York . During the American Revolutionary War , the highly decentralized Iroquois divided into groups and bands that supported the British, and two tribes that supported the American-born rebels, or patriots.

Settlers came into central and western New York from eastern parts of the state and New England after the American Revolutionary War and various treaties with and land sales by Native American tribes.

[ 7 ] The subsequent designation of this area by the state of New York as the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation provided the basis for commercial salt production. Such production took place from the late 1700s through the early 1900s. Brine from wells that tapped into halite (common salt) beds in the Salina shale near Tully, New York , 15 miles south of the city, was developed in the 19th century.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] It is the north-flowing brine from Tully that is the source of salt for the "salty springs" found along the shoreline of Onondaga Lake. The rapid development of this industry in the 18th and 19th centuries led to the nicknaming of this area as "The Salt City".

The original settlement of Syracuse was a conglomeration of several small towns and villages and was not recognized with a post office by the United States Government . Establishing the post office was delayed because the settlement did not have a name. Joshua Forman wanted to name the village Corinth . When John Wilkinson applied for a post office in that name in 1820, it was denied because the same name was already in use in Saratoga County, New York .

[ 10 ] Having read a poetic description of Syracuse, Sicily (Siracusa), Wilkinson saw similarities to the lake and salt springs of this area, which had both "salt and freshwater mingling together".

[ 11 ] On February 4, 1820, Wilkinson proposed the name "Syracuse" to a group of fellow townsmen; it became the name of the village and the new post office.

[ 12 ] The first Solvay Process Company plant in the United States was erected on the southwestern shore of Onondaga Lake in 1884. The village was called Solvay to commemorate the inventor Ernest Solvay . In 1861, he developed the ammonia-soda process for the manufacture of soda ash (anhydrous sodium carbonate) from brine wells dug in the southern end of Tully valley (as a source of sodium chloride) and limestone (as a source of calcium carbonate). The process was an improvement over the earlier Leblanc process. The Syracuse Solvay plant was the incubator for a large chemical industry complex owned by Allied Signal in Syracuse. While this industry stimulated development and provided many jobs in Syracuse, it left Onondaga Lake as the most polluted in the nation.

The salt industry declined after the Civil War , but a new manufacturing industry arose in its place. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, numerous businesses and stores were established, including the Franklin Automobile Company , which produced the first air-cooled engine in the world; the Century Motor Vehicle Company ; the Smith Corona company; and the Craftsman Workshops, the center of Gustav Stickley 's handmade furniture empire.

On March 24, 1870, Syracuse University was founded. The State of New York granted the new university its own charter, independent of Genesee College , which had unsuccessfully tried to move to Syracuse the year before.

[ 13 ] The university was founded as coeducational. President Peck stated at the opening ceremonies, "The conditions of admission shall be equal to all persons.... There shall be no invidious discrimination here against woman.... Brains and heart shall have a fair chance...." [ 14 ] Syracuse implemented this policy and attracted a high proportion of women students. In the College of Liberal Arts, the ratio between male and female students during the 19th century was approximately even. The College of Fine Arts was predominantly female, and a low ratio of women enrolled in the College of Medicine and the College of Law.

1908 The first New York State Fair was held in Syracuse in 1841.

[ 15 ] Between 1842 and 1889, the Fair was held among 11 New York cities before finding a permanent home in Syracuse. It has been an annual event since then, except between 1942 and 1947, when the grounds were used as a military base during World War II, [ 15 ] and in 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic .

As part of the racial incidents happening all over the country during the 1919 Red Summer , on July 31, 1919, there was a violent riot between white and black workers of the Syracuse Globe Malleable Iron Works.

Syracuse is home to the only "green on top" traffic light . The "green on top" traffic light was installed in 1928 as a result of local youths throwing rocks at the "British red" light that was originally on top. These locals became known as "stonethrowers" and the neighborhood now has the Tipperary Hill Heritage Memorial on the corner of Tompkins Street and Milton Avenue to commemorate this history.

[ 16 ] World War II stimulated significant industrial expansion in the area: of specialty steel, fasteners, and custom machining. After the war, two of the Big Three automobile manufacturers ( General Motors and Chrysler ) had major operations in the area. Syracuse was also headquarters for Carrier Corporation , and Crouse-Hinds manufactured traffic signals in the city.

General Electric , with its headquarters in Schenectady to the east, had its main television manufacturing plant at Electronics Parkway in Syracuse.

The manufacturing industry in Syracuse began to falter in the 1970s, as the industry restructured nationwide. Many small businesses failed during this time, which contributed to the already increasing unemployment rate. Rockwell International moved its factory outside New York state. General Electric moved its television manufacturing operations to Suffolk, Virginia , and later offshore to Asia. The Carrier Corporation moved its headquarters out of Syracuse, relocated its manufacturing operations out of state, and outsourced some of its production to Asian facilities. Although the city population has declined since 1950, the Syracuse metropolitan area population has remained fairly stable, growing by 2.5% since 1970. While this growth rate is greater than much of Upstate New York, it is far below the national average during that period.

The Syracuse Community Grid project is a 2023 highway teardown project taking place in Downtown Syracuse, with the goal of improving the city.

[ 17 ] Historic Clinton Square Erie Canal in Syracuse Salina Street Fayette Street Geography [ edit ] Syracuse is located at 43°2′49″N 76°8′40″W ﻿ / ﻿ 43.04694°N 76.14444°W ﻿ / 43.04694; -76.14444 (43.046899, −76.144423).

[ 18 ] It is located about 87 miles (140 km) east of Rochester , 150 miles (240 km) east of Buffalo , and 145 miles (230 km) west of the state capital, Albany . It is also the halfway point between New York City and Toronto , about 245 miles (390 km) from each, Toronto to the northwest and NYC to the southeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 66 square kilometres (25.6 square miles), of which 65 square kilometres (25.1 square miles) is land and 1.6 square kilometres (0.6 square miles) (2.15%) water.

The city developed at the northeast corner of the Finger Lakes region. The city has many neighborhoods that were originally independent villages, which joined the city over the years. Although the central part of Syracuse is flat, many of its neighborhoods are on small hills such as University Hill and Tipperary Hill . Land to the north of Syracuse is generally flat, while land to the south is hilly.

About 27% of Syracuse's land area is covered by 890,000 trees — a higher percentage than in Albany , Rochester , or Buffalo . The Labor Day Storm of 1998 was a derecho that destroyed approximately 30,000 trees. The sugar maple accounts for 14.2% of Syracuse's trees, followed by the Northern white cedar (9.8%) and the European buckthorn (6.8%). The most common street tree is the Norway maple (24.3%), followed by the honey locust (9.3%).

The densest tree cover in Syracuse is in the two Valley neighborhoods, where 46.6% of the land is covered by trees. The lowest tree cover percentage is found in the densely developed downtown , which has only 4.6% trees.

[ 19 ] Syracuse's main water source is Skaneateles Lake , one of the country's cleanest lakes, [ 20 ] located 15 mi (24 km) southwest of the city. Water from nearby Onondaga Lake is not potable due to industrial dumping that spanned many decades, leaving the lake heavily polluted.

[ 21 ] Incoming water is left unfiltered, [ 22 ] and chlorine is added to prevent bacterial growth. Most of the environmental work to achieve lake cleanup was scheduled to be completed by 2016; however Honeywell , the company tasked with the cleanup, announced the project's completion in late 2017.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] For periods of drought, there is also a backup line which uses water from Lake Ontario .

[ 25 ] Onondaga Creek , a waterway that runs through downtown, flows northward through the city. The Onondaga Creekwalk borders this, connecting the Lakefront , Inner Harbor , Franklin Square and Armory Square neighborhoods. The creek continues through the Valley and ultimately to the Onondaga Nation . The creek is navigable, but it can be a challenge. Its channelized nature speeds up its flow, particularly in the spring, when it may be dangerous. After some youngsters drowned in the creek, some residential areas fenced-off the creek in their neighborhoods.

( July 2018 ) The 26 Syracuse neighborhoods Further information: 15th Ward The City of Syracuse officially recognizes 26 neighborhoods within its boundaries. Some of these have small additional neighborhoods and districts inside of them. In addition, Syracuse also owns and operates Syracuse Hancock International Airport on the territory of four towns north of the city.

Syracuse's neighborhoods reflect the historically ethnic and multicultural population. Traditionally, Irish, Polish and Ukrainian Americans settled on its west side (see Tipperary Hill ); Jewish Americans on its east side; German and Italian Americans on the north side; and African-Americans on its south side. In recent years, large numbers of refugees from the Middle East have settled mainly on the north side as well.

Climate [ edit ] Syracuse's weather averages Syracuse has a hot-summer humid continental climate ( Dfa ), as mean July temperatures are just above the 71.6 °F (22.0 °C) threshold needed for a hot-summer climate. The city is known for its high snowfall, 115.6 inches (2.94 meters) on average; [ 26 ] Syracuse receives the most annual average snow of any metropolitan area in the United States.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Syracuse usually wins the Golden Snowball Award among Upstate cities. Its record seasonal (July 1 to June 30 of the following year) snowfall so far is 192.1 in (4.88 m) during the winter of 1992–93, while the snowiest calendar month was January 2004, with 78.1 in (1.98 m) accumulated.

[ 29 ] The high snowfall is a result of the city receiving both heavy snow from the lake effect of nearby Lake Ontario (of the Great Lakes) and nor'easter snow from storms driven from the Atlantic Ocean. Snow most often falls in small (about 1–3 inches or 2.5–7.6 centimetres), almost daily doses, over a period of several days. Larger snowfalls do occur occasionally, and even more so in the northern suburbs.

The Blizzard of 1993 was described as the Storm of the Century. Some 42.9 in (109 cm) fell on the city within 48 hours, with 35.6 in (90 cm) falling within the first 24 hours. Syracuse received more snow than any other city in the country during this storm, which shattered a total of eight local records, including the most snow in a single snowstorm.

[ 30 ] A second notable snowfall was the Blizzard of 1966 , with 42.3 in (107 cm). The Blizzard of '58 occurred in February (16–17th) across Oswego and Onondaga counties. This storm was classified as a blizzard due to the high winds, blowing snow, and cold; 26.1 in (66 cm) of snow was measured at Syracuse and drifts reached 20 ft (6.1 m) in Oswego County. (See Thirtieth Publication of the Oswego County Historical Society, (1969) and The Climate and Snow Climatology of Oswego N.Y., (1971) Syracuse on average receives an annual precipitation of 38.47 inches (977 millimeters), with the months of July through September being the wettest in terms of total precipitation, [ 29 ] while precipitation occurs on more days each month during the snow season.

[ 31 ] The normal monthly mean temperature ranges from 23.6 °F (−4.7 °C) in January to 71.3 °F (21.8 °C) in July.

[ 29 ] The record high of 102 °F (39 °C) was recorded on July 9, 1936, and the record low of −26 °F (−32 °C) has occurred three times since 1942, the last being February 18, 1979.

[ 29 ] In the early 21st century, a handful of previous heat records have been broken in the city. For example, July 2020 became the hottest month on record, with a mean temperature of 77.1 °F (25.1 °C), while the summers (June–August) of 2005, 2020, and 2012 were, respectively, the hottest, second-hottest, and third-hottest summers on record.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Additionally, 2017 and 2018 saw consecutive monthly high temperature records broken in February, of 71 °F (22 °C) on February 24, 2017, [ 34 ] and 75 °F (24 °C) on February 21, 2018, [ 35 ] in addition to four consecutive days at or above 60 °F (16 °C).

[ 34 ] The latter was the warmest winter day on record.

[ 93 ] Six major full-power stations serve the city: WSTM-TV 3 ( NBC ), WTVH 5 ( CBS ), WSYR-TV 9 ( ABC ), WCNY-TV 24/cable 11 ( PBS ), WSPX-TV 56/cable 4 ( Ion ), and WSYT 68/cable 8 ( Fox ). WSTM-TV also operates the area's CW affiliate on its DT2 subchannel and cable channel 6, and WSYT carries the MyNetworkTV affiliation on channel 43 and cable channel 7; both stations were previously separately - licensed stations before having their licenses returned to the FCC .

Additionally, networks such as Cornerstone Television channel 11 & 22, Univision , and MTV2 are broadcast by low-power television stations .

[ 94 ] Syracuse University 's student-run TV station is CitrusTV . CitrusTV programming is broadcast on the university campus on the Orange Television Network.

Syracuse's cable television provider is Charter Spectrum (Charter Communications acquired Time Warner Cable in 2016), which, as a part of its regular and digital offerings, provides a 24-hour local news channel ( Spectrum News Central New York ), public access channel , and an additional PBS channel. Several suburbs also have access to Verizon Fios for cable television.

Dish Network and DirecTV also provide local satellite television subscribers with local broadcast stations.

Newspapers [ edit ] Syracuse has one major daily morning newspaper, The Post-Standard . Until 2001, Syracuse also had an evening paper, The Herald-Journal . It focuses on local news throughout Central New York, and has a reporter in Washington, DC.

Before the merger with the evening paper, the Post-Standard was named among the "10 best newspapers in America with a circulation of under 100,000" by Al Neuharth of USA Today (run by a competing organization). Since the merger, circulation has increased to over 120,000. Even outside of its four-county delivery area, the paper is available in many convenience stores and supermarkets from the Canada–US border to the New York– Pennsylvania border. The newspaper partly caters to this audience as well, covering many stories from the Ithaca , Utica , and Watertown areas. Since opening a new printing press in 2002, the paper calls itself "America's Most Colorful Newspaper," as almost every page contains color.

The Daily Orange , the newspaper of Syracuse University and SUNY ESF students, is read by over 20,000 people daily, and is widely distributed in the University Hill neighborhood and Armory Square .

The Dolphin , the weekly student newspaper of Le Moyne College is also available, read mainly by Le Moyne students.

There are other popular free newspapers, including Eagle Newspaper ' s downtown edition, the City Eagle , and Table Hopping , which focuses on the restaurant and entertainment scene. Additionally, a weekly newspaper, CNY Vision, publishes news and information focusing on Syracuse's African American community.

A Hispanic-based monthly publication, called the CNY Latino newspaper, is published in Syracuse by the CNY Latino Media Consortium in both paper and online formats, and covers an area from Rochester to Albany and Watertown to Binghamton.

The Daily Orange Magazines [ edit ] The Syracuse area is covered in a regional lifestyle publication called The Good Life, Central New York Magazine , mostly known as Central New York Magazine . The magazine is bi-monthly (six issues per year) and offers print + digital and digital only subscriptions; it covers the greater Syracuse and Central New York area.

Central New York Magazine premiered in May 2006 and tells "positive and uniquely CNY stories." Coverage areas include local shops and small businesses, regional travel destinations, food and drink, home décor, attractions and things to do, artisans, changemakers, and area trends.

Infrastructure [ edit ] Transportation [ edit ] Public transit [ edit ] Syracuse is served by the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority , or Centro. Centro operates bus service in Syracuse and its suburbs, as well as to outlying metropolitan area cities such as Auburn , Fulton , and Oswego .

Proposed public transit projects In 2005, local millionaire Tom McDonald proposed an aerial tramway system, called Salt City Aerial Transit (S.C.A.T.), to link the university to the transportation center. The first segment from Syracuse University to downtown was estimated to cost $5 million, which McDonald planned to raise himself. Due to perceived low operating costs, the system was envisioned as running continuously.

[ 95 ] Rail [ edit ] Syracuse ( station stop code SYR) is served by Amtrak 's Empire Service , Lake Shore Limited , and Maple Leaf lines. Amtrak's station is part of the William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center .

The Empire Service runs twice daily in each direction between Niagara Falls, NY and New York Penn Station , with major stops in Buffalo , Rochester , Syracuse, Utica , and Albany along the way. The Maple Leaf runs once daily in each direction, and follows the same route as the Empire Service, however instead of terminating in Niagara Falls, it continues on to Toronto.

Empire Service and Maple Leaf trains stop at the seasonal New York State Fair – NYF station during the New York State Fair 's annual run each August. The NYF Station is located along the southern part of the fairgrounds, near the historic train car display of the Central New York Chapter, of the National Railway Historical Society .

The Lake Shore Limited runs once daily in each direction between Chicago and Boston or New York City (via two sections splitting Albany-Rensselaer ). It follows the same route as the Empire Service and Maple Leaf between New York City and Buffalo-Depew , where it diverges and continues on through Cleveland and Toledo to Chicago.

A regional commuter rail service, OnTrack , was active from 1994 until it was discontinued in 2007 due to low ridership. Its sole route connected the Carousel Center to southern Syracuse, often extending to Jamesville in the summer.

Bus [ edit ] Greyhound Lines , Megabus , OurBus , and Trailways provide long-distance bus service to destinations including New York City, Boston, Buffalo, Albany, and Toronto. Greyhound, Megabus, and Trailways use the William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center in the northern area of the city, while OurBus stops near the campus of Syracuse University.

Air service [ edit ] Syracuse is served by the Syracuse Hancock International Airport in nearby Salina , near Mattydale . The airport is named after Clarence E. Hancock , a former US Congressman representing Syracuse. The airport is served by 8 major airlines, which provide non-stop flights to important airline hubs and business centers such as Atlanta , Boston , Charlotte , Chicago, Detroit, Denver , Ft. Lauderdale , New York City , Orlando , Philadelphia , Tampa , Washington, DC, as well as connecting service to 147 foreign cities in 87 countries. Cargo carriers FedEx and UPS also serve the airport.

New York City can be reached in under an hour flight. The City of Syracuse owns the airport and property, while a public for-benefit corporation runs the airport, the Syracuse Regional Airport Authority. The airport is protected by the 174th Attack Wing's Fire Department, and patrolled by Syracuse Airport Police Department Officers.

Major highways and roads [ edit ] Interstate 81 runs north–south through Syracuse, and provides access to Canada, Pennsylvania and points south. Its downtown portion is extremely narrow, only consisting of four lanes and few onramps. The highway was known as the Penn-Can Expressway when first built, leading to the Penn-Can Mall and other similarly named developments. It will soon be rerouted to follow I-481's route around the city instead of going through downtown. The current route will be designated as Interstate 81 Business.

[ 96 ] Interstate 90 , signed as the New York State Thruway within New York State, runs east–west, just north of the city. It is a toll highway that provides access to Rochester , Buffalo , Albany , and the north–south ( Interstate 87 ) part of the Thruway leads to New York City .

Interstate 690 runs east–west through the city, and provides access to Interstate 90, as well as to Syracuse's northwestern and eastern suburbs. A spur off I-690 directly west of the city, NY 695 , provides freeway access to the southwestern suburbs. It meets Interstate 81 in downtown Syracuse in a highly complex and incomplete intersection. Most of its routing through the city directly replaced the former elevated rail lines of the New York Central four-track mainline , a fact quite notable by the city's former main rail terminal, where the freeway spans the width between the terminal and its outermost platform. In 1981, artist Duke Epolito erected sculptures of "passengers" on the single remaining passenger platform. The piece is entitled "Waiting for the Night Train." [ 97 ] Interstate 481 forms an eastern loop around the city and continues to the northwest as NY 481 to Fulton and Oswego , on the shore of Lake Ontario . The highway was built to provide rapid access to eastern suburbs after the affluent community members in Manlius and Fayetteville squashed the original design to extend Interstate 690 to serve the eastern suburbs. The highway is soon to be replaced in designation by Interstate 81.

[ 96 ] Community Grid In late May, 2023, The Community Grid project was officially approved for construction in the Syracuse. The highly controversial plan consists of removing the I-81 viaduct that runs through the downtown of the city, and replacing it with the Boulevard style Business Loop-81. The heavily congested Interstate-81 will be re-routed around the city onto the already existing Interstate-481 . This project is estimated to cost around 2.25 billion dollars, and will be completed over a multi-year process.

[ 98 ] Construction has already begun in portions of North Syracuse at the I-81 and I-481 interchange.

[ 99 ] Two US Highways run through the Syracuse area: U.S. Highway 11 ( Route 223 in Quebec to New Orleans ) runs north–south through Syracuse, including downtown, and it follows Salina, State, and Wolf Streets.

U.S. Highway 20 (Boston to Newport, Oregon ) passes south of Syracuse.

New York State Route Expressways: New York State Route 481 travels from NY 104 in Oswego to the terminus of Interstate 481 north of Syracuse.

New York State Route 690 was built as an extension of Interstate 690 to serve the northwest suburbs of Syracuse. The route is a four-lane divided highway from its southern end at I-690, where it meets Interstate 90 (NYS Thruway), to its end northwest of Baldwinsville in Lysander at NY 48 and NY 631 .

New York State Route 695 is a short state highway west of Syracuse in the village of Solvay in Onondaga County . The number of the highway was derived from the two highways that NY 695 links, Interstate 690 and NY 5.

New York State Routes New York State Route 5 runs east–west through Syracuse, including downtown, and follows Erie Boulevard and West Genesee Street.

New York State Route 80 's western terminus is at NY 175 on the south side. The route follows Valley Drive.

New York State Route 92 's western terminus is in downtown Syracuse at US 11. The route follows East Genesee Street.

New York State Route 173 runs east–west through Syracuse and follows the Seneca Turnpike through the South Valley neighborhood.

New York State Route 175 follows South Avenue and West Kennedy Street to its eastern terminus at US 11.

New York State Route 290 's western terminus is at US 11 just north of I-81. The route follows James Street.

New York State Route 298 's western terminus is at exit 9 on I-690. The route follows Bear and Court Streets, Genant Drive and Sunset Avenue.

New York State Route 370 's eastern terminus is at US 11 in the Lakefront neighborhood. The route follows Park Street.

New York State Route 598 is a short north–south highway following Midler Avenue to its southern terminus at NY 5.

Public works [ edit ] Public services such as garbage pickup, street plowing, sewage, and street and traffic maintenance are provided by the Department of Public Works (DPW).

[ 100 ] Utilities [ edit ] The Syracuse water system was one of the few water systems built and operated before federal funding. The water system was constructed mainly to support the industries around Syracuse, New York. Construction of Syracuse's water system began in 1868.

[ 101 ] The water is brought in on a gravity fed system from Skaneateles Lake , through an unfiltered system, and carried into the city. It is noted for having some of the best drinking water in the nation, [ 102 ] due to the quality of the lake.

In 2015, the city experienced an average of at least one water main break per day. Between 2005 and 2015, the city suffered 2,000 water main breaks. Mayor Stephanie Miner estimated of the cost to fix the city's water infrastructure at $1 billion over a 10–15-year period.

[ 103 ] On February 25, 2015, Miner testified before a joint hearing of the state Assembly Ways and Means Committee and state Senate Finance Committee. Miner testified that the 2014 polar vortex contributed to the increase in Syracuse's water main break.

[ 104 ] On March 3, the 100th water main break in Syracuse in 2015 occurred on James Street.

[ 105 ] Early in 2015, Miner lobbied the state for funding to fix the city's aging water system. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declined to help, stating that the city should improve its economy and increase tax revenues, which would enable the city to fund their own water pipe repairs.

[ 106 ] Police department [ edit ] The Syracuse Police Department (SPD) is the principal law enforcement agency of the city of Syracuse, New York.

[ 107 ] For 2017–18, the police department budget was $48.5 million (equivalent to $59.3 million in 2023).

[ 108 ] Effective April 22, 2022, longtime Deputy Chief Joe Cecile is Chief of the SPD, following his predecessor Kenton Buckner's retirement.

[ 109 ] Police headquarters is in the John C. Dillon Public Safety Building at 511 South State Street.

[ 110 ] The SPD is divided into three patrol zones North (Lakefront, Northside, Eastwood, Tip Hill), South West (Strathmore, Valley, Southside, Near-Westside), and Southeast (University Area, Downtown, Meadowbrook, Eastside).

[ 111 ] In 2019, a jury awarded Elijah Johnson $35,000 (equivalent to $43,045.03 in 2024) after he was beaten with unreasonable force by three police officers while being arrested. In addition, the city was forced to pay attorneys fees, at a total cost to taxpayers of $213,000.

[ 112 ] In 2024, Officer John Tassini was Syracuse’s top paid employee earning a total of $282,000.

[ 113 ] Surveillance [ edit ] Established in 2011, SPD operates a network of 521 [ 114 ] surveillance cameras called the Criminal Observation and Protection System (COPS).

[ 115 ] [ 116 ] Between 2011 and 2014 more than 40 utility pole mounted cameras were installed, mainly in the Southwest and Northeast neighborhoods.

[ 117 ] The cameras were funded by federal, state, and private grants. In Summer 2014, 10 cameras were approved for installation in Downtown Syracuse , the first area not targeted because of high levels of violent crime.

[ 118 ] Live monitoring of Clinton Square for suspicious people during events and festivals was planned, although police agreed to a prohibition on the use of cameras to monitor protests.

[ 119 ] Twenty-five additional cameras were planned to be installed in 2016.

[ 116 ] In spring 2017, the surveillance system was augmented with the installation of ShotSpotter gunshot detection sensors. Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner cited increasing public acceptance of police cameras and lower technology costs as factors in the decision.

[ 120 ] Fire department [ edit ] The Syracuse Fire Department (SFD) has the responsibility of protecting the City of Syracuse from fires and other dangers. The department provides multiple services in addition to fire related calls: multi-county regional HAZ-MAT response, first response to medical and trauma calls, unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) capabilities, and teams experienced in high-angle rope, swift water, and confined space rescue operations. The Chief of Fire is Michael J. Monds.

[ 121 ] SFD headquarters is in the John C. Dillon Public Safety Building at 511 South State Street.

[ 110 ] The department has a Class 1 rating from the Insurance Services Office , which is the best rating obtainable. This rating has a direct effect on the fire insurance of properties within the city. The SFD operates out of 11 fire stations, organized into three districts (akin to battalions), located throughout the city. The SFD currently maintains nine engine companies (operating with nine corresponding "mini" units), five truck companies, one heavy rescue company, a manpower-squad company, and several special and support units. The department also provides Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting ARFF coverage and specialized fire, rescue, medical, and hazardous materials coverage to the Syracuse Hancock International Airport (station 4).
