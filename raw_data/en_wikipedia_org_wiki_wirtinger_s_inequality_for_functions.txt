In the mathematical field of analysis , the Wirtinger inequality is an important inequality for functions of a single variable, named after Wilhelm Wirtinger . It was used by Adolf Hurwitz in 1901 to give a new proof of the isoperimetric inequality for curves in the plane.  A variety of closely related results are today known as Wirtinger's inequality, all of which can be viewed as certain forms of the Poincaré inequality .

Theorem [ edit ] There are several inequivalent versions of the Wirtinger inequality: Let y be a continuous and differentiable function on the interval [0, L ] with average value zero and with y (0) = y ( L ) . Then ∫ ∫ 0 L y ( x ) 2 d x ≤ ≤ L 2 4 π π 2 ∫ ∫ 0 L y ′ ( x ) 2 d x , {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{L}y(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x\leq {\frac {L^{2}}{4\pi ^{2}}}\int _{0}^{L}y'(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x,} and equality holds if and only if y ( x ) = c sin ⁠ 2π( x − α) / L ⁠ for some numbers c and α .

[ 1 ] Let y be a continuous and differentiable function on the interval [0, L ] with y (0) = y ( L ) = 0 . Then ∫ ∫ 0 L y ( x ) 2 d x ≤ ≤ L 2 π π 2 ∫ ∫ 0 L y ′ ( x ) 2 d x , {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{L}y(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x\leq {\frac {L^{2}}{\pi ^{2}}}\int _{0}^{L}y'(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x,} and equality holds if and only if y ( x ) = c sin ⁠ π x / L ⁠ for some number c .

[ 1 ] Let y be a continuous and differentiable function on the interval [0, L ] with average value zero. Then ∫ ∫ 0 L y ( x ) 2 d x ≤ ≤ L 2 π π 2 ∫ ∫ 0 L y ′ ( x ) 2 d x .

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{L}y(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x\leq {\frac {L^{2}}{\pi ^{2}}}\int _{0}^{L}y'(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x.} and equality holds if and only if y ( x ) = c cos ⁠ π x / L ⁠ for some number c .

[ 2 ] Despite their differences, these are closely related to one another, as can be seen from the account given below in terms of spectral geometry . They can also all be regarded as special cases of various forms of the Poincaré inequality , with the optimal Poincaré constant identified explicitly. The middle version is also a special case of the Friedrichs inequality , again with the optimal constant identified.

Proofs [ edit ] The three versions of the Wirtinger inequality can all be proved by various means. This is illustrated in the following by a different kind of proof for each of the three Wirtinger inequalities given above. In each case, by a linear change of variables in the integrals involved, there is no loss of generality in only proving the theorem for one particular choice of L .

Fourier series [ edit ] Consider the first Wirtinger inequality given above. Take L to be 2π . Since Dirichlet's conditions are met, we can write y ( x ) = 1 2 a 0 + ∑ ∑ n ≥ ≥ 1 ( a n sin ⁡ ⁡ n x π π + b n cos ⁡ ⁡ n x π π ) , {\displaystyle y(x)={\frac {1}{2}}a_{0}+\sum _{n\geq 1}\left(a_{n}{\frac {\sin nx}{\sqrt {\pi }}}+b_{n}{\frac {\cos nx}{\sqrt {\pi }}}\right),} and the fact that the average value of y is zero means that a 0 = 0 . By Parseval's identity , ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π y ( x ) 2 d x = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ ( a n 2 + b n 2 ) {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }y(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }(a_{n}^{2}+b_{n}^{2})} and ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π y ′ ( x ) 2 d x = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ n 2 ( a n 2 + b n 2 ) {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }y'(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }n^{2}(a_{n}^{2}+b_{n}^{2})} and since the summands are all nonnegative, the Wirtinger inequality is proved. Furthermore, it is seen that equality holds if and only if a n = b n = 0 for all n ≥ 2 , which is to say that y ( x ) = a 1 sin x + b 1 cos x . This is equivalent to the stated condition by use of the trigonometric addition formulas .

Integration by parts [ edit ] Consider the second Wirtinger inequality given above.

[ 1 ] Take L to be π . Any differentiable function y ( x ) satisfies the identity y ( x ) 2 + ( y ′ ( x ) − − y ( x ) cot ⁡ ⁡ x ) 2 = y ′ ( x ) 2 − − d d x ( y ( x ) 2 cot ⁡ ⁡ x ) .

{\displaystyle y(x)^{2}+{\big (}y'(x)-y(x)\cot x{\big )}^{2}=y'(x)^{2}-{\frac {d}{dx}}{\big (}y(x)^{2}\cot x{\big )}.} Integration using the fundamental theorem of calculus and the boundary conditions y (0) = y (π) = 0 then shows ∫ ∫ 0 π π y ( x ) 2 d x + ∫ ∫ 0 π π ( y ′ ( x ) − − y ( x ) cot ⁡ ⁡ x ) 2 d x = ∫ ∫ 0 π π y ′ ( x ) 2 d x .

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi }y(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x+\int _{0}^{\pi }{\big (}y'(x)-y(x)\cot x{\big )}^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x=\int _{0}^{\pi }y'(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x.} This proves the Wirtinger inequality, since the second integral is clearly nonnegative. Furthermore, equality in the Wirtinger inequality is seen to be equivalent to y ′( x ) = y ( x ) cot x , the general solution of which (as computed by separation of variables ) is y ( x ) = c sin x for an arbitrary number c .

There is a subtlety in the above application of the fundamental theorem of calculus, since it is not the case that y ( x ) 2 cot x extends continuously to x = 0 and x = π for every function y ( x ) . This is resolved as follows. It follows from the Hölder inequality and y (0) = 0 that | y ( x ) | = | ∫ ∫ 0 x y ′ ( x ) d x | ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ 0 x | y ′ ( x ) | d x ≤ ≤ x ( ∫ ∫ 0 x y ′ ( x ) 2 d x ) 1 / 2 , {\displaystyle |y(x)|=\left|\int _{0}^{x}y'(x)\,\mathrm {d} x\right|\leq \int _{0}^{x}|y'(x)|\,\mathrm {d} x\leq {\sqrt {x}}\left(\int _{0}^{x}y'(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x\right)^{1/2},} which shows that as long as ∫ ∫ 0 π π y ′ ( x ) 2 d x {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi }y'(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x} is finite, the limit of ⁠ 1 / x ⁠ y ( x ) 2 as x converges to zero is zero. Since cot x < ⁠ 1 / x ⁠ for small positive values of x , it follows from the squeeze theorem that y ( x ) 2 cot x converges to zero as x converges to zero. In exactly the same way, it can be proved that y ( x ) 2 cot x converges to zero as x converges to π .

Functional analysis [ edit ] Consider the third Wirtinger inequality given above. Take L to be 1 . Given a continuous function f on [0, 1] of average value zero, let Tf denote the function u on [0, 1] which is of average value zero, and with u ′′ + f = 0 and u ′(0) = u ′(1) = 0 . From basic analysis of ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients , the eigenvalues of T are ( k π) −2 for nonzero integers k , the largest of which is then π −2 . Because T is a bounded and self-adjoint operator , it follows that ∫ ∫ 0 1 T f ( x ) 2 d x ≤ ≤ π π − − 2 ∫ ∫ 0 1 f ( x ) T f ( x ) d x = 1 π π 2 ∫ ∫ 0 1 ( T f ) ′ ( x ) 2 d x {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}Tf(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x\leq \pi ^{-2}\int _{0}^{1}f(x)Tf(x)\,\mathrm {d} x={\frac {1}{\pi ^{2}}}\int _{0}^{1}(Tf)'(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x} for all f of average value zero, where the equality is due to integration by parts . Finally, for any continuously differentiable function y on [0, 1] of average value zero, let g n be a sequence of compactly supported continuously differentiable functions on (0, 1) which converge in L 2 to y ′ . Then define y n ( x ) = ∫ ∫ 0 x g n ( z ) d z − − ∫ ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ 0 w g n ( z ) d z d w .

{\displaystyle y_{n}(x)=\int _{0}^{x}g_{n}(z)\,\mathrm {d} z-\int _{0}^{1}\int _{0}^{w}g_{n}(z)\,\mathrm {d} z\,\mathrm {d} w.} Then each y n has average value zero with y n ′(0) = y n ′(1) = 0 , which in turn implies that − y n ′′ has average value zero. So application of the above inequality to f = − y n ′′ is legitimate and shows that ∫ ∫ 0 1 y n ( x ) 2 d x ≤ ≤ 1 π π 2 ∫ ∫ 0 1 y n ′ ( x ) 2 d x .

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}y_{n}(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x\leq {\frac {1}{\pi ^{2}}}\int _{0}^{1}y_{n}'(x)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} x.} It is possible to replace y n by y , and thereby prove the Wirtinger inequality, as soon as it is verified that y n converges in L 2 to y . This is verified in a standard way, by writing y ( x ) − − y n ( x ) = ∫ ∫ 0 x ( y n ′ ( z ) − − g n ( z ) ) d z − − ∫ ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ 0 w ( y n ′ ( z ) − − g n ( z ) ) d z d w {\displaystyle y(x)-y_{n}(x)=\int _{0}^{x}{\big (}y_{n}'(z)-g_{n}(z){\big )}\,\mathrm {d} z-\int _{0}^{1}\int _{0}^{w}(y_{n}'(z)-g_{n}(z){\big )}\,\mathrm {d} z\,\mathrm {d} w} and applying the Hölder or Jensen inequalities.

This proves the Wirtinger inequality. In the case that y ( x ) is a function for which equality in the Wirtinger inequality holds, then a standard argument in the calculus of variations says that y must be a weak solution of the Euler–Lagrange equation y ′′( x ) + y ( x ) = 0 with y ′(0) = y ′(1) = 0 , and the regularity theory of such equations, followed by the usual analysis of ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients , shows that y ( x ) = c cos π x for some number c .

To make this argument fully formal and precise, it is necessary to be more careful about the function spaces in question.

[ 2 ] Spectral geometry [ edit ] In the language of spectral geometry , the three versions of the Wirtinger inequality above can be rephrased as theorems about the first eigenvalue and corresponding eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on various one-dimensional Riemannian manifolds : [ 3 ] the first eigenvalue of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on the Riemannian circle of length L is ⁠ 4π 2 / L 2 ⁠ , and the corresponding eigenfunctions are the linear combinations of the two coordinate functions.

the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on the interval [0, L ] is ⁠ π 2 / L 2 ⁠ and the corresponding eigenfunctions are given by c sin ⁠ π x / L ⁠ for arbitrary nonzero numbers c .

the first Neumann eigenvalue of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on the interval [0, L ] is ⁠ π 2 / L 2 ⁠ and the corresponding eigenfunctions are given by c cos ⁠ π x / L ⁠ for arbitrary nonzero numbers c .

These can also be extended to statements about higher-dimensional spaces. For example, the Riemannian circle may be viewed as the one-dimensional version of either a sphere , real projective space , or torus (of arbitrary dimension). The Wirtinger inequality, in the first version given here, can then be seen as the n = 1 case of any of the following: the first eigenvalue of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on the unit-radius n -dimensional sphere is n , and the corresponding eigenfunctions are the linear combinations of the n + 1 coordinate functions.

[ 4 ] the first eigenvalue of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on the n -dimensional real projective space (with normalization given by the covering map from the unit-radius sphere) is 2 n + 2 , and the corresponding eigenfunctions are the restrictions of the homogeneous quadratic polynomials on R n + 1 to the unit sphere (and then to the real projective space).

[ 5 ] the first eigenvalue of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on the n -dimensional torus (given as the n -fold product of the circle of length 2π with itself) is 1 , and the corresponding eigenfunctions are arbitrary linear combinations of n -fold products of the eigenfunctions on the circles.

[ 6 ] The second and third versions of the Wirtinger inequality can be extended to statements about first Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplace−Beltrami operator on metric balls in Euclidean space : the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace−Beltrami operator on the unit ball in R n is the square of the smallest positive zero of the Bessel function of the first kind J ( n − 2)/2 .

[ 7 ] the first Neumann eigenvalue of the Laplace−Beltrami operator on the unit ball in R n is the square of the smallest positive zero of the first derivative of the Bessel function of the first kind J n /2 .

[ 7 ] Application to the isoperimetric inequality [ edit ] In the first form given above, the Wirtinger inequality can be used to prove the isoperimetric inequality for curves in the plane, as found by Adolf Hurwitz in 1901.

[ 8 ] Let ( x , y ) be a differentiable embedding of the circle in the plane. Parametrizing the circle by [0, 2π] so that ( x , y ) has constant speed, the length L of the curve is given by ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π x ′ ( t ) 2 + y ′ ( t ) 2 d t {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }{\sqrt {x'(t)^{2}+y'(t)^{2}}}\,\mathrm {d} t} and the area A enclosed by the curve is given (due to Stokes theorem ) by − − ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π y ( t ) x ′ ( t ) d t .

{\displaystyle -\int _{0}^{2\pi }y(t)x'(t)\,\mathrm {d} t.} Since the integrand of the integral defining L is assumed constant, there is L 2 2 π π − − 2 A = ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π ( x ′ ( t ) 2 + y ′ ( t ) 2 + 2 y ( t ) x ′ ( t ) ) d t {\displaystyle {\frac {L^{2}}{2\pi }}-2A=\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\big (}x'(t)^{2}+y'(t)^{2}+2y(t)x'(t){\big )}\,\mathrm {d} t} which can be rewritten as ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π ( x ′ ( t ) + y ( t ) ) 2 d t + ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π ( y ′ ( t ) 2 − − y ( t ) 2 ) d t .

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }{\big (}x'(t)+y(t){\big )}^{2}\,\mathrm {d} t+\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\big (}y'(t)^{2}-y(t)^{2}{\big )}\,\mathrm {d} t.} The first integral is clearly nonnegative. Without changing the area or length of the curve, ( x , y ) can be replaced by ( x , y + z ) for some number z , so as to make y have average value zero. Then the Wirtinger inequality can be applied to see that the second integral is also nonnegative, and therefore L 2 4 π π ≥ ≥ A , {\displaystyle {\frac {L^{2}}{4\pi }}\geq A,} which is the isoperimetric inequality. Furthermore, equality in the isoperimetric inequality implies both equality in the Wirtinger inequality and also the equality x ′( t ) + y ( t ) = 0 , which amounts to y ( t ) = c 1 sin( t – α) and then x ( t ) = c 1 cos( t – α) + c 2 for arbitrary numbers c 1 and c 2 . These equations mean that the image of ( x , y ) is a round circle in the plane.
