**Aboriginal Australians** are the various [indigenous peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples "Indigenous peoples") of the [Australian mainland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Australia "Mainland Australia") and many of its islands, excluding the ethnically distinct people of the [Torres Strait Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islands "Torres Strait Islands").

Humans first migrated to [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_(continent) "Australia (continent)") 50,000 to 65,000 years ago, and over time formed as many as 500 [linguistic and territorial groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Aboriginal_Australian_group_names "List of Aboriginal Australian group names").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-socio-cultural-3) In the past, Aboriginal people lived over large sections of the [continental shelf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_shelf "Continental shelf"). They were isolated on many of the smaller offshore islands and [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") when the land was inundated at the start of the [Holocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene "Holocene")[inter-glacial period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interglacial "Interglacial"), about 11,700 years ago. Despite this, Aboriginal people maintained extensive networks within the continent and certain groups maintained relationships with [Torres Strait Islanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders "Torres Strait Islanders") and the [Makassar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makassar_people "Makassar people") people of modern-day Indonesia.

Over the millennia, Aboriginal people developed complex trade networks, inter-cultural relationships, law and religions,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-socio-cultural-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-4) which make up some of the oldest continuous cultures in the world.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Tonkinson-2011-5) At the time of European colonisation of Australia, the Aboriginal people consisted of more than 250 [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_languages "Australian Aboriginal languages")[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-6) and varying degrees of technology and settlements. Languages (or dialects) and language-associated groups of people are connected with stretches of territory known as "Country", with which they have a profound spiritual connection.

Contemporary Aboriginal beliefs are a complex mixture, varying by region and individual across the continent.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Cox-2016-7) They are shaped by traditional beliefs, the disruption of colonisation, religions brought to the continent by Europeans, and contemporary issues.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Cox-2016-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Harvey-2019-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Fraser-2012-9) Traditional cultural beliefs are passed down and shared through [dancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australian_dance "Indigenous Australian dance"), [stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition "Oral tradition"), [songlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songline "Songline"), and [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australian_art "Indigenous Australian art") that collectively weave an [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") of modern daily life and ancient creation known as [the Dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dreaming "The Dreaming").

Studies of Aboriginal groups' genetic makeup are ongoing, but evidence suggests that they have genetic inheritance from ancient Asian but not more modern peoples. They share some similarities with [Papuans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_people_of_New_Guinea "Indigenous people of New Guinea"), but have been isolated from [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia "Southeast Asia") for a very long time. They have a broadly shared, complex genetic history, but only in the last 200 years were they defined by others as, and started to self-identify as, a single group. [Aboriginal identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_identity "Australian Aboriginal identity") has changed over time and place, with family lineage, self-identification, and community acceptance all of varying importance.

In the [2021 census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Australian_census "2021 Australian census"), Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people comprised 3.8% of Australia's population.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Australian-Bureau-of-Statistics-2023-1) Most Aboriginal people today speak [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") and live in cities. Some may use Aboriginal phrases and words in [Australian Aboriginal English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_English "Australian Aboriginal English") (which also has a tangible influence of [Aboriginal languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_languages "Australian Aboriginal languages") in the [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology "Phonology") and [grammatical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_structure "Grammatical structure")). Many but not all also speak the various [traditional languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_aboriginal_languages "Australian aboriginal languages") of their clans and peoples. Aboriginal people, along with Torres Strait Islander people, have a number of severe [health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_health_in_Australia "Indigenous health in Australia") and economic deprivations in comparison with the wider Australian community.

Archeological evidence indicates that the ancestors of today's Aboriginal Australians first migrated to the continent 50,000 to 65,000 years ago.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-:022-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-ClarksonJacobs201722-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Veth2-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-FaganDurrani201822-14) Genomic studies suggest that the peopling of Australia happened between 43,000 and 60,000 years ago.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-18)

They may have one of the oldest continuous cultures on earth.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-19) In [Arnhem Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem_Land "Arnhem Land") in the [Northern Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory "Northern Territory"), oral histories comprising complex narratives have been passed down by [Yolngu people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolngu_people "Yolngu people") through hundreds of generations. The [Aboriginal rock art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_rock_art "Aboriginal rock art"), dated by modern techniques, shows that their culture has continued from ancient times.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-20)

Scholars of ancient history believe that it would have been difficult for Aboriginal people to have originated purely from mainland Asia, as not enough people would have migrated to Australia and surrounding islands to fulfill the beginning of the size of the population seen in the 19th century. The ancestors of present-day Aboriginal Australian people migrated from Southeast Asia by sea during the [Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene "Pleistocene") epoch, making them among the first in the world to have completed sea voyages.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Read-1982-21)

They lived over large sections of the [Australian continental shelf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_(continent) "Australia (continent)") when the [sea levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level "Sea level") were lower. At that time, Australia, Tasmania and [New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea "New Guinea") were part of the same landmass, known as [Sahul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahul "Sahul"). As sea levels rose, the people on the [Australian mainland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_mainland "Australian mainland") and nearby islands became increasingly isolated, some on Tasmania and some of the smaller offshore islands when the land was inundated at the start of the [Holocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene "Holocene"), the [inter-glacial period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interglacial "Interglacial") that started about 11,700 years ago.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-22)

A 2021 study by researchers at the [Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC_Centre_of_Excellence_for_Australian_Biodiversity_and_Heritage "ARC Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage") has mapped the likely migration routes of the peoples as they moved across the [Australian continent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_continent "Australian continent") to its southern reaches of what is now [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") (then part of the mainland). The modelling is based on data from [archaeologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeologist "Archaeologist"), [anthropologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropologist "Anthropologist"), [ecologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecologist "Ecologist"), [geneticists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneticist "Geneticist"), [climatologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatologist "Climatologist"), [geomorphologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomorphologist "Geomorphologist"), and [hydrologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrologist "Hydrologist"). The new models suggest that the first people may have landed in the [Kimberley region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberley_region "Kimberley region") in what is now [Western Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia "Western Australia") about 60,000 years ago, and had settled across the continent within 6,000 years.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-24)

### Genetics

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Phylogenetic_structure_of_Eastern_Eurasians.png/250px-Phylogenetic_structure_of_Eastern_Eurasians.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phylogenetic_structure_of_Eastern_Eurasians.png)

Phylogenetic position of the Aboriginal Australian lineage among other [East Eurasians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East-Eurasian "East-Eurasian")

Genetic studies have revealed that a population wave outgoing from the [Persian plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_plateau "Persian plateau") during the [Initial Upper Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_Upper_Paleolithic "Initial Upper Paleolithic") period populated the Asia-Pacific region via a [southern route dispersal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Dispersal "Southern Dispersal"). This wave is suggested to have expanded into the [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia "South Asia") and [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia "Southeast Asia") region and subsequently diverged rapidly into the ancestors of [Ancient Ancestral South Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_and_archaeogenetics_of_South_Asia "Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia") (AASI), [Andamanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andamanese "Andamanese"), [East Asians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_history_of_East_Asians "Genetic history of East Asians"), and Australasians, including Aboriginal Australians and [Papuans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papuan_People "Papuan People").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-:0-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-:1-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-:3-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-:2-28) These populations are collectively known as [East Eurasian Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Eurasian "East Eurasian"). Aboriginal Australians are genetically most closely related to other [Oceanians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania "Oceania"), such as [Papuans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papuan_People "Papuan People") and [Melanesians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesians "Melanesians"), who are collectively referred to as "Australasians" and which can be described as "a deeply branching East Asian lineage".[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-:0-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-:1-26)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-:2-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-29)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-:3-27)

While the commonly accepted date for the diversification of modern humans following the [Out of Africa migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Africa_migration "Out of Africa migration") is placed at 60–50,000 years ago, there is, however, evidence that Aboriginal Australians may carry ancestry from an earlier human diaspora (xOoA) that originated 75,000 to 62,000 years ago. This earlier group has been estimated to have possibly contributed around 2% ancestry to modern Aboriginal Australians.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-31)

Mallick et al. 2016 and Mark Lipson et al. 2017 found the bifurcation of Eastern Eurasians and Western Eurasians dates to at least 45,000 years ago, with indigenous Australians nested inside the Eastern Eurasian clade.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-32)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-:2-28) Aboriginal Australians, together with [Papuans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papuan_People "Papuan People"), may either form a sister clade to a single mainland Asian clade consisting of the AASI, Andamanese and East Asians, and to the exclusion of West Eurasians,[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-33) or alternatively are nested within the Eastern Eurasian cluster without a strong internal cladal structure against mainland Asian lineages.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-:2-28)

Genetic data on indigenous populations of [Borneo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borneo "Borneo") and [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia") showed them to be closer related to other mainland Asian groups, than compared to the groups from Papua New Guinea and Australia. This indicates that populations in Australia were isolated for a long time from the rest of Southeast Asia. They remained untouched by migrations and population expansions into that area, which can be explained by the [Wallace line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_line "Wallace line").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Huoponen2001-35)

#### Uniparentals

The most common [Y-chromosome haplogroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Y-chromosome_DNA_haplogroup "Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup") among Aboriginal Australians is [C1b2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_C-B477 "Haplogroup C-B477"), followed by haplogroups [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_S-B254 "Haplogroup S-B254") and [M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_M-P256 "Haplogroup M-P256"); these latter haplogroups are also very frequent among Papuans.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-36)

#### Other studies

In a 2001 study, blood samples were collected from some [Warlpiri people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlpiri_people "Warlpiri people") in the [Northern Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory "Northern Territory") to study their genetic makeup (which is not representative of all Aboriginal peoples in Australia). The study concluded that the Warlpiri are descended from ancient Asians whose DNA is still somewhat present in Southeastern Asian groups, although greatly diminished. The Warlpiri DNA lacks certain information found in modern Asian genomes, and carries information not found in other genomes. This reinforces the idea of ancient Aboriginal isolation.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Huoponen2001-35)

Genetic data extracted in 2011 by Morten Rasmussen et al., who took a [DNA sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sample "DNA sample") from an early-20th-century lock of an Aboriginal person's hair, found that the Aboriginal ancestors probably migrated through [South Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia "South Asia") and [Maritime Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Southeast_Asia "Maritime Southeast Asia"), into Australia, where they stayed. As a result, outside of Africa, the Aboriginal peoples have occupied the same territory continuously longer than any other human populations. These findings suggest that modern Aboriginal Australians are the direct descendants of the eastern wave, who left Africa up to 75,000 years ago.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-38) This finding is compatible with earlier archaeological finds of [human remains near Lake Mungo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mungo_remains "Lake Mungo remains") that date to approximately 40,000 years ago.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The idea of the "oldest continuous culture" is based on the Aboriginal peoples' geographical isolation, with little or no interaction with outside cultures before some contact with [Makassan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makassan "Makassan") fishermen and Dutch explorers up to 500 years ago.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The Rasmussen study also found evidence that Aboriginal peoples carry some genes associated with the [Denisovans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisovan "Denisovan") (a species of human related to but distinct from [Neanderthals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal "Neanderthal")) of Asia; the study suggests that there is an increase in [allele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele "Allele") sharing between the Denisovan and Aboriginal Australian genomes, compared to other Eurasians or Africans. Examining DNA from a finger bone excavated in [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia "Siberia"), researchers concluded that the Denisovans migrated from [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia "Siberia") to tropical parts of Asia and that they interbred with modern humans in Southeast Asia 44,000 years BP, before Australia separated from New Guinea approximately 11,700 years BP. They contributed DNA to Aboriginal Australians and to present-day New Guineans and an indigenous tribe in the Philippines known as [Mamanwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamanwa "Mamanwa"). This study confirms Aboriginal Australians as one of the oldest living populations in the world. They are possibly the oldest outside Africa, and they may have the oldest continuous culture on the planet.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-39)

A 2016 study at the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge") suggests that it was about 50,000 years ago that these peoples reached [Sahul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahul "Sahul") (the [supercontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent "Supercontinent") consisting of present-day Australia and its islands and [New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea "New Guinea")). The sea levels rose and isolated Australia about 10,000 years ago, but Aboriginal Australians and Papuans diverged from each other genetically earlier, about 37,000 years BP, possibly because the remaining land bridge was impassable. This isolation makes the Aboriginal people the world's oldest culture. The study also found evidence of an unknown [hominin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominin "Hominin") group, distantly related to Denisovans, with whom the Aboriginal and Papuan ancestors must have interbred, leaving a trace of about 4% in most Aboriginal Australians' genome. There is, however, increased genetic diversity among Aboriginal Australians based on geographical distribution.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-klein2016-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-41)

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Migration_routes_and_their_contribution_to_the_East_Timor_mtDNA_pool.gif/250px-Migration_routes_and_their_contribution_to_the_East_Timor_mtDNA_pool.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Migration_routes_and_their_contribution_to_the_East_Timor_mtDNA_pool.gif)

The initial human settlement of Oceania is estimated to have been between 60,000 and 40,000 years ago. Archaeogenetic results indicate a colonisation of southern Sahul (Australia) before 37,000 years ago and an incubation period in northern Sahul (Papua New Guinea), followed by westward expansions within Australia about 28,000 years ago.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-42)

Carlhoff et al. 2021 analysed a [Holocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene "Holocene") hunter-gatherer sample ("Leang Panninge") from [South Sulawesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulawesi "Sulawesi"), which shares high amounts of genetic drift with Aboriginal Australians and Papuans. This suggests that a population split from the common ancestor of Aboriginal Australians and Papuans. The sample also shows genetic affinity with East Asians and the Andamanese people of South Asia. The authors note that this hunter-gatherer sample can be modelled with ~50% Australian/Papuan-related ancestry and either with ~50% East Asian or Andamanese Onge ancestry, highlighting the deep split between Leang Panninge and Aboriginal/Papuans.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-43)[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-44)

Two genetic studies by Larena et al. 2021 found that [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines")[Negrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negrito "Negrito") people split from the common ancestor of Aboriginal Australians and Papuans before the latter two diverged from each other, but after their common ancestor diverged from the ancestor of [East Asian peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_peoples "East Asian peoples").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-45)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-46)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Lipson-47)

### Changes about 4,000 years ago

The [dingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingo "Dingo") reached Australia about 4,000 years ago. Near that time, there were changes in language (with the [Pama-Nyungan language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pama-Nyungan_languages "Pama-Nyungan languages") spreading over most of the mainland), and in [stone tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_tool "Stone tool") technology. Smaller tools were used. Human contact has thus been inferred, and genetic data of two kinds have been proposed to support a gene flow from India to Australia: firstly, signs of South Asian components in Aboriginal Australian genomes, reported on the basis of genome-wide [SNP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism "Single-nucleotide polymorphism") data; and secondly, the existence of a [Y chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome "Y chromosome") (male) lineage, designated [haplogroup C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_C-M130 "Haplogroup C-M130")∗, with the most recent common ancestor about 5,000 years ago.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-bergstrom2016-48)

The first type of evidence comes from a 2013 study by the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Evolutionary_Anthropology "Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology") using large-scale [genotyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping "Genotyping") data from a pool of Aboriginal Australians, New Guineans, island Southeast Asians, and Indians. It found that the New Guinea and [Mamanwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamanwa "Mamanwa") (Philippines area) groups diverged from the Aboriginal about 36,000 years ago (there is supporting evidence that these populations are descended from migrants taking an early "southern route" out of Africa, before other groups in the area).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Also the Indian and Australian populations mixed long before European contact, with this gene flow occurring during the Holocene (c. 4,200 years ago).[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-maxplanck2013-49) The researchers had two theories for this: either some Indians had contact with people in Indonesia who eventually transferred those Indian genes to Aboriginal Australians, or a group of Indians migrated from India to Australia and intermingled with the locals directly.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-50)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-MacDonald-51)

However, a 2016 study in _[Current Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current\_Biology "Current Biology")_ by Anders Bergström et al. excluded the Y chromosome as providing evidence for recent gene flow from India into Australia. The study authors sequenced 13 Aboriginal Australian Y chromosomes using recent advances in [gene sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing "Whole genome sequencing") technology. They investigated their divergence times from Y chromosomes in other continents, including comparing the haplogroup C chromosomes. They found a divergence time of about 54,100 years between the Sahul C chromosome and its closest relative C5, as well as about 54,300 years between haplogroups K*/M and their closest haplogroups R and Q. The deep divergence time of 50,000-plus years with the South Asian chromosome and "the fact that the Aboriginal Australian Cs share a more recent common ancestor with Papuan Cs" excludes any recent genetic contact.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-bergstrom2016-48)

The 2016 study's authors concluded that, although this does not disprove the presence of any Holocene gene flow or non-genetic influences from South Asia at that time, and the appearance of the dingo does provide strong evidence for external contacts, the evidence overall is consistent with a complete lack of gene flow, and points to indigenous origins for the technological and linguistic changes. They attributed the disparity between their results and previous findings to improvements in technology; none of the other studies had utilised complete Y chromosome sequencing, which has the highest precision. For example, use of a ten Y STRs method has been shown to massively underestimate divergence times. Gene flow across the island-dotted 150-kilometre-wide (93 mi) Torres Strait, is both geographically plausible and demonstrated by the data, although at this point it could not be determined from this study when within the last 10,000 years it may have occurred—newer analytical techniques have the potential to address such questions.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-bergstrom2016-48)

Bergstrom's 2018 doctoral thesis looking at the population of Sahul suggests that other than relatively recent admixture, the populations of the region appear to have been genetically independent from the rest of the world since their divergence about 50,000 years ago. He writes "There is no evidence for South Asian gene flow to Australia.... Despite Sahul being a single connected landmass until [8,000 years ago], different groups across Australia are nearly equally related to Papuans, and vice versa, and the two appear to have separated genetically already [about 30,000 years ago]."[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-bergstromthesis2018-52)

### Environmental adaptations

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Alexander_Schramm_-_An_Aboriginal_encampment%2C_near_the_Adelaide_foothills_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/250px-Alexander_Schramm_-_An_Aboriginal_encampment%2C_near_the_Adelaide_foothills_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alexander_Schramm_-_An_Aboriginal_encampment,_near_the_Adelaide_foothills_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)

Aboriginal Australians possess inherited abilities to adapt to a wide range of environmental temperatures in various ways. A study in 1958 comparing cold adaptation in the desert-dwelling [Pitjantjatjara people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitjantjatjara "Pitjantjatjara") compared with a group of European people showed that the cooling adaptation of the Aboriginal group differed from that of the white people, and that they were able to sleep more soundly through a cold desert night.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-53) A 2014 [Cambridge University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University "Cambridge University") study found that a beneficial mutation in two genes which regulate [thyroxine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine "Thyroxine"), a hormone involved in regulating body [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism"), helps to regulate body temperature in response to fever. The effect of this is that the desert people are able to have a higher body temperature without accelerating the activity of the whole of the body, which can be especially detrimental in childhood diseases. This helps protect people to survive the side-effects of infection.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-54)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-55)

Location and demographics
-------------------------

Aboriginal people have lived for tens of thousands of years on the [continent of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent_of_Australia "Continent of Australia"), through its various changes in landmass. The area within [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia")'s borders today includes the islands of [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania"), [K'gari (previously Fraser Island)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Island "Fraser Island"), [Hinchinbrook Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinchinbrook_Island "Hinchinbrook Island"),[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-actoss-56) the [Tiwi Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwi_Islands "Tiwi Islands"), [Kangaroo Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island "Kangaroo Island") and [Groote Eylandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groote_Eylandt "Groote Eylandt"). Indigenous people of the Torres Strait Islands, however, are not Aboriginal.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-57)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-58)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-59)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-60)

Census counts and intercensal change

 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons, 2006–2021[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-changes-61)| Census | Number of persons | Intercensal change (number) | Intercensal change (percentage) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2006 | 455,028 | 45,025 | 11.0 |
| 2011 | 548,368 | 93,340 | 20.5 |
| 2016 | 649,171 | 100,803 | 18.4 |
| 2021 | 812,728 | 163,557 | 25.2 |

In the [2021 census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Australian_census "2021 Australian census"), people who self-identified on the census form as being of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander origin totalled 812,728 out of a total of 25,422,788 Australians, equating to 3.2% of Australia's population[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-62) and an increase of 163,557 people, or 25.2%, since the previous census in 2016.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-changes-61)

[Demographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography "Demography") factors – births, deaths and migration[[note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-63) – accounted for 43.5% of the increase (71,086 people).[_[vague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vagueness "Wikipedia:Vagueness")_] In turn, 76.2% of that increase was attributed to people aged 0–19 years in 2021, broken down as 52.5% for 0–4 year olds (births since 2016) and 23.7% for 5–19 year olds.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-changes-61)[_[vague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vagueness "Wikipedia:Vagueness")_]

Reasons for an increase in Aboriginal population also include non-demographic factors, which are complex to quantify. These include changes in individuals' identification as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander in different censuses, and individuals completing a census form in 2021 but not in 2016. These factors accounted for 56.5% of the increase in the Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander population (92,471 people). The increase was higher than observed between 2011 and 2016 (39.0%) and 2006–2011 (38.7%).[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-changes-61)

Languages
---------

Most Aboriginal people speak English,[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-langstats-64) with Aboriginal phrases and words being added to create [Australian Aboriginal English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_English "Australian Aboriginal English") (which also has a tangible influence of [Aboriginal languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_languages "Australian Aboriginal languages") in the [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology "Phonology") and [grammatical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_structure "Grammatical structure")).[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-65) Some Aboriginal people, especially those living in remote areas, are multi-lingual.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-langstats-64) Many of the original 250–400 Aboriginal languages (more than 250 languages and about 800 dialectal varieties on the continent) are endangered or extinct,[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-aiatsis-66) although some efforts are being made at [language revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_revival "Language revival") for some. As of 2016, only 13 traditional Indigenous languages were still being acquired by children,[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-67) and about another 100 spoken by older generations only.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-aiatsis-66)

Groups and sub-groups

Dispersing across the Australian continent over time, the ancient people expanded and differentiated into distinct groups, each with its own language and culture.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Lourandos-68) More than 400 distinct Australian Aboriginal [peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indigenous_Australian_group_names "List of Indigenous Australian group names") have been identified, distinguished by names designating their [ancestral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor "Ancestor") languages, dialects, or distinctive speech patterns.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-69) According to noted [anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropologist "Anthropologist"), [archaeologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeologist "Archaeologist") and sociologist [Harry Lourandos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lourandos "Harry Lourandos"), historically, these groups lived in three main cultural areas, the Northern, Southern and Central cultural areas. The Northern and Southern areas, having richer natural marine and woodland resources, were more densely populated than the Central area.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Lourandos-68)

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Bathurst_Island_men.jpg/250px-Bathurst_Island_men.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bathurst_Island_men.jpg)

### Geographically-based names

There are various other names from [Australian Aboriginal languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_languages "Australian Aboriginal languages") commonly used to identify groups based on [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography"), known as [demonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonyms "Demonyms"), including:

*   [Anangu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anangu "Anangu") in northern [South Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia "South Australia"), and neighbouring parts of [Western Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia "Western Australia") and [Northern Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory "Northern Territory")
*   Goorie (variant pronunciation and spelling of Koori) in South East Queensland and some parts of northern New South Wales
*   [Koori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koori "Koori") (or Koorie) in New South Wales and [Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(state) "Victoria (state)") ([Aboriginal Victorians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Victorians "Aboriginal Victorians"))
*   [Murri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murri_people "Murri people") in Central and Northern Queensland, sometimes referring to all Aboriginal Queenslanders
*   [Nunga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunga "Nunga") in southern South Australia
*   [Noongar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noongar "Noongar") in southern Western Australia
*   [Palawah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palawah "Palawah") (or Pallawah) in [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Aborigine "Tasmanian Aborigine")
*   [Tiwi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwi_people "Tiwi people") on [Tiwi Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwi_Islands "Tiwi Islands") off [Arnhem Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem_Land "Arnhem Land") (NT)

### A few examples of sub-groups

Other group names are based on the [language group or specific dialect spoken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_languages "Australian Aboriginal languages"). These also coincide with geographical regions of varying sizes. A few examples are:

*   [Anindilyakwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enindhilyagwa_language "Enindhilyagwa language") on [Groote Eylandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groote_Eylandt "Groote Eylandt") (off Arnhem Land), NT
*   [Arrernte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrernte_people "Arrernte people") in central Australia[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Read-1982-21)
*   [Bininj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bininj_Kunwok_people "Bininj Kunwok people") in Western Arnhem Land (NT)[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-70)
*   [Gunggari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kungkari_language "Kungkari language") in south-west Queensland[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-71)
*   [Muruwari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muruwari "Muruwari") people in New South Wales
*   [Luritja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luritja "Luritja") (Kukatja), an Anangu sub-group based on language
*   [Ngunnawal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngunnawal "Ngunnawal") in the [Australian Capital Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory "Australian Capital Territory") and surrounding areas of New South Wales
*   [Pitjantjatjara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitjantjatjara "Pitjantjatjara"), an Anangu sub-group based on language
*   [Wangai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wangai "Wangai") in the [Western Australian Goldfields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian_Goldfields "Western Australian Goldfields")
*   [Warlpiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlpiri_people "Warlpiri people") (Yapa) in western central Northern Territory
*   [Yamatji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamatji "Yamatji") in central Western Australia
*   [Yolngu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolngu "Yolngu") in eastern Arnhem Land (NT)

### Difficulties defining groups

However, these lists are neither exhaustive nor definitive, and there are overlaps. Different approaches have been taken by non-Aboriginal scholars in trying to understand and define Aboriginal culture and societies, some focusing on the micro-level (tribe, clan, etc.), and others on shared languages and cultural practices spread over large regions defined by ecological factors. [Anthropologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropologist "Anthropologist") have encountered many difficulties in trying to define what constitutes an Aboriginal people/community/group/tribe, let alone naming them. Knowledge of pre-colonial Aboriginal cultures and societal groupings is still largely dependent on the observers' interpretations, which were filtered through colonial ways of viewing societies.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-72)

Some Aboriginal peoples identify as one of several [saltwater, freshwater, rainforest or desert peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians#Other_groupings "Indigenous Australians").

Aboriginal identity
-------------------

### Terminology

The term _Aboriginal Australians_ includes many distinct peoples who have developed across Australia for over 50,000 years.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-ClarksonJacobs2017-73)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-74) These peoples have a broadly shared, though complex, genetic history,[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-abc2013-75)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-MacDonald-51) but it is only in the last two hundred years that they have been defined and started to self-identify as a single group, socio-politically.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Fesl-76)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-age2-77) While some preferred the term _Aborigine_ to _Aboriginal_ in the past, as the latter was seen to have more directly discriminatory legal origins,[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Fesl-76) use of the term _Aborigine_ has declined in recent decades, as many consider the term an offensive and racist hangover from Australia's colonial era.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-78)[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-79)

The definition of the term _Aboriginal_ has changed over time and place, with family lineage, self-identification and community acceptance all being of varying importance.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-AECG_Inc-80)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-81)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-82)

The term _Indigenous Australians_ refers to Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and the term is conventionally only used when both groups are included in the topic being addressed, or by self-identification by a person as Indigenous. (Torres Strait Islanders are ethnically and culturally distinct,[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-83) despite extensive cultural exchange with some of the Aboriginal groups,[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-84) and the Torres Strait Islands are mostly part of Queensland but have a [separate governmental status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Regional_Authority "Torres Strait Regional Authority").) Some Aboriginal people object to being labelled _Indigenous_, as an artificial and denialist term, because some non-Aboriginal people have referred to themselves as indigenous because they were born in Australia.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-age2-77)

### Culture and beliefs

Australian Indigenous people have beliefs unique to each mob ([tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe "Tribe")) and have a strong connection to the land.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Behind-the-dots-of-Aboriginal-Art-85)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Tonkinson-2011-5) Contemporary Indigenous Australian beliefs are a complex mixture, varying by region and individual across the continent.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Cox-2016-7) They are shaped by traditional beliefs, the disruption of colonisation, religions brought to the continent by Europeans, and contemporary issues.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Cox-2016-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Harvey-2019-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Fraser-2012-9) Traditional cultural beliefs are passed down and shared by [dancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australian_dance "Indigenous Australian dance"), [stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition "Oral tradition"), [songlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songline "Songline") and [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australian_art "Indigenous Australian art")—especially [Papunya Tula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papunya_Tula "Papunya Tula") (dot painting)—collectively telling the story of creation known as [The Dreamtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dreaming "The Dreaming").[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-86)[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Behind-the-dots-of-Aboriginal-Art-85) Additionally, traditional healers were also custodians of important Dreaming stories as well as their medical roles (for example the [Ngangkari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngangkari "Ngangkari") in the [Western desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Desert_cultural_bloc "Western Desert cultural bloc")).[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-87) Some core structures and themes are shared across the continent with details and additional elements varying between language and cultural groups.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Cox-2016-7) For example, in The Dreamtime of most regions, a spirit creates the earth then tells the humans to treat the animals and the earth in a way which is respectful to land. In [Northern Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory "Northern Territory") this is commonly said to be a huge snake or snakes that weaved its way through the earth and sky making the mountains and oceans. But in other places the spirits who created the world are known as [wandjina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandjina "Wandjina") rain and water spirits. Major [ancestral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral "Ancestral") spirits include the [Rainbow Serpent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Serpent "Rainbow Serpent"), [Baiame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiame "Baiame"), [Dirawong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirawong "Dirawong") and [Bunjil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunjil "Bunjil"). Similarly, the Arrernte people of central Australia believed that humanity originated from great superhuman ancestors who brought the sun, wind and rain as a result of breaking through the surface of the Earth when waking from their slumber.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-Read-1982-21)

Health and economic deprivations
--------------------------------

Taken as a whole, Aboriginal Australians, along with Torres Strait Islander people, have a number of health and economic deprivations in comparison with the wider Australian community.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-healthstats2011-88)[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-89)

Due to the aforementioned disadvantage, Aboriginal Australian communities experience a higher rate of suicide, as compared to non-indigenous communities. These issues stem from a variety of different causes unique to indigenous communities, such as historical trauma,[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-90) socioeconomic disadvantage, and decreased access to education and health care.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-91) Also, this problem largely affects indigenous youth, as many indigenous youth may feel disconnected from their culture.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-92)

To combat the increased suicide rate, many researchers have suggested that the inclusion of more cultural aspects into suicide prevention programs would help to combat mental health issues within the community. Past studies have found that many indigenous leaders and community members, do in fact, want more culturally-aware health care programs.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-93) Similarly, culturally-relative programs targeting indigenous youth have actively challenged suicide ideation among younger indigenous populations, with many social and emotional wellbeing programs using cultural information to provide coping mechanisms and improving mental health.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-94)[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-95)

The [outstation movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outstation_movement "Outstation movement") of the 1970s and 1980s, when Aboriginal people moved to tiny remote settlements on traditional land, brought health benefits,[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-96)[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-97) but funding them proved expensive, training and employment opportunities were not provided in many cases, and support from governments dwindled in the 2000s, particularly in the era of the [Howard government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_government "Howard government").[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-expch1-98)[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-expch10-99)[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-altman2009-100)

Indigenous communities in remote Australia are often small, isolated towns with basic facilities, on [traditionally owned land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_title_in_Australia "Native title in Australia"). These communities have between 20 and 300 inhabitants and are often closed to outsiders for cultural reasons. The long-term viability and resilience of Aboriginal communities in desert areas has been discussed by scholars and policy-makers. A 2007 report by the [CSIRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO "CSIRO") stressed the importance of taking a demand-driven approach to services in desert settlements, and concluded that "if top-down solutions continue to be imposed without appreciating the fundamental drivers of settlement in desert regions, then those solutions will continue to be partial, and ineffective in the long term."[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_note-101)

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginals#cite_ref-44)**The [qpGraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QpGraph "QpGraph") analysis confirmed this branching pattern, with the Leang Panninge individual branching off from the Near Oceanian clade after the Denisovan gene flow. The most supported topology indicates around 50% of a basal East Asian component contributing to the Leang Panninge genome (fig. 3c, supplementary figs. 7–11).

While the chronology of Sahul colonisation remains important, we see no arguable cause-and-effect nexus between when Sahul colonisation ﬁrst occurred and AMH ability to achieve it (cf. Davidson & Noble 1992). If we exclude the extreme age claimed for Madjedbebe (Clarkson et al. 2017) the increasing consensus of available evidence currently puts this event in the range 47–51 ka.

The timing of human arrival in Australia was estimated using the age of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for the different Australian-only haplogroups, calculated using a molecular clock with substitution rates calibrated with ancient European and Asian mitogenomes18. Although these TMRCA values are likely to be minimal estimates given the limited sampling, they group in a narrow window of time from approximately 43–47 ka (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs 2, 3), consistent with previous studies (Supplementary Information). ... The resulting independent estimate for initial colonization of Sahul, 48.8 ± 1.3 ka, is a close match to the genetic age estimates (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 4).

A single major migration of modern humans into the continents of Asia and Sahul was strongly supported by earlier studies using mitochondrial DNA, the non-recombining portion of Y chromosomes, and autosomal SNP data [42–45]. Ancestral Ancient South Indians with no West Eurasian relatedness, East Asians, Onge (Andamanese hunter–gatherers) and Papuans all derive in a short evolutionary time from the eastward dispersal of an out-of-Africa population [46,47]
