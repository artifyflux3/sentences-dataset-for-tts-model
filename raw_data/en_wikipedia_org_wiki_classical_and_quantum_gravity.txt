The editor-in-chief is Susan Scott at The Australian National University . The journal's 2023 impact factor is 3.6 according to Journal Citation Reports . As of October 2015, the journal publishes letters in addition to regular articles.

[ 1 ] Scope [ edit ] The journal's scope includes: Classical general relativity Applications of relativity Experimental gravitation Cosmology and the early universe Quantum gravity Supergravity , superstrings and supersymmetry Mathematical physics relevant to gravitation Classical and Quantum Gravity also supports the field of gravitational physics through sponsorship of the British Gravity Meeting.

[ 2 ] CQG+ [ edit ] Until the end of 2023, the journal used to have a companion blog website, called "CQG+", that highlighted high-quality papers published in the journal in order to raise the visibility of those papers.

[ 3 ] The former "CQG+" content is now hosted at a WordPress site.

[ 4 ] The site featured reviews of films related to gravity, such as Interstellar (2014) and The Theory of Everything (2014).
