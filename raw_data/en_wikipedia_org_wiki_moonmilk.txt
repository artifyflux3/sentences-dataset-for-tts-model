It is a precipitate from limestone comprising aggregates of fine crystals of varying composition, usually made of carbonates such as calcite , aragonite , hydromagnesite , and/or monohydrocalcite .

Formation and Composition [ edit ] Moonmilk forms as a result of several processes, including both chemical reactions and possible bacterial action. One hypothesis suggests that moonmilk is created by the bacterium Macromonas bipunctata . However, no microbiological studies have been carried out to confirm this. Moonmilk was originally thought to be created by moon rays, a misconception reflected in its name.

[ 1 ] It is possible that moonmilk forms when water dissolves and softens the karst in caves, carrying dissolved nutrients that are used by microbes, such as Actinomycetes . As microbial colonies grow, they trap and accumulate chemically precipitated crystals in an organic matter-rich matrix. These heterotrophic microbes, which produce CO 2 as a waste product of respiration and possibly organic acids , may help to dissolve the carbonate.

[ citation needed ] Historical and Cultural Uses [ edit ] In 2017, archaeologists at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in China discovered a bronze jar dating back over 2,700 years, containing animal fat combined with moonmilk. This mixture is believed to have been used as a cosmetic face cream by Chinese noblemen.

[ 2 ] Being soft, moonmilk was frequently used as a medium for finger fluting , a form of prehistoric art .

The Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner described moonmilk's use as a medicine in the 16th century. It continued to be prescribed until the 19th century.

[ 3 ] Notable Formations [ edit ] The world's largest formation of brushite moonmilk is found in the Big Room of Kartchner Caverns State Park in southern Arizona.
