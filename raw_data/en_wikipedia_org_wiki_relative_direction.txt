Three line segments with the same direction

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), **direction**, also known as **spatial direction** or **vector direction**, is the common characteristic of all [rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry) "Ray (geometry)") which coincide when [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") to share a common endpoint; equivalently, it is the common characteristic of [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)") (such as the [relative position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_position "Relative position") between a pair of points) which can be made equal by [scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_(geometry) "Scaling (geometry)") (by some positive [scalar multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication")).

Two vectors sharing the same direction are said to be _**codirectional**_ or _**equidirectional**_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_direction#cite_note-HMCS-1) All co[directional line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_line_segment "Directional line segment") sharing the same size (length) are said to be _[equipollent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipollent\_(geometry) "Equipollent (geometry)")_. Two equipollent segments are not necessarily coincident; for example, a given direction can be evaluated at different starting [positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(geometry) "Position (geometry)"), defining different unit directed line segments (as a [bound vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_vector "Bound vector") instead of a [free vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_vector "Free vector")).

A direction is often represented as a [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector"), the result of dividing a vector by its length. A direction can alternately be represented by a [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") on a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") or [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), the [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(geometry) "Intersection (geometry)") between the sphere and a ray in that direction emanating from the sphere's center; the tips of unit vectors emanating from a common [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)") point lie on the [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere").

A [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") is defined in terms of several oriented reference lines, called _coordinate axes_; any arbitrary direction can be represented numerically by finding the [direction cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_cosine "Direction cosine") (a list of [cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine "Cosine") of the angles) between the given direction and the directions of the axes; the direction cosines are the coordinates of the associated unit vector.

A two-dimensional direction can also be represented by its [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_(geometry) "Angle (geometry)"), measured from some reference direction, the angular component of [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates "Polar coordinates") (ignoring or normalizing the radial component). A three-dimensional direction can be represented using a polar angle relative to a fixed polar axis and an azimuthal angle about the polar axis: the angular components of [spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinates "Spherical coordinates").

Non-oriented straight lines can also be considered to have a direction, the common characteristic of all [parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines "Parallel lines"), which can be made to coincide by translation to pass through a common point. The direction of a non-oriented line in a two-dimensional plane, given a Cartesian coordinate system, can be represented numerically by its [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_(geometry) "Slope (geometry)").

Examples of two 2D direction vectors

A direction is used to represent linear objects such as [axes of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation "Axis of rotation") and [normal vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry) "Normal (geometry)"). A direction may be used as part of the representation of a more complicated [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body")'s [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") in [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space") (e.g., [axis–angle representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis%E2%80%93angle_representation "Axis–angle representation")).

Two airplanes in [parallel (and opposite) directions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_opposite_direction_parallel_runway_operations "Simultaneous opposite direction parallel runway operations").

Two directions are said to be _**opposite**_ if the unit vectors representing them are [additive inverses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_inverse "Additive inverse"), or if the points on a sphere representing them are [antipodal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodal_point "Antipodal point"), at the two opposite ends of a common diameter. Two directions are _**parallel**_ (as in [parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines "Parallel lines")) if they can be brought to lie on the same straight line without rotations; parallel directions are either codirectional or opposite.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_direction#cite_note-HMCS-1)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_direction#cite_note-2)

Two directions are _**obtuse**_ or _**acute**_ if they form, respectively, an [obtuse angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obtuse_angle "Obtuse angle") (greater than a right angle) or [acute angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_angle "Acute angle") (smaller than a right angle); equivalently, obtuse directions and acute directions have, respectively, negative and positive [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_product "Scalar product") (or [scalar projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_projection "Scalar projection")).
