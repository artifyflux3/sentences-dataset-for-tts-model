The **identity of indiscernibles** is an [ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") principle that states that there cannot be separate [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy) "Object (philosophy)") or [entities](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/entity "wikt:entity") that have all their [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(philosophy) "Property (philosophy)") in common. That is, entities _x_ and _y_ are identical if every [predicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(logic) "Predicate (logic)") possessed by _x_ is also possessed by _y_ and vice versa. It states that no two distinct things (such as [snowflakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake "Snowflake")) can be exactly alike, but this is intended as a metaphysical principle rather than one of natural science. A related principle is the [indiscernibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiscernibles "Indiscernibles") of identicals, discussed below.

A form of the principle is attributed to the German philosopher [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz"). While some think that Leibniz's version of the principle is meant to be only the indiscernibility of identicals, others have interpreted it as the conjunction of the identity of indiscernibles and the **indiscernibility of identicals** (the converse principle). Because of its association with Leibniz, the indiscernibility of identicals is sometimes known as **Leibniz's law**. It is considered to be one of his great metaphysical principles, the other being the [principle of noncontradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction "Law of noncontradiction") and the [principle of sufficient reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_sufficient_reason "Principle of sufficient reason") (famously used in his disputes with [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and [Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Clarke "Samuel Clarke") in the [Leibniz–Clarke correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Clarke_correspondence "Leibniz–Clarke correspondence")).

Some philosophers have decided, however, that it is important to exclude certain predicates (or purported predicates) from the principle in order to avoid either triviality or contradiction. An example (detailed below) is the predicate that denotes whether an object is equal to _x_ (often considered a valid predicate). As a consequence, there are a few different versions of the principle in the philosophical literature, of varying logical strength—and some of them are termed "the strong principle" or "the weak principle" by particular authors, in order to distinguish between them.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Forrest2008-1)

The identity of indiscernibles has been used to motivate notions of [noncontextuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_contextuality "Quantum contextuality") within quantum mechanics.

Associated with this principle is also the question as to whether it is a [logical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical "Logical") principle, or merely an [empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical "Empirical") principle.

Identity and indiscernibility
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Identity_of_indiscernibles&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Identity and indiscernibility")]

Both **identity** and **indiscernibility** are expressed by the word "same".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Sandk%C3%BChler-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Noonan-3)_Identity_ is about _numerical sameness_, and is expressed by the equality sign ("="). It is the relation each object bears only to itself.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-4)_Indiscernibility_, on the other hand, concerns _qualitative sameness_: two objects are indiscernible if they have all their properties in common.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Forrest2008-1) Formally, this can be expressed as "![Image 1: {\displaystyle \forall F(Fx\leftrightarrow Fy)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c91be3bf7517f56ca475129e80db22c27358b11)". The two senses of _sameness_ are linked by two principles: the principle of _indiscernibility of identicals_ and the principle of _identity of indiscernibles_. The principle of _indiscernibility of identicals_ is uncontroversial and states that if two entities are identical with each other then they have the same properties.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Noonan-3) The principle of _identity of indiscernibles_, on the other hand, is more controversial in making the converse claim that if two entities have the same properties then they must be identical.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Noonan-3) This entails that "no two distinct things exactly resemble each other".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Forrest2008-1) On this principle, for any two different items there must be some discriminable or distinguishable difference, at least in principle, between the two items because were there no difference, they would not be two but rather one. Note that these are all [second-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_logic "Second-order logic") expressions. Neither of these principles can be expressed in [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic") (are [nonfirstorderizable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonfirstorderizability "Nonfirstorderizability")). Formally, the two principles can be expressed in the following way:

The _indiscernibility of identicals_ is usually taken to be uncontroversially true, whereas the _identity of indiscernibles_ is more controversial,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-:0-5) having been famously disputed by [Max Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Black "Max Black").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-6)

The conjunction of these two principles is sometimes called "Leibniz's Law",[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-7)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Forrest2008-1) although this name has sometimes been used for either of the two other principles,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-:0-5) or for other principles.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-8) It may be stated as a [biconditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_biconditional "Logical biconditional"):

Some logicians have regarded this principle as essential to [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy) "Identity (philosophy)") and [equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics) "Equality (mathematics)"): [Alfred Tarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski "Alfred Tarski") listed it among the logical axioms governing the notion of identity,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-9) and [Rudolf Carnap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Carnap "Rudolf Carnap")_defined_ the [equals sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign "Equals sign") for identity (=) in terms of this biconditional.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-10)

In a universe of two distinct objects A and B, all predicates F are materially equivalent to one of the following properties:

*   IsA, the property that holds of A but not of B;
*   IsB, the property that holds of B but not of A;
*   IsAorB, the property that holds of both A and B;
*   IsNotAorB, the property that holds of neither A nor B.

If ∀F applies to all such predicates, then the second principle as formulated above reduces trivially and uncontroversially to a [logical tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic) "Tautology (logic)"). In that case, the objects are distinguished by IsA, IsB, and all predicates that are materially equivalent to either of these. This argument can combinatorially be extended to universes containing any number of distinct objects.

**Proof box**

The [equality relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics) "Equality (mathematics)") expressed by the sign "=" is an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") in being [reflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation "Reflexive relation") (everything is equal to itself), [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation "Symmetric relation") (if _x_ is equal to _y_ then _y_ is equal to _x_) and [transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation "Transitive relation") (if _x_ is equal to _y_ and _y_ is equal to _z_ then _x_ is equal to _z_). The _indiscernibility of identicals_ and _identity of indiscernables_ can jointly be used to define the equality relation. The _symmetry_ and _transitivity_ of equality follow from the first principle, whereas _reflexivity_ follows from the second. Both principles can be combined into a single axiom by using a biconditional operator (_![Image 2: {\displaystyle \leftrightarrow }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/046b918c43e05caf6624fe9b676c69ec9cd6b892)_) in place of material implication (_![Image 3: {\displaystyle \rightarrow }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/53e574cc3aa5b4bf5f3f5906caf121a378eef08b)_).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-11)[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Indiscernibility and conceptions of properties
----------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Identity_of_indiscernibles&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Indiscernibility and conceptions of properties")]

**Indiscernibility** is usually defined in terms of shared properties: two objects are indiscernible if they have all their properties in common.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Forrest-12) The plausibility and strength of the principle of identity of indiscernibles depend on the **conception of properties** used to define indiscernibility.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Forrest-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Honderich-13)

One important distinction in this regard is between _pure_ and _impure_ properties. _Impure properties_ are properties that, unlike _pure properties_, involve reference to a particular substance in their definition.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Forrest-12) So, for example, _being a wife_ is a pure property while _being the wife of Socrates_ is an impure property due to the reference to the particular "Socrates".[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-14) Sometimes, the terms _qualitative_ and _non-qualitative_ are used instead of _pure_ and _impure_.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Cowling-15) Discernibility is usually defined in terms of pure properties only. The reason for this is that taking impure properties into consideration would result in the principle being trivially true since any entity has the impure property of being identical to itself, which it does not share with any other entity.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Forrest-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Honderich-13)

Another important distinction concerns the difference between [intrinsic and extrinsic properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_properties "Intrinsic and extrinsic properties").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Honderich-13) A property is _extrinsic_ to an object if having this property depends on other objects (with or without reference to particular objects), otherwise it is _intrinsic_. For example, the property of _being an aunt_ is extrinsic while the property of _having a mass of 60 kg_ is intrinsic.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Marshall-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-17) If the identity of indiscernibles is defined only in terms of _intrinsic pure_ properties, one cannot regard two books lying on a table as distinct when they are _intrinsically identical_. But if _extrinsic_ and _impure_ properties are also taken into consideration, the same books become distinct so long as they are discernible through the latter properties.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Forrest-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-Honderich-13)

[Max Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Black "Max Black") has argued against the identity of indiscernibles by counterexample. Notice that to show that the identity of indiscernibles is false, it is sufficient that one provide a [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory "Model theory") in which there are two distinct (numerically nonidentical) things that have all the same properties. He claimed that in a symmetric universe wherein only two symmetrical spheres exist, the two spheres are two distinct objects even though they have all their properties in common.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-18)

Black argues that even relational properties (properties specifying distances between objects in space-time) fail to distinguish two identical objects in a symmetrical universe. Per his argument, two objects are, and will remain, equidistant from the universe's plane of symmetry and each other. Even bringing in an external observer to label the two spheres distinctly does not solve the problem, because it violates the symmetry of the universe.

### Indiscernibility of identicals

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Identity_of_indiscernibles&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Indiscernibility of identicals")]

As stated above, the principle of indiscernibility of identicals—that if two objects are in fact one and the same, they have all the same properties—is mostly uncontroversial. However, one famous application of the indiscernibility of identicals was by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") in his _[Meditations on First Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations\_on\_First\_Philosophy "Meditations on First Philosophy")_. Descartes concluded that he could not doubt the existence of himself (the famous _[cogito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito\_ergo\_sum "Cogito ergo sum")_ argument), but that he _could_ doubt the existence of his body.

This argument is criticized by some modern philosophers on the grounds that it allegedly derives a conclusion about what is true from a premise about what people know. What people know or believe about an entity, they argue, is not really a characteristic of that entity. A response may be that the argument in the _[Meditations on First Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations\_on\_First\_Philosophy "Meditations on First Philosophy")_ is that the inability of Descartes to doubt the existence of his mind is part of his mind's [essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence "Essence"). One may then argue that identical things should have identical essences.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-19)

Numerous counterexamples are given to debunk Descartes' reasoning via _[reductio ad absurdum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio\_ad\_absurdum "Reductio ad absurdum")_, such as the following argument based on a [secret identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_identity "Secret identity"):

1.   Entities _x_ and _y_ are identical if and only if any predicate possessed by _x_ is also possessed by _y_ and vice versa.
2.   Clark Kent is Superman's secret identity; that is, they're the same person (identical) but people don't know this fact.
3.   [Lois Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Lane "Lois Lane") thinks that [Clark Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent "Clark Kent") cannot fly.
4.   Lois Lane thinks that [Superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman "Superman") can fly.
5.   Therefore Superman has a property that Clark Kent does not have, namely that Lois Lane thinks that he can fly.
6.   Therefore, Superman is not identical to Clark Kent.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-20)
7.   Since in proposition 6 we come to a contradiction with proposition 2, we conclude that at least one of the premises is wrong. Either: 
    *   Leibniz's law is wrong; or
    *   A person's knowledge about _x_ is not a predicate of _x_; or
    *   The application of Leibniz's law is erroneous; the law is only applicable in cases of monadic, not polyadic, properties; or
    *   What people think about are not the actual objects themselves; or
    *   A person is capable of holding conflicting beliefs.

Any of which will undermine Descartes' argument.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles#cite_note-belief-21)
