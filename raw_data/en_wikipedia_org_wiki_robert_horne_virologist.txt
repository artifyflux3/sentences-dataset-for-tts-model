Horne (21 January 1923 – 13 November 2010) was a British virologist and expert in electron microscopy .

[ 1 ] Life and academic career [ edit ] Horne was raised in Montreal and served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He began his scientific career at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge , where he began working with transmission electron microscopes with Vernon Ellis Cosslett .

[ 1 ] He received his master's and doctorate from the University of Cambridge.

[ 2 ] In 1961, Horne moved to what was then the Institute of Animal Physiology (now the Babraham Institute ), and in 1968 he moved again to what became the John Innes Centre , directed by Roy Markham . Horne remained there as a department head until retiring in 1982.

[ 1 ] He continued working after his retirement as an honorary professor at the University of East Anglia .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In addition to his scientific interests, Horne was a sailing enthusiast and an artist who focused on marine art .

[ 1 ] Research [ edit ] Horne specialized in the use of electron microscopy to study viruses . In 1959, he and Sydney Brenner pioneered the technique of negative staining in electron microscopy and used it to study virus structure, beginning with bacteriophages .

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] With Peter Wildy and Willie Russell , Horne applied the technique to study the herpes simplex virus and the geometry of its capsid .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] In the 1960s, Horne, André Michel Lwoff , and Paul Tournier developed early systems of viral taxonomy .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] His work with Alec Bangham on phospholipids contributed to the discovery of liposomes .

[ 1 ] Horne wrote two books on virology and co-authored reference works in electron microscopy. He joined the editorial board of the journal Micron at its founding in 1969 and served as its editor-in-chief from 1978 to 1995.
