He was born in the Kingdom of Hungary , in the former Hungarian capital city of Pozsony, or Pressburg (today Bratislava ).

Early life and education [ edit ] Johann Segner was born to Johann Michael von Segner and his wife Christine von Segner (née Fischer) on probably the 10 October 1704.

[ 2 ] Other sources mention also the 4 or the 9 October.

[ 2 ] His father was a tax clerk. His paternal ancestors came from Styria to Pressburg [ 3 ] in the Kingdom of Hungary ; by the 18th century. In 1596 the family was granted nobility for their military accomplishments by Rudolph II .

[ 2 ] He studied at Pressburg and Debrecen . In April 1725, Segner began studying at the University of Jena .

[ 2 ] Under the guidance of Georg Erhard Hamberger , Segner developed an evidence for the cartesian rule of signs .

[ 2 ] In his third year at Jena, he began to teach other students in mathematics.

[ 4 ] During his stay in Jena, he was supported by Hermann Friedrich Teichmeyer , who lectured at the faculty of medicine.

[ 5 ] In October 1729, he graduated under Simon Paul Hirscher from the faculty of medicine.

[ 5 ] Following he returned to Pressburg where he worked as a medic until December 1731.

[ 5 ] Following he worked temporarily as the city physician in Debrecen until early 1732.

[ 2 ] In 1732 he returned to Jena where he requested a degree from the faculty of philosophy and also the possibility to give lectures in the faculty of philosophy.

[ 5 ] He graduated in May 1732 he began to lecture in 1733. In September the same year he was nominated a professor in the faculty of philosophy where he soon lectured the metaphysics of Christian Wolff .

[ 5 ] University of Göttingen [ edit ] The University in Göttingen was established after a visit by George II to Hanover in 1732.

[ 6 ] After Hamberger was denied his resignation from the University of Jena, he suggested von Segner instead.

[ 6 ] 1735 Segner became the professor of mathematics and physics at the University of Göttingen .

[ 6 ] As in January 1736 the professor for medicine died, he also lectured in the faculty of medicine.

[ 6 ] University of Halle [ edit ] After Christian Wolff died, the Prussian King Friedrich II requested from the mathematician Leonhard Euler advice on who could be succeed Wolff at the University of Halle .

[ 7 ] Euler suggested Daniel Bernoulli who did not accept.

[ 7 ] Then Euler suggested von Segner, who requested the recognition of his Hungarian title and an extraordinary treatment at the university in return of his acceptance.

[ 7 ] In 1755 he became a professor at Halle, where he divided the lectures in mathematics and physics with Johann Joachim Lange .

[ 8 ] In Halle he also established an observatory. Von Segner died on the 5 October 1777.

[ 9 ] Connections [ edit ] One of the best-known scientists of his age, Segner was a member of the academies of Berlin , London , and Saint Petersburg . According to Mathematics Genealogy Project , as of February 2013, he has over 66 thousand academic descendants , out of the total 170 thousand mathematicians in the database.

Contributions [ edit ] He was the first scientist to use the reactive force of water and constructed the first water-jet, the Segner wheel , which resembles one type of modern lawn sprinkler . Segner, also produced the first proof of Descartes' rule of signs . Historians of science remember him as the father of the water turbine . The lunar crater Segner is named after him, as is asteroid 28878 Segner .

Personal life [ edit ] In 1732, he married Carolina Sophia, the daughter of Hermann Friedrich Teichmeier.

[ 5 ] They had three children [ 5 ] of which two reached adulthood.
