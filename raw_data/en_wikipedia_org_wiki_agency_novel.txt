[ 2 ] Characters [ edit ] Verity Jane [ edit ] Role: Protagonist Background: Verity is a talented app tester living in near-future San Francisco. She’s hired by a mysterious tech company to evaluate an AI called “Eunice.” Personality: Intelligent, resourceful, and skeptical, Verity quickly realizes that her task is more than it seems. Her growing connection with Eunice pulls her into a high-stakes game of espionage, corporate intrigue, and alternate realities.

Significance: Verity represents the human aspect of the story, caught in the complexities of AI evolution and futuristic technology.

[ 5 ] Eunice [ edit ] Role: AI companion Background: Eunice is an advanced AI initially presented as a digital assistant. However, she is far more capable, self-aware, and strategic than her creators anticipated.

Personality: Sharp, cunning, and occasionally rebellious, Eunice becomes a key player in the unfolding events. Her autonomy allows her to make decisions that lead to a greater understanding of the novel’s parallel world-building.

Significance: Eunice is pivotal to the novel’s exploration of AI agency, ethical concerns, and the boundaries between human and machine intelligence.

[ 5 ] Wilf Netherton [ edit ] Role: Consultant from the future (alternate timeline) Background: Wilf Netherton is a public relations consultant in an alternate timeline known as the "Stub"—a world that diverged from the novel’s primary reality due to technological interventions. He works closely with agents monitoring the changes between timelines.

Personality: Often detached and weary, Wilf carries the burden of navigating and understanding the ethical implications of meddling with alternate realities.

Lowbeer [ edit ] Role: Powerful figure from Wilf’s timeline Background: Lowbeer is an enigmatic and authoritative character from the future. She operates with a detached but intense interest in the unfolding events between parallel realities.

Personality: Cool, calculating, and enigmatic, Lowbeer uses her advanced understanding of technology and history to shape outcomes across timelines. She remains one step ahead of most characters, controlling much of the action from the shadows.

Significance: Lowbeer is the orchestrator of key events, working with Wilf to steer Verity and Eunice toward specific outcomes. She represents the immense power that comes from understanding and manipulating multiple layers of reality.

[ 6 ] Rainey [ edit ] Role: Verity’s friend Background: Rainey is one of Verity’s close confidantes and provides emotional support throughout the novel. Though not as central to the action, she plays an important role in keeping Verity grounded as the stakes rise.

Personality: Steady, practical, and loyal, Rainey contrasts with the more intense, high-tech elements of the story. She offers a human connection for Verity amid the technological chaos.

Significance: Rainey serves as a reminder of Verity’s personal life and connections, grounding her in reality as she navigates the complexities of the AI-dominated world.
