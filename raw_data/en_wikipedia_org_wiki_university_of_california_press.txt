It was founded in 1893 [ 2 ] to publish scholarly and scientific works by faculty of the University of California, established 25 years earlier in 1868.

As the publishing arm of the University of California system, the press publishes over 250 new books and almost four dozen multi-issue journals annually, in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, and maintains approximately 4,000 book titles in print.

[ 3 ] It is also the digital publisher of Collabra and Luminos open access (OA) initiatives.

The press has its administrative office in downtown Oakland, California , an editorial branch office in Los Angeles , and a sales office in New York , and distributes through marketing offices in Great Britain, Asia, Australia, and Latin America. A Board consisting of senior officers of the University of California, holds responsibility for the operations of the press, and authorizes and approves all manuscripts for publication. The Editorial Committee consists of distinguished faculty members representing the university's nine campuses.

[ 4 ] The press commissioned as its corporate typeface University of California Old Style from type designer Frederic Goudy from 1936 to 1938, although it no longer always uses the design.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] University of California Press joined the Association of American Publishers trade organization in the Hachette v. Internet Archive lawsuit which resulted in the removal of access to over 500,000 books from global readers.
