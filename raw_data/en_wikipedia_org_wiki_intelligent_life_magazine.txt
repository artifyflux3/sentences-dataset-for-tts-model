[ 1 ] Named after the year The Economist was founded, 1843 offers a complementary perspective to its sister publication, focusing more on narrative, rather than analysis. Like The Economist , 1843 is based in London and has a global readership. Like the newspaper, the magazine is owned by the Economist Group , a British media holding company.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] History [ edit ] The magazine was launched under the title Intelligent Life in September 2007 as a quarterly publication, having previously been a summer annual and was billed as covering "the arts, style, food, wine, cars, travel and anything else under the sun, as long as it's interesting." [ 2 ] In March 2016, the Economist Group relaunched and rebranded Intelligent Life as 1843 (named for The Economist ' s founding year).

[ 4 ] 1843 magazine features contributions from The Economist' s journalists, as well as writers and photographers from around the world. It is edited by Rosie Blau.

[ 5 ] It is seen as akin to The Wall Street Journal 's WSJ.

and the Financial Times ' FT Magazine .

[ 6 ] It has won awards for its journalism from the British Society of Magazine Editors , [ 7 ] the Association of Illustrators , [ 8 ] British Journalism Awards , [ 9 ] the Foreign Press Association Media Awards, [ 10 ] the Migration Media Awards, [ 11 ] Fortnum & Mason Food and Drink Awards [ 12 ] and the Travel Media Awards.

[ 13 ] In May 2020 it was announced that 1843 would move to a digital-only format.
