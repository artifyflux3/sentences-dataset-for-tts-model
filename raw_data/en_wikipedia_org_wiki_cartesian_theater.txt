It mockingly describes the idea of consciousness as a centralized "stage" in the brain where perceptions are presented to an internal observer. Dennett ties this to Cartesian materialism , which he considers to be the often unacknowledged residue of René Descartes’ dualism in modern materialist views. This model implies an infinite regress , as each observer would require another to perceive it, a problem Dennett argues misrepresents how consciousness actually emerges.

The phrase echoes earlier skepticism from Dennett’s teacher, Gilbert Ryle , who in The Concept of Mind (1949) similarly derided Cartesian dualism’s depiction of the mind as a "private theater" or "second theater." [ 1 ] Vancouver-based independent software vendor Cartesian Theatre drew its corporate name from Dennett's concept to emphasize the often neglected contributions of philosophy of mind to the field of artificial intelligence.

[ 2 ] Overview [ edit ] Descartes originally claimed that consciousness requires an immaterial soul, which interacts with the body via the pineal gland of the brain.

[ 3 ] Dennett says that, when the dualism is removed, what remains of Descartes' original model amounts to imagining a tiny theater in the brain where a homunculus (small person), now physical, performs the task of observing all the sensory data projected on a screen at a particular instant, making the decisions and sending out commands (see Homunculus argument ).

[ 4 ] The term "Cartesian theater" was brought up in the context of the multiple drafts model that Dennett posits in Consciousness Explained (1991): Cartesian materialism is the view that there is a crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of "presentation" in experience because what happens there is what you are conscious of. ... Many theorists would insist that they have explicitly rejected such an obviously bad idea. But ... the persuasive imagery of the Cartesian Theater keeps coming back to haunt us—laypeople and scientists alike—even after its ghostly dualism has been denounced and exorcized.
