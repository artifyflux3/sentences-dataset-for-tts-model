[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] He is renowned for his pioneering work in spectroscopy.

[ 7 ] Life and work [ edit ] Adams was born in Antioch , Ottoman Empire , to Lucien Harper Adams and Nancy Dorrance Francis Adams, missionary parents, [ 8 ] and was brought to the U.S.

in 1885 [ 1 ] He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1898, then continued his education in Chicago and in Germany . After returning to the U.S., he began a career in Astronomy that culminated when he became director of the Mount Wilson Observatory .

His primary interest was the study of stellar spectra . He worked on solar spectroscopy and co-discovered a relationship between the relative intensities of certain spectral lines and the absolute magnitude of a star. He was able to demonstrate that spectra could be used to determine whether a star was a giant or a dwarf . In 1915 he began a study of the companion of Sirius and found that despite a size only slightly larger than the Earth , the surface of the star was brighter per unit area than the Sun and it was about as massive .

[ 9 ] Such a star later came to be known as a white dwarf . In 1925, he reported a gravitational redshift caused by Sirius B; this was regarded as significant confirmation of Albert Einstein 's theory of General Relativity. It is now known that his reported measurements were incorrect. Along with Theodore Dunham , he discovered the strong presence of carbon dioxide in the infrared spectrum of Venus .

Adams died at the age of 79 in Pasadena, California .
