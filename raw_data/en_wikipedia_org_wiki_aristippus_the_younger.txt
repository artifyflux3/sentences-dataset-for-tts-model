380 BC), of Cyrene , was a Cyrenaic philosopher in the second half of the 4th century BC. He was the grandson of Aristippus of Cyrene , the founder of the school. According to Diogenes Laërtius , he received the nickname "Mother-taught" ( metrodidaktos ).

[ 1 ] because he learned philosophy from his mother, Arete of Cyrene , who was the daughter of the elder Aristippus. Diogenes lists Theodorus the Atheist as one of his students.

[ 2 ] According to Aristocles of Messene , as quoted by Eusebius , he may have formalized the principles of Cyrenaic philosophy.: He quite plainly defined the end to be the life of pleasure, ranking as pleasure that which lies in motion. For he said that there are three states affecting our temperament: one, in which we feel pain, like a storm at sea; another, in which we feel pleasure, that may be likened to a gentle undulation, for pleasure is a gentle movement, comparable to a favourable breeze; and the third is an intermediate state, in which we feel neither pain nor pleasure, which is similar to a calm.

[ 3 ] Not much else is known about Aristippus the Younger. According to Debra Nails , he may have been conflated with his grandfather.
