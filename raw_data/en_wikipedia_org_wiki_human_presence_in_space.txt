**Human presence in space** (also **anthropogenic presence in space** or **humanity in space**) is the direct and mediated presence or [telepresence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepresence "Telepresence") of humans in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Presence-1) and in an extended sense across space including [astronomical bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_body "Astronomical body"). Human presence in space, particularly through mediation, can take many physical forms from [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris"), [uncrewed spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft "Uncrewed spacecraft"), [artificial satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellites "Artificial satellites"), [space observatories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_observatories "Space observatories"), [crewed spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crewed_spacecraft "Crewed spacecraft"), [art in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#Art_in_space "Space art"), to [human outposts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_outpost "Human outpost") in outer space such as [space stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station "Space station").

While human presence in space, particularly its continuation and permanence can be a goal in itself,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Presence-1) human presence can have a range of purposes[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Next-2) and modes from [space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration "Space exploration"), [commercial use of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_use_of_space "Commercial use of space") to [extraterrestrial settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_settlement "Extraterrestrial settlement") or even [space colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization "Space colonization") and [militarisation of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarisation_of_space "Militarisation of space"). Human presence in space is realized and sustained through the advancement and application of [space sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_science "Space science"), particularly [astronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics "Astronautics") in the form of spaceflight and [space infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_infrastructure "Space infrastructure").

Humans have achieved some mediated presence throughout the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), but the most extensive presence has been in [orbit around Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit "Geocentric orbit"). Humans reached outer space mediated in 1944 ([MW 18014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MW_18014 "MW 18014")) and have sustained mediated presence since 1958 ([Vanguard 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_1 "Vanguard 1")),[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-IdeaManNote-4) as well as having reached space directly for the first time on [12 April 1961](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_of_Human_Space_Flight "International Day of Human Space Flight") ([Yuri Gagarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin "Yuri Gagarin")) and continuously since the year 2000 with the crewed [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") (ISS), or since the later 1980s with some few interruptions through crewing its predecessor, the space station [Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Station-5) The increasing and extensive human presence in orbital space around Earth, beside its benefits, has also produced a threat to it by carrying with it space debris, potentially cascading into the so-called [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome "Kessler syndrome").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Kessler-6) This has raised the need for [regulation and mitigation of such](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_traffic_management "Space traffic management") to secure a [sustainable access to outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_sustainability "Space sustainability").

Securing the access to space and human presence in space has been pursued and allowed by the establishment of [space law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_law "Space law") and [space industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_industry "Space industry"), creating a [space infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_infrastructure "Space infrastructure"). But sustainability has remained a challenging goal, with the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") seeing the need to advance long-term [sustainability of outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_sustainability "Space sustainability") activities in space science and application,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-UN-7) and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") having it as a crucial goal of its contemporary [space policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_policy "Space policy") and [space program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_program "Space program").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-NASA_sustainability-8)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Artemis-9)

For [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") being the dominant expanse of [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space"), "space" is often used synonymously for outer space, referring to human presence in space to human presence across all of space, including astronomical bodies which outer space surrounds.

The United States has been using the term "_human presence_" to identify one of the long-term goals of its space program and its international cooperation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Presence-1)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Bartels_2018-10) While it traditionally means and is used to name direct human presence, it is also used for mediated presence.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Presence-1) Differentiating human presence in space between direct and mediated human presence, meaning human or non-human presence, such as with [crewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crewed_spacecraft "Crewed spacecraft") or uncrewed spacecraft, is rooted in a history of how human presence is to be understood (see [dedicated chapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#Study_and_reception)).

Human, particularly direct, presence in space is sometimes replaced with "boots on the ground"[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Presence-1) or equated with space colonization. But such terms, particularly [colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization "Colonization")[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Bartels_2018-10) and even [settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler_colonialism "Settler colonialism") has been avoided[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Presence-1) and questioned to describe human presence in space, since they employ very particular concepts of [appropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_appropriation "Original appropriation"), with historic baggage,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-11)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-12)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-13) addressing the forms of human presence in a particular and not general way.

Alternatively some have used the term "_humanization of space_",[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-smithsonian-15)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Dickens-MR-2010-11-16) which differs in focusing on the general development, impact and structure of human presence in space.

On an international level the United Nations uses the phrase of "_outer space activity_" for the activity of its member states in space.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-UN-7)

Human presence in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") began with the first launches of [artificial object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_object "Artificial object") in the mid 20th century, and has increased to the point where Earth is orbited by a vast number of artificial objects and the far reaches of the Solar System have been visited and explored by a range of space probes. Human presence throughout the Solar System is continued by different contemporary and future missions, most of them mediating human presence through [robotic spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_spaceflight "Robotic spaceflight").

First a realized project of the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") and followed in competition by the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), human presence in space is now an increasingly international and commercial field.

Representation, participation and regulation
--------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_presence_in_space&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Representation, participation and regulation")]

Participation and representation of humanity in space is an issue of human access to and presence in space ever since the beginning of spaceflight.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Durrani-17) Different [space agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_agency "Space agency"), [space programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_program "Space program") and interest groups such as the [International Astronomical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union "International Astronomical Union") have been formed supporting or producing humanity's or a particular human presence in space. Representation has been shaped by the inclusiveness, scope and [varying capabilities of these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#Spacefaring "Spaceflight") organizations and programs.

Some rights of non-spacefaring countries to partake in spaceflight have been secured through international [space law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_law "Space law"), declaring space the "[province of all mankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind "Common heritage of mankind")", understanding spaceflight as its resource, though sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized as [imperialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism") and lacking,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Durrani-17)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Bartels_2018-10) particularly regarding regulation of private spceflight.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Wheeling_2019-18)

Additionally to international inclusion the [inclusion of women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space "Women in space"),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-10percent-19)[people of colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_colour "People of colour") and with [disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_studies "Disability studies") has also been lacking.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Link_2022-20)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-e485-21)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-l062-22) To reach a more inclusive spaceflight some organizations like the _Justspace Alliance_[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Durrani-17) and [IAU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU "IAU") featured _Inclusive Astronomy_[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-23) have been formed in recent years.

Space activity is legally based on the [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty "Outer Space Treaty"), the main international treaty. Though there are other international agreements such as the significantly less ratified [Moon Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Treaty "Moon Treaty").

The Outer Space Treaty established the basic ramifications for space activity in article one: "_The exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind._"

And continued in article two by stating: "_Outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means._"[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-unoda-24)

The development of international space law has revolved much around outer space being defined as _common heritage of mankind_. The _Magna Carta of Space_ presented by William A. Hyman in 1966 framed outer space explicitly not as _[terra nullius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra\_nullius "Terra nullius")_ but as _[res communis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res\_communis "Res communis")_, which subsequently influenced the work of the [United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Committee_on_the_Peaceful_Uses_of_Outer_Space "United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space") (COPUOS).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Durrani-17)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-25)

The [United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_Outer_Space_Affairs "United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs") and the [International Telecommunication Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union "International Telecommunication Union") are international organizations central for facilitating space regulation, such as [space traffic management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_traffic_management "Space traffic management").

### Signals and radiation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_presence_in_space&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Signals and radiation")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Starlink_Satellites_Imaged_from_CTIO.jpeg/250px-Starlink_Satellites_Imaged_from_CTIO.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Starlink_Satellites_Imaged_from_CTIO.jpeg)

Humans have been producing a range of [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation") which has reached space unintentionally as well as intentionally, well before any direct human presence in space. [Electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") such as light, of humans, has been reaching even stars as far away as the age of the radiation.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-26)

Beginning in the 20th century, humans have been sending radiation significantly into space. [Nuclear explosions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_explosion "Nuclear explosion"), especially [high-altitude ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_nuclear_explosion "High-altitude nuclear explosion") have since at times, starting with 1958, just a year after the first satellite Sputnik was launched, introduced strong and broad radiation from humans into space, producing [electromagnetic pulses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse "Electromagnetic pulse") and [orbital radiation belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_radiation_belts "List of artificial radiation belts"), adding to the explosion's destructive potential on ground and in orbit.

While Earth's and humanities radiation profile is the main material for [space based remote Earth observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation_satellite "Earth observation satellite"), but radiation by human activity from Earth and from space has also been an obstacle for human activities, such as spiritual life[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-global-commons-27)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-28) or [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") through [light pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution "Light pollution")[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-29) and [radio spectrum pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum_pollution "Radio spectrum pollution") from Earth and space. In the case of [radio astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy "Radio astronomy")[radio quiet zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_quiet_zone "Radio quiet zone") have been kept and sought out, with the [far side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon "Far side of the Moon") being most pristine facing away from human made [electromagnetic interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference "Electromagnetic interference").

### Space junk and human impact

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_presence_in_space&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Space junk and human impact")]

[![Image 6: Objects in Earth orbit including fragmentation debris. November 2020 NASA:ODPO](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/LEO-SpaceDebris-Nov2020.png/500px-LEO-SpaceDebris-Nov2020.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LEO-SpaceDebris-Nov2020.png)

Space junk as product and form of human presence in space has existed ever since the first orbital spaceflights and comes mostly in the form of space debris in outer space. Space debris has been for example possibly the first human objects to have been present in space beyond Earth, reaching its [escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity "Escape velocity") after being ejected purposefully from an exploded [Aerobee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobee "Aerobee") rocket in 1957.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-IdeaMan-3) Most space debris is in orbit around Earth, it can stay there for years to centuries if at altitudes from hundreds to thousands of kilometers, before it falls to Earth.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-30) Space debris is a hazard since it can hit and damage spacecraft. Having reached considerable amounts around Earth, policies have been put into place to prevent space debris and hazards, such as [international regulation to prevent nuclear hazards in Earth's orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_space#Regulation_and_hazard_prevention "Nuclear power in space") and the [Registration Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration_Convention "Registration Convention") as part of space traffic management.

But space junk can also come as result of human activity on astronomical bodies, such as the remains of space missions, like the many [artificial objects left behind on the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_objects_on_the_Moon "List of artificial objects on the Moon"),[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-31) and [on other bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_objects_on_extraterrestrial_surfaces "List of artificial objects on extraterrestrial surfaces").

Human presence in space has been strongly based on the many [robotic spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_spacecraft "Robotic spacecraft"), particularly as the many [artificial satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite "Artificial satellite") in orbit around Earth.

Many firsts of human presence in space have been achieved by robotic missions. The first artificial object to reach space, above the 100 km altitude [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line"), and therefore performing the first [sub-orbital flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_flight "Sub-orbital flight") was [MW 18014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MW_18014 "MW 18014") in 1944. But the first sustained presence in space was established by the [orbital flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_flight "Orbital flight") of [Sputnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik "Sputnik") in 1957. Followed by a rich number of robotic [space probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe "Space probe") achieving human presence and exploration throughout the Solar system for the first time.

Human presence at the Moon was established by the [Luna programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_programme "Luna programme") starting in 1959, with a first [flyby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyby_(spaceflight) "Flyby (spaceflight)") and [heliocentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit "Heliocentric orbit") ([Luna 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_1 "Luna 1")), a first arrival of an artificial object on the surface with an [impactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impactor_(spacecraft) "Impactor (spacecraft)") ([Luna 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_2 "Luna 2")), and a for the first time a successful flight to the [far side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon "Far side of the Moon") ([Luna 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_3 "Luna 3")). The Moon then was in 1966 visited for the first time by a [lander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander_(spacecraft) "Lander (spacecraft)") ([Luna 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_9 "Luna 9")), as well as an [orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbiter "Orbiter") ([Luna 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_10 "Luna 10")), and in 1970 for the first time a [rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rover_(space_exploration) "Rover (space exploration)") ([Lunokhod 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunokhod_1 "Lunokhod 1")) landed on an extraterrestrial body. [Interplanetary presence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_spaceflight "Interplanetary spaceflight") was established at Venus by the [Venera program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_program "Venera program"), with a [flyby in 1961 (Venera 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_1 "Venera 1") and [a crash in 1966 (Venera 3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_3 "Venera 3").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-32)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-33)

Presence in the [outer Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System#Outer_Solar_System "Solar System") was achieved by _[Pioneer 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer\_10 "Pioneer 10")_ in 1972[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Pioneer-34) and presence in [interstellar space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_space "Interstellar space") by _[Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager\_1 "Voyager 1")_ in 2012.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Voyager-35)

The 1958 [Vanguard 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_1 "Vanguard 1") is the fourth artificial satellite and the oldest spacecraft still in space and orbit around Earth, though inactive.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-vanguard-36)

### Presence of non-human life from Earth

[Laika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika "Laika") was sent into space in 1957, without plans for survival on return, becoming the first animal (including humans) to reach orbit.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-RussiaOpensMonument-37) Here in her flight harness on a [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania "Romania") stamp from 1959.

Since the very beginning of human outer space activities in 1944, and [possibly before that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia "Panspermia"),[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-The_University_of_Edinburgh_2017-38) life has been present with [microscopic life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_life "Microscopic life") as [space contaminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_contamination "Interplanetary contamination") and after 1960 as [space research subjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_microorganisms_tested_in_outer_space "List of microorganisms tested in outer space"). Prior to crewed spaceflight non-human [animals had been subjects of space research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals_in_space "Animals in space"), specifically [bioastronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioastronautics "Bioastronautics") and [astrobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology "Astrobiology"), being exposed to ever higher testflights. The first animals (including humans) and [plant seeds in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_in_space "Plants in space") above the 100 km [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line") were [corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn "Corn") seeds [and fruit flies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_flies_in_space "Fruit flies in space"), launched for the first time on 9 July 1946,[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-White_Sands_1946-39) with the first fruit flies launched and returned alive in 1947.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-40) In 1949 [Albert II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_II_(monkey) "Albert II (monkey)"), became the first [mammal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal "Mammal") and [first primate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkeys_and_apes_in_space "Monkeys and apes in space") reaching the 100 km Kármán line, and in 1957 the dog [Laika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika "Laika") became the first animal in orbit, with both also becoming the first fatalities of spaceflight and in space, respectively. In 1968, on [Zond 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zond_5 "Zond 5") tortoises, insects and planets became the first animals (incl. humans) and plants to fly to and returned safely from the Moon and any extraterrestrial flight. In 2019 [Chang'e 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_4 "Chang'e 4") landed fruit flies on the Moon, the first extraterrestrial stay of non-human animals.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Numbers_2018_l047-41)

Visits of organisms to extraterrestrial bodies have been a significant issue of [planetary protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_protection "Planetary protection"), as with the [crash of tardigrades on the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_on_the_Moon "Tardigrades on the Moon") in 2019.

Plants first grown in 1966 with [Kosmos 110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_110 "Kosmos 110")[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-42) and in 1971 on [Salyut 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_1 "Salyut 1"), with the first producing seeds August 4, 1982 on [Salyut 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_7 "Salyut 7").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Magazine_2003-43) The first plant to sprout on the Moon and any extraterrestrial body grew in 2019, on the [Chang'e 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_4 "Chang'e 4") lander.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Castelvecchi_Tatalovi%C4%87_2019_w411-44)

Plants and growing them in space and places such as the Moon have been important subjects of space research, but also as psychological support and possibly nutrition during continuous crewed presence in space.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Magazine_2003-43)

### Direct human presence in space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_presence_in_space&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Direct human presence in space")]

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Tracy_Caldwell_Dyson_in_Cupola_ISS.jpg/330px-Tracy_Caldwell_Dyson_in_Cupola_ISS.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tracy_Caldwell_Dyson_in_Cupola_ISS.jpg)

[International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") crewmember [Tracy Caldwell Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Caldwell_Dyson "Tracy Caldwell Dyson") views the Earth, 2010.

Direct human presence in space was achieved with [Yuri Gagarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin "Yuri Gagarin") flying a [space capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule "Space capsule") in 1961 for one orbit around Earth for the first time. While direct human presence in open space, by exiting a spacecraft in a [spacesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacesuit "Spacesuit"), a so-called [extravehicular activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity"), has been achieved since the first person to do so, [Alexei Leonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Leonov "Alexei Leonov"), in 1965.

Though [Valentina Tereshkova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_Tereshkova "Valentina Tereshkova") was in 1963 the first woman in space, women saw no further presence in space until the 1980s and are still underrepresented, e.g. with no women ever being present on the Moon.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-10percent-19) An internationalization of direct human presence in space started with the first [space rendezvous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous "Space rendezvous") of two crews of different [human spaceflight programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight_programs "Human spaceflight programs"), the [Apollo–Soyuz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz "Apollo–Soyuz") mission in 1975 and at the end of the 1970s with the [Interkosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interkosmos "Interkosmos") program.

[Space stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station "Space station") have harboured so far the only long-duration direct human presence in space. After the first station [Salyut 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_1 "Salyut 1") (1971) and its tragic [Soyuz 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_11 "Soyuz 11") crew, space stations have been operated consecutively since [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab "Skylab") (1973), having allowed a progression of long-duration direct human presence in space. Long-duration direct human presence has been joined by visiting crews since 1977 ([Salyut 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_6 "Salyut 6")). Consecutive direct human presence in space has been achieved since the [Salyut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_program "Salyut program") successor [Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir") starting with 1987. This was continued until the operational transition from the Mir to the [ISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISS "ISS"), giving rise with its first occupation to an uninterrupted direct human presence in space since 2000.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Station-5) While human population records in orbit developed from 1 in 1961, 2 in 1962, 4–7 in 1969, 7–11 in 1984 and 13 in 1995,[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-45) to 14 in 2021, 17 in 2023[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Pearlman_2023-46) and 19 in 2024,[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-d550-47) developing into a continuous population of no less than 10 people on two space stations since 5 June 2022 (as of 2024).[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-s693-48) The ISS has hosted the most people in space at the same time, reaching 13 for the first time during the eleven day docking of [STS-127](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-127 "STS-127") in 2009.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Canadian_Space_Agency_2008-49)

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/STS-131_%26_Expedition_23_Group_Portrait.jpg/330px-STS-131_%26_Expedition_23_Group_Portrait.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:STS-131_%26_Expedition_23_Group_Portrait.jpg)

[STS-131](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-131 "STS-131") and [Expedition 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_23 "Expedition 23") crew members gather for a group portrait of 13 in 2010, which set the record of four women at the same time in space.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-50)

Beyond Earth the Moon has been the only astronomical object which so far has seen direct human presence through the week long [Apollo missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program") between 1968 and 1972, beginning with the first orbit by [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8 "Apollo 8") in 1968 and with the first landing by [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11") in 1969. The longest extraterrestrial human stay was three days by [Apollo 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_17 "Apollo 17").

While most persons who have been to space are [astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronauts "Astronauts"), professional members of [human spaceflight programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight_programs "Human spaceflight programs"), particularly governmental ones, the few others, starting in the 1980s, have been trained and gone to space as [spaceflight participants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_participant "Spaceflight participant"), with the first [space tourist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourist "Space tourist") staying in space in 2001.

By the end of the 2010s several hundred people from more than [40 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_space_travel_by_nationality "Timeline of space travel by nationality") have gone into space, most of them reaching orbit. 24 people have [traveled to the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lunar_astronauts "List of lunar astronauts") and 12 of them [walked on the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apollo_astronauts#People_who_have_walked_on_the_Moon "List of Apollo astronauts").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-astronaut1-51) Space travelers have spent by 2007 over 29,000 person-days (or a cumulative total of over 77 years) in space including over 100 person-days of [spacewalks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewalk "Spacewalk").[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-52) Usual durations for individuals to inhabit space on long-duration stays are six months,[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Kennedy_Space_Center-53) with the [longest stays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_longest_spaceflights "Timeline of longest spaceflights") on record being at about a year.

[Apollo 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_12 "Apollo 12") astronaut [Pete Conrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Conrad "Pete Conrad") with [Surveyor 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveyor_3 "Surveyor 3") and Apollo 12 [lunar base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_base "Lunar base") with the _Intrepid_ lander and S-band antenna in the background, in a first ever [visit of a separate mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous "Space rendezvous") beyond [Low Earth Orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_Orbit "Low Earth Orbit")[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-g936-54)

A permanent human presence in space depends on an established space infrastructure which harbours, supplies and maintains human presence. Such [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure "Infrastructure") has originally been Earth [ground-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_segment "Ground segment"), but with increased numbers of [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") and long-duration missions beyond the [near side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_side_of_the_Moon "Near side of the Moon") space-to-space based infrastructure is being used. First simple interplanetary infrastructures have been created by [space probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe "Space probe") particularly when employing a system which combines a [lander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander_(spacecraft) "Lander (spacecraft)") and a relaying [orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbiter "Orbiter").

Space stations are [space habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_habitat_(facility) "Space habitat (facility)") which have provided a crucial infrastructure for sustaining a continuous direct human, including non-human, presence in space. Space stations have been continuously present in orbit around Earth from [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab "Skylab") in 1973, to the [Salyut stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_programme "Salyut programme"), Mir and eventually ISS. The planned [Artemis program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program "Artemis program") includes the [Lunar Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Gateway "Lunar Gateway") a future space station around the Moon as a multimission waystation.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-55)

### Spiritual and artistic

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Fallen_Astronaut.jpg/330px-Fallen_Astronaut.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fallen_Astronaut.jpg)

_[Fallen Astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen\_Astronaut "Fallen Astronaut")_ sculpture by Paul Van Hoeydonck, placed on the Moon by [David Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scott "David Scott") of [Apollo 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_15 "Apollo 15")

Human presence has also been expressed through spiritual and artistic installations in outer space or [on the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon#Human_impact "Moon"). [Apollo 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_15 "Apollo 15") Mission Commander [David Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scott "David Scott") left for example a Bible on their [Lunar Roving Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Roving_Vehicle "Lunar Roving Vehicle") during an [extravehicular activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity") on the Moon. Space has furthermore been the site of people taking part in religious festivities such as [Christmas on the International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_on_the_International_Space_Station "Christmas on the International Space Station").

For basic general outer space presence, as in Earth sub-orbital to orbital presence, see above the overlaping chapter of ["Forms"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#Forms) of human presence in space.

Human presence in [Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit "Geocentric orbit") and [heliocentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit "Heliocentric orbit") has been the case with a [range of artificial objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_objects_in_heliocentric_orbit "List of artificial objects in heliocentric orbit") since the beginning of spaceflight (both possibly with debris since 1957,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-IdeaMan-3) but for sure since 1958 with [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1 "Sputnik 1") and in 1959 with [Luna 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_1 "Luna 1") respectively), and at more [interplanetary heliocentric orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_spaceflight "Interplanetary spaceflight") since 1961 with [Venera 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_1 "Venera 1"). [Extraterrestrial orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_insertion "Orbital insertion") other than heliocentric orbit has been achieved since 1966, starting with [Luna 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_10 "Luna 10") around the Moon and several at the same time in orbit of the Moon that same year starting with [Lunar Orbiter 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_1 "Lunar Orbiter 1"), and since 1971 with [Mariner 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_9 "Mariner 9") around another planet (Mars).

Humans have also used and occupied [co-orbital configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-orbital_configuration "Co-orbital configuration"), [particularly at different liberation points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_objects_at_Lagrange_points "List of objects at Lagrange points") with [halo orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit "Halo orbit"), to harness the benefits of those so called [Lagrange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point "Lagrange point").

Some interplanetary missions, particularly the _[Ulysses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses\_(spacecraft) "Ulysses (spacecraft)")_ solar polar probe and considerably _[Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager\_1 "Voyager 1")_ and _[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager2 "Voyager2")_, as well as others like _[Pioneer 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer\_10 "Pioneer 10")_ and _[11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer\_11 "Pioneer 11")_, have entered trajectories taking them out of the [ecliptic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic#Plane_of_the_Solar_System "Ecliptic").

Humanity has reached different types of astronomical bodies, but the longest and most diverse presence (including non-human, e.g. sprouting plants[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Seeds-56)) has been [on the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_the_Moon "List of missions to the Moon"), particularly because it is the first and only extraterrestrial body having been directly visited by humans.

Space probes have been establishing and mediating human presence interplanetarily since their [first visits to Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_Venus "List of missions to Venus"). Mars has seen a continuous presence [since 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Pathfinder "Mars Pathfinder"),[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Mars1997-57) after being [first flown by in 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_4 "Mariner 4") and [landed on in 1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_3 "Mars 3"). [A group of missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_Mars "List of missions to Mars") have been present on Mars [since 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Mars_Odyssey "2001 Mars Odyssey"), including continuous presence by a series of rovers [since 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover) "Spirit (rover)").

Beside having reached some [planetary-mass objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet#Planetary-mass_objects "Planet") (that is [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), [dwarf planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet "Dwarf planet") or the largest, so-called [planetary-mass moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary-mass_moon "Planetary-mass moon")), humans have also reached, landed and in some cases even returned robotic probes from some [small Solar System bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Solar_System_body "Small Solar System body"), like [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid") and [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet"), with a [range of space probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_planets_and_comets_visited_by_spacecraft "List of minor planets and comets visited by spacecraft").

The Solar System region near the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun")'s [corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona "Stellar corona"), inside [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)")'s orbit, with its high [gravitational potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential "Gravitational potential") difference from Earth and the subsequent high [delta-v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "Delta-v") needed to reach it, has only been considerably pierced on highly [elliptic orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit "Elliptic orbit") by some [solar probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_probes#Solar_probes "List of Solar System probes") like [Helios 1 & 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_(spacecraft) "Helios (spacecraft)"), as well as the more contemporary [Parker Solar Probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe "Parker Solar Probe"). The latter being the closest to reach the Sun, breaking speed records with its very low solar altitudes at [perihelion apsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#Perihelion_and_aphelion "Apsis").

Future direct human presence beyond Earth's orbit is possibly going to be re-introduced if current plans for crewed [research stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_station "Research station") to be established [on Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars "Human mission to Mars") and [on the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonbase "Moonbase") are continued to be developed.

Human presence in the [outer Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System#Outer_Solar_System "Solar System") has been established by the first visit to [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") in 1973 by _Pioneer 10_.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Pioneer-34) Thirty years later nine probes had traveled to the Outer Solar System, and the first such probe (JUICE, the [Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Explorer "Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer")) by another space agency than NASA had just been launched on its way. Jupiter and [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn") are the only outer Solar System bodies which have been orbited by probes (Jupiter: _[Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo\_(spacecraft) "Galileo (spacecraft)")_ in 1995 and _[Juno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno\_(spacecraft) "Juno (spacecraft)")_ in 2016; Saturn: _[Cassini–Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens "Cassini–Huygens")_ in 2004), with all other outer Solar System probes performing flybys.

The Saturn moon [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon) "Titan (moon)"), with its special lunar atmosphere, has so far been the only body in the outer Solar System to be landed on by the _Cassini–Huygens_ lander _[Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens\_(spacecraft) "Huygens (spacecraft)")_ in 2005.

[Several probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_objects_leaving_the_Solar_System "List of artificial objects leaving the Solar System") have reached Solar [escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity "Escape velocity"), with _Voyager 1_ being the first to cross after 36 years of flight the [heliopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopause_(astronomy) "Heliopause (astronomy)") and enter [interstellar space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_space "Interstellar space") on August 25, 2012, at distance of 121 [AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit") from the Sun.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Voyager-35)

Living in outer space is fundamentally different to living on Earth. It is shaped by the characteristic environment of outer space, particularly its [microgravity (producing weightlessness)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgravity "Microgravity") and its near [perfect vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_vacuum "Perfect vacuum") (supplying few and producing unhindered exposure to radiation and material from far away). Mundane needs such as for air, pressure, temperature and light have to be accommodated completely by [life support systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support_system "Life support system"). Furthermore [movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotion_in_space "Locomotion in space"), [food intake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_food "Space food") and [hygiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautical_hygiene "Astronautical hygiene") is confronted with challenges.

Long-duration stays are particularly endangered by the prevalent [radiation exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_radiation_carcinogenesis "Spaceflight radiation carcinogenesis") and the [health effects of microgravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness#Human_health_effects "Weightlessness"). Human fatalities have been the case due to accidents during spaceflight, particularly at [launch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_launch "Space launch") and [reentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentry "Reentry"). With the last in-flight accident killing humans, the [Columbia accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_accident "Columbia accident") in 2003, the sum of in-flight fatalities has risen to 15 astronauts and 4 [cosmonauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmonaut "Cosmonaut"), in five separate incidents.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-59)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-60) Over 100 others have died in [accidents during activity directly related to spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spaceflight-related_accidents_and_incidents "List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents") or testing. None of them remained in space, but small parts of the remains of deceased people have been taken as [space burials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_burial "Space burial") to orbital space since 1992 and [controversially even to the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoemaker_(lunar_crater) "Shoemaker (lunar crater)") since 1999.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-web.archive.org_2011_c901-61)

Research has begun into the culture and "microsocieties" that are formed in space, with space archeologists analyzing residue from space environments to learn about astronaut life.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-62) A few incidents of astronauts from different countries having difficulties in getting along have also been studied.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-63)

Overview of key [space sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_sustainability "Space sustainability") issues under consideration

Human space activity, and its subsequent presence, can and has been having an impact on space as well as on the capacity to access it. This impact of human space activity and presence, or its potential, has created the need to address its issues regarding planetary protection, space debris, [nuclear hazards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_space#Regulation_and_hazard_prevention "Nuclear power in space"), [radio pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum_pollution "Radio spectrum pollution") and [light pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution#From_satellites "Light pollution"), to the [reusability of launch systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system "Reusable launch system"), for space not to become a [sacrifice zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_zone "Sacrifice zone").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Calma_2021-64)

Sustainability has been a goal of space law, [space technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_technology "Space technology") and space infrastructure, with the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") seeing the need to advance long-term sustainability of outer space activities in space science and application,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-UN-7) and the United States having it as a crucial goal of its contemporary [space policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_policy "Space policy") and space program.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-NASA_sustainability-8)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Artemis-9)

Human presence in space is particularly being felt in orbit around Earth. The orbital space around Earth has seen increasing and extensive human presence, beside its benefits it has also produced a threat to it by carrying with it space debris, potentially cascading into the so-called [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome "Kessler syndrome").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Kessler-6) This has raised the need for [regulation and mitigation of such](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_traffic_management "Space traffic management") to secure a [sustainable access to outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_sustainability "Space sustainability").

### Human presence observed from space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_presence_in_space&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Human presence observed from space")]

[![Image 22](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Earth_and_Moon_from_Mars_PIA04531.jpg/330px-Earth_and_Moon_from_Mars_PIA04531.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Earth_and_Moon_from_Mars_PIA04531.jpg)

Earth and Moon from Mars, imaged by [Mars Global Surveyor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Global_Surveyor "Mars Global Surveyor") on May 8, 2003, 13:00 [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC "UTC"). South America is visible.

[Earth observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation "Earth observation") has been one of the first missions of spaceflight, resulting in a dense contemporary presence of [Earth observation satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation_satellite "Earth observation satellite"), having a wealth of uses and benefits for life on Earth.

Viewing human presence from space, particularly by humans directly, has been reported by some astronauts to cause a [cognitive shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_shift "Cognitive shift") in perception, especially while viewing the Earth from outer space, this effect has been called the [overview effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect "Overview effect").

### Observation of space from space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_presence_in_space&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Observation of space from space")]

Parallel to the above _overview effect_ the term "ultraview effect" has been introduced for a subjective response of intense awe some astronauts have experienced viewing large "starfields" while in space.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-68)

[Space observatories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_observatory "Space observatory") like the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope "Hubble Space Telescope") have been present in Earth's orbit, benefiting from advantages from being outside Earth's atmosphere and away from its [radio noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_noise "Radio noise"), resulting in less distorted observation results.

### Direct and mediated human presence

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_presence_in_space&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Direct and mediated human presence")]

Related to the long discussion of what human presence constitutes and how it should be lived, the discussion about direct (e.g. crewed) and mediated (e.g. uncrewed) human presence, has been decisive for how space policy makers have chosen human presence and its purposes.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-69)

The relevance of this issue for space policy has risen with the advancement and resulting possibilities of [telerobotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telerobotics "Telerobotics"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Presence-1) to the point where most of the human presence in space has been reallized robotically, leaving direct human presence behind.

### Localization in space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_presence_in_space&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Localization in space")]

The location of human presence has been studied throughout history by astronomy and was significant in order to relate to the heavens, that is to outer space and its bodies.

The historic argument between [geocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism "Geocentrism") and [heliocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism "Heliocentrism") is one example about the location of human presence.

Realizations of the [scales of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_of_Earth "Location of Earth"), have been taken as subject to discuss human and life's existence or relations to [space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") beyond them, with some understanding humanity's or life's presence as a [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis "Rare Earth hypothesis") or one to be in [isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples "Uncontacted peoples"), pondering on the [Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox "Fermi paradox").

A diverse range of arguments of how to relate to space beyond human presence have been raised, with some seeing space beyond humans as reason to venture out into space and exploring it, some aiming for [contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_contact_(anthropology) "First contact (anthropology)") with [extraterrestrial life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life "Extraterrestrial life"), to arguments for [protection of humanity or life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_protection "Planetary protection") from its possibilities.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-70)[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-71)

Considerations about the ecological integrity[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Gorman_2022-72) and independence of celestial bodies, counter exploitive understandings of space as dead, particularly in the sense of [terra nullius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_nullius "Terra nullius"), have raised issues such as [rights of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_of_nature "Rights of nature").

[Earth observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation "Earth observation"), like with this famous [image of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Images_of_Earth "Images of Earth") called [Blue Marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Marble "Blue Marble"), has been one of the most basic uses of outer space, having enabled a critical awareness of the global dimension of humanity's impact on Earth.

Space and human presence in it has been the subject of different agendas.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Next-2)

Human presence in space at its beginnings, was fueled by the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War") and its outgrowing the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race"). During this time technological, nationalist, ideological and [military competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization_of_space "Militarization of space") were dominant driving factors of space policy[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-73) and the resulting activity and, particularly direct human, presence in space.

With the waning of the Space Race, concluded by [cooperation in human spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz "Apollo–Soyuz"), focus shifted in the 1970s further to space exploration and [telerobotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telerobotics "Telerobotics"), having a range of achievements and technological advances.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-74) Space exploration meant by then also an engagement by governments in the [search for extraterrestrial life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_life "Search for extraterrestrial life").

Since human activity and presence in space has been producing [spin-off benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefits_of_space_exploration "Benefits of space exploration"), other than for the above purposes, such as Earth observation and [communication satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_satellite "Communication satellite") for civilian use, international cooperation to advance such benefits of human presence in space grew with time.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-75) Particularly for the purpose of continuing benefits of space infrastructure and [space science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_science "Space science") the United Nations has been pushing for safeguarding [human activity in outer space in a sustainable way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_sustainability "Space sustainability").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-UN-7)

With the contemporary so-called [NewSpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewSpace "NewSpace"), the aim of [commercialization of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercialization_of_space "Commercialization of space") has grown along with a narrative of space habitation for the [survival of some humans away from and without Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_and_survival "Space and survival"), which in turn has been critically analyzed and highlighted [colonialist purposes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization#Colonialism "Space colonization") for human activity and presence in space.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-76) This has given rise for a deeper engagement in the fields of [space environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment "Space environment") and [space ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_ethics "Space ethics").[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space#cite_note-Weinberg._2021-77)

They flew me to Washington and I gave a speech called "New Opportunities for the Humanization of Space" or "Space, What's in it for me?" In [the speech], I'm going where no man or woman dares go. I took NASA on for not including women and I gave some history of the powerful women who had applied and, after five times applying, felt disenfranchised and backed off. [At that time] NASA was having their fifth or sixth recruitment and women and ethnic people [were] staying away in droves. I was asked to come to headquarters the next day and they wanted me to assist them in persuading women and people of ethnic backgrounds that NASA was serious [about recruiting them]. And I said you've got to be joking; I didn't take them seriously. . . . John Yardley, who I knew from working on a previous project, was in the room and said 'Nichelle, we are serious.' I said OK. I will do this and I will bring you the most qualified people on the planet, as qualified as anyone you've ever had and I will bring them in droves. And if you do not pick a person of color, if you do not pick a woman, if it's the same old, same old, all-white male astronaut corps, that you've done for the last five years, and I'm just another dupe, I will be your worst nightmare.
