[ 32 ] Mathematical contributions [ edit ] Vogtmann's early work concerned homological properties of orthogonal groups associated to quadratic forms over various fields .

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] Vogtmann's most important contribution came in a 1986 paper with Marc Culler called "Moduli of graphs and automorphisms of free groups".

[ 2 ] The paper introduced an object that came to be known as Culler–Vogtmann Outer space . The Outer space X n , associated to a free group F n , is a free group analog [ 35 ] of the Teichmüller space of a Riemann surface . Instead of marked conformal structures (or, in an equivalent model, hyperbolic structures) on a surface, points of the Outer space are represented by volume-one marked metric graphs . A marked metric graph consists of a homotopy equivalence between a wedge of n circles and a finite connected graph Γ without degree-one and degree-two vertices, where Γ is equipped with a volume-one metric structure, that is, assignment of positive real lengths to edges of Γ so that the sum of the lengths of all edges is equal to one. Points of X n can also be thought of as free and discrete minimal isometric actions F n on real trees where the quotient graph has volume one.

By construction the Outer space X n is a finite-dimensional simplicial complex equipped with a natural action of Out( F n ) which is properly discontinuous and has finite simplex stabilizers. The main result of Culler–Vogtmann 1986 paper, [ 2 ] obtained via Morse-theoretic methods, was that the Outer space X n is contractible. Thus the quotient space X n /Out( F n ) is "almost" a classifying space for Out( F n ) and it can be thought of as a classifying space over Q . Moreover, Out( F n ) is known to be virtually torsion-free, so for any torsion-free subgroup H of Out( F n ) the action of H on X n is discrete and free, so that X n / H is a classifying space for H . For these reasons the Outer space is a particularly useful object in obtaining homological and cohomological information about Out( F n ). In particular, Culler and Vogtmann proved [ 2 ] that Out( F n ) has virtual cohomological dimension 2 n − 3.

In their 1986 paper Culler and Vogtmann do not assign X n a specific name. According to Vogtmann, [ 36 ] the term Outer space for the complex X n was later coined by Peter Shalen . In subsequent years the Outer space became a central object in the study of Out( F n ) . In particular, the Outer space has a natural compactification, similar to Thurston 's compactification of the Teichmüller space , and studying the action of Out( F n ) on this compactification yields interesting information about dynamical properties of automorphisms of free groups .

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Much of Vogtmann's subsequent work concerned the study of the Outer space X n , particularly its homotopy, homological and cohomological properties, and related questions for Out( F n ). For example, Hatcher and Vogtmann [ 41 ] [ 42 ] obtained a number of homological stability results for Out( F n ) and Aut( F n ).

In her papers with Conant, [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Vogtmann explored the connection found by Maxim Kontsevich between the cohomology of certain infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and the homology of Out( F n ).

A 2001 paper of Vogtmann, joint with Louis Billera and Susan P. Holmes , used the ideas of geometric group theory and CAT(0) geometry to study the space of phylogenetic trees , that is trees showing possible evolutionary relationships between different species.

[ 46 ] Identifying precise evolutionary trees is an important basic problem in mathematical biology and one also needs to have good quantitative tools for estimating how accurate a particular evolutionary tree is. The paper of Billera, Vogtmann and Holmes produced a method for quantifying the difference between two evolutionary trees, effectively determining the distance between them.

[ 47 ] The fact that the space of phylogenetic trees has "non-positively curved geometry", particularly the uniqueness of shortest paths or geodesics in CAT(0) spaces , allows using these results for practical statistical computations of estimating the confidence level of how accurate particular evolutionary tree is. A free software package implementing these algorithms has been developed and is actively used by biologists.
