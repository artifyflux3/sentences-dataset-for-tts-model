Find sources: "Gibbs state" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2024 ) In probability theory and statistical mechanics , a Gibbs state is an equilibrium probability distribution which remains invariant under future evolution of the system.  For example, a stationary or steady-state distribution of a Markov chain , such as that achieved by running a Markov chain Monte Carlo iteration for a sufficiently long time, is a Gibbs state.

Precisely, suppose L {\displaystyle L} is a generator of evolutions for an initial state ρ ρ 0 {\displaystyle \rho _{0}} , so that the state at any later time is given by ρ ρ ( t ) = e L t [ ρ ρ 0 ] {\displaystyle \rho (t)=e^{Lt}[\rho _{0}]} .  Then the condition for ρ ρ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \rho _{\infty }} to be a Gibbs state is L [ ρ ρ ∞ ∞ ] = 0 {\displaystyle L[\rho _{\infty }]=0} .

In physics there may be several physically distinct Gibbs states in which a system may be trapped, particularly at lower temperatures.

They are named after Josiah Willard Gibbs , for his work in determining equilibrium properties of statistical ensembles . Gibbs himself referred to this type of statistical ensemble as being in "statistical equilibrium".
