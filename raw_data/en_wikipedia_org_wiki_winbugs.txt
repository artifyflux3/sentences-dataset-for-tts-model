   / August 6, 2007 ; 18 years ago ( 2007-08-06 ) Written in Component Pascal Operating system Microsoft Windows Available in English Type Statistical package License Freeware Website winbugs-development .mrc-bsu .cam .ac .uk WinBUGS is statistical software for Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

It is based on the BUGS ( B ayesian inference U sing G ibbs S ampling ) project started in 1989. It runs under Microsoft Windows , though it can also be run on Linux or Mac using Wine .

[ 1 ] It was developed by the BUGS Project, a team of British researchers at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge , and Imperial College School of Medicine , London. Originally intended to solve problems encountered in medical statistics, it soon became widely used in other disciplines, such as ecology, sociology, and geology.

[ 2 ] The last version of WinBUGS was version 1.4.3, released in August 2007. Development is now focused on OpenBUGS , an open-source version of the package. WinBUGS 1.4.3 remains available as a stable version for routine use, but is no longer being developed.
