Given n {\displaystyle n} , there is a positive number ε ε n > 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{n}>0} such that if an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold admits an ε ε n {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{n}} -flat metric with diameter ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle \leq 1} then it is almost flat. On the other hand, one can fix the bound of sectional curvature and get the diameter going to zero, so the almost-flat manifold is a special case of a collapsing manifold , which is collapsing along all directions.

According to the Gromov–Ruh theorem , M {\displaystyle M} is almost flat if and only if it is infranil . In particular, it is a finite factor of a nilmanifold , which is the total space of a principal torus bundle over a principal torus bundle over a torus.
