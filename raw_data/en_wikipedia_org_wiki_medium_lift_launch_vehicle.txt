[ 2 ] An MLV is between a small-lift launch vehicle and a heavy-lift launch vehicle . Medium-lift vehicles comprise the majority of orbital launches as of 2024 [update] , with both the Soyuz and Falcon 9 having launched several hundred times.

History [ edit ] Atlas-Centaur launching Surveyor 1 in 1966 Soviet Union and Russia [ edit ] The Soviet R-7 family was based on the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).

Sputnik was a small-lift derivative that carried the first satellite into orbit, and the R-7 design quickly grew in capacity, with Luna launching in 1958. The 1960s saw the R-7 series continue to develop, with Vostok 1 carrying the first human into space, Voskhod carrying multiple crew members, and the first Soyuz . As of 2025 [update] , Soyuz variants are still operational and have launched over 1,100 times. The R-7 family has launched more times than any other family of orbital rockets.

[ 3 ] United States [ edit ] The first US medium-lift vehicle was a purpose-built orbital launch vehicle, the Saturn I . Saturn I first launched in 1961, and the Saturn family would eventually grow into the heavy-lift Saturn IB and the super-heavy lift Saturn V .

[ 4 ] ICBM-derived launch vehicles for the US include the Atlas , Titan , and Delta families.

Atlas-Centaur launched in 1962 and marked the first use of a Centaur upper stage. As of 2025 [update] , the derivative Atlas V is still operational; Centaur has seen extensive use on multiple vehicles and is operational on the Atlas V and Vulcan vehicles.

Titan II GLV carried the Gemini spacecraft . The family was further developed into Titan III which utilized solid rocket boosters (SRBs), and in 1989, the heavy-lift Titan IV .
Medium-lift versions of the Delta family include Delta II which utilized up to nine SRBs, and the Delta IV which could use optional SRBs or three first-stage cores as a heavy variant.

SpaceX introduced the Falcon 9 in 2010, designed to be a partially reusable launch vehicle . Falcon 9 underwent iterative upgrades and completed the first propulsive landing of an orbital rocket stage in 2015.

[ 5 ] SpaceX then began regularly reusing first stages.

[ 6 ] In 2022, Falcon 9 broke the record of 47 launches in one year held by Soyuz-U .

[ 7 ] Falcon 9 launched 91 times in 2023 and 132 times in 2024.

[ 8 ] Other [ edit ] China's Long March family and the European Ariane family were introduced in the 1970s. Japan launched the H-I in 1986 before developing the H-II and H3 . India introduced the PSLV in 1993. South Korea's Nuri reached orbit in 2022.
