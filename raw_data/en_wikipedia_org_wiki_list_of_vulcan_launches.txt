Notable missions [ edit ] Peregrine Mission One [ edit ] Launch of the Peregrine on Vulcan Centaur's first flight Main article: Peregrine Mission One Peregrine Mission One was a lunar lander built by Astrobotic Technology , selected as a part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. It was launched on the maiden flight of Vulcan Centaur on 8 January 2024, 07:18 UTC .

[ 1 ] The Vulcan Centaur successfully placed Peregrine into trans-lunar injection , however, following a fuel leak with the spacecraft unrelated to the Vulcan Centaur, the lander failed in its attempt to land on the Moon.

[ 2 ] Launch statistics [ edit ] Launch outcomes 3 6 9 12 15 2024 2025 2026 2027 Failure Partial failure Success Planned Launch sites 1 2 2024 2025 2026 2027 Cape Canaveral , SLC‑41 Vandenberg , SLC‑3E Rocket configurations 1 2 2024 2025 2026 2027 VC0 VC2 VC4 VC6 Launch history [ edit ] 2024 [ edit ] Flight No.

Date / time ( UTC ) Rocket, configuration Launch site Payload Payload mass Orbit Customer Launch outcome 1 8 January 2024 07:18 Vulcan Centaur VC2S Cape Canaveral , SLC‑41 Peregrine lander 1,283 kg (2,829 lb) TLI Astrobotic Technology Success [ 3 ] Enterprise (space burial) Heliocentric Celestis Maiden flight of Vulcan Centaur and Vulcan Centaur VC2S Configuration.

Certification-1 mission, the first of two launches needed to certify the rocket for National Security Space Launch (NSSL) missions. Payload from Celestis , demonstrated engine restart capability of the Centaur upper stage delivering multiple payloads to different orbits. The Peregrine payload failed in transit to the Moon, precluding a landing attempt, due to reasons unrelated to the launch vehicle.

[ 4 ] 2 4 October 2024 11:25 Vulcan Centaur VC2S Cape Canaveral , SLC‑41 Mass simulator 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) Heliocentric United Launch Alliance Success Certification-2 mission, the second of two launches needed to certify the rocket for NSSL missions. Originally scheduled to carry the first flight of Dream Chaser ; however, due to schedule delays with Dream Chaser, ULA flew a mass simulator with experiments and demonstrations of future Centaur V technologies.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Approximately 37 seconds into the launch, the nozzle on one of solid rocket boosters (SRB) fell off resulting in a shower of debris in the exhaust plume. Although the SRB continued to function for its full 90-second burn, the anomaly led to reduced, asymmetrical thrust. This caused the rocket to slightly tilt before the guidance system and main engines successfully corrected and extended their burn by roughly 20 seconds to compensate. Despite the anomaly, the rocket achieved nominal orbital insertion, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] with the Space Force praising the launch and "the robustness of the total Vulcan system".

[ 9 ] The nozzle anomaly was attributed to a manufacturing defect in a insulator located inside the nozzle.

[ 10 ] 2025 [ edit ] Flight No.

Date / time ( UTC ) Rocket, configuration Launch site Payload Payload mass Orbit Customer Launch outcome 3 13 August 2025 00:56 Vulcan Centaur VC4S Cape Canaveral , SLC‑41 USSF-106 ( NTS-3 & TBA) ~1,250 kg (2,760 lb) GSO U.S. Space Force Success USSF-106 mission.

[ 11 ] Maiden flight of Vulcan Centaur VC4S Configuration.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] First NSSL mission for Vulcan Centaur.

[ 14 ] It will launch Navigation Technology Satellite 3 (NTS-3), an experimental spacecraft to test technologies for next-generation GPS satellites.

Future launches [ edit ] Future launches are listed chronologically when firm plans are in place. The order of the later launches is much less certain.

[ 15 ] Launches are expected to take place "no earlier than" (NET) the listed date.  As of August 2025 [update] ULA are "aiming for about two launches per month across its Atlas and Vulcan fleets in 2025 and 2026".
