[ 1 ] It has a focus on politics, culture and economy, and is published in Rhenish format . The place of publication is Berlin . Its publisher and editor-in-chief is Jakob Augstein , who is also one of the main owners of Der Spiegel .

[ 2 ] The newspaper has won several awards, such as European Newspaper of the Year and World's Best Designed Newspaper .

History [ edit ] The newspaper was founded on 9 November 1990 with the name Freitag . It had some predecessors, one with the name of Sonntag , which was established in 1946.

[ 1 ] The paper originally described itself as "the East West Weekly", being established in the year of German reunification , but underwent a substantial rebranding in 2009, including the addition of the definite article (it was previously just Freitag ) as well as the new claim "das Meinungsmedium".

[ 3 ] This followed the 2008 acquisition of the paper by Jakob Augstein, one of the owners of the Spiegel publishing company . The rebranding was judged a success by the Society for News Design , judging it one of the three "World's Best Designed Newspapers" in 2010.

[ 4 ] Starting with edition 36 on September 5, 2019 der Freitag was published with the new subheadline „Die Wochenzeitung" („the Weekly Newspaper") and a redesigned front page. The paper's logo was placed higher up and the front-page picture enlarged. According to the publishing house the new subline is supposed to emphasise der Freitag's „strength as Weekly Paper and thus as medium for background reporting and analysis".

[ 5 ] Profile [ edit ] Since its relaunch in 2009 the newspaper consists of three sections – Politics, Culture and Everyday Life, plus an additional economics section each month. Also monthly is its arts supplement called "Kultur+," which features current stage productions, exhibitions and cultural events. Several times a year, [ when?

] special literature supplements on new publications that encompass fiction and non-fiction are featured. A "Guardian-Reportage" is included six times a year. This is a Long Read extracted from the British Newspaper The Guardian and translated into German. Der Freitag has a syndication agreement with the Guardian, and presents a number of German translations of that newspaper's content in every issue.

[ 6 ] Der Freitag publishes online daily, as well as weekly in print.

Circulation [ edit ] Der Freitag has gained in circulation in the past few years. The current paid circulation amounts to 23.822 copies. Subscriptions account for 79% of paid circulation.

[ 7 ] Since its relaunch in the first quarter of 2009, the number of subscriptions has grown by 132%.

[ 8 ] Web presence [ edit ] freitag.de is der Freitag's internet portal. The site was completely redesigned on 5 February 2014 and consists of articles from the print newspaper, online articles and contributions from the Freitag-Community (readers are thus given the opportunity to publish content and their opinion), as well as texts translated into German by the British syndication partner The Guardian .

[ 9 ] The editors work on both the print and online editions. Since November 2014, der Freitag digital offers the content of the current issue in the form of a web app for all mobile devices.

[ 10 ] Further activities [ edit ] Since October 2009 the newspaper has been hosting a regular series of political talks called "Freitag-Salon." Since 2015, the talks have been organised in cooperation with the Berlin radio station radioeins which broadcasts live the discussions between Freitag's editor-in-chief Jakob Augstein and his respective guest. Until February 2019 the radioeins und Freitag Salon took place in Berlins Maxim-Gorki-Theatre . Since March 2019 it has been moved to Volksbühne Berlin.

[ 11 ] Awards [ edit ] Together with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung and The New York Times der Freitag was chosen as World's Best Designed Newspaper 2009 by the Society for News Design in Orlando , Florida , in February 2010.

[ 4 ] In March of the same year its online content was chosen as web magazine of the year in the Lead Awards in Hamburg .

[ 12 ] In 2013 der Freitag received a silver medal in the category lead paper of the year.

[ 13 ] At the German Art Directors Club Awards held in Frankfurt am Main in May 2010, the online content received a bronze nail in the Online Editorial category.

[ 14 ] Ulrike Winkelmann, Head of the Political Affairs Department, was awarded the Alternative Media Prize 2011 for her satirical contribution to the Thilo Sarrazin debate entitled "Integrate yourselves!".

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] In December 2011 Jakob Augstein was awarded the Bert-Donnepp-Preis – Deutscher Preis für Medienpublizistik in 2011, with a "special honour".
