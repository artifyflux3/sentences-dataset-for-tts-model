[ 9 ] Manel De Aguas , a Catalan photographer who developed fins that allow him to perceive atmospheric pressure , humidity and temperature through a couple of implants at each side of his head.

[ 10 ] Joe Dekni, an artist who has developed and installed a radar system in his head. The sensory system includes two implants in his cheekbones.

[ 11 ] Pau Prats, creator of a system that allows him to feel the ultraviolet ray levels that reach his skin.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Alex Garcia, whose sensor installed in his chest allows him to feel the air quality levels around him.

[ 14 ] Kai Landre, a musician developing two implants to hear the sound of the particles affected by the collusion of cosmic rays.
