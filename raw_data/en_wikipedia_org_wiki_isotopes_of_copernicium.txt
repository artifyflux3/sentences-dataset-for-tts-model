SF – view talk edit Copernicium ( 112 Cn) is a synthetic element , and thus a standard atomic weight cannot be given. Like all synthetic elements, it has no stable isotopes . The first isotope to be synthesized was 277 Cn in 1996. There are seven known radioisotopes (with one more unconfirmed); the longest-lived isotope is 285 Cn with a half-life of 28 seconds.

Whereas most of the isotopes of copernicium can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers .

[ 7 ] Depending on the energies involved, the former are separated into "hot" and "cold". In hot fusion reactions, very light, high-energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets such as actinides , giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40–50 MeV ) that may either fission or evaporate several (3 to 5) neutrons.

[ 7 ] In cold fusion reactions, the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy (~10–20 MeV), which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions. As the fused nuclei cool to the ground state , they require emission of only one or two neutrons, and thus, allows for the generation of more neutron-rich products.

[ 8 ] The latter is a distinct concept from that of where nuclear fusion claimed to be achieved at room temperature conditions (see cold fusion ).

[ 9 ] The table below contains various combinations of targets and projectiles which could be used to form compound nuclei with Z = 112.

[ 10 ] 208 82 Pb + 70 30 Zn → 277 112 Cn + n In a review of the data in 2000, the first decay chain was retracted. In a repeat of the reaction in 2000 they were able to synthesize a further atom. They attempted to measure the 1n excitation function in 2002 but suffered from a failure of the zinc-70 beam.
The unofficial discovery of copernicium-277 was confirmed in 2004 at RIKEN , where researchers detected a further two atoms of the isotope and were able to confirm the decay data for the entire chain.

[ 11 ] This reaction had also previously been tried in 1971 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna , Russia in an effort to produce 276 Cn in the 2n channel, but without success.

[ 12 ] After the successful synthesis of copernicium-277, the GSI team performed a reaction using a 68 Zn projectile in 1997 in an effort to study the effect of isospin (neutron richness) on the chemical yield.

208 82 Pb + 68 30 Zn → 276−x 112 Cn + x n The experiment was initiated after the discovery of a yield enhancement during the synthesis of darmstadtium isotopes using nickel-62 and nickel-64 ions. No decay chains of copernicium-275 were detected leading to a cross section limit of 1.2 picobarns (pb). However, the revision of the yield for the zinc-70 reaction to 0.5 pb does not rule out a similar yield for this reaction.

In 1990, after some early indications for the formation of isotopes of copernicium in the irradiation of a tungsten target with multi-GeV protons, a collaboration between GSI and the Hebrew University studied the foregoing reaction.

184 74 W + 88 38 Sr → 272−x 112 Cn + x n They were able to detect some spontaneous fission (SF) activity and a 12.5 MeV alpha decay , both of which they tentatively assigned to the radiative capture product copernicium-272 or the 1n evaporation residue copernicium-271. Both the TWG and JWP have concluded that a lot more research is required to confirm these conclusions.

[ 7 ] Hot fusion [ edit ] In 1998, the team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Research (FLNR) in Dubna, Russia began a research program using calcium-48 nuclei in "warm" fusion reactions leading to super-heavy elements . In March 1998, they claimed to have synthesized two atoms of the element in the following reaction.

238 92 U + 48 20 Ca → 286−x 112 Cn + x n (x=3,4) The product, copernicium-283, had a claimed half-life of 5 minutes, decaying by spontaneous fission.

[ 13 ] The long half-life of the product initiated first chemical experiments on the gas phase atomic chemistry of copernicium. In 2000, Yuri Yukashev in Dubna repeated the experiment but was unable to observe any spontaneous fission events with half-life of 5 minutes. The experiment was repeated in 2001 and an accumulation of eight fragments resulting from spontaneous fission were found in the low-temperature section, indicating that copernicium had radon-like properties. However, there is now some serious doubt about the origin of these results. To confirm the synthesis, the reaction was successfully repeated by the same team in January 2003, confirming the decay mode and half-life. They were also able to calculate an estimate of the mass of the spontaneous fission activity to ~285, lending support to the assignment.

[ 14 ] The team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, United States entered the debate and performed the reaction in 2002. They were unable to detect any spontaneous fission and calculated a cross section limit of 1.6 pb for the detection of a single event.

[ 15 ] The reaction was repeated in 2003–2004 by the team at Dubna using a slightly different set-up, the Dubna Gas-Filled Recoil Separator (DGFRS). This time, copernicium-283 was found to decay by emission of a 9.53 MeV alpha-particle with a half-life of 4 seconds. Copernicium-282 was also observed in the 4n channel (emitting 4 neutrons).

[ 16 ] In 2003, the team at GSI entered the debate and performed a search for the five-minute SF activity in chemical experiments. Like the Dubna team, they were able to detect seven SF fragments in the low temperature section. However, these SF events were uncorrelated, suggesting they were not from actual direct SF of copernicium nuclei and raised doubts about the original indications for radon-like properties.

[ 17 ] After the announcement from Dubna of different decay properties for copernicium-283, the GSI team repeated the experiment in September 2004. They were unable to detect any SF events and calculated a cross section limit of ~1.6 pb for the detection of one event, not in contradiction with the reported 2.5 pb yield by Dubna team.

In May 2005, the GSI performed a physical experiment and identified a single atom of 283 Cn decaying by SF with a short half-time suggesting a previously unknown SF branch.

[ 18 ] However, initial work by Dubna team had detected several direct SF events but had assumed that the parent alpha decay had been missed. These results indicated that this was not the case.

The new decay data on copernicium-283 were confirmed in 2006 by a joint PSI–FLNR experiment aimed at probing the chemical properties of copernicium. Two atoms of copernicium-283 were observed in the decay of the parent flerovium -287 nuclei. The experiment indicated that contrary to previous experiments, copernicium behaves as a typical member of group 12, demonstrating properties of a volatile metal.

[ 19 ] Finally, the team at GSI successfully repeated their physical experiment in January 2007, and detected three atoms of copernicium-283, confirming both the alpha and SF decay modes.

[ 20 ] As such, the 5-minute SF activity is still unconfirmed and unidentified. It is possible that it refers to an isomer, namely copernicium-283b, whose yield is dependent upon the exact production methods. It is also possible that it is the result of an electron capture branch in 283 Cn leading to 283 Rg, which would necessitate a reassignment of its parent to 287 Nh (the electron-capture daughter of 287 Fl).

[ 21 ] 233 92 U + 48 20 Ca → 281−x 112 Cn + x n The team at FLNR studied this reaction in 2004. They were unable to detect any atoms of copernicium and calculated a cross section limit of 0.6 pb. The team concluded that this indicated that the neutron mass number for the compound nucleus has an effect on the yield of evaporation residues.

286 Cn ?

[ 6 ] Copernicium has been observed as decay products of flerovium . Flerovium currently has seven known isotopes, all of which have been shown to undergo alpha decays to become copernicium nuclei, with mass numbers between 280 and 286. Copernicium isotopes with mass numbers 280, 281, 284, 285, and 286 to date have only been produced by flerovium nuclei decay. Parent flerovium nuclei can be themselves decay products of livermorium or oganesson .

[ 27 ] For example, in May 2006, the Dubna team ( JINR ) identified copernicium-282 as a final product in the decay of oganesson via the alpha decay sequence. It was found that the final nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission .

[ 23 ] 294 118 Og → 290 116 Lv + 4 2 He 290 116 Lv → 286 114 Fl + 4 2 He 286 114 Fl → 282 112 Cn + 4 2 He In the claimed synthesis of oganesson-293 in 1999, copernicium-281 was identified as decaying by emission of a 10.68 MeV alpha particle with half-life 0.90 ms.

[ 28 ] The claim was retracted in 2001. This isotope was finally created in 2010 and its decay properties contradicted the previous data.

[ 22 ] Nuclear isomerism [ edit ] First experiments on the synthesis of 283 Cn produced a SF activity with half-life ~5 min.

[ 27 ] This activity was also observed from the alpha decay of flerovium-287. The decay mode and half-life were also confirmed in a repetition of the first experiment. Later, copernicium-283 was observed to undergo 9.52 MeV alpha decay and SF with a half-life of 3.9 s. It has also been found that alpha decay of copernicium-283 leads to different excited states of darmstadtium-279.

[ 16 ] These results suggest the assignment of the two activities to two different isomeric levels in copernicium-283, creating copernicium-283a and copernicium-283b. This result may also be due to an electron-capture branching of the parent 287 Fl to 287 Nh, so that the longer-lived activity would be assigned to 283 Rg.

[ 21 ] Copernicium-285 has only been observed as a decay product of flerovium-289 and livermorium-293; during the first recorded synthesis of flerovium, one flerovium-289 was created, which alpha decayed to copernicium-285, which itself emitted an alpha particle in 29 seconds, releasing 9.15 or 9.03 MeV.

[ 16 ] However, in the first experiment to successfully synthesize livermorium, when livermorium-293 was created, it was shown that the created nuclide alpha decayed to flerovium-289, decay data for which differed from the known values significantly. Although unconfirmed, it is highly possible that this is associated with an isomer. The resulting nuclide decayed to copernicium-285, which emitted an alpha particle with a half-life of around 10 minutes, releasing 8.586 MeV. Similar to its parent, it is believed to be a nuclear isomer, copernicium-285b.

[ 29 ] Due to the low beam energies associated with the initial 244 Pu+ 48 Ca experiment, it is possible that the 2n channel may have been reached, producing 290 Fl instead of 289 Fl; this would then undergo undetected electron capture to 290 Nh, thus resulting in a reassignment of this activity to its alpha daughter 286 Rg.

[ 30 ] Summary of observed alpha decay chains from superheavy elements with Z = 114, 116, 118, or 120 as of 2016. Assignments for dotted nuclides (including the early Dubna chains 5 and 8 containing 287 Nh and 290 Nh as alternative explanations instead of isomerism in 287m Fl and 289m Fl) are tentative.

[ 21 ] According to another analysis, chain 3 (starting at element 120) is not a real decay chain, but is rather a random sequence of events.

The nuclear reaction used is 238 U+ 48 Ca. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132 Sn ( Z = 50, N = 82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48 Ca and 58 Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of 58 Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.
