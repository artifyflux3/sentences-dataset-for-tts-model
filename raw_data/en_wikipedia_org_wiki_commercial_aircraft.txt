A [United Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")[Boeing 737](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737 "Boeing 737") (foreground) and a [Virgin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_America "Virgin America")[Airbus A320](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320 "Airbus A320") (background), two of the world's most widely used airliners

An **airliner** is a type of [airplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane "Airplane") for transporting [passengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger "Passenger") and [air cargo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_cargo "Air cargo"). Such aircraft are most often operated by [airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline "Airline"). The modern and most common variant of the airliner is a long, tube shaped, and [jet powered aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner"). The largest of them are [wide-body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft") jets which are also called twin-aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. These are usually used for [long-haul flights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_length#Short-haul_and_long-haul "Flight length") between [airline hubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_hub "Airline hub") and major cities. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the [narrow-body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft") or single-aisle. These are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts.

[Regional airliners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_airliner "Regional airliner") typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by [turbofans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan") or [turboprops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop"). These airliners are the non-[mainline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_(flight) "Mainline (flight)") counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers, [legacy carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_carrier "Legacy carrier"), and [flag carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_carrier "Flag carrier"), and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs. These regional routes then form the spokes of a hub-and-spoke air transport model.

The lightest aircraft are short-haul regional feeder airliner type aircraft that carry a small number of passengers are called commuter aircraft, commuterliners, feederliners, and [air taxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_taxi "Air taxi"), depending on their size, engines, how they are marketed, region of the world, and seating configurations. The [Beechcraft 1900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_1900 "Beechcraft 1900"), for example, has only 19 seats.

When the [Wright brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers") made the world's first sustained [heavier-than-air flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavier-than-air_flight "Heavier-than-air flight"), they laid the foundation for what would become a major transport industry. Their flight, performed in the [Wright Flyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer "Wright Flyer") during 1903,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-NewarkDailyAdvocate_19031228-1) was just 11 years before what is often defined as the world's first airliner.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Tise-2) By the 1960s, airliners had expanded capabilities, making a significant impact on global society, economics, and politics.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Bernardo-3)

[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")

During 1913, [Igor Sikorsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Sikorsky "Igor Sikorsky") developed the first large multi-engine airplane, the [Russky Vityaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_Russky_Vityaz "Sikorsky Russky Vityaz").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-5) This aircraft was subsequently refined into the more practical [Ilya Muromets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets"), being furnished with dual controls for a pilot and copilot and a comfortable [cabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin") with a lavatory, cabin heating and lighting.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-ASM0807-6) This large four-engine biplane was further adapted into an early [bomber aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_aircraft "Bomber aircraft"), preceding subsequent transport and bomber aircraft.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-ASM0807-6) It first flew on 10 December 1913 and took off for its first demonstration flight with 16 passengers aboard on 25 February 1914. However, it was never used as a commercial airliner due to the onset of the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War") which led to military applications being prioritised.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-igo40-8)

In 1919, shortly after the end of the First World War, large numbers of ex-military aircraft flooded the market. One such aircraft was the French [Farman F.60 Goliath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farman_F.60_Goliath "Farman F.60 Goliath"), which had originally been designed as a long-range [heavy bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_bomber "Heavy bomber"); a number were converted for commercial use into passenger airliners starting in 1919, being able to accommodate a maximum of 14 seated passengers. and around 60 were built. Initially, several publicity flights were made, including one on 8 February 1919, when the Goliath flew 12 passengers from [Toussus-le-Noble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toussus-le-Noble "Toussus-le-Noble") to [RAF Kenley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Kenley "RAF Kenley"), near [Croydon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croydon "Croydon"), despite having no permission from the British authorities to land. Dozens of early airlines subsequently procured the type.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-aeroplane1015-9) One high-profile flight, made on 11 August 1919, involved an F.60 flying eight passengers and a ton of supplies from Paris via [Casablanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca") and [Mogador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogador "Mogador") to Koufa, 180 km (110 mi) north of [Saint-Louis, Senegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Louis,_Senegal "Saint-Louis, Senegal"), flying more than 4,500 km (2,800 mi).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-10)

Another important airliner built in 1919 was the [Airco DH.16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airco_DH.16 "Airco DH.16"); a redesigned [Airco DH.9A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airco_DH.9A "Airco DH.9A") with a wider [fuselage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage "Fuselage") to accommodate an enclosed cabin seating four passengers, plus pilot in an open cockpit. In March 1919, the prototype first flew at [Hendon Aerodrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendon_Aerodrome "Hendon Aerodrome"). Nine aircraft were built, all but one being delivered to the nascent airline, [Aircraft Transport and Travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Transport_and_Travel "Aircraft Transport and Travel"), which used the first aircraft for pleasure flying, and on 25 August 1919, it inaugurated the first scheduled international airline service from London to Paris.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11) One aircraft was sold to the River Plate Aviation Company in [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina"), to operate a cross-river service between [Buenos Aires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires "Buenos Aires") and [Montevideo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo "Montevideo").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11) Meanwhile, the competing [Vickers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers "Vickers") converted its successful First World War era bomber, the [Vickers Vimy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers_Vimy "Vickers Vimy"), into a civilian version, the Vimy Commercial. It was redesigned with a larger-diameter fuselage (largely of [spruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce "Spruce") plywood), and first flew from the Joyce Green airfield in [Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent "Kent") on 13 April 1919.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Andrews_Vickersp95-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jackson_v3_p202-13)

The world's first all-metal transport aircraft was the [Junkers F.13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_F.13 "Junkers F.13"), which also made its first flight in 1919.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-14) Junkers marketed the aircraft towards business travellers and commercial operators, and European entrepreneurs bought examples for their private use and business trips. Over 300 Junkers F 13s were built between 1919 and 1932.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-15) The Dutch [Fokker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker "Fokker") company produced the [Fokker F.II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker_F.II "Fokker F.II"), then the enlarged [F.III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker_F.III "Fokker F.III").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Flight260521p355-16) These were used by the Dutch airline [KLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM "KLM"), including on its Amsterdam-London service in 1921. A relatively reliable aircraft for the era, the Fokkers were flying to destinations across Europe, including Bremen, Brussels, Hamburg, and Paris.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-deLeeuw-17)

The [Handley Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page "Handley Page") company in Britain produced the [Handley Page Type W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page_Type_W "Handley Page Type W"), its first civil transport aircraft. It housed two crew in an open [cockpit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") and 15 passengers in an enclosed cabin. Powered by two 450 hp (340 kW) [Napier Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napier_Lion "Napier Lion") engines, the prototype first flew on 4 December 1919, shortly after it was displayed at the 1919 [Paris Air Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Air_Show "Paris Air Show") at [Le Bourget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Bourget "Le Bourget"). It was ordered by the Belgian firm [Sabena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabena "Sabena"), a further ten Type Ws were [produced under license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensed_production "Licensed production") in Belgium by [SABCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABCA "SABCA").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-18) In 1921 the [Air Ministry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Ministry "Air Ministry") ordered three aircraft, built as the W.8b, for use by [Handley Page Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page_Transport "Handley Page Transport"), and later by [Imperial Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways"), on services to [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris") and [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels "Brussels").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-19)

In France, the [Bleriot-SPAD S.33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleriot-SPAD_S.33 "Bleriot-SPAD S.33") was introduced during the early 1920s.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Flight070721p460-20) It was commercially successful, initially serving the Paris-[London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") route, and later on [continental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") routes. The enclosed cabin could carry four passengers with an extra seat in the cockpit. It was further developed into the [Blériot-SPAD S.46](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bl%C3%A9riot-SPAD_S.46 "Blériot-SPAD S.46"). Throughout the 1920s, companies in Britain and France were at the forefront of the civil airliner industry.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-21)

By 1921, the capacity of airliners needed to be increased to achieve more favourable economics. The English company [de Havilland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland "De Havilland"), built the 10-passenger [DH.29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Doncaster "De Havilland Doncaster") monoplane,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22) while starting work on the design of the DH.32, an eight-seater [biplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biplane "Biplane") with a more economical but less powerful [Rolls-Royce Eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Eagle "Rolls-Royce Eagle") engine.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V3_508525-23) For more capacity, DH.32 development was replaced by the [DH.34](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_DH.34 "De Havilland DH.34") biplane, accommodating 10 passengers.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Flight180823-24) A commercially successful aircraft, [Daimler Airway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daimler_Airway "Daimler Airway") ordered a batch of nine.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)

The [Ford Trimotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Trimotor "Ford Trimotor") had two engines mounted on the wings and one in the nose, and a slabsided body, it carried eight passengers and was produced from 1925 to 1933.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25) It was an important early airliner in America. It was used by the predecessor to [Trans World Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines "Trans World Airlines"), and by other airlines long after production ceased. The Trimotor helped to popularise numerous aspects of modern aviation infrastructure, including paved [runways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway "Runway"), [passenger terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_terminal "Airport terminal"), [hangars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangar "Hangar"), [airmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airmail "Airmail"), and [radio navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_navigation "Radio navigation").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-26)[Pan Am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am "Pan Am") opened up transoceanic service in the late 1920s and early 1930s, based on a series of large seaplanes – the [Sikorsky S-38](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-38 "Sikorsky S-38") through [Sikorsky S-42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-42 "Sikorsky S-42").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Johnson-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Daley,_Robert_1980,_page_103-28)

By the 1930s, the airliner industry had matured and large consolidated national airlines were established with regular international services that spanned the globe, including [Imperial Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways") in Britain, [Lufthansa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa "Lufthansa") in Germany, KLM in the Netherlands, and [United Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines") in America. Multi-engined aircraft were now capable of transporting dozens of passengers in comfort.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-29)

During the 1930s, the British [de Havilland Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon "De Havilland Dragon") emerged as a short-haul, low-capacity airliner. Its relatively simple design could carry six passengers, each with 45 lb (20 kg) of luggage, on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of 13 gal (49 L) per hour.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-30) The DH.84 Dragon entered worldwide service. During early August 1934, one performed the first non-stop flight between the Canadian mainland and Britain in 30 hours 55 minutes, although the intended destination had originally been [Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad "Baghdad") in [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-FOOTNOTERiding1980289-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-racing_p265-32) British production of the Dragon ended in favour of the [de Havilland Dragon Rapide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon_Rapide "De Havilland Dragon Rapide"), a faster and more comfortable successor.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-moss_3-33)

By November 1934, series production of the Dragon Rapide had commenced.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-moss_4-34) De Havilland invested into advanced features including elongated rear windows, cabin heating, thickened wing tips, and a strengthened airframe for a higher gross weight of 5,500 lb (2,500 kg).[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-moss_5-35) Later aircraft were amongst the first airliners to be fitted with [flaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics) "Flap (aeronautics)") for improved landing performance, along with downwards-facing recognition light and metal propellers, which were often retrofitted to older aircraft.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-moss_6-36) It was also used in military roles;[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-moss_4-34) civil Dragon Rapides were [impressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressment "Impressment") into military service during the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-moss_6_7-37)

The [Douglas DC-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3") appeared in 1935

Metal airliners came into service in the 1930s. In the United States, the [Boeing 247](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_247 "Boeing 247"),[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-bhistory-38) and the 14-passenger [Douglas DC-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-2 "Douglas DC-2"),[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-39) flew during the first half of the decade, while the more powerful, faster, 21–32 passenger [Douglas DC-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3") first appeared in 1935. DC-3s were produced in quantity for the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War") and were sold as surplus afterward, becoming widespread within the commercial sector. It was one of first airliners to be profitable without the support of postal or government subsidies.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Mellberg-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-41)

Long-haul flights were expanded during the 1930s as Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways competed on [transatlantic travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_flight "Transatlantic flight") using fleets of [flying boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_boat "Flying boat"), such as the British [Short Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Empire "Short Empire") and the American [Boeing 314](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_314 "Boeing 314").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-bogash-42) Imperial Airways' order for 28 Empire flying boats was viewed by some as a bold gamble.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-norris_3-43) At the time, flying boats were the only practical means of building aircraft of such size and weight as land-based aircraft would have unfeasibly poor field performance.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-norris_3-43) One Boeing 314, [registration NC18602](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_flight_of_Pan_American_NC18602 "Extended flight of Pan American NC18602"), became the first commercial plane to circumnavigate the globe during December 1941 and January 1942.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Bull-44)

Prototype of the [de Havilland Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet") in 1949, the first jet airliner in the world

In the United Kingdom, the [Brabazon Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brabazon_Committee "Brabazon Committee") was formed in 1942 under [John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Moore-Brabazon,_1st_Baron_Brabazon_of_Tara "John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara") to forecast advances in aviation technology and the air transport needs of the postwar [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") (in South Asia, Africa, and the Near and [Far East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East "Far East")) and Commonwealth ([Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand")).[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-MandG82-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Phipp17-46) For British use, multi-engine aircraft types were allegedly split between the US for [military transport aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft "Military transport aircraft") and the UK for [heavy bombers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_bomber "Heavy bomber").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] That such a policy was suggested or implemented have been disputed, at least by [Sir Peter Masefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Peter_Masefield "Sir Peter Masefield").[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-MandG97-47) British aircraft manufacturers were tied up to fulfill military requirements, and had no free capacity to address other matters though the war.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-48)

The committee final report pushed four designs for the state-owned airlines [British Overseas Airways Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation "British Overseas Airways Corporation") (BOAC) and later [British European Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_European_Airways "British European Airways") (BEA): three piston-powered aircraft of varying sizes, and a [jet-powered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine "Jet engine") 100-seat design at the request of [Geoffrey de Havilland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_de_Havilland "Geoffrey de Havilland"), involved in the first jet fighters development.

After a brief contest, the Type I design was given to the [Bristol Aeroplane Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company "Bristol Aeroplane Company"), building on a "100 ton [bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber "Bomber")" submission.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Barnes324-49) This evolved into the [Bristol Brabazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Brabazon "Bristol Brabazon") but this project folded in 1951 as BOAC lost interest and the first aircraft needed a costly wing re-design to accommodate the [Bristol Proteus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Proteus "Bristol Proteus") engine.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Phipp67-50)

The Type II was split between the [de Havilland Dove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Dove "De Havilland Dove") and [Airspeed Ambassador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspeed_Ambassador "Airspeed Ambassador") conventional piston designs,[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Phipp75-51) and the [Vickers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers "Vickers") model powered by newly developed [turboprops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop"): first flown in 1948, the [VC.2 Viceroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers_Viscount "Vickers Viscount") was the first turboprop design to enter service;[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Phipp81-52) a commercial success with 445 Viscounts built.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Andrews_and_Morgan,_p._537-53) The Type III requirement led to the conventional [Avro Tudor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Tudor "Avro Tudor") and the more ambitious [Bristol Britannia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Britannia "Bristol Britannia"), although both aircraft suffered protracted developments,[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Barnes347-54) with the latter entering service with BOAC in February 1957, over seven years following its order.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Phipp105-55)

The jet-powered Type IV became the [de Havilland Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet") in 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four [de Havilland Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Ghost "De Havilland Ghost") turbojet engines buried in the wings, a pressurised fuselage, and large square windows. On 2 May 1952, the Comet took off on the world's first [jetliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner") flight carrying fare-paying passengers and simultaneously inaugurated scheduled service between London and Johannesburg.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-bbc-56)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-cookman195207-57) However, roughly one year after introduction, three Comets broke up mid-flight due to airframe [metal fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(material) "Fatigue (material)"), not well understood at the time.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-withey_fatigue-58)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-59) The Comet was grounded and tested to discover the cause, while rival manufacturers heeded the lessons learned while developing their own aircraft.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-60) The improved Comet 2 and the prototype Comet 3 culminated in the redesigned Comet 4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career over 30 years, but sales never fully recovered.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Phipp93-61)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jackson464-62)

By the 1960s, the UK had lost the airliner market to the US due to the Comet disaster and a smaller domestic market, not regained by later designs like the [BAC 1-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAC_1-11 "BAC 1-11"), [Vickers VC10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10"), and [Hawker Siddeley Trident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Siddeley_Trident "Hawker Siddeley Trident"). The STAC committee was formed to consider [supersonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic "Supersonic") designs and worked with Bristol to create the [Bristol 223](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_223 "Bristol 223"), a 100-passenger transatlantic airliner. The effort was later merged with similar efforts in France to create the [Concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde "Concorde") supersonic airliner to share the cost.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jarrett-63)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-64)

[United Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")[DC-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-6 "Douglas DC-6"), Stapleton Airport, Denver, September 1966

The first batch of the [Douglas DC-4s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-4 "Douglas DC-4") went to the U.S. Army and Air Forces,[_[when?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] and was named the [C-54 Skymaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_C-54_Skymaster "Douglas C-54 Skymaster"). Some ex-military DC-6s were later converted into airliners, with both passenger and cargo versions flooding the market shortly after the war's end. Douglas also developed a pressurized version of the DC-4, which it designated the [Douglas DC-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-6 "Douglas DC-6"). Rival company Lockheed produced the [Constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation "Lockheed Constellation"), a triple-tailed aircraft with a wider fuselage than the DC-4.

The [Boeing 377 Stratocruiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_377_Stratocruiser "Boeing 377 Stratocruiser") was based on the [C-97 Stratofreighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_C-97_Stratofreighter "Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter") military transport, it had a double deck and a pressurized fuselage.

Convair produced the [Convair 240](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair_CV-240_family "Convair CV-240 family"), a 40-person pressurized airplane; 566 examples flew. Convair later developed the [Convair 340](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair_CV-240_family "Convair CV-240 family"), which was slightly larger and could accommodate between 44 and 52 passengers, of which 311 were produced. The firm also commenced work on the [Convair 37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair_Model_37 "Convair Model 37"), a relatively large double-deck airliner that would have served trans[continental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent "Continent") routes; however, the project was abandoned due to a lack of customer demand and its high development costs.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Rival planes include the [Martin 2-0-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_2-0-2 "Martin 2-0-2") and [Martin 4-0-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_4-0-4 "Martin 4-0-4"), but the 2-0-2 had safety concerns and was unpressurized, while the 4-0-4 only sold around 100 units.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

During the postwar years, engines became much larger and more powerful, and safety features such as deicing, navigation, and weather information were added to the planes. American planes were allegedly more comfortable and had superior flight decks than those produced in Europe.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jarrett-63)[_[page needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_]

In 1936, the French Air Ministry requested transatlantic flying boats that could hold at least 40 passengers, leading to three [Latécoère 631s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lat%C3%A9co%C3%A8re_631 "Latécoère 631") introduced by [Air France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France "Air France") in July 1947.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Aeroplane0114-65) However, two crashed and the third was removed from service over safety concerns. The [SNCASE Languedoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNCASE_Languedoc "SNCASE Languedoc") was the first French post-war airliner.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Aeroplane0414-66) Accommodating up to 44 seats, 40 aircraft were completed for Air France between October 1945 and April 1948.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-67)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jarrett-63) Air France withdrew the last Languedoc from its domestic routes in 1954, being replaced by later designs.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Aeroplane0414-66) First flying in February 1949, the four-engined [Breguet Deux-Ponts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breguet_Deux-Ponts "Breguet Deux-Ponts") was a double-decker transport for passengers and cargo.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Aeroplane-68) Air France used it on its busiest routes, including from [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport "Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport") to the Mediterranean area and to [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport "London Heathrow Airport").[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Aeroplane-68)

A [Sud-Aviation Caravelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sud-Aviation_Caravelle "Sud-Aviation Caravelle")

The [Sud-Aviation Caravelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sud-Aviation_Caravelle "Sud-Aviation Caravelle") was developed during the late 1950s as the first short range jet airliner. The nose and cockpit layout were licensed from the [de Havilland Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet"), along with some fuselage elements.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-L%C3%B3pez1-69) Entering service in mid 1959, 172 Caravelles had been sold within four years and six versions were in production by 1963.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-70) Sud Aviation then focused its design team on a Caravelle successor.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-L%C3%B3pez1-69)

The [Super-Caravelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sud_Aviation_Super-Caravelle "Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle") was a [supersonic transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_transport "Supersonic transport") project of similar size and range to the Caravelle. It was merged with the similar [Bristol Aeroplane Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company "Bristol Aeroplane Company") project into the Anglo-French [Concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde "Concorde").[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-L%C3%B3pez1-69) The Concorde entered service in January 1967 as the second and last commercial [supersonic transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_transport "Supersonic transport"),[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Gordon_Tu-144-71)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Melik-Karamov_2000-72) after large overruns and delays, costing £1.3 billion.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-73) All subsequent French airliner efforts were part of the [Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus "Airbus") pan-European initiative.

Soon after the war, most of the Soviet fleet of airliners consisted of DC-3s or [Lisunov Li-2s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisunov_Li-2 "Lisunov Li-2"). These planes were in desperate need of replacement, and in 1946, the [Ilyushin Il-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-12 "Ilyushin Il-12") made its first flight. The Il-12 was very similar in design to American Convair 240, except was unpressurized. In 1953, the [Ilyushin Il-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-14 "Ilyushin Il-14") made its first flight, and this version was equipped with much more powerful engines. The main contribution that the Soviets made in regards to airliners was the [Antonov An-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-2 "Antonov An-2"). This plane is a biplane, unlike most of the other airliners, and sold more units than any other transport plane.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

### Narrow-body airliners

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Narrow-body airliners")]

The [Airbus A320 family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family "Airbus A320 family") is the most ordered [narrow-body aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")

The most common airliners are the [narrow-body aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft"), or single-aisles. The earliest [jet airliners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner "Jet airliner") were narrowbodies: the initial [de Havilland Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet"), the [Boeing 707](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_707 "Boeing 707") and its competitor the [Douglas DC-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-8 "Douglas DC-8"). They were followed by smaller models: the [Douglas DC-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-9 "Douglas DC-9") and its [MD-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD-80 "MD-80")/[MD-90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD-90 "MD-90")/[Boeing 717](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_717 "Boeing 717") derivatives; the [Boeing 727](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_727 "Boeing 727"), [737](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737 "Boeing 737") and [757](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_757 "Boeing 757") using the 707 cabin cross-section; or the [Tupolev Tu-154](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-154 "Tupolev Tu-154"), [Ilyushin Il-18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-18 "Ilyushin Il-18"), and the [Ilyushin Il-62](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-62 "Ilyushin Il-62").

Currently produced narrow-body airliners include the [Airbus A220](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A220 "Airbus A220"), [A320 family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family "Airbus A320 family"), [Boeing 737](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737 "Boeing 737"), [Embraer E-Jet family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraer_E-Jet_family "Embraer E-Jet family") and [Comac C919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comac_C919 "Comac C919"), generally used for [medium-haul flights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_length "Flight length") with 100 to 240 passengers. They could be joined by the in-development [Irkut MC-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irkut_MC-21 "Irkut MC-21").

### Wide-body airliners

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Wide-body airliners")]

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Boeing_747_rollout_%283%29.jpg/250px-Boeing_747_rollout_%283%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boeing_747_rollout_(3).jpg)

The first [wide-body aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft"), the [Boeing 747](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747 "Boeing 747"), rolled out in September 1968

The larger [wide-body aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft"), or twin-aisle as they have two separate aisles in the cabin, are used for long-haul flights. The first was the [Boeing 747](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747 "Boeing 747") quadjet, followed by the trijets: the [Lockheed L-1011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_L-1011 "Lockheed L-1011") and the [Douglas DC-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-10 "Douglas DC-10"), then its [MD-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD-11 "MD-11") stretch. Then other quadjets were introduced: the [Ilyushin Il-86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-86 "Ilyushin Il-86") and [Il-96](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-96 "Ilyushin Il-96"), the [Airbus A340](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A340 "Airbus A340") and the double-deck [A380](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380 "Airbus A380"). Twinjets were also put into service: the [Airbus A300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A300 "Airbus A300")/[A310](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A310 "Airbus A310"), [A330](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A330 "Airbus A330") and [A350](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350 "Airbus A350"); the [767](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_767 "Boeing 767"), [777](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777 "Boeing 777") and [787](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787 "Boeing 787").

Over 1,800 [Bombardier CRJs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ "Bombardier CRJ") have been delivered

[Regional airliners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_airliner "Regional airliner") seat fewer than 100 passengers. These smaller aircraft are often used to feed traffic at large [airline hubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_hub "Airline hub") to larger aircraft operated by the major [mainline carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_(flight) "Mainline (flight)"), [legacy carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_carriers "Legacy carriers"), or [flag carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_carrier "Flag carrier"); often sharing the same livery. [Regional jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_jet "Regional jet") include the [Bombardier CRJ100/200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ100/200 "Bombardier CRJ100/200") and [Bombardier CRJ700 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ700_series "Bombardier CRJ700 series"), or the [Embraer ERJ family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraer_ERJ_family "Embraer ERJ family"). Currently produced [turboprop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop") regional airliners include the [Dash-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash-8 "Dash-8") series, and the [ATR 42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATR_42 "ATR 42")/[72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATR_72 "ATR 72").

[Beechcraft 1900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_1900 "Beechcraft 1900"), short-range commuter aircraft

[Light aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_aircraft "Light aircraft") can be used as small commuter airliners, or as [air taxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_taxi "Air taxi"). Twin turboprops carrying up to 19 passengers include the [Beechcraft 1900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_1900 "Beechcraft 1900"), [Fairchild Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Metro "Fairchild Metro"), [Jetstream 31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetstream_31 "Jetstream 31"), [DHC-6 Twin Otter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHC-6_Twin_Otter "DHC-6 Twin Otter") and [Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraer_EMB_110_Bandeirante "Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante"). Smaller airliners include the single-engined turboprops like the [Cessna Caravan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_Caravan "Cessna Caravan") and [Pilatus PC-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilatus_PC-12 "Pilatus PC-12"); or twin piston-powered aircraft made by [Cessna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna "Cessna"), [Piper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Aircraft "Piper Aircraft"), [Britten-Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britten-Norman "Britten-Norman"), and [Beechcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft "Beechcraft"). They often lack [lavatories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory "Aircraft lavatory"), stand-up cabins, [pressurization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressurization "Pressurization"), [galleys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_(kitchen) "Galley (kitchen)"), overhead storage bins, reclining seats, or a [flight attendant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant "Flight attendant").

Until the beginning of the [Jet Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Age "Jet Age"), [piston engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston_engine "Piston engine") were common on [propliners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propliner "Propliner") such as the Douglas DC-3. Nearly all modern airliners are now powered by [turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_turbine "Gas turbine") engines, either [turbofans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan") or [turboprops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop"). Gas turbine engines operate efficiently at much higher altitudes, are more reliable than piston engines, and produce less vibration and noise. The use of a common fuel type – kerosene-based jet fuel – is another advantage.

Some variants of airliners have been developed for carrying freight or for luxury [corporate use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_jet "Business jet"). Many airliners have also been modified for government use as [VIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Important_Person "Very Important Person") transports and for military functions such as airborne tankers (for example, the [Vickers VC10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10"), [Lockheed L-1011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_L-1011 "Lockheed L-1011"), [Boeing 707](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_707 "Boeing 707")), air ambulance ([USAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force")/[USN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy")[McDonnell Douglas DC-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-9 "McDonnell Douglas DC-9")), [reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance "Aerial reconnaissance") ([Embraer ERJ 145](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraer_ERJ_145_family "Embraer ERJ 145 family"), [Saab 340](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_340 "Saab 340"), and [Boeing 737](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737 "Boeing 737")), as well as for troop-carrying roles.

Modern jetliners are usually low-wing designs with two engines mounted underneath the [swept wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swept_wing "Swept wing"), while [turboprop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop") aircraft are slow enough to use straight wings. Smaller airliners sometimes have their engines mounted on either side of the rear fuselage. Numerous advantages and disadvantages exist due to this arrangement.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-74) Perhaps the most important advantage to mounting the engines under the wings is that the total aircraft weight is more evenly distributed across the wingspan, which imposes less [bending moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending_moment "Bending moment") on the wings and allows for a lighter wing structure. This factor becomes more important as aircraft weight increases, and no in-production airliners have both a maximum takeoff weight more than 50 tons and engines mounted on the fuselage. The [Antonov An-148](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-148 "Antonov An-148") is the only in-production jetliner with high-mounted wings (usually seen in [military transport aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft "Military transport aircraft")), which reduces the risk of damage from unpaved runways.

Except for a few experimental or military designs, all aircraft built to date have had all of their weight [lifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)") off the ground by airflow across the wings. In terms of [aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics"), the fuselage has been a mere burden. [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") and [Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing "Boeing") are currently developing a [blended wing body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_wing_body "Blended wing body") design in which the entire airframe, from wingtip to wingtip, contributes lift. This promises a significant gain in [fuel efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation "Fuel efficiency in transportation").[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-75)

By the end of 2018, there were 1,826 parked or in storage jetliners out of 29,824 in service (6.1%): 1,434 narrowbodies and 392 widebodies, down from 9.8% of the fleet at the end of 2012 and 11.3% at the end of 2001.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-83)

Since it began, the [jet airliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner "Jet airliner") market had a recurring pattern of seven years of growth followed by three years of deliveries falling 30–40%, except a steady growth from 2004 due to the [economic rise of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_China_(1949%E2%80%93present)#From_2001 "Economic history of China (1949–present)") going from 3% of world market in 2001 to 22% in 2015, expensive [jet fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_fuel "Jet fuel") till 2014 stimulating old jets replacement allowed by low [interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate") since 2008, and strong [airline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline "Airline") passenger demand since.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-84) In 2004, 718 Airbus and Boeings were delivered, worth $39.3 billion; 1,466 are expected in 2017, worth $104.4 billion: a growth by 3.5 from 2004 to 2020 is unprecedented and highly unusual for any mature market.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-85)

In 2016, the deliveries went for 38% in Asia-Pacific, 25% in Europe, 22% in North America, 7% in Middle East, 6% in South America and 2% in Africa. 1,020 narrowbodies were delivered and their backlog reach 10891: 4,991 A320neo, 644 A320ceo; 3,593 737 Max, 835 737NG, 348 CSeries, 305 C919 and 175 MC-21; while 398 widebodies were delivered: 137 Dreamliners and 99 B777 for Boeing (65%) against 63 A330 and 49 A350 for Airbus, more than 2,400 widebodies were in backlog, led by the A350 with 753 (31%) then the Boeing 787 with 694 (28%).[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86)

The most important driver of orders is airline [profitability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profitability "Profitability"), itself driven mainly by world [GDP growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_growth "GDP growth") but also [supply and demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand "Supply and demand") balance and [oil prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_price "Oil price"), while new programmes by [Airbus and Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_and_Boeing "Airbus and Boeing") help to stimulate aircraft demand. In 2016, 38% of the 25 years old airliners had been retired, 50% of the 28 years old: there will be 523 aircraft reaching 25 years old in 2017, 1,127 in 2026 and 1,628 in 2041. Deliveries rose by 80% from 2004 to 2016, they represented 4.9% of the fleet in 2004 and 5.9% in 2016, down from 8% previously.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-CAPA20June2017-87) Oil prices and [airshow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airshow "Airshow") orders are trending together.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-88)

In 2020, deliveries were down by more than 50% compared to 2019 due to the [impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_aviation "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation"), after 10 years of growth.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-Flight23dec2020-89)

Storage, scrapping and recycling
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Storage, scrapping and recycling")]

Storage can be an adjustment variable for the airliner fleet: as Jan–Apr 2018 [RPKs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_passenger_kilometer "Revenue passenger kilometer") are up by 7% over a year and [FTKs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne-kilometer "Tonne-kilometer") up by 5.1%, the [IATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA "IATA") reports 81 net aircraft went back from storage (132 recalled and 51 stored) in April. It is the second month of storage contraction after eight of expansion and the largest in four years, while new aircraft deliveries fell slightly to 448 from 454 due to supply-chain issues and in-service issues [grounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_on_ground "Aircraft on ground") others. Retirements were down by 8% and utilization up by 2%, according to [Canaccord Genuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaccord_Genuity "Canaccord Genuity"), driving used aircraft and engines values up while [MRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_maintenance "Aircraft maintenance") shops have unexpected demand for legacy products like the [PW4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PW4000 "PW4000") and [GE CF6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_CF6 "GE CF6").[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-AvWeek13jun2018-90)

Cabin configurations and features
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Cabin configurations and features")]

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Flight-interior.jpg/250px-Flight-interior.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flight-interior.jpg)

Interior of a [Qatar Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways "Qatar Airways")[Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus "Airbus"). Video systems (the vertical white panels) are visible above the very centre seats of the aircraft

An airliner will usually have several classes of seating: [first class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_class_travel "First class travel"), [business class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_class "Business class"), and/or [economy class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_class "Economy class") (which may be referred to as coach class or tourist class, and sometimes has a separate "premium" economy section with more legroom and amenities). The seats in more expensive classes are wider, more comfortable, and have more amenities such as "lie flat" seats for more comfortable sleeping on long flights. Generally, the more expensive the class, the better the beverage and meal service.

Domestic flights generally have a two-class configuration, usually first or business class and coach class, although many airlines instead offer all-economy seating. International flights generally have either a two-class configuration or a three-class configuration, depending on the airline, route and aircraft type. Many airliners offer [movies or audio/video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment") on demand (this is standard in first and business class on many international flights and may be available on economy). Cabins of all classes have [lavatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory "Aircraft lavatory") facilities, reading lights, and [air vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_control_system#Air_distribution "Environmental control system"). Some larger airliners have a [rest compartment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_rest_compartment "Crew rest compartment") reserved for crew use during breaks.

The types of seats that are provided and how much legroom is given to each passenger are decisions made by the individual airlines, not the aircraft manufacturers. Seats are mounted in "tracks" on the floor of the cabin and can be moved back and forth by the maintenance staff or removed altogether. One driver of airline profitability is how many passengers can be seated in economy class cabins, meaning that airline companies have an incentive to place seats close together to fit as many passengers in as possible.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-91) In contrast, ‘premium class’ seat configurations provide more space for travelers.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-92)

Passengers seated in an **exit row** (the row of seats adjacent to an [emergency exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_exit "Emergency exit")) usually have substantially more legroom than those seated in the remainder of the cabin, while the seats directly in front of the exit row may have less legroom and may not even recline (for evacuation safety reasons). However, passengers seated in an exit row may be required to assist cabin crew during an [emergency evacuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_evacuation "Emergency evacuation") of the aircraft opening the emergency exit and assisting fellow passengers to the exit. As a precaution, many airlines prohibit young people under the age of 15 from being seated in the exit row.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-93)

The seats are designed to withstand strong forces so as not to break or come loose from their floor tracks during [turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence") or accidents. The backs of seats are often equipped with a fold-down tray for eating, writing, or as a place to set up a portable computer, or a music or video player. Seats without another row of seats in front of them have a tray that is either folded into the armrest or that clips into brackets on the underside of the armrests. However, seats in premium cabins generally have trays in the armrests or clip-on trays, regardless of whether there is another row of seats in front of them. Seatbacks now often feature small colour [LCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCD "LCD") screens for videos, television and video games. Controls for this display as well as an outlet to plug in audio headsets are normally found in the armrest of each seat.

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Overhead_bins_%286389156645%29.jpg/250px-Overhead_bins_%286389156645%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Overhead_bins_(6389156645).jpg)

Overhead bins aboard a [Sukhoi Superjet 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Superjet_100 "Sukhoi Superjet 100")

The overhead bins, also known as overhead lockers or pivot bins, are used for stowing carry-on baggage and other items. While the airliner manufacturer will normally specify a standard version of the product to supply, airlines can choose to have bins of differing size, shape, or color installed. Over time, overhead bins evolved out of what were originally overhead shelves that were used for little more than coat and briefcase storage. As concerns about falling debris during turbulence or in accidents increased, enclosed bins became[_[when?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] the norm. Bins have increased in size to accommodate the larger carry-on baggage passengers can bring onto the aircraft. Newer bin designs have included a handrail, useful when moving through the cabin.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aircraft#cite_note-94)

### Passenger service units

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Passenger service units")]

Above the passenger seats are [Passenger Service Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_Service_Unit "Passenger Service Unit") (PSU). These typically contain reading lights, air vents, and a flight attendant call light. On most narrowbody aircraft (and some [Airbus A300s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A300 "Airbus A300") and [A310s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A310 "Airbus A310")), the flight attendant call button and the buttons to control the reading lights are located directly on the PSU, while on most widebody aircraft, the flight attendant call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the [in-flight entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment") system. The units frequently have small "Fasten Seat Belt" and "No Smoking" illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system. On some newer aircraft, a "Turn off electronic devices" sign is used instead of the "No Smoking" sign, as smoking isn't permitted on board the aircraft anyway.

The PSU will also normally contain the drop-down [oxygen masks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_mask "Oxygen mask") which are activated if there is a sudden drop in cabin pressure. These are supplied with oxygen by means of a [chemical oxygen generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator "Chemical oxygen generator"). By using a chemical reaction rather than a connection to an oxygen tank, these devices supply breathing oxygen for long enough for the airliner to descend to thicker, more breathable air. Oxygen generators do generate considerable heat in the process. Because of this, the oxygen generators are thermally shielded and are only allowed in commercial airliners when properly installed – they are not permitted to be loaded as freight on passenger-carrying flights. [ValuJet Flight 592](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ValuJet_Flight_592 "ValuJet Flight 592") crashed on May 11, 1996, as a result of improperly loaded chemical oxygen generators.

### Cabin pressurization

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Cabin pressurization")]

Airliners developed since the 1940s have had pressurized cabins (or, more accurately, pressurized hulls including baggage holds) to enable them to carry passengers safely at high altitudes where low oxygen levels and air pressure would otherwise cause sickness or death. High altitude flight enabled airliners to fly above most weather systems that cause turbulent or dangerous flying conditions, and also to fly faster and further as there is less drag due to the lower air density. Pressurization is applied using compressed air, in most cases bled from the engines, and is managed by an [environmental control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_control_system "Environmental control system") which draws in clean air, and vents stale air out through a valve.

Pressurization presents design and construction challenges to maintain the structural integrity and sealing of the cabin and hull and to prevent [rapid decompression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_decompression "Rapid decompression"). Some of the consequences include small round windows, [doors that open inwards and are larger than the door hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_door "Plug door"), and an [emergency oxygen system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_oxygen_system "Emergency oxygen system").

To maintain a pressure in the cabin equivalent to an altitude close to sea level would, at a cruising altitude around 10,000 m (33,000 ft), create a pressure difference between inside the aircraft and outside the aircraft that would require greater hull strength and weight. Most people do not suffer ill effects up to an altitude of 1,800–2,500 m (5,900–8,200 ft), and maintaining cabin pressure at this equivalent altitude significantly reduces the pressure difference and therefore the required hull strength and weight. A side effect is that passengers experience some discomfort as the cabin pressure changes during ascent and descent to the majority of airports, which are at low altitudes.

### Cabin climate control

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Cabin climate control")]

The air bled from the engines is hot and requires cooling by [air conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning "Air conditioning") units. It is also extremely dry at cruising altitude, and this causes sore eyes, dry skin and [mucosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucosa "Mucosa") on long flights. Although [humidification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidifier "Humidifier") technology could raise its [relative humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity "Relative humidity") to comfortable middle levels, this is not done since humidity promotes [corrosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion "Corrosion") to the inside of the hull and risks [condensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation "Condensation") which could [short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_circuit "Short circuit") electrical systems, so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value, around 10%. Another problem of the air coming from the ventilation (unto which the oil lubrication system of the engines is hooked up) is that fumes from components in the synthetic oils can sometimes travel along, causing passengers, pilots and crew to be intoxicated. The illness it causes is called [aerotoxic syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerotoxic_syndrome "Aerotoxic syndrome").

Airliners must have space on board to store "checked" baggage – that which will not safely fit in the passenger cabin.

Designed to hold baggage as well as freight, these compartments are called "cargo bins", "baggage holds", "luggage holds", or occasionally "pits". Occasionally baggage holds may be referred to as **cargo decks** on the largest of aircraft. These compartments can be accessed through doors on the outside of the aircraft.

Depending on the aircraft, baggage holds are normally inside the hull and are therefore pressurized just like the passenger cabin although they may not be heated. While lighting is normally installed for use by the loading crew, typically the compartment is unlit when the door is closed.

Baggage holds on modern airliners are equipped with fire detection equipment and larger aircraft have automated or remotely activated fire-fighting devices installed.

### Narrow-body airliners

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Narrow-body airliners")]

Most "[narrow-body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")" airliners with more than 100 seats have space below the cabin floor, while smaller aircraft often have a special compartment separate from the passenger area but on the same level.

Baggage is normally stacked within the bin by hand, sorted by destination category. Netting that fits across the width of the bin is secured to limit movement of the bags. Airliners often carry items of [freight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight "Freight") and mail. These may be loaded separately from the baggage or mixed in if they are bound for the same destination. For securing bulky items "hold down" rings are provided to tie items into place.

### Wide-body airliners

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Wide-body airliners")]

"[Wide-body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")" airliners frequently have a compartment like the ones described above, typically called a "bulk bin". It is normally used for late arriving luggage or bags which may have been checked at the gate.

However, most baggage and loose freight items are loaded into containers called [Unit Load Devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device") (ULDs), often referred to as "cans". ULDs come in a variety of sizes and shapes, but the most common model is the [LD3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LD3 "LD3"). This particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and fits across half of its width.

ULDs are loaded with baggage and are transported to the aircraft on [dolly carts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_support_equipment#Dollies "Ground support equipment") and loaded into the baggage hold by a loader designed for the task. By means of [belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt "Conveyor belt") and [rollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roller_(machine_part)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Roller (machine part) (page does not exist)") an operator can maneuver the ULD from the dolly cart, up to the aircraft baggage hold door, and into the aircraft. Inside the hold, the floor is also equipped with drive wheels and rollers that an operator inside can use to move the ULD properly into place. Locks in the floor are used to hold the ULD in place during flight.

For consolidated freight loads, like a pallet of boxes or an item too oddly shaped to fit into a container, flat metal pallets that resemble large baking sheets that are compatible with the loading equipment are used.
