( November 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , synthetic differential geometry is a formalization of the theory of differential geometry in the language of topos theory .  There are several insights that allow for such a reformulation.  The first is that most of the analytic data for describing the class of smooth manifolds can be encoded into certain fibre bundles on manifolds: namely bundles of jets (see also jet bundle ).  The second insight is that the operation of assigning a bundle of jets to a smooth manifold is functorial in nature.  The third insight is that over a certain category , these are representable functors .  Furthermore, their representatives are related to the algebras of dual numbers , so that smooth infinitesimal analysis may be used.

Synthetic differential geometry can serve as a platform for formulating certain otherwise obscure or confusing notions from differential geometry.  For example, the meaning of what it means to be natural (or invariant ) has a particularly simple expression, even though the formulation in classical differential geometry may be quite difficult.
