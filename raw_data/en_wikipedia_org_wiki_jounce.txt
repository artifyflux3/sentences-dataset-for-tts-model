The higher-order derivatives are less common than the first three; [ 1 ] [ 2 ] thus their names are not as standardized, though the concept of a minimum snap trajectory has been used in robotics .

[ 3 ] The fourth derivative is referred to as snap , leading the fifth and sixth derivatives to be "sometimes somewhat facetiously" [ 4 ] called crackle and pop , named after the Rice Krispies mascots of the same name .

[ 5 ] The fourth derivative is also called jounce .

[ 4 ] Fourth derivative (snap/jounce) [ edit ] Snap, [ 6 ] or jounce, [ 2 ] is the fourth derivative of the position vector with respect to time , or the rate of change of the jerk with respect to time.

[ 4 ] Equivalently, it is the second derivative of acceleration or the third derivative of velocity ,
and is defined by any of the following equivalent expressions: s → → = d ȷ ȷ → → d t = d 2 a → → d t 2 = d 3 v → → d t 3 = d 4 r → → d t 4 .

{\displaystyle {\vec {s}}={\frac {d\,{\vec {\jmath }}}{dt}}={\frac {d^{2}{\vec {a}}}{dt^{2}}}={\frac {d^{3}{\vec {v}}}{dt^{3}}}={\frac {d^{4}{\vec {r}}}{dt^{4}}}.} In civil engineering , the design of railway tracks and roads involves the minimization of snap, particularly around bends with different radii of curvature . When snap is constant, the jerk changes linearly, allowing for a smooth increase in radial acceleration , and when, as is preferred, the snap is zero, the change in radial acceleration is linear. The minimization or elimination of snap is commonly done using a mathematical clothoid function. Minimizing snap improves the performance of machine tools and roller coasters.

[ 1 ] The following equations are used for constant snap: ȷ ȷ → → = ȷ ȷ → → 0 + s → → t , a → → = a → → 0 + ȷ ȷ → → 0 t + 1 2 s → → t 2 , v → → = v → → 0 + a → → 0 t + 1 2 ȷ ȷ → → 0 t 2 + 1 6 s → → t 3 , r → → = r → → 0 + v → → 0 t + 1 2 a → → 0 t 2 + 1 6 ȷ ȷ → → 0 t 3 + 1 24 s → → t 4 , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\vec {\jmath }}&={\vec {\jmath }}_{0}+{\vec {s}}t,\\{\vec {a}}&={\vec {a}}_{0}+{\vec {\jmath }}_{0}t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {s}}t^{2},\\{\vec {v}}&={\vec {v}}_{0}+{\vec {a}}_{0}t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {\jmath }}_{0}t^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{6}}{\vec {s}}t^{3},\\{\vec {r}}&={\vec {r}}_{0}+{\vec {v}}_{0}t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {a}}_{0}t^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{6}}{\vec {\jmath }}_{0}t^{3}+{\tfrac {1}{24}}{\vec {s}}t^{4},\end{aligned}}} where s → → {\displaystyle {\vec {s}}} is constant snap, ȷ ȷ → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {\jmath }}_{0}} is initial jerk, ȷ ȷ → → {\displaystyle {\vec {\jmath }}} is final jerk, a → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {a}}_{0}} is initial acceleration, a → → {\displaystyle {\vec {a}}} is final acceleration, v → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}_{0}} is initial velocity, v → → {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}} is final velocity, r → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}_{0}} is initial position, r → → {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}} is final position, t {\displaystyle t} is time between initial and final states.

The notation s → → {\displaystyle {\vec {s}}} (used by Visser [ 4 ] ) is not to be confused with the displacement vector commonly denoted similarly.

The dimensions of snap are distance per fourth power of time [LT −4 ]. The corresponding SI unit is metre per second to the fourth power,  m/s 4 , m⋅s −4 .

Fifth derivative [ edit ] The fifth derivative of the position vector with respect to time is sometimes referred to as crackle.

[ 5 ] It is the rate of change of snap with respect to time.

[ 5 ] [ 4 ] Crackle is defined by any of the following equivalent expressions: c → → = d s → → d t = d 2 ȷ ȷ → → d t 2 = d 3 a → → d t 3 = d 4 v → → d t 4 = d 5 r → → d t 5 {\displaystyle {\vec {c}}={\frac {d{\vec {s}}}{dt}}={\frac {d^{2}{\vec {\jmath }}}{dt^{2}}}={\frac {d^{3}{\vec {a}}}{dt^{3}}}={\frac {d^{4}{\vec {v}}}{dt^{4}}}={\frac {d^{5}{\vec {r}}}{dt^{5}}}} The following equations are used for constant crackle: s → → = s → → 0 + c → → t ȷ ȷ → → = ȷ ȷ → → 0 + s → → 0 t + 1 2 c → → t 2 a → → = a → → 0 + ȷ ȷ → → 0 t + 1 2 s → → 0 t 2 + 1 6 c → → t 3 v → → = v → → 0 + a → → 0 t + 1 2 ȷ ȷ → → 0 t 2 + 1 6 s → → 0 t 3 + 1 24 c → → t 4 r → → = r → → 0 + v → → 0 t + 1 2 a → → 0 t 2 + 1 6 ȷ ȷ → → 0 t 3 + 1 24 s → → 0 t 4 + 1 120 c → → t 5 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\vec {s}}&={\vec {s}}_{0}+{\vec {c}}\,t\\[1ex]{\vec {\jmath }}&={\vec {\jmath }}_{0}+{\vec {s}}_{0}\,t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {c}}\,t^{2}\\[1ex]{\vec {a}}&={\vec {a}}_{0}+{\vec {\jmath }}_{0}\,t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {s}}_{0}\,t^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{6}}{\vec {c}}\,t^{3}\\[1ex]{\vec {v}}&={\vec {v}}_{0}+{\vec {a}}_{0}\,t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {\jmath }}_{0}\,t^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{6}}{\vec {s}}_{0}\,t^{3}+{\tfrac {1}{24}}{\vec {c}}\,t^{4}\\[1ex]{\vec {r}}&={\vec {r}}_{0}+{\vec {v}}_{0}\,t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {a}}_{0}\,t^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{6}}{\vec {\jmath }}_{0}\,t^{3}+{\tfrac {1}{24}}{\vec {s}}_{0}\,t^{4}+{\tfrac {1}{120}}{\vec {c}}\,t^{5}\end{aligned}}} where c → → {\displaystyle {\vec {c}}} : constant crackle, s → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {s}}_{0}} : initial snap, s → → {\displaystyle {\vec {s}}} : final snap, ȷ ȷ → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {\jmath }}_{0}} : initial jerk, ȷ ȷ → → {\displaystyle {\vec {\jmath }}} : final jerk, a → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {a}}_{0}} : initial acceleration, a → → {\displaystyle {\vec {a}}} : final acceleration, v → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}_{0}} : initial velocity, v → → {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}} : final velocity, r → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}_{0}} : initial position, r → → {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}} : final position, t {\displaystyle t} : time between initial and final states.

The dimensions of crackle are [LT −5 ]. The corresponding SI unit is m/s 5 .

Sixth derivative [ edit ] The sixth derivative of the position vector with respect to time is sometimes referred to as pop.

[ 5 ] It is the rate of change of crackle with respect to time.

[ 5 ] [ 4 ] Pop is defined by any of the following equivalent expressions: p → → = d c → → d t = d 2 s → → d t 2 = d 3 ȷ ȷ → → d t 3 = d 4 a → → d t 4 = d 5 v → → d t 5 = d 6 r → → d t 6 {\displaystyle {\vec {p}}={\frac {d{\vec {c}}}{dt}}={\frac {d^{2}{\vec {s}}}{dt^{2}}}={\frac {d^{3}{\vec {\jmath }}}{dt^{3}}}={\frac {d^{4}{\vec {a}}}{dt^{4}}}={\frac {d^{5}{\vec {v}}}{dt^{5}}}={\frac {d^{6}{\vec {r}}}{dt^{6}}}} The following equations are used for constant pop: c → → = c → → 0 + p → → t s → → = s → → 0 + c → → 0 t + 1 2 p → → t 2 ȷ ȷ → → = ȷ ȷ → → 0 + s → → 0 t + 1 2 c → → 0 t 2 + 1 6 p → → t 3 a → → = a → → 0 + ȷ ȷ → → 0 t + 1 2 s → → 0 t 2 + 1 6 c → → 0 t 3 + 1 24 p → → t 4 v → → = v → → 0 + a → → 0 t + 1 2 ȷ ȷ → → 0 t 2 + 1 6 s → → 0 t 3 + 1 24 c → → 0 t 4 + 1 120 p → → t 5 r → → = r → → 0 + v → → 0 t + 1 2 a → → 0 t 2 + 1 6 ȷ ȷ → → 0 t 3 + 1 24 s → → 0 t 4 + 1 120 c → → 0 t 5 + 1 720 p → → t 6 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\vec {c}}&={\vec {c}}_{0}+{\vec {p}}\,t\\{\vec {s}}&={\vec {s}}_{0}+{\vec {c}}_{0}\,t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {p}}\,t^{2}\\{\vec {\jmath }}&={\vec {\jmath }}_{0}+{\vec {s}}_{0}\,t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {c}}_{0}\,t^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{6}}{\vec {p}}\,t^{3}\\{\vec {a}}&={\vec {a}}_{0}+{\vec {\jmath }}_{0}\,t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {s}}_{0}\,t^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{6}}{\vec {c}}_{0}\,t^{3}+{\tfrac {1}{24}}{\vec {p}}\,t^{4}\\{\vec {v}}&={\vec {v}}_{0}+{\vec {a}}_{0}\,t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {\jmath }}_{0}\,t^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{6}}{\vec {s}}_{0}\,t^{3}+{\tfrac {1}{24}}{\vec {c}}_{0}\,t^{4}+{\tfrac {1}{120}}{\vec {p}}\,t^{5}\\{\vec {r}}&={\vec {r}}_{0}+{\vec {v}}_{0}\,t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\vec {a}}_{0}\,t^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{6}}{\vec {\jmath }}_{0}\,t^{3}+{\tfrac {1}{24}}{\vec {s}}_{0}\,t^{4}+{\tfrac {1}{120}}{\vec {c}}_{0}\,t^{5}+{\tfrac {1}{720}}{\vec {p}}\,t^{6}\end{aligned}}} where p → → {\displaystyle {\vec {p}}} : constant pop, c → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {c}}_{0}} : initial crackle, c → → {\displaystyle {\vec {c}}} : final crackle, s → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {s}}_{0}} : initial snap, s → → {\displaystyle {\vec {s}}} : final snap, ȷ ȷ → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {\jmath }}_{0}} : initial jerk, ȷ ȷ → → {\displaystyle {\vec {\jmath }}} : final jerk, a → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {a}}_{0}} : initial acceleration, a → → {\displaystyle {\vec {a}}} : final acceleration, v → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}_{0}} : initial velocity, v → → {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}} : final velocity, r → → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}_{0}} : initial position, r → → {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}} : final position, t {\displaystyle t} : time between initial and final states.
