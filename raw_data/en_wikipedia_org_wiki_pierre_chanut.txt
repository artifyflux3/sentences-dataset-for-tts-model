Pierre Hector Chanut (February 22, 1601 in Riom – July 3, 1662 in Livry-sur-Seine ) was a civil servant in the Auvergne , a French ambassador in Sweden and the Dutch Republic , and state counsellor.

[ 1 ] Life [ edit ] In 1626 Chanut married Marguerite Clerselier and had eight children.

[ 2 ] Charged by Jules Mazarin he resided from 1646 to 1649 at the Swedish court and in Osnabrück, where he negotiated the Peace of Westfalia .

[ 3 ] His companion Antoine de Courtin became Christina's secretary.

In 1646 Chanut met and corresponded with the philosopher René Descartes , asking him for a copy of his Meditations . Upon showing Christina of Sweden some of the letters, the queen became interested in beginning a correspondence with Descartes. She invited him to Sweden, but Descartes was reluctant until she asked him to organize a scientific academy. He resided with Chanut, and finished his Passions of the Soul . Chanut lived at Västerlånggatan , 450 meters from Tre Kronor (castle) on Gamla Stan . There, Chanut and Descartes made observations with a Torricellian barometer, a tube with mercury . Chanut was criticized when he organized a private mass in his house.

[ 4 ] Descartes died of pneumonia according to Chanut.

[ 5 ] Over time there have  been speculations regarding the death of the philosopher.

[ 6 ] Theodor Ebert claimed that Descartes did not meet his end by being exposed to the harsh Swedish winter climate, as philosophers have been fond of repeating, but by arsenic poisoning .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Vasterlanggatan 68.

In 1651, during Second Northern War , Chanut departed to Lübeck to a Congress which had to mediate peace between Sweden and Poland. Peace talks failed, however, and in 1653 Chanut returned to Stockholm. He probably invited Pierre Bourdelot and Gabriel Naudé , but departed to The Hague , where he was appointed as ambassador. In 1655, back in Paris, he became Conseiller d'Etat .

In the summer of 1654, Christina left Sweden and settled in Rome. In August 1656 Christina traveled to Paris. In October, apartments were assigned to her at the Palace of Fontainebleau , where she committed an action which stained her memory – the execution of marchese Gian Rinaldo Monaldeschi , her master of the horse.

[ 10 ] After the murder of Gian Rinaldo Monaldeschi Christina promised Chanut that Ludivico Santinelli and his two helpers would have to leave her court.

[ 11 ] His friend and brother-in-law Claude Clerselier , an editor, inherited all the manuscripts by Descartes in 1662 and published them. His Mémoires et Négociations (Memoirs and Negotiations) were published posthumously (1676); his correspondence is preserved in Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.
