Most scientists are scientists of the Russian Federation .

The institute has seven laboratories, each with its own specialisation: theoretical physics , high energy physics (particle physics), heavy ion physics, condensed matter physics, nuclear reactions, neutron physics, and information technology . The institute has a division to study radiation and radiobiological research and other ad hoc experimental physics experiments.

Principal research instruments include a nuclotron superconductive particle accelerator (particle energy : 7 GeV ), three isochronous cyclotrons (120, 145, 650 MeV), a phasitron (680 MeV) and a synchrophasotron (4 GeV). The site has a neutron fast-pulse reactor (1,500MW pulse) with nineteen associated instruments receiving neutron beams.

Founding [ edit ] The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research was established on the basis of an agreement signed on 26 March 1956, in Moscow by representatives of the governments of the eleven founding countries, with a view to combining their scientific and material potential. The USSR contributed 50 percent, the People's Republic of China 20 percent. In February 1957, the JINR was registered by the United Nations . The institute is located in Dubna , 120 km north of Moscow.

At the time of the creation of JINR, the Institute of Nuclear Problems (INP) of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR already existed at the site of the future Dubna since the late 1940s, and it launched a program of fundamental and applied research at the synchrocyclotron . The Electrophysics Laboratory of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (EFLAN) was established, and under the guidance of Academician Vladimir Veksler , work began to create a new accelerator – a proton synchrophasotron – with a record energy of 10 GeV at that time.

By the mid-1950s, there was a worldwide consensus that nuclear science should be accessible and that only broad cooperation could ensure the progressive development of this research, as well as the peaceful use of atomic energy. Thus, in 1954, near Geneva , CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) was established. At about the same time, the countries that belonged to the socialist community decided to establish a Joint Institute for Nuclear Research on the basis of the INP and EFLAN.

The first director of the United Institute was Professor D. I. Blokhintsev , who just completed the creation of Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant the world's first nuclear power plant in Obninsk . The first vice-directors of JINR were professors Marian Danysz (Poland) and V. Votruba (Czechoslovakia).

The history of the formation of the JINR is associated with the names of prominent scientists and Professors. The following list provides some of the names of prominent scientists.

Shapiro Dmitry Shirkov E. Yanik (Polish: Jerzy Janik) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Cooperation [ edit ] The JINR cooperates with many organizations. One of the main organizations with which JINR cooperates is UNESCO . Its collaboration with JINR started in 1997 in order to develop basic sciences and try to achieve sustainable development. Joint activities include training programmes and grant mechanisms for researchers in the basic science. This international scientific cooperation and knowledge sharing in key scientific fields is one of the main 2030 UNESCO goals, the achievement of Sustainable Development.

[ 4 ] The United Nations General Assembly and UNESCO General Conference named 2019 as The International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements (IYPTE 2019). This reinforced the cooperation between these two organizations.

[ 4 ] JINR was one of the observers of European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) from 2014 till 25 March 2022.

[ 16 ] The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was one of the founding states in 1956. It has been suspended from participating in JINR since 2015.

[ 17 ] Structure of research [ edit ] The main fields of the institute's research are: Theoretical physics Elementary particle physics Relativistic nuclear physics Heavy ion physics Low and intermediate energy physics Nuclear physics with neutrons Condensed matter physics Radiobiology Computer networking , computing and computational physics Educational programme The JINR possess eight laboratories and University Centre.

Its facilities enable a tenfold increase in beam intensity; such an increase in sensitivity enables the study of reactions with lower cross sections that would otherwise be inaccessible. Sergey Dmitriev, director of the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, believes that the SHE factory will enable closer examination of nuclei near the limits of stability, as well as experiments aimed at the synthesis of elements 119 and 120 .
