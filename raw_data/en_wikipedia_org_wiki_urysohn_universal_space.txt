The Urysohn universal space is a certain metric space that contains all separable metric spaces in a particularly nice manner. This mathematics concept is due to Pavel Urysohn , who presented an explicit construction. Another construction has been subsequently developed by Felix Hausdorff and a more general notion was discussed by Miroslav Katětov .

[ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] A metric space ( U , d ) is called Urysohn universal [ 2 ] if it is separable and complete and has the following property: given any finite metric space X , any point x in X , and any isometric embedding f : X \{ x } → U , there exists an isometric embedding F : X → U that extends f , i.e. such that F ( y ) = f ( y ) for all y in X \{ x }.

Properties [ edit ] If U is Urysohn universal and X is any separable metric space, then there exists an isometric embedding f : X → U . (Other spaces share this property: for instance, the space l ∞ of all bounded real sequences with the supremum norm admits isometric embeddings of all separable metric spaces (" Fréchet embedding"), as does the space C[0,1] of all continuous functions [0,1]→ R , again with the supremum norm, a result due to Stefan Banach .) Furthermore, every isometry between finite subsets of U extends to an isometry of U onto itself. This kind of "homogeneity" actually characterizes Urysohn universal spaces: A separable complete metric space that contains an isometric image of every separable metric space is Urysohn universal if and only if it is homogeneous in this sense.

Existence and uniqueness [ edit ] Urysohn proved that a Urysohn universal space exists, and that any two Urysohn universal spaces are isometric . This can be seen as follows. Take ( X , d ) , ( X ′ , d ′ ) {\displaystyle (X,d),(X',d')} , two Urysohn universal spaces. These are separable, so fix in the respective spaces countable dense subsets ( x n ) n , ( x n ′ ) n {\displaystyle (x_{n})_{n},(x'_{n})_{n}} . These must be properly infinite, so by a back-and-forth argument, one can step-wise construct partial isometries ϕ ϕ n : X → → X ′ {\displaystyle \phi _{n}:X\to X'} whose domain (resp. range) contains { x k : k < n } {\displaystyle \{x_{k}:k<n\}} (resp.

{ x k ′ : k < n } {\displaystyle \{x'_{k}:k<n\}} ). The union of these maps defines a partial isometry ϕ ϕ : X → → X ′ {\displaystyle \phi :X\to X'} whose domain resp. range are dense in the respective spaces. And such maps extend (uniquely) to isometries, since a Urysohn universal space is required to be complete.
