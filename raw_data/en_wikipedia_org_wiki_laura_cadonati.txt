Career [ edit ] Cadonati completed her PhD at Princeton University in 2001 with her thesis The Borexino Solar Neutrino Experiment and its Scintillator Containment Vessel . She was an associate professor in the physics department at University of Massachusetts Amherst before moving to the Center for Relativistic Astrophysics at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2015.

[ 1 ] Cadonati has been a member of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) collaboration since 2002, [ 2 ] and was involved in the first observations of gravitational waves in 2015.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In 2017 she became the first deputy spokesperson for LIGO [ 5 ] and was widely quoted in the media as LIGO detected its third gravitational wave.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ excessive citations ] Cadonati became associate dean for research in the College of Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2021.

[ 15 ] She is a member of the International Astronomical Union .

[ 16 ] Awards and honors [ edit ] 2010 National Science Foundation CAREER award [ 17 ] 2015 Fellow of the American Physical Society for "leadership of the gravitational-wave data analysis and astrophysics efforts of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, including work connecting numerical modeling of sources to observations with the LIGO, Virgo, and GEO detectors" [ 18 ] 2018 Outstanding Faculty Research Author Award [ 19 ] References [ edit ] ^ "Laura Cadonati | Department of Physics | UMass Amherst" .
