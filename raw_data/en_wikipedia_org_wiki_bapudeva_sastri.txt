[ 1 ] Bapudeva Sastri or Narasimha Deva Paranjpe (1821–1900) was an Indian mathematician.

Biography [ edit ] He was born on 1 November 1821, to a Hindu Brahmin family of Maharashtra .

[ 2 ] He received his early education in arithmetic and algebra at the Marathi school in Nagpur . He also studied the Lilāvati and Bijaganita under Dhundiraja Misra .
Noting his talent, the British political agent Lancelot Wilkinson secured his admission to the Sehore Sanskrit school where he studied Siddhānta Shiromani , Euclidean Geometry and European science in general under Pandit Sevarama and Wilkinson himself. In 1842 Sastri went to Government Sanskrit College, Varanasi , where he taught rekha-ganita (Euclidean Geometry). In 1890 Sudhakar Dwivedi was appointed the teacher of mathematics and astrology after Bapudeva Sastri, retired in 1889.

[ 3 ] Scholarly works [ edit ] Bapudeva Sastri translated the Siddhānta Shiromani (a treatise on Hindu mathematics written in the twelfth century by Bhaskaracharya ) and published it in Benares in 1891. With Lancelot Wilkinson, Sastri wrote commentary on The Surya Siddhanta (a treatise on Hindu astronomy).
