Since its establishment in 1899, the university has grown to be the seventh-largest university in Texas. Texas State University reached a record enrollment of 40,678 students in the 2024 fall semester, continuing a trend of enrollment growth over several years.

[ 7 ] Texas State University offers over 200 bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs from its nine colleges. The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) and designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) by the U.S. Department of Education. Texas State is classified among "R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity" [ 8 ] [ 9 ] and an Emerging Research University (ERU) by the State of Texas.

[ 10 ] It spent over $160 million in research expenditures during fiscal year 2024.

[ 11 ] The 36th president of the United States , Lyndon B. Johnson , graduated from the institution in 1930; [ 12 ] Texas State University is the only college or university in Texas to have a U.S. president as an alumnus.

Texas State's main campus consists of 259 buildings on 517 acres (2.09 km 2 ) of hilly land along the San Marcos River . Additionally, it has a 101 acres (0.41 km 2 ) satellite campus at its Round Rock Campus (RRC) in the greater north Austin area. The university operates the 70 acres (0.28 km 2 ) Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Park, a technology commercialization and applied research facility.

[ 13 ] Texas State has 4,522 acres (18.30 km 2 ) additional acres of recreational, instructional, farm, and ranch land. The Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State is the largest forensics research facility in the world.

[ 14 ] Texas State University's intercollegiate sports teams, the Bobcats , compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Sun Belt Conference .

History [ edit ] Texas State University was first proposed in a March 3, 1899 bill by state representative Fred Cocke with the name of Southwest Texas State Normal School.  Cocke represented the citizens of Hays and surrounding counties where the school was to be located.  While there was opposition to the bill, with the support of state senator J.B. Dibrell, it was finally passed and signed into law on May 10, 1899, by Governor Joseph D. Sayers .

[ 15 ] The school's purpose was to train the future teachers of Texas.  Any students earning a diploma and teaching certificate from the school would be authorized to teach in the state's public schools.

[ 16 ] In October 1899, the San Marcos City Council voted to donate 11 acres (45,000 m 2 ) of land at what was known as Chautauqua Hill for the school to be built on.  It was not until 1901 that the Texas legislature accepted this donation and approved $25,000 to be used for construction of buildings on the site.

[ 17 ] The building now known as Old Main was completed and the school opened its doors to its first enrollment of 303 students in September 1903.

[ 15 ] In 1912, the San Marcos School Board began a partnership with the school to allow Southwest Texas State Normal School students to instruct local school children as part of their training to become teachers.  The San Marcos East End Ward School, comprising the first eight grades of the school district, was moved onto the Southwest Texas State campus in 1917.  In 1935, a formal contract between Southwest Texas State Teachers College, as it was known then, and the San Marcos school district for the "Public Schools [to become] the laboratory school for said Teachers College."  The school would be under the control and supervision of the city of San Marcos but Southwest Texas State was responsible for providing and maintaining buildings and equipment for the city's elementary and junior high schools .

[ 18 ] : 15–18 The college enrolled its first African-American students in 1963, following a federal lawsuit brought by Dana Smith, who became one of the first five African Americans at the institution when a district court judge ruled that they could not be denied admission based on race.

[ 19 ] On November 8, 1965, the school's most famous alumnus, United States president Lyndon B. Johnson , returned to his alma mater to sign the Higher Education Act of 1965 a part of the Great Society programs.

[ 20 ] In a speech, held in the old Strahan Gymnasium on the school's campus (now the Music Building), prior to signing the bill, he recounted his own difficulties affording to go to college: having to shower and shave in the school's gymnasium, living above a faculty member's garage, and working multiple jobs.

[ 21 ] On November 13, 1969, ten students were suspended from Texas State for protesting the Vietnam War. They became known as the "San Marcos 10." They appealed their expulsion through the normal school channels and then filed a lawsuit against the president of the university, the dean of students and the Texas State University system Board of Regents. They were reinstated via injunction and attended classes while their case moved through the courts. When their appeals were rejected, they submitted their case to the U.S. Supreme Court, but only Justice William Douglas voted to hear their argument so the decisions of the lower courts stood. The San Marcos 10 subsequently lost all of the credits for the semesters they completed while their lawsuit moved through the court system.

[ 22 ] Expansion [ edit ] The campus has grown substantially from its original 11 acres in 1899. During the first 40 years of the school's history, the campus was expanded to accommodate 18 buildings around the original Main Building. These buildings included academic buildings, a library, buildings to house the San Marcos school students, dormitories, a dining hall, and men's and women's gymnasiums.

[ 18 ] : 18–31 In 1926, 90 acres of land adjacent to the San Marcos River was purchased by A. B. Rogers to build a hotel, glass-bottom boat rides and other water-based attractions to become the Aquarena Springs theme park. The university bought the property in 1994 intending to use the land as a research and education center. In 2002, this piece of land became known as the International Institute for Sustainable Water Resources and offered educational tours including a wetlands boardwalk and continued to offer glass-bottom boat rides.

[ 23 ] In 1996, the school began offering courses in Round Rock, Texas , on the campus of Westwood High School . It originally offered night classes that allowed students to earn graduate degrees in business administration and education. As enrollment in these programs increased and with a gift of 101 acres (0.41 km 2 ), the Texas State University Round Rock Campus was constructed and opened in 2005.

[ 17 ] Name changes [ edit ] The school's name has changed several times over the course of its history. The first change occurred in 1918 when Southwest Texas State Normal School became Southwest Texas State Normal College , after the Board of Regents, two years earlier, had authorized the school to begin granting degrees as a senior college .

[ 15 ] : 8 [ 18 ] : 55 In 1921, a statewide effort was launched to improve academic standards in Texas normal schools to meet more closely the requirements of the University of Texas .

[ 24 ] : 60 These improvements prompted a second name change in 1923, when the Texas Legislature renamed the school Southwest Texas State Teachers College .

[ 15 ] : 40 Another change occurred in 1959, with the school becoming Southwest Texas State College . Ten years later, the legislature renamed the school Southwest Texas State University .

[ 17 ] In 2003, members of the school's Associated Student Government (ASG), approached state senator Jeff Wentworth asking that the school be renamed Texas State University at San Marcos .  The ASG had unanimously approved a resolution supporting the change, arguing that the current name reflected a regionalism that was not aligned with the university's effort to reach top-tier status .  The ASG further said that donations from the school's alumni would pay for implementing the name change so that state tax dollars would not be required.

[ 25 ] Some students and alumni protested the change, pointing out that no vote had been taken on the matter.

[ 26 ] A bill, sponsored by Senator Wentworth, was passed and on September 1, 2003, the school became known as Texas State University–San Marcos .  The city was originally included in the name to differentiate it from other schools in the Texas State University System , which were, at the time, expected to change their names to Texas State University (e.g.

Texas State University–Lamar ).  Those changes did not occur, however, and after Texas State continued to expand its campus in Round Rock, the university requested that the name of the city be removed from the school's name. In 2013, under the McDaniel-Sibley ASG Administration, Associated Student Government senator Quentin De La Garza continued the efforts to have the name changed. A bill to accomplish that change was passed by the Eighty-third Texas Legislature [ 27 ] and signed by the governor.

[ 28 ] The name was officially changed on September 1, 2013, for the sixth time in the school's history.

[ 29 ] 2019 sexual assault controversies [ edit ] In the fall of 2019, the US Department of Education opened a formal review into Texas State University's compliance with a federal crime-reporting statute meant to provide information about campus safety. Texas State University officials acknowledged in September 2019 that it seriously under-reported the number of rapes and other crimes on campus in recent years.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] A former university police chief and his top deputy were also accused of hiring unqualified officers to patrol the San Marcos campus, including one who allegedly slept with a sexual assault victim while investigating her case.

[ 33 ] Campus [ edit ] Texas State University comprises over 8 million gross square feet in facilities and its campuses are located on over 500 acres with an additional 4,000 acres of agriculture, research, and recreational areas.
The Texas State University main campus is located in San Marcos, Texas , midway between Austin and San Antonio along Interstate 35 . It spans 517 acres (2.09 km 2 ), [ 34 ] including the original land donated by the city of San Marcos consisting of Chautauqua Hill on which Old Main still sits. The university also operates a 101 acres (0.41 km 2 ) Round Rock Campus and a 70 acres (0.28 km 2 ) Science, Technology, and Advanced Research (STAR) Park; other parts of the Texas State property including farm and ranch land, residential, recreational areas and commercial incubators cover more than 4,522 acres (18.30 km 2 ) of additional land.

[ 34 ] Aerial view of TXST campus in 2009 The Quad is the heart of campus because it is surrounded by a majority of the academic buildings and is near the bus loop where most of the university bus routes stop on campus.  Since many students pass through the quad, it is the primary gathering place for student organizations, which often set up booths and tables promoting fundraisers and events.

[ 35 ] The west end of the Quad has a 17-foot high aluminum sculpture of two horses, called The Fighting Stallions .

[ 36 ] This area was designated as the university's free speech zone and was subject to one of the first court challenges to the creation of such zones after the suspension of ten students protesting the Vietnam War .

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] The east end of the Quad rises to the top of the highest hill on campus where the university's oldest building, Old Main, sits.

The main campus in San Marcos served as the location of the fictional school TMU (Texas Methodist University) in the NBC TV series Friday Night Lights .

[ 39 ] Old Main [ edit ] Old Main Main article: Old Main (Texas State University) Built in 1903 and originally called the Main Building, Old Main was the first building on the campus. The design was closely patterned on the Old Main Building of 1889 at Sam Houston State University, designed by Alfred Muller of Galveston. Fourteen years later, E. Northcraft, the engineer for the building at Sam Houston, oversaw construction of the Texas State University Main Building, a Victorian Gothic structure.

[ 40 ] It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

[ 41 ] In more than a century of use, and through many renovations, the building has served varied purposes, from being the university's administration building to an auditorium and chapel to now housing the offices for the School of Journalism and Mass Communication as well as the offices of the College of Fine Arts and Communication.

[ 42 ] Alkek Library [ edit ] Main article: Alkek Library Alkek Library The university's library was named in 1991 for an alumnus, Albert B. Alkek, who became an oilman, rancher, and philanthropist. The Albert B. Alkek Library serves as the main academic library supporting the university community. It is a "select depository" for United States and Texas government documents, receiving a large number of government publications from the state and 60% of all federal publications. The library also encompasses special collections and papers, including the Wittliff collections , which is the largest US repository of contemporary Mexican photography, as well as home of the King of the Hill archives and major collections of works by Cormac McCarthy , Sam Shepard , and Sandra Cisneros , and the Lonesome Dove miniseries collection.

It was opened in 1917 by Southwest Texas State Normal School, and was called Riverside Park.  The land was owned by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries and leased to the school.  It was originally used by students to learn how to swim and for general recreation.

[ 44 ] The river banks were built up from the river bottom by university workers.  In 1949 the park was renamed Sewell Park in honor of S. M. Sewell, a mathematics professor who helped form the park.

[ 45 ] A long time fixture of Sewell Park, local legend Dan Barry, better known as "Frisbee Dan", can be seen on just about any sunny day tossing his frisbee and keeping a watchful eye on the park.

Texas State teams and athletes from multiple sports have won national and regional championships as well as medalists in the Olympic Games .

[ 120 ] Mascot and logo [ edit ] In 1920, Texas State adopted its first official mascot, the bobcat, at the urging of Oscar Strahan, who became the school's athletic director in 1919. Strahan suggested the bobcat because the cat is native to central Texas and is known for its ferocity. The bobcat did not get a name until 1964. At that time, Beth Greenlees won the Name the Bobcat contest with the name Boko the Bobcat.

[ 121 ] The athletic logo, or spirit mark, is referred to as the SuperCat logo.

[ 124 ] [ 125 ] Rivalries [ edit ] A thirteen-year rivalry with Nicholls State University ended with the 2011 football season. It began in 1998 when the annual football game between the two schools was at first cancelled due to severe flooding in San Marcos , where the game was to be played. The athletic directors and coaches later decided to postpone the game from October to November. To remember those affected by the floods, including some people who had died in it, a wooden oar was made with each school's colors and initials. The winning school would take possession of the oar for the next year and have the score inscribed on it. This rivalry became known as the Battle for the Paddle . The oar was last traded in 2010 when Nicholls State received it following 47–44 win over Texas State after four overtimes. Prior to the schools' meeting in 2011, Rob Bernardi, the athletic director for Nicholls State, said that they would not be bringing the oar to San Marcos and would leave it on display in the Nicholls State athletic offices. Due to Texas State changing conferences, Bernardi said it was unlikely that the schools will face each other in football again and that the rivalry was ending.

[ 126 ] [ 127 ] [ 128 ] The rivalry with the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is dubbed the I-35 Showdown for the interstate highway that links San Marcos and San Antonio. A trophy consisting of an Interstate Highway 35 sign was originally given to the winner of the men's basketball game, but that tradition has been expanded to all sporting events between the two schools.

[ 129 ] [ 130 ] Texas State's only in-state Sun Belt conference rival was the University of Texas at Arlington (UT Arlington) . The rivalry never ceased as both schools moved from the Southland Conference to the Western Athletic Conference then on to the Sun Belt Conference until 2022 when the Sun Belt stopped sponsoring non-football teams and UT Arlington returned to the Western Athletic Conference.

[ 131 ] Fields West Side Complex at Bobcat Stadium completed in 2009 Transition to FBS [ edit ] In the summer of 2007, university president Denise Trauth created the Athletic Strategic Planning Committee with the purpose of evaluating a move for the football team to go to the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). The committee released its final report in November 2007 which included a series of tasks that would need to be completed to make the move.  The university called its efforts The Drive to FBS.

[ 132 ] Following the release of the committee's report, the university's Associated Student Government passed a bill for a student referendum to be held the following spring to obtain the student body's endorsement of an increase in fees to help pay for the move to the FBS.

[ 133 ] In February 2008, almost 80% of the students who voted in the referendum, approved a raise in the athletics fee by $10 over the next five years.

[ 134 ] Another set of milestones for the Drive involved improvements to Texas State's football stadium, Bobcat Stadium . Three phases of construction were completed to double the seating capacity of the stadium to 30,000, add luxury boxes, improvements to the press box, and replace the visitors' locker room.
