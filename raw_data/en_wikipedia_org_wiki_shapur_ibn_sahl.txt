Among other medical works, he wrote one of the first medical books on antidotes called Aqrabadhin ( القراباذين ), which was divided into 22 volumes, and which was possibly the earliest of its kind to influence Islamic medicine . This antidotary enjoyed much popularity until it was superseded Ibn al-Tilmidh 's version later in the first half of twelfth century.
