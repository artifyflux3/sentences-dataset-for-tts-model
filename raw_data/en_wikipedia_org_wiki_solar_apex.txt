The solar apex , or the apex of the Sun's way , refers to the direction that the Sun travels with respect to the local standard of rest . This is not to be confused with the Sun's apparent motion through all constellations of the zodiac , which is an illusion caused by the Earth's orbit .

Direction [ edit ] The solar apex is in the constellation of Hercules near the star Vega .

[ 1 ] For more than 30 years before 1986 the speed of the Sun towards the solar apex was taken to be about 20 km/s [ 2 ] but all later studies give a smaller component in the vector toward galactic longitude 90°, reducing overall speed to about 13.4 km/s.

[ 3 ] This speed is not to be confused with the orbital speed of the Sun around the Galactic Center , which is about 220 km/s and is included in the movement of the Local standard of rest . Thus the Sun moves towards the apex (a relatively local point) at about 1 ⁄ 13 our spiral arm's orbital speed. The Sun's motion in the Milky Way is not confined to the galactic plane; it also shifts ("bobs") up and down with respect to the plane over millions of years.

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] The nature and extent of the solar motion was first demonstrated by William Herschel in 1783, who also first determined the direction for the solar apex, as Lambda Herculis , 10° away from today's accepted position.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Herschel was not an observer–he relied on star motions reported in existing catalogs by Nevil Maskelyne and Jérôme Lalande - and he was not an especially skilled mathematician but his result was close to modern values.

[ 7 ] Many calculations of the solar apex have been published as new catalogues of stars were published.

[ 8 ] The catalog from the Hipparcos astrometric satellite and measurements with objective prisms lead to a new set of values.

[ 9 ] These two results do not agree. The calculation of the local standard of rest itself is subject to issues due to inhomogeneous stellar velocities [ 10 ] and high sensitivity to parameters.

[ 11 ] Solar antapex [ edit ] The solar antapex , the direction opposite of the solar apex, is located near the star Zeta Canis Majoris .
