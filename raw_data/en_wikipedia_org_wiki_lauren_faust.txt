2004) ​ Children 1 Awards 2009 Primetime Emmy Award Signature Lauren J. Faust (born July 25, 1974) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] is an American animator, writer, director, and producer.  She is known for developing the animated series My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic and DC Super Hero Girls . Faust has collaborated with her husband Craig McCracken on his four animated series The Powerpuff Girls , Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends , Wander Over Yonder , and Kid Cosmic .

Career [ edit ] Faust attended the California Institute of Arts from 1992 to 1994. She started working in the animation industry as a character layouts artist for the character Julie from the MTV animated television series The Maxx , before becoming an animator at Turner Feature Animation and Warner Bros Feature Animation, where she worked as an animator on feature films such as Cats Don't Dance , Quest for Camelot , and The Iron Giant .

Faust shifted to television animation in 1999, working on The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends [ 4 ] at Cartoon Network Studios as a storyboard artist, screenwriter, supervising producer, story supervisor.

[ 5 ] Faust created and developed the toy line Milky Way and the Galaxy Girls .

Faust worked with Hasbro to develop the company's My Little Pony property, resulting in the series My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic .

[ 3 ] The series proved to be a major success not only with the primary young audience, but also significantly among adults and teenagers, who became popularly known as " bronies ".

[ 6 ] She developed Super Best Friends Forever for Warner Brothers , and Medusa for Sony Pictures Animation , [ 7 ] though Sony changed the creative direction of Medusa , with Faust leaving the project.

[ 8 ] She worked with her husband Craig McCracken on Wander Over Yonder for Disney and Kid Cosmic for Netflix.

Faust worked with Warner Bros. in 2019 to develop a reboot of DC Super Hero Girls . As of 2021, she was developing an animated series for Netflix Animation , called Toil & Trouble . However, the series was cancelled by August of that year due to a change in leadership. Faust mentioned in April 2022 that she managed to retain the rights to the show, and was hoping some other network would pick it up eventually.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In 2011, Faust offered to design new characters for the fangame My Little Pony: Fighting is Magic after a cease and desist from Hasbro. The new characters became the basis for Them's Fightin' Herds , which was successfully funded on Indiegogo and was released to Early Access on Steam in 2018.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] The game left Early Access in 2020, when the first chapter of story mode was released. In November 2023, it was announced that after the completion and release of in-development DLC playable fighters, active development of the game would cease, including the rest of the story mode, of which the entire plot outline had already been written.

[ 16 ] Faust herself expressed disappointment at this news, wondering if perhaps a "show or a comic" could be made out of the existing story that had already been written.

[ 17 ] Awards [ edit ] In 2004, Faust was nominated for an Emmy Award . In 2005, she was nominated for an Annie Award .

[ 5 ] In 2009, she shared a Primetime Emmy for the Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends special, " Destination: Imagination ".

Personal life [ edit ] Craig McCracken and Lauren Faust in 2003 Faust is married to Craig McCracken , creator of The Powerpuff Girls , Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends , and Wander Over Yonder .

[ 3 ] They met while they were working on the third season of The Powerpuff Girls .

[ 18 ] Faust has worked with her husband on all of his shows. She considers herself a lifelong feminist.

[ 19 ] Faust took maternity leave in mid-2016 to take care of her newborn daughter.
