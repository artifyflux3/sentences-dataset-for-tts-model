For other uses, see Vertex (disambiguation) .

An ellipse (red) and its evolute (blue). The dots are the vertices of the curve, each corresponding to a cusp on the evolute.

In the geometry of plane curves , a vertex is a point of where the first derivative of curvature is zero.

[ 1 ] This is typically a local maximum or minimum of curvature, [ 2 ] and some authors define a vertex to be more specifically a local extremum of curvature.

[ 3 ] However, other special cases may occur, for instance when the second derivative is also zero, or when the curvature is constant. For space curves , on the other hand, a vertex is a point where the torsion vanishes.

Examples [ edit ] A hyperbola has two vertices, one on each branch; they are the closest of any two points lying on opposite branches of the hyperbola, and they lie on the principal axis. On a parabola, the sole vertex lies on the axis of symmetry and in a quadratic of the form: a x 2 + b x + c {\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c\,\!} it can be found by completing the square or by differentiation .

[ 2 ] On an ellipse , two of the four vertices lie on the major axis and two lie on the minor axis.

[ 4 ] For a circle , which has constant curvature, every point is a vertex.

Cusps and osculation [ edit ] Vertices are points where the curve has 4-point contact with the osculating circle at that point.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] In contrast, generic points on a curve typically only have 3-point contact with their osculating circle. The evolute of a curve will generically have a cusp when the curve has a vertex; [ 6 ] other, more degenerate and non-stable singularities may occur at higher-order vertices, at which the osculating circle has contact of higher order than four.

[ 5 ] Although a single generic curve will not have any higher-order vertices, they will generically occur within a one-parameter family of curves, at the curve in the family for which two ordinary vertices coalesce to form a higher vertex and then annihilate.

The symmetry set of a curve has endpoints at the cusps corresponding to the vertices, and the medial axis , a subset of the symmetry set , also has its endpoints in the cusps.

Other properties [ edit ] According to the classical four-vertex theorem , every simple closed planar smooth curve must have at least four vertices.

[ 7 ] A more general fact is that every simple closed space curve which lies on the boundary of a convex body, or even bounds a locally convex disk, must have four vertices.

[ 8 ] Every curve of constant width must have at least six vertices.

[ 9 ] If a planar curve is bilaterally symmetric , it will have a vertex at the point or points where the axis of symmetry crosses the curve. Thus, the notion of a vertex for a curve is closely related to that of an optical vertex , the point where an optical axis crosses a lens surface.
