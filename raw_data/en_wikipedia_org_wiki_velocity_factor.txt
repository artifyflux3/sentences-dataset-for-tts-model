For optical signals, the velocity factor is the reciprocal of the refractive index .

The speed of radio signals in vacuum , for example, is the speed of light , and so the velocity factor of a radio wave in vacuum is 1.0 (unity). In air, the velocity factor is ~0.9997 . In electrical cables, the velocity factor mainly depends on the insulating material (see table below).

The use of the terms velocity of propagation and wave propagation speed to mean a ratio of speeds is confined to the computer networking and cable industries. In a general science and engineering context, these terms would be understood to mean a true speed or velocity in units of distance per time, [ 3 ] while velocity factor is used for the ratio.

Typical velocity factors [ edit ] Velocity factor is an important characteristic of communication media such as category 5 cables and radio transmission lines .

Plenum data cable typically has a VF between 0.42 and 0.72 (42% to 72% of the speed of light in vacuum) and riser cable around 0.70 (approximately 210,000,000 m/s or 4.76 ns per metre).

In the most general case: V F = 1 μ μ r ϵ ϵ r {\displaystyle \mathrm {VF} ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {\mu _{\mathrm {r} }\epsilon _{\mathrm {r} }}}}\ } which includes unusual magnetic conducting materials, such as ferrite .

The velocity factor for a lossless transmission line is given by: V F = 1 c 0 L ′ C ′ {\displaystyle \mathrm {VF} ={\frac {1}{c_{\mathrm {0} }{\sqrt {L'C'}}}}\ } where L ′ {\displaystyle L'} is the distributed inductance (in henries per unit length), C ′ {\displaystyle C'} is the capacitance between the two conductors (in farads per unit length), and c 0 {\displaystyle c_{\mathrm {0} }} is the speed of light in vacuum.

Optical wave [ edit ] VF equals the reciprocal of the refractive index n {\displaystyle {n}} of the medium, usually optical fiber .

V F = 1 n {\displaystyle \mathrm {VF} ={\frac {1}{n}}\ } See also [ edit ] Coaxial cable Propagation delay Signal velocity Speed of electricity Speed of sound Telegrapher's equations References [ edit ] ^ Gottlieb, I.M., Practical RF power design techniques , TAB Books, 1993, ISBN 0-8306-4129-7 , p.251 ('velocity factor') ^ Velocity of Propagation , General Cable Australia Pty Ltd, retrieved 2010-02-13 ^ "velocity of propagation" in Walker, P.M.B., Chambers Science and Technology Dictionary, Edinburgh, 1991, ISBN 1-85296-150-3 ^ IEEE 802.3 Clause 8.4.1.3 The minimum required velocity of propagation is 0.77 c.
