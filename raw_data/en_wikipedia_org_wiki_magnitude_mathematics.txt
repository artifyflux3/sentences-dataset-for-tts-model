In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the **magnitude** or **size** of a [mathematical object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") is a property which determines whether the object is larger or smaller than other objects of the same kind. More formally, an object's magnitude is the displayed result of an [ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory "Order theory") (or ranking) of the [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(mathematics) "Class (mathematics)") of objects to which it belongs. Magnitude as a concept dates to [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") and has been applied as a [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics) "Measure (mathematics)") of distance from one object to another. For numbers, the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value") of a number is commonly applied as the measure of units between a number and zero.

In vector spaces, the [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm "Euclidean norm") is a measure of magnitude used to define a distance between two points in space. In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), magnitude can be defined as quantity or distance. An [order of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude "Order of magnitude") is typically defined as a unit of distance between one number and another's numerical places on the decimal scale.

[Ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greeks "Ancient Greeks") distinguished between several types of magnitude,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#cite_note-1) including:

*   Positive [fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction "Fraction")
*   [Line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") (ordered by [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length"))
*   [Plane figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_shape "Geometric shape") (ordered by [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area"))
*   [Solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_geometry "Solid geometry") (ordered by [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume"))
*   [Angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") (ordered by angular magnitude)

They proved that the first two could not be the same, or even [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic "Isomorphic") systems of magnitude.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#cite_note-2) They did not consider [negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number "Negative number") magnitudes to be meaningful, and _magnitude_ is still primarily used in contexts in which [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero "Zero") is either the smallest size or less than all possible sizes.

The magnitude of any [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number")![Image 1: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) is usually called its _[absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute\_value "Absolute value")_ or _modulus_, denoted by ![Image 2: {\displaystyle |x|}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4eb41e5fd5dc37eaa1718dfbf4bc082edb991936).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#cite_note-3)

The absolute value of a [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")_r_ is defined by:[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#cite_note-4)

![Image 3: {\displaystyle \left|r\right|=r,{\text{ if }}r{\text{ ≥ }}0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70cfa5c9015f1ff5b2556b5ee864c58e06c20018)![Image 4: {\displaystyle \left|r\right|=-r,{\text{ if }}r<0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8fa3177fcf6cc4120932bf5bee736f1ffeb5c10d)
Absolute value may also be thought of as the number's [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance") from zero on the real [number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line "Number line"). For example, the absolute value of both 70 and −70 is 70.

A [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")_z_ may be viewed as the position of a point _P_ in a [2-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), called the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane"). The absolute value (or _[modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulus\_of\_complex\_number "Modulus of complex number")_) of _z_ may be thought of as the distance of _P_ from the origin of that space. The formula for the absolute value of _z_ = _a_ + _bi_ is similar to that for the [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm "Euclidean norm") of a vector in a 2-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"):[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#cite_note-5)

![Image 5: {\displaystyle \left|z\right|={\sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9da4596776ffd646aaacbe2fdbc577405bc122c9)
where the real numbers _a_ and _b_ are the [real part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_part "Real part") and the [imaginary part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_part "Imaginary part") of _z_, respectively. For instance, the modulus of −3 + 4 _i_ is ![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {(-3)^{2}+4^{2}}}=5}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3fcbefccdc5808a1c4487e1d9dd5830f01e9e15e). Alternatively, the magnitude of a complex number _z_ may be defined as the square root of the product of itself and its [complex conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate "Complex conjugate"), ![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\bar {z}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52dd0599595d539f7d757ec21da6c6e6ac3ad427), where for any complex number ![Image 8: {\displaystyle z=a+bi}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eef52538a0077e8dff45f937a232364d68ca6124), its complex conjugate is ![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\bar {z}}=a-bi}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d46e4a859fca2ebcf485368fa0dac7762d4bb944).

![Image 10: {\displaystyle \left|z\right|={\sqrt {z{\bar {z}}}}={\sqrt {(a+bi)(a-bi)}}={\sqrt {a^{2}-abi+abi-b^{2}i^{2}}}={\sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e93550e193cede677d9ea1d5f9d24203fc12cdfb)
(where ![Image 11: {\displaystyle i^{2}=-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/88e98a401d352e5037d5043028e2d7f449e83fa6)).

### Euclidean vector space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnitude_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Euclidean vector space")]

A [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") represents the position of a point _P_ in a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"). Geometrically, it can be described as an arrow from the origin of the space (vector tail) to that point (vector tip). Mathematically, a vector **x** in an _n_-dimensional Euclidean space can be defined as an ordered list of _n_ real numbers (the [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate "Cartesian coordinate") of _P_): _x_ = [_x_ 1, _x_ 2, ..., _x_ _n_]. Its **magnitude** or **length**, denoted by ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \|x\|}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/be45ae82237598ea927f321e2e1e04e36633b93b),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#cite_note-6) is most commonly defined as its [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm "Norm (mathematics)") (or Euclidean length):[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#cite_note-AntonRorres2010-7)

![Image 13: {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {x} \|={\sqrt {x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\cdots +x_{n}^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c4a0eca6a1dc02341bafa36943bf6573dffb2113)
For instance, in a 3-dimensional space, the magnitude of [3,4, 12] is 13 because ![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {3^{2}+4^{2}+12^{2}}}={\sqrt {169}}=13.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b4fe17997f7a9c01ebcdcdfdfd0aa9a921cc469) This is equivalent to the [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") of the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") of the vector with itself:

![Image 15: {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {x} \|={\sqrt {\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {x} }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33b6f309408f68cbbaca25b2340dc8524a049473)
The Euclidean norm of a vector is just a special case of [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance"): the distance between its tail and its tip. Two similar notations are used for the Euclidean norm of a vector _x_:

1.   ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {x} \right\|,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5b802f24458c84db35c87b34053c6beac6120bf0)
2.   ![Image 17: {\displaystyle \left|\mathbf {x} \right|.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/589d7624119eebf1b75d8079e32831b14ce16416)

A disadvantage of the second notation is that it can also be used to denote the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value") of [scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)") and the [determinants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") of [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"), which introduces an element of ambiguity.

### Normed vector spaces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnitude_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Normed vector spaces")]

By definition, all Euclidean vectors have a magnitude (see above). However, a vector in an abstract [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") does not possess a magnitude.

A [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") endowed with a [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) "Norm (mathematics)"), such as the Euclidean space, is called a [normed vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space "Normed vector space").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#cite_note-8) The norm of a vector _v_ in a normed vector space can be considered to be the magnitude of _v_.

### Pseudo-Euclidean space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnitude_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Pseudo-Euclidean space")]

In a [pseudo-Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Euclidean_space "Pseudo-Euclidean space"), the magnitude of a vector is the value of the [quadratic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form "Quadratic form") for that vector.

Logarithmic magnitudes
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnitude_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Logarithmic magnitudes")]

When comparing magnitudes, a [logarithmic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale "Logarithmic scale") is often used. Examples include the [loudness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness "Loudness") of a [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound "Sound") (measured in [decibels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel "Decibel")), the [brightness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightness "Brightness") of a [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), and the [Richter scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale "Richter magnitude scale") of earthquake intensity. Logarithmic magnitudes can be negative. In the [natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sciences "Natural sciences"), a logarithmic magnitude is typically referred to as a _[level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level\_(logarithmic\_quantity) "Level (logarithmic quantity)")_.

Orders of magnitude denote differences in numeric quantities, usually measurements, by a factor of 10—that is, a difference of one digit in the location of the decimal point.

Other mathematical measures
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnitude_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Other mathematical measures")]

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Measure_illustration_%28Vector%29.svg/250px-Measure_illustration_%28Vector%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Measure_illustration_(Vector).svg)

Informally, a measure has the property of being [monotone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_function "Monotone function") in the sense that if ![Image 19: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) is a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of ![Image 20: {\displaystyle B,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/075d661417b8ca5a991a2a7bd4991cc1ab856d9d) the measure of ![Image 21: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) is less than or equal to the measure of ![Image 22: {\displaystyle B.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0eccf5bca7cdc1fa4439af2d31831db6bde00473) Furthermore, the measure of the [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set "Empty set") is required to be 0. A simple example is a volume (how big an object occupies a space) as a measure.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the concept of a [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics) "Measure (mathematics)") is a generalization and formalization of [geometrical measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_measures "Geometrical measures") ([length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length"), [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area"), [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume")) and other common notions, such as magnitude, [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"), and [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") of events. These seemingly distinct concepts have many similarities and can often be treated together in a single mathematical context. Measures are foundational in [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), [integration theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral"), and can be generalized to assume [negative values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_measure "Signed measure"), as with [electrical charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_charge "Electrical charge"). Far-reaching generalizations (such as [spectral measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_measure "Spectral measure") and [projection-valued measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection-valued_measure "Projection-valued measure")) of measure are widely used in [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics") and physics in general.

The intuition behind this concept dates back to [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"), when [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") tried to calculate the [area of a circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle "Area of a circle").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#cite_note-10) But it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that measure theory became a branch of mathematics. The foundations of modern measure theory were laid in the works of [Émile Borel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Borel "Émile Borel"), [Henri Lebesgue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue "Henri Lebesgue"), [Nikolai Luzin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Luzin "Nikolai Luzin"), [Johann Radon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Radon "Johann Radon"), [Constantin Carathéodory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantin_Carath%C3%A9odory "Constantin Carathéodory"), and [Maurice Fréchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Fr%C3%A9chet "Maurice Fréchet"), among others.
