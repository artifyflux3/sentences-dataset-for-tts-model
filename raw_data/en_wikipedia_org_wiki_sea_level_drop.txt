[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Background [ edit ] In Höfn , Iceland, the sea level is dropping relative to the land at a rate of about 1.7 cm (0.7 in) per year, and nearby it is dropping 3.8 cm (1.5 in) per year.

[ 3 ] The effect in Iceland is mainly caused by the Vatnajökull glacier. If the land rises enough, the Hornafjörður fjord would become impassable from ships, which would significantly hurt the town.

[ 4 ] Other countries experience this effect as well; in a portion of Alaska and Canada, the relative sea level is falling by up to 2.0 cm (0.8 in) a year. In Norway, Sweden and Finland, an effect called Fennoscandian land elevation causes the relative sea level to fall by up to 0.7 cm (0.3 in) a year.
