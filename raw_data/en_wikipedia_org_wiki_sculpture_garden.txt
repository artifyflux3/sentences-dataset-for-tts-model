A sculpture garden or sculpture park is an outdoor garden or park which includes the presentation of sculpture , usually several permanently sited works in durable materials in landscaped surroundings.

[ 1 ] A sculpture garden may be private, owned by a museum and accessible freely or for a fee, or public and accessible to all. Some cities own large numbers of public sculptures , some of which they may present together in city parks .

Exhibits range from individual, traditional sculptures to large site-specific installations . Sculpture gardens may also vary greatly in size and scope, either featuring the collected works of multiple artists, or the artwork of a single individual.  These installations are related to several similar concepts, most notably land art , where landscapes become the basis of a site-specific sculpture , and topiary gardens, which consists of clipping or training live plants into living sculptures.  A sculpture trail layout may be adopted, either in a park or through open countryside.  The Irwell Sculpture Trail , the largest public art scheme in England, includes 28 art pieces along a 30-mile (48 km) footpath stretching from Salford Quays through Bury into Rossendale and up to the Pennines above Bacup .

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] Sculpture gardens have a long history around the world – the oldest known collection of human constructions is a Neanderthal "sculpture garden" unearthed in Bruniquel Cave in France in 1990.

[ 3 ] Within the cave, broken stalagmites were arranged in a series of stacked or ring-like structures approximately 175,000 years ago.

Garden statues , often of very high quality, were a feature of ancient Roman gardens , revived at the Renaissance , and then especially a feature of the Baroque garden .  Palace gardens, such as the Gardens of Versailles , featured a concentration of sculpture equalling that of larger modern sculpture parks.

In the United States, the oldest public sculpture garden is a part of the joint park and wildlife preserve Brookgreen Gardens , [ 4 ] located in South Carolina. The property was opened in 1932, and has since been included on the National Register of Historic Places .
