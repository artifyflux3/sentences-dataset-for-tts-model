[ 4 ] It is the third-largest city in Lithuania , the fifth-largest city in the Baltic States , and the capital of Klaipėda County , as well as the only major seaport in the country – the Port of Klaipėda , which is also the busiest port in the Baltic States.

The city has a complex recorded history, partially due to the combined regional importance of the usually ice-free port at the mouth of the river Akmena-Danė [ lt ] .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] It was located in Lithuania Minor , and the State of the Teutonic Order and Duchy of Prussia under the suzerainty of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth , then the Kingdom of Prussia and German Empire , within which it was the northernmost big city until it was placed under French occupation in 1919. From 1923, the city was part of Lithuania until its annexation by Nazi Germany in 1939, and after World War II it was part of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic . Klaipėda has remained within Lithuania since 1944.

The urban zone of Klaipėda expanded well into the suburbs, which sprang up around the city and surrounded it from three sides. These are partly integrated with the city (city bus lines, city water supply, etc.), and the majority of inhabitants of these suburbs work in Klaipėda. According to data from the Department of Statistics, there are 212,302 permanent inhabitants (as of 2020) in the Klaipėda city and Klaipėda district municipalities combined.

[ 6 ] As of 2025 the population of Klaipėda city is 160 885 people.

[ 7 ] Popular seaside resorts found close to Klaipėda are Neringa to the south on the Curonian Spit and Palanga to the north.

[ 8 ] The city is also known for the annual Klaipėda Sea Festival and a nearby Lithuanian Sea Museum [ lt ] .

Names [ edit ] Memel city seal, 1446 (diameter 200 mm (7.9 in)). From the Archive of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, Berlin .

The Teutonic Knights built a castle in the *Pilsāts Land of the Curonians and named it Memelburg , which would later be shortened to Memel . From 1252 to 1923 and from 1939 to 1945, the town and city were officially named Memel . Between 1923 and 1939, both names were in official use [ clarification needed ] . Since 1945, the Lithuanian name of Klaipėda has been used.

[ citation needed ] The names Memelburg and Memel are found in most written sources from the 13th century onwards, while Klaipėda is found in Lithuanian sources since the 15th century. The city was initially mentioned as Caloypede in the letter of Vytautas in 1413, [ 9 ] and in negotiation documents from 1420, the city was named Klawppeda.

[ 10 ] In the Treaty of Melno of 1422, the city's name was listed as Cleupeda . According to Samogitian folk etymology , the name Klaipėda refers to the boggy terrain of the town ( klaidyti =obstruct and pėda =foot). Most likely, the name is of Curonian origin and means "even ground"; it likely originates from a combination of "klais/klait" (flat, open, free) and "peda" (sole of the foot, ground), as a reference to relatively flat terrain of the original settlement's surroundings.

[ citation needed ] The lower reaches of the river Neman were named either * Mēmele or * Mēmela by Scalovians and local Curonian inhabitants. In the Latvian Curonian language, it means mute, silent ( memelis, mimelis, mēms ), as a reference to peaceful flow of the Neman. This name was adopted by German speakers, and also was chosen for the new city founded further away at the lagoon.

[ citation needed ] The name of the city in the Samogitian language is spelled slightly differently: Klaipieda . The most notable non-Lithuanian names include: Latvian : Klaipēda ; Polish : Kłajpeda ; Russian: Клайпеда ; German: Memel .

Coat of arms [ edit ] Main article: Coat of arms of Klaipėda The coat of arms of Klaipėda is also used as the coat of arms of the Klaipėda city municipality . The modern version was created by the designer Kęstutis Mickevičius . The modern coat of arms was created by restoring old seals of the Memel city (analogous with those used in the years 1446, 1605 and 1618). It was affirmed on 1 July 1992.

[ 11 ] History [ edit ] A settlement of Baltic tribes in the territory of the present-day city is said to have existed in the region as early as the 7th century. Klaipėda is the oldest city which is in modern Lithuanian territory. The Balts initially established Klaipėda as a trading centre for the storage of goods and annual fairs with the Germans.

[ 12 ] Teutonic Knights [ edit ] In the 1240s, Pope Gregory IX offered King Håkon IV of Norway the opportunity to conquer the peninsula of Sambia .

[ citation needed ] However, after Grand Duke Mindaugas of Lithuania , the Teutonic Knights and a group of crusaders from Lübeck moved into Sambia and accepted Christianity.

[ citation needed ] These groups founded a fort in 1252 called Memele castrum (or Memelburg , " Memel Castle "). The fort's construction was completed in 1253, and Memel was garrisoned with troops of the Teutonic Order , administered by Deutschmeister Eberhard von Seyne . Documents for its founding were signed by Eberhard and Bishop Heinrich von Lützelburg of Courland on 29 July 1252 and 1 August 1252.

[ citation needed ] Preserved historic timber framed architecture Seal of viceregent in Klaipėda, 13th century Seal of Klaipėda as of 1409 depicting bell towers of the Churches of St. John , St. Mary and St. Nicholas Master Conrad von Thierberg used the fortress as a base for further campaigns along the river Neman and against Samogitia . Memel was unsuccessfully besieged by Sambians in 1255, and the Sambians surrendered in 1259. Memel was also colonized by settlers from Holstein , Lübeck and Dortmund . Hence, Memel also being known at the time as Neu-Dortmund , or "New Dortmund". It became the main town of the Diocese of Curonia, with a cathedral and at least two parochial churches, but the development of the castle became the dominant priority. According to different sources, Memel received Lübeck city rights in 1254 [ 13 ] or 1258.

[ 14 ] Following it Klaipėda's status was quite extraordinary as only three cities in the State of the Teutonic Order had Lübeck city rights.

[ 15 ] In the spring and summer of 1323, a Lithuanian army led by Grand Duke Gediminas came up the Neman and sieged the castle of Memel, while later he marched to other Prussian, Latvian, Estonian territories controlled by the Order, eventually forcing the Order to sue for a truce in October 1323.

[ 16 ] While planning a campaign against Samogitia , Memel's garrison of the Teutonic Order's Livonian branch was replaced with knights from the Prussian branch in 1328. Threats and attacks by Lithuanians greatly slowed down the town's development; the castle was sacked by Lithuanian tribes in 1360, and in 1379 the reconstructed castle and town were both sacked once again.

[ 17 ] In 1409, the castle was rebuilt and in 1422–1441 the strengthening of the castle's fortifications continued when eventually its ramparts reached 7 meters height.

[ 17 ] After the Battle of Grunwald , the dispute between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Teutonic Order on Samogitia started.

[ 18 ] Vytautas the Great wanted the border to be the Neman River , while the Teutonic Order wanted to have Veliuona and Klaipėda in the right side of the river.

[ 18 ] Both sides agreed to accept the prospective solution of Emperor Sigismund 's representative Benedict Makrai in 1413. He decided that the right side of Nemunas ( Veliuona , Klaipėda) were to be owned by Lithuania. Makrai is known to have stated: [ 19 ] We find that the Memel Castle is built in the land of Samogitians. Neither Master , nor the Order was able to prove anything opposing.

Nevertheless, no agreement was concluded and fighting continued until the Treaty of Melno in 1422 stabilized the border between the Teutonic Order and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania for the next 501 years. However, two miles of Lithuanian territories, including Klaipėda, was left for the Order.

[ 20 ] In 1454, King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region to the Kingdom of Poland upon the request of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation .

[ 21 ] After the subsequent Thirteen Years' War (1454–1466) the city became a part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Knights, [ 22 ] and thus located within the Polish–Lithuanian union . The rebuilt town received Kulm law city rights in 1475.

[ 17 ] Duchy of Prussia [ edit ] Panorama of the city with the Klaipėda Castle and the old town in 1674 Historical illustration of Memel (1684) Against the wishes of its governor and commander, Eric of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel , Memel adopted Lutheranism after the conversion of Grand Master Albert of Prussia and the creation of the Duchy of Prussia as a fief of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in 1525, [ 23 ] soon part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth . Since then, Klaipėda has become the county centre within the Duchy of Prussia.

[ 24 ] It was the onset of a long period of prosperity for the city and port.

[ 24 ] Klaipėda served as a port for neighbouring Lithuania, benefiting from its location near the mouth of the Neman, with wheat as a profitable export.

[ 24 ] The Duchy of Prussia was inherited by a relative, John Sigismund , the Hohenzollern prince-electors of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1618.

Brandenburg-Prussia began active participation in regional policy, which affected the development of Memel. From 1629 to 1635, the town was occupied by Sweden over several periods during the Polish-Swedish War of 1626–1629 .

[ 24 ] After the Treaty of Königsberg in 1656 during the Northern Wars , Elector Frederick William opened Memel's harbor to Sweden, with whom the harbor's revenue was divided. Sovereignty of the margraves of Brandenburg over the region was affirmed in the Treaty of Oliva in 1660.

The construction of a fortified defence system around the entire town, initiated in 1627, noticeably changed its status and prospects.

[ 24 ] [ 17 ] In November 1678 a small Swedish army invaded the Prussian territory, but was unable to capture the fortress of Memel.

Kingdom of Prussia [ edit ] Spit fortress By the beginning of the 18th century, Memel was one of the strongest fortresses ( Memelfestung ) in Prussia, and the town became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. Despite its fortifications, it was captured by Russian troops during the Seven Years' War in 1757.

[ citation needed ] Consequently, from 1757 to 1762 the town, along with the rest of eastern Prussia, was dependent on the Russian Empire . After this war ended, the maintenance of the fortress was neglected, but the town's growth continued.

[ citation needed ] Memel became part of the newly formed province of East Prussia within the Kingdom of Prussia in 1773. In the second half of the 18th century, Memel's lax customs and Riga 's high duties enticed English traders, who established the first industrial sawmills in the town.

[ citation needed ] In 1784, 996 ships arrived in Memel, 500 of which were English. The specialisation in wood manufacturing guaranteed Memel's merchants income and stability for more than a hundred years. During this era, it also normalised its trade relations with Königsberg ; regional instability had degraded relations since the 16th century.

[ citation needed ] Klaipėda Town Hall was the temporary residence of the King Frederick William III of Prussia , his wife Queen Louise and their children.

[ 25 ] Memel prospered during the second half of the 18th century by exporting timber to Great Britain for use by the Royal Navy .

[ citation needed ] In 1792, 756 British ships visited the town to transport lumber from forests near Memel.

[ citation needed ] In 1800, its imports consisted chiefly of salt, iron and herrings; the exports, which greatly exceeded the imports, were corn, hemp, flax, and, particularly, timber. The 1815 Encyclopædia Britannica stated that Memel was "provided with the finest harbour in the Baltic".

[ citation needed ] During the Napoleonic Wars , Memel became the temporary capital of the Kingdom of Prussia. Between 1807 and 1808, the town was the residence of King Frederick William III , his consort Louise , his court, and the government.

[ 25 ] On 9 October 1807 the king signed a document in Memel, later called the October Edict , which abolished serfdom in Prussia.

[ 26 ] It originated the reforms of Karl Freiherr vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg . The land around Memel suffered major economic setbacks under Napoleon Bonaparte 's Continental System . During Napoleon's retreat from Moscow after the failed invasion of Russia in 1812, General Yorck refused Marshal MacDonald 's orders to fortify Memel at Prussia's expense.

[ citation needed ] During the January Uprising , in June 1863, Polish insurgents made an unsuccessful attempt at a naval landing near the city's harbor.

[ 27 ] German Empire [ edit ] Panorama of the city from the Curonian Lagoon in 1880 Central Post Office, the former residence of Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander and monarchs of Prussia [ 28 ] After the unification of Germany into the German Empire in 1871, Memel became Germany's northernmost city.

The development of the town in the 19th century was influenced by the Industrial Revolution in Prussia, as well as urbanisation.

[ 24 ] Even though the population of Memel increased fourfold during the 19th century, and had risen to 21,470 by 1910, its pace of development lagged in comparison. The reasons for this were mostly political. Memel was the northernmost and easternmost city in Germany, and although the government was engaged in a very costly tree-planting exercise to stabilise the sand-dunes on the Curonian Spit , most of the financial infusions in the province of East Prussia were concentrated in Königsberg, the capital of the province. Some notable instances of the German infrastructure investments in the area included sandbar blasting and a new ship canal between Pillau and Königsberg, which enabled vessels of up to 6.5 m draughts to moor alongside the city, at a cost of 13 million marks.

Owing to the absence of heavy industry in the 1870s and 1880s, the population of Memel stagnated, although wood manufacturing persisted as the main industry. It remained the central point of the Baltic timber-trade. A British Consul was located in the town in 1800; in 1900 a British Vice-Consul was recorded there, as well as a Lloyd's Agent.

Early 20th-century view of the city featuring the Church of St. John By 1900 steamer services had been established between Memel and Cranz (on the southern end of the Curonian Spit), and also between Memel and Tilsit . A main-line railway was built from Insterburg , the main East Prussian railway junction, to St. Petersburg via Eydtkuhnen , the Prussian frontier station. The Memel line also ran from Insterburg via Tilsit , where a further direct line connected with Königsberg, that crossed the 4-kilometre-wide ( 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 -mile) Memel Valley over three bridges before its arrival in Memel.

During the second half of the 19th century, Memel was a center for the publication of books printed in the Lithuanian language using a Latin-script alphabet – these publications were prohibited in the nearby Russian Empire of which Lithuania was a province.

[ 24 ] The books were then smuggled over the Lithuanian border.

The German 1910 census lists the Memel Territory population as 149,766, of whom 67,345 declared Lithuanian to be their first language. The Germans greatly predominated in the town and port of Memel as well as in other nearby villages; the Lithuanian population was predominant in the area's rural districts.

[ 29 ] Inter-war years and World War II [ edit ] Main article: Klaipėda Region Lithuanian Army parade in Klaipėda Theatre Square in 1923 Under the Treaty of Versailles after World War I , Klaipėda and the surrounding Klaipėda Region (Memel Territory) were detached from Germany and made a protectorate of the Entente States . The French became provisional administrators of the region until a more permanent solution could be worked out. Both Lithuania and Poland campaigned for their rights in the region. However, it seemed that the region would become a free city, similar to the Free City of Danzig . Not waiting for an unfavourable decision, the Lithuanians decided to stage the Klaipėda Revolt , take the region by force, and present the Entente with a fait accompli . The revolt was carried out in January 1923 while western Europe was distracted by the occupation of the Ruhr . The Germans tacitly supported the action, and the French offered only limited resistance.

[ 30 ] The revolt was supported by the Chief Rescue Committee of Lithuania Minor, chaired by Prussian Lithuanian Martynas Jankus , which operated since 22 December 1922 with its centre in Klaipėda.

[ 31 ] The League of Nations protested the revolt but accepted the transfer in February 1923. The formal Klaipėda Convention was signed in Paris on 8 May 1924 and secured extensive autonomy for the region.

[ 32 ] Supreme Commander of the Lithuanian Army Silvestras Žukauskas in Klaipėda, 1925 Two 1920s posters, representing the historical attachment of Klaipėda to Lithuania in 1923 The annexation of the city had significant consequences for the Lithuanian economy and foreign relations. The region subsequently accounted for up to 30% of Lithuania's entire economic production. Between 70% and 80% of foreign trade passed through Klaipėda. The region, which represented only about 5% of Lithuania's territory, contained a third of its industry.

[ 33 ] Weimar Germany , under Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann , maintained normal relations with Lithuania. However, Nazi Germany desired to reacquire the region and tensions rose. Pro-German parties won clear supermajorities in all elections to the Klaipėda Parliament , which often clashed with the Lithuanian-appointed Klaipėda Directorate . Lithuanian efforts to "re-Lithuanize" Prussian Lithuanians by promoting the Lithuanian language, culture, education were often met with resistance from the locals. In 1932, a conflict between the Parliament and the Directorate had to be resolved by the Permanent Court of International Justice . In 1934–1935, the Lithuanians attempted to combat increasing Nazi influence in the region by arresting and prosecuting over 120 Nazi activists for the alleged plot to organize an anti-Lithuanian rebellion.

[ 34 ] Despite these rather harsh sentences, the defendants in the Neumann–Sass case were soon released under pressure from Nazi Germany.

[ 35 ] The extensive autonomy guaranteed by the Klaipėda Convention prevented Lithuania from blocking the growing pro-German attitudes in the region.

Visit of Adolf Hitler following the German annexation of the city, March 1939 As tensions in pre-war Europe continued to grow, it was expected that Germany would make a move against Lithuania to reacquire the region. German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop delivered an ultimatum to the Lithuanian Foreign Minister on 20 March 1939, demanding the surrender of Klaipėda. Lithuania, unable to secure international support for its cause, submitted to the ultimatum and, in exchange for the right to use the new harbour facilities as a free port, ceded the disputed region to Germany in the late evening of 22 March 1939.

[ 24 ] Adolf Hitler visited the harbour and delivered a speech to the city residents. That was Hitler's last territorial acquisition before World War II .

[ 36 ] During the war, the Germans operated a forced labour subcamp of the Stalag I-A prisoner-of-war camp for Allied prisoners of war in the city, [ 37 ] and expelled Poles from German-occupied Poland were also enslaved as forced labour in the city's vicinity.

[ 38 ] 1945–present [ edit ] Participants' ships of the 2017 Sea Festival in Klaipėda During World War II, from the end of 1944 into 1945, the Battle of Memel took place. The nearly-empty city was captured by the Soviet Red Army on 28 January 1945 with only about 50 remaining people.

[ 24 ] After the war the Klaipėda Region was incorporated into the Lithuanian SSR , and the post-1937 German occupation of various regions of Europe, including Klaipėda, was considered illegal.

[ 23 ] The Soviets turned Klaipėda, the foremost ice-free port in the Eastern Baltic, into the largest piscatorial-marine base in the European part of the USSR.

[ 24 ] [ 5 ] Shipyards , dockyards and a fishing port were constructed.

[ 24 ] [ 5 ] Subsequently, by the end of 1959, the population of the city had doubled its pre-war population, and by 1989, there were 202,900 inhabitants.

[ 24 ] Initially, Russian-speakers dominated the city's local government, but after the death of Joseph Stalin , more people came to the city from the rest of Lithuania than from other Soviet republics and oblasts, and Lithuanians became its major ethnic group.

[ 39 ] [ 24 ] Among Lithuanian cities with a population greater than 100,000, however, Klaipėda has the highest percentage of people whose native language is Russian.

[ 40 ] Costa Pacifica in Klaipėda Until the 1970s, Klaipėda was important to the USSR only for its economy, and cultural and religious activity was minimal and restricted. The developers of a Roman Catholic church (Maria, Queen of Peace, constructed 1957–1962) were arrested. The city began to develop cultural activities in the 1970s and the 1980s, such as the introduction of the Sea Festival cultural tradition, where thousands of people come to celebrate from all over the country. Based on the Pedagogical University of Šiauliai and the National Conservatory of Lithuania in Klaipėda, the University of Klaipėda was established in 1991. Klaipėda is now the home of a bilingual German-Lithuanian institution, the Hermann-Sudermann -Schule , as well as an English-language university, LCC International University.

In 2014, Klaipėda was visited 64 times by cruise ships and surpassed the Latvian capital, Riga , for the first time.

[ 41 ] Geography [ edit ] Climate [ edit ] Klaipėda's climate is under the influence of the Baltic Sea .

Klaipėda's climate is considered to be oceanic (Köppen Cfb ) using the −3 °C (26.6 °F) isotherm and warm humid continental (Köppen Dfb) using the 0 °C (32.0 °F) isotherm.

[ 42 ] In July and August, the warmest season, high temperatures average 20 °C (68 °F), and low temperatures average 14 °C (57 °F). The highest official temperature ever recorded was 36.6 °C (97.9 °F) in August 2014. In January and February, the coldest season, high temperatures average 0 °C (32 °F) with low temperatures averaging −5 °C (23 °F).

1535 Klaipėda was established as an outpost dedicated for German crusaders .

[ 24 ] Initially, Klaipėda developed slowly. In the 13th century, it was often attacked by the Sambians and Samogitians , and in the middle of the 15th century, it was attacked by the Gdańskians (for trading reasons).

[ 24 ] Consequently, in the 13th–15th centuries, Klaipėda was burned or ruined around 20 times.

[ 24 ] In the second half of the 15th century, the residents began to settle in a territory of the Klaipėda Old Town, which was on a peninsula of the right bank of the old Danė [ lt ] .

[ 24 ] Soon, the reconstruction of the Klaipėda Castle began, and all residents moved to the peninsula.

[ 24 ] The development of Klaipėda was fueled by the increasing trade of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with the Western countries . Around 1503, there were 25 families of full-fledged townspeople, while in 1540, there were 107 families. Eventually, in 1589, there were 143 families in Klaipėda.

[ 24 ] [ 17 ] The Lithuanians and Curonians lived alongside the German colonists , but the magistrate did not allow non-Germans to join artisan corporations and did not grant them rights available to townspeople.

[ 24 ] In the State of the Teutonic Order , Old Prussians and Western Lithuanians were not allowed to engage in trade, crafts, and settle in cities. Thus, in the Duchy of Prussia , most of the cities' residents were Germans.

[ 49 ] Nevertheless, villages in Lithuania Minor were extensively inhabited by Lithuanians, [ 49 ] and Klaipėda developed as one of the most important centres of Lithuania Minor.

[ 24 ] According to the Prussian Law, all native citizens were initially called as Prussians, while only in the 16th century classification of the population by nationality began.

[ 49 ] In 1525–1818, Klaipėda was part of the Lithuanian Province (the term was used in state legal documents and Prussian monarchs decrees), which comprised the most Lithuanian territories of Lithuania Minor (the Klaipėda, Tilsit , Ragainė , Įsrūtis counties).

[ 50 ] Prussian Lithuanians in 1744 There were few German colonists in Royal Prussia when Prussian monarchs were vassals of the Polish kings (1466–1660), and they mostly moved to cities and towns.

[ 49 ] During the Second Northern War in 1656–1657, Lithuania Minor was damaged by Tatars detached from the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth .

[ 49 ] Following the Treaty of Oliva in 1660, Klaipėda become part of the Brandenburg-Prussia constituent state , which led to strengthened oppression of the locals of Lithuania Minor.

[ 49 ] In 1701 the Kingdom of Prussia was created and Prussian officials and intellectuals propagated a political direction which claimed that a new nation formed from Prussian Lithuanians ( Lietuvininkai ), Old Prussians, and German colonists.

[ 49 ] In the beginning of the 18th century 300,000 residents lived in the core of Lithuania Minor and up to 100% of peasant farms in the Klaipėda Region were Lithuanian, however cities in Lithuania Minor become centres of Germanisation , cultural assimilation , and colonization.

[ 49 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] In 1700–1721 the Prussian Lithuanians population was dramatically decreased in Klaipėda and other Lithuanian counties by the Great Northern War plague outbreak which killed 160,000 (53%) of residents in Lithuania Minor (more than 90% of the deceased were Prussian Lithuanians).

[ 49 ] [ 53 ] Following it, the Prussian authorities organized a large-scale German colonization of Lithuania Minor.

[ 49 ] [ 54 ] The colonists received various privileges, however they constituted for only 13.4% of residents and quite a few of them later departed to other countries.

[ 49 ] [ 54 ] In 1736–1818 Klaipėda was part of Lithuanian Department which had over 340,000 residents.

[ 55 ] The recovering population was ravaged by the Imperial Russian Army during the Seven Years' War in 1756–1763.

[ 49 ] In 1782 Klaipėda had 5500 residents, in 1790 – 6300.

[ 17 ] Borussia (Prussia in Latin ) Monument in Klaipėda circa 1920 In the General State Laws for the Prussian States (completed in 1794) the serfdom and privileged position of landlords and colonists was consolidated.

[ 49 ] During the Napoleonic Wars Napoleon I occupied most of the Kingdom of Prussia, thus in 1807–1808 Klaipėda was a residence of Prussian monarchs and in 1807 Frederick William III abolished serfdom. Following the abolishment of serfdom Prussian Lithuanians migrated to Klaipėda, especially its outskirts, and in 1837 they constituted 10.1% of the residents. In 1825 Klaipėda had 8,500 residents.

[ 24 ] [ 17 ] Moreover, after the Uprising of 1863–1864 part of the Lithuanian insurgents retreated to Lithuania Minor.

[ 49 ] In 1855 Vitė [ lt ] was added to the city of Klaipėda, thus the number of population increased to over 17,000 and in 1875 reached ~20,000. Before World War I , the majority of Lithuanians in Königsberg Region (which included Klaipėda) integrated into the German nation. In March 1915 the population of Klaipėda was yet again ravaged by the Imperial Russian Army.

[ 24 ] [ 17 ] Theatre Square before 1930 Following the Klaipėda Revolt in 1923, Klaipėda Region was incorporated into Lithuania and Lithuanian population in Klaipėda increased due to migration (Lithuanians constituted 30.3% and Germans 57.3% of Klaipėda's 35,845 population in 1925).

[ 24 ] [ 54 ] [ 17 ] German politicians promoted a Memellander ideology and argued that Germans and local Lithuanians were "two ethnicities ( Volkstümer ), yet one cultural community ( Kulturgemeinschaft )".

[ 56 ] Lithuania ceded Klaipėda Region to Nazi Germany due to the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania , however soon World War II started and residents of Klaipėda were evacuated to Germany.

[ 24 ] In the aftermath of World War II almost all the new residents moved to Klaipėda from Lithuania, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine , replacing the former German-speaking population (after the war only six old residents remained in the city).

[ 24 ] Over the years the Lithuanian population in the city continued to grow and constituted: 55.2% in 1959, 60.9% in 1970, 61.5% in 1979, 63.0% in 1989, 71.3% in 2001, 73.9% in 2011.

[ 24 ] As of 2025 [update] , the population of Klaipėda was 160,979.

[ 57 ] The latest data shows that there are more women in the city: females make up 52.83% (85,053), males make up 47.17% (75,926).

[ 57 ] In 2022, Lithuanians constituted 80% of the population in Klaipėda.

[ 58 ] Religion [ edit ] See also: Religion in Lithuania Façade of the Church of St. John with 75-metre tower which dominated in Klaipėda's skyline until World War II, photographed in the 19th century [ 59 ] The first church (possibly chapel) dedicated to the military garrison was built along with the Klaipėda Castle in 1252 and was consecrated after Mary, mother of Jesus , although it did not have as much effect for the townspeople, as well as the residents of surrounding villages.

[ 60 ] Initially, it was planned that Klaipėda would become centre of the Bishopric of Courland .

[ 60 ] Thus, before 1290, a St. Mary's Cathedral was built in the town and a six-members chapter settled down in 1290.

[ 60 ] Nevertheless, the cathedral also did not have much effect on the town's religious life in long-term as bishop Edmund von Werth [ de ] waived his rights to the cathedral in 1298.

[ 60 ] Eventually, the cathedral was moved to Windau .

[ 60 ] Eberhard von Sayn , the Teutonic Grand Marshal, and Heinrich von Lützelburg [ de ] , the Bishop of Courland, agreed in a treaty to build two churches: one for German colonists ( Church of St. John ), the other for baptized natives (Church of St. Nicholas).

[ 60 ] The Church of St. Nicholas was large (with 10 windows) and served residents of many neighborhoods.

[ 60 ] The church services were held in Latin and sermons were given in German, but there also were translators into the language of the local people who had a dedicated place near the pulpit .

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] Church of St. Jacob ( Lietuvininkai ) in the second half of the 19th century Following the creation of the Duchy of Prussia in 1525 and due to the Reformation movement, the Evangelical faith was spread in the languages of the local people, including Lithuanian .

[ 60 ] In 1620, the Lithuanian Parish of Klaipėda became an independent unit, but in 1627, the Church of St. Nicholas was demolished due to necessity to build a city wall around a growing city and the parish was left without its own church.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] The construction of a new church for the Lithuanian Parish began in 1686, and the new church was consecrated in the summer of 1687.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] Johann Lehmann worked in the new church, and by having a great knowledge of Lithuanian language he checked the Daniel Klein 's Grammatica Litvanica and wrote other texts in Lithuanian.

[ 60 ] Following Lehmann's death, the parish was taken over by his son, who worked there for 32 years, and then his grandson, who worked there in 1696–1722.

[ 60 ] Later priests of the parish (e.g. Abraham David Lüneburg, Johann Richter) also knew Lithuanian language and published Lithuanian texts.

[ 60 ] Evangelical Reformed Church in the 1930s The Lithuanian Church was destroyed during the Great Fire of Klaipėda in 1854.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] Consequently, the parishioners collected funds and the reconstruction project was prepared by architect Friedrich August Stüler which was completed in the winter of 1856.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] The Lithuanian Parish of Klaipėda was large (it had 15,600 parishioners in 1848 and 16,000 parishioners in 1878).

[ 60 ] In 1852, German services started being held in the Lithuanian Church, and since then, the church was called Landkirche , but was eventually renamed to Church of St. Jacob.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] Karl Rudolf Jacobi worked in the Church of St. Jacob in 1859–1881 and in 1879 was selected as Chairman of the Lithuanian Literary Society .

[ 60 ] After Jacobi's death he was replaced by Janis Pipirs who is also known for his prominent Lithuanian publications.

[ 60 ] [ 62 ] Following the Klaipėda Revolt in 1923 the priests of the Church of St. Jacob stayed loyal to Lithuania and did not demonstrate vast support for Adolf Hitler in 1939.

[ 60 ] Due to migration following the revolt, the number of Catholics in Klaipėda increased and in 1926 the deanery of Klaipėda was assigned to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Telšiai .

[ 63 ] In 1939 the Catholic deanery had 25,000 believers.

[ 63 ] In 1944 almost the entire Lutheran parish was evacuated westward to avoid Soviet repressions .

[ 60 ] Due to the forceful implementation of state atheism in the post-war period, the damaged churches of St. John, St. Jacob, Evangelical Reformed, Anglican and Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity were completely demolished.

[ 24 ] [ 61 ] [ 64 ] In 1956, there were 30,000 Catholics in Klaipėda.

[ 63 ] Following the death of Joseph Stalin , a construction of the Church of Mary, Queen of Peace, in Rumpiškės Street was started in 1961, but the Soviet administration did not allow to open it.

[ 63 ] Furthermore, with the support of the Soviet Army , the tower of the church was demolished and it was rearranged into a philharmonic, while priests who built the church were imprisoned.

[ 63 ] The church was eventually returned to the believers in 1987.

[ 63 ] Following the restoration of independent Lithuania in 1990 , Klaipėda has one of the largest parishes of the Lithuanian Evangelical Lutheran Church .

[ 65 ] Since 1991, the Catholic Church of Klaipėda Region belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Telšiai.

[ 63 ] The Days of Lutheran Culture that features various concerts, discussions, lectures and other events are held annually in Klaipėda Region since 2023.

[ 80 ] The bascule bridge had important economic impacts for the city, as every passing vessel was required to pay a bridge lifting fee.

[ 84 ] Klaipėda Old Town in 1932 In the early 20th century, Jugendstil style buildings were built in the city, including houses at Tiltų Street 13 and H. Manto Street 30, as well as a villa at Smiltynės Street 11.

[ 80 ] During World War II, 60% of the buildings in Klaipėda were destroyed.

[ 80 ] Moreover, the buildings reminiscent of Klaipėda's Germans were destroyed, and the remains of bombed-out Catholic and evangelical Reformed churches were demolished.

[ 80 ] During the Soviet occupation , the historical part of Klaipėda was redesigned.

[ 80 ] The construction of the St. Church of the Queen Mary of Peace was started in 1957 with the funding of the believers (architect J. Baltrėnas). However, in 1960, it was deprived of believers. Instead, a branch of the LSSR Philharmonic was established there in 1963. The building would later be used as a place of worship again in 1988.

[ 85 ] Other notable constructions from that period include the Palace of Culture (1963, architect A. Mikėnas, now Klaipėda Musical Theater), Marriage Palace (1980, architect R. V.

[ 86 ] During the period of Teutonic Knights there were so-called Latin schools near the city churches in Pilsotas, the northern part of the Klaipėda Region inhabited by the Curonians , however most of the schools were established in Sambia Peninsula .

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] During the period of the Duchy of Prussia schools in Lithuania Minor were created based on the regulations of the church authorities.

[ 87 ] In the 16th century a dozen Lithuanian parochial schools operated in the Duchy of Prussia.

[ 87 ] The earliest documented fact about teachers in Klaipėda dates to 1540 when a tax payer was described as "living with the teacher".

[ 89 ] Around 1590, the Lithuanian community became independent, and then in ~1620 a separate Klaipėdian Parochial School was opened in a house built on a plot belonging to a priest of the Lithuanian Church, located between the extension of John's Street and Market's Street, but the church and school were demolished in 1627.

[ 90 ] [ 89 ] In 1687, a new Lithuanian Church was built in the Friedrich's suburb and the Lithuanian Parochial School was also established next to it.

[ 90 ] At the beginning of the 19th century, the significance of the Lithuanian Parochial School in Klaipėda decreased and in 1817 the Magistrate of Klaipėda occupied the building and the school ceased its activity after operating for nearly 300 years.

[ 90 ] Ewangeliszkas Malonės Dawadas , a popular 18th century educational book in Lithuanian [ 90 ] In the first half of the 18th century King Frederick William I carried out a reform of the Prussian education system and was one of the first in Europe to try to implement universal primary education.

[ 87 ] Out of 1160 new primary schools 275 were established in Lithuanian Province which included Klaipėda.

[ 87 ] Moreover, Lutheranism provisions encouraged the use of the language of the local people in public life, including in church schools, and in the 18th century the number of primary schools in Lithuanian counties eventually risen to 449 (in 340 of them pupils were taught only in Lithuanian or in German).

[ 87 ] Nevertheless, a big obstacle for Lithuanian children to study was serfdom which was abolished in Prussia only in 1763.

[ 87 ] In the 19th century, mixed schools resulted in Germanisation of Lithuanian pupils as bilingual schools eventually became monolingual German.

[ 87 ] In the interwar period Klaipėda became part of Lithuania since 1923, however in this period out of 102 schools only four were Lithuanian and seven were mixed German–Lithuanian in the entire Klaipėda Region.

[ 91 ] Stasio Šimkaus Conservatory At the end of the 17th century, the Great School (or the Latin School) was established which was the first upper school in Klaipėda, and in ~1850 the school was granted gymnasium status, while in 1891 it was named after Queen Louise .

[ 99 ] Tertiary education [ edit ] Academic campus of Klaipėda University LCC International University Initially, Klaipėda had no university, therefore many Klaipėdians and prominent Lithuanians from Lithuania Minor and Lithuania proper studied and lectured at the University of Königsberg which was established in 1544 with a permission of Sigismund I the Old and had equal status to the University of Kraków .

[ 87 ] [ 100 ] Since 1718 the University of Königsberg had the Lithuanian language seminar which was the first independent discipline of Lithuanian language in higher education.
