Find sources: "Wick rotation" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( May 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In physics , Wick rotation , named after Italian physicist Gian Carlo Wick , is a method of finding a solution to a mathematical problem in Minkowski space from a solution to a related problem in Euclidean space by means of a transformation that substitutes an imaginary-number variable for a real-number variable.

Wick rotations are useful because of an analogy between two important but seemingly distinct fields of physics: statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics .  In this analogy, inverse temperature plays a role in statistical mechanics formally akin to imaginary time in quantum mechanics: that is, it , where t is time and i is the imaginary unit ( i 2 = –1 ).

More precisely, in statistical mechanics, the Gibbs measure exp(− H / k B T ) describes the relative probability of the system to be in any given state at temperature T , where H is a function describing the energy of each state and k B is the Boltzmann constant .  In quantum mechanics, the transformation exp(− itH / ħ ) describes time evolution, where H is an operator describing the energy (the Hamiltonian ) and ħ is the reduced Planck constant .   The former expression resembles the latter when we replace it / ħ with 1/ k B T , and this replacement is called Wick rotation.

[ 1 ] Wick rotation is called a rotation because when we represent complex numbers as a plane , the multiplication of a complex number by the imaginary unit is equivalent to counter-clockwise rotating the vector representing that number by an angle of magnitude π /2 about the origin.

[ 2 ] Instantons are Wick-rotated time solution to certain potentials that allow for the calculation of eigenenergies and decay rates.

Overview [ edit ] Wick rotation is motivated by the observation that the Minkowski metric in natural units (with metric signature (− + + +) convention) d s 2 = − − ( d t 2 ) + d x 2 + d y 2 + d z 2 {\displaystyle ds^{2}=-\left(dt^{2}\right)+dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}} and the four-dimensional Euclidean metric d s 2 = d τ τ 2 + d x 2 + d y 2 + d z 2 {\displaystyle ds^{2}=d\tau ^{2}+dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}} are equivalent if one permits the coordinate t to take on imaginary values. The Minkowski metric becomes Euclidean when t is restricted to the imaginary axis , and vice versa. Taking a problem expressed in Minkowski space with coordinates x , y , z , t , and substituting t = − iτ sometimes yields a problem in real Euclidean coordinates x , y , z , τ which is easier to solve. This solution may then, under reverse substitution, yield a solution to the original problem.

Statistical and quantum mechanics [ edit ] Wick rotation connects statistical mechanics to quantum mechanics by replacing inverse temperature with imaginary time , or more precisely replacing 1/ k B T with it / ħ , where T is temperature, k B is the Boltzmann constant , t is time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant .

For example, consider a quantum system whose Hamiltonian H has eigenvalues E j . When this system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature T , the probability of finding it in its j th energy eigenstate is proportional to exp(− E j / k B T ) . Thus, the expected value of any observable Q that commutes with the Hamiltonian is, up to a normalizing constant, ∑ ∑ j Q j e − − E j k B T , {\displaystyle \sum _{j}Q_{j}e^{-{\frac {E_{j}}{k_{\text{B}}T}}},} where j runs over all energy eigenstates and Q j is the value of Q in the j th eigenstate.

Alternatively, consider this system in a superposition of energy eigenstates , evolving for a time t under the Hamiltonian H . After time t , the relative phase change of the j th eigenstate is exp(− E j it / ħ ) .  Thus, the probability amplitude that a uniform (equally weighted) superposition of states | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ = ∑ ∑ j | j ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle =\sum _{j}|j\rangle } evolves to an arbitrary superposition | Q ⟩ ⟩ = ∑ ∑ j Q j | j ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |Q\rangle =\sum _{j}Q_{j}|j\rangle } is, up to a normalizing constant, ⟨ Q | e − − i H t ℏ ℏ | ψ ψ ⟩ = ∑ ∑ j Q j e − − E j i t ℏ ℏ ⟨ ⟨ j | j ⟩ ⟩ = ∑ ∑ j Q j e − − E j i t ℏ ℏ .

{\displaystyle \left\langle Q\left|e^{-{\frac {iHt}{\hbar }}}\right|\psi \right\rangle =\sum _{j}Q_{j}e^{-{\frac {E_{j}it}{\hbar }}}\langle j|j\rangle =\sum _{j}Q_{j}e^{-{\frac {E_{j}it}{\hbar }}}.} Note that this formula can be obtained from the formula for thermal equilibrium by replacing 1/ k B T with it / ħ .

Statics and dynamics [ edit ] Wick rotation relates statics problems in n dimensions to dynamics problems in n − 1 dimensions, trading one dimension of space for one dimension of time. A simple example where n = 2 is a hanging spring with fixed endpoints in a gravitational field. The shape of the spring is a curve y ( x ) . The spring is in equilibrium when the energy associated with this curve is at a critical point (an extremum); this critical point is typically a minimum, so this idea is usually called "the principle of least energy". To compute the energy, we integrate the energy spatial density over space: E = ∫ ∫ x [ k ( d y ( x ) d x ) 2 + V ( y ( x ) ) ] d x , {\displaystyle E=\int _{x}\left[k\left({\frac {dy(x)}{dx}}\right)^{2}+V{\big (}y(x){\big )}\right]dx,} where k is the spring constant, and V ( y ( x )) is the gravitational potential.

The corresponding dynamics problem is that of a rock thrown upwards. The path the rock follows is that which extremalizes the action ; as before, this extremum is typically a minimum, so this is called the " principle of least action ". Action is the time integral of the Lagrangian : S = ∫ ∫ t [ m ( d y ( t ) d t ) 2 − − V ( y ( t ) ) ] d t .

{\displaystyle S=\int _{t}\left[m\left({\frac {dy(t)}{dt}}\right)^{2}-V{\big (}y(t){\big )}\right]dt.} We get the solution to the dynamics problem (up to a factor of i ) from the statics problem by Wick rotation, replacing y ( x ) by y ( it ) and the spring constant k by the mass of the rock m : i S = ∫ ∫ t [ m ( d y ( i t ) d t ) 2 + V ( y ( i t ) ) ] d t = i ∫ ∫ t [ m ( d y ( i t ) d i t ) 2 − − V ( y ( i t ) ) ] d ( i t ) .

{\displaystyle iS=\int _{t}\left[m\left({\frac {dy(it)}{dt}}\right)^{2}+V{\big (}y(it){\big )}\right]dt=i\int _{t}\left[m\left({\frac {dy(it)}{dit}}\right)^{2}-V{\big (}y(it){\big )}\right]d(it).} Both thermal/quantum and static/dynamic [ edit ] Taken together, the previous two examples show how the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is related to statistical mechanics. From statistical mechanics, the shape of each spring in a collection at temperature T will deviate from the least-energy shape due to thermal fluctuations; the probability of finding a spring with a given shape decreases exponentially with the energy difference from the least-energy shape. Similarly, a quantum particle moving in a potential can be described by a superposition of paths, each with a phase exp( iS ) : the thermal variations in the shape across the collection have turned into quantum uncertainty in the path of the quantum particle.

Further details [ edit ] The Schrödinger equation and the heat equation are also related by Wick rotation.

Wick rotation also relates a quantum field theory at a finite inverse temperature β to a statistical-mechanical model over the "tube" R 3 × S 1 with the imaginary time coordinate τ being periodic with period β .  However, there is a slight difference. Statistical-mechanical n -point functions satisfy positivity, whereas Wick-rotated quantum field theories satisfy reflection positivity .

[ further explanation needed ] Note, however, that the Wick rotation cannot be viewed as a rotation on a complex vector space that is equipped with the conventional norm and metric induced by the inner product , as in this case the rotation would cancel out and have no effect.

Rigorous proof [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( January 2025 ) Dirk Schlingemann proved that a more rigorous link between Euclidean and quantum field theory can be constructed using the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms .
