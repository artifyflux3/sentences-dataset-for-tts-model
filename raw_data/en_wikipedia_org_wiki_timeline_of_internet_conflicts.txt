This is a list of known and documented Internet, Usenet , virtual community and World Wide Web related conflicts, and of conflicts that touch on both offline and online worlds with possibly wider reaching implications.

Spawned from the original ARPANET , the modern Internet, World Wide Web and other services on it, such as virtual communities ( bulletin boards , forums , and Massively multiplayer online games ) have grown exponentially. Such prolific growth of population, mirroring "offline" society, contributes to the number of conflicts and problems online growing each year.  Today, billions of people in nearly all countries use various parts of the Internet.  Inevitably, as in "brick and mortar" or offline society, the virtual equivalent of major turning points, conflicts, and disruptions—the online equivalents of the falling of the Berlin Wall , the creation of the United Nations , spread of disease , and events like the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will occur.
