[ 1 ] PyCBC contains modules for signal processing, FFT , matched filtering , gravitational waveform generation, among other tasks common in gravitational-wave data analysis.

[ 1 ] The software is developed by the gravitational-wave community alongside LIGO and Virgo scientists to analyze gravitational-wave data, search for gravitational-waves, and to measure the properties of astrophysical sources. It has been used to analyze gravitational-wave data from the LIGO and Virgo observatories to detect gravitational-waves from the mergers of neutron stars [ 2 ] and black holes [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and determine their statistical significance.

[ 7 ] PyCBC based analyses can integrate with the Open Science Grid for large scale computing resources.

[ 8 ] Software based on PyCBC has been used to rapidly analyze gravitational-wave data for astronomical follow-up.
