Examples include: A canal cut in a hard material, usually metal . This canal can be round, oval or an arc in order to receive another component such as a boss , a tongue or a gasket . It can also be on the circumference of a dowel , a bolt , an axle or on the outside or inside of a tube or pipe etc. This canal may receive a circlip , an o-ring , or a gasket.

A depression on the entire circumference of a cast or machined wheel , a pulley or sheave . This depression may receive a cable , a rope or a belt .

A longitudinal channel formed in a hot rolled rail profile such as a grooved rail . This groove is for the flange on a train wheel.

Grooves were used by ancient Roman engineers to survey land.
