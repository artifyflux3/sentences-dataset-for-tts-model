( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In geometry , Jung's theorem is an inequality between the diameter of a set of points in any Euclidean space and the radius of the minimum enclosing ball of that set. It is named after Heinrich Jung , who first studied this inequality in 1901. Algorithms also exist to solve the smallest-circle problem explicitly.

Statement [ edit ] Consider a compact set K ⊂ ⊂ R n {\displaystyle K\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and let d = max p , q ∈ ∈ K ‖ ‖ p − − q ‖ ‖ 2 {\displaystyle d=\max _{p,q\,\in \,K}\|p-q\|_{2}} be the diameter of K , that is, the largest Euclidean distance between any two of its points. Jung's theorem states that there exists a closed ball with radius r ≤ ≤ d n 2 ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle r\leq d{\sqrt {\frac {n}{2(n+1)}}}} that contains K .  The boundary case of equality is attained by the regular n - simplex .

Jung's theorem in the plane [ edit ] The most common case of Jung's theorem is in the plane , that is, when n = 2. In this case the theorem states that there exists a circle enclosing all points whose radius satisfies r ≤ ≤ d 3 , {\displaystyle r\leq {\frac {d}{\sqrt {3}}},} and this bound is as tight as possible since when K is an equilateral triangle (or its three vertices) one has r = d 3 .

{\displaystyle r={\frac {d}{\sqrt {3}}}.} General metric spaces [ edit ] For any bounded set S {\displaystyle S} in any metric space , d / 2 ≤ ≤ r ≤ ≤ d {\displaystyle d/2\leq r\leq d} . The first inequality is implied by the triangle inequality for the center of the ball and the two diametral points, and the second inequality follows since a ball of radius d {\displaystyle d} centered at any point of S {\displaystyle S} will contain all of S {\displaystyle S} . Both these inequalities are tight: In a uniform metric space , that is, a space in which all distances are equal, r = d {\displaystyle r=d} .

At the other end of the spectrum, in an injective metric space such as the Manhattan distance in the plane, r = d / 2 {\displaystyle r=d/2} : any two closed balls of radius d / 2 {\displaystyle d/2} centered at points of S {\displaystyle S} have a non- empty intersection , therefore all such balls have a common intersection, and a radius d / 2 {\displaystyle d/2} ball centered at a point of this intersection contains all of S {\displaystyle S} .

Versions of Jung's theorem for various non-Euclidean geometries are also known (see e.g. Dekster 1995, 1997).
