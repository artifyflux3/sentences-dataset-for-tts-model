[ 1 ] In static games, players optimize payoffs based on current information, as in the Nash equilibrium , [ 2 ] but farsightedness involves anticipating dynamic or repeated interactions, such as in coalition games like hedonic games where preferences shape long-term alliances.

[ 3 ] For example, in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma , a farsighted player might cooperate to encourage future cooperation, unlike the one-shot case where defection prevails.

[ 4 ] Similarly, a player might refuse a small immediate payoff to build a more valuable alliance later.

[ 1 ] Farsightedness assumes significant foresight and computational ability, which may be unrealistic in complex scenarios. In evolutionary settings, myopic strategies might dominate if immediate survival outweighs long-term planning.

[ 5 ] Applications [ edit ] In evolutionary game theory , farsightedness contrasts with myopic adaptation, where strategies adjust based on immediate fitness.

[ 6 ] A farsighted strategy might aim for an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) that withstands long-term mutant challenges. In coalition settings, farsighted players assess how current choices affect future stability, rejecting short-term gains for long-term benefits, as seen in hedonic games.

[ 3 ] Farsighted stability captures this by modeling chains of responses predicting stable configurations.
