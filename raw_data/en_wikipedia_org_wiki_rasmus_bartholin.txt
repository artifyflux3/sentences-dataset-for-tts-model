Biography [ edit ] Bartholin was born in Roskilde . He was the son of Caspar Bartholin the Elder (1585–1629) and Anna Fincke, daughter of the mathematician Thomas Fincke .

[ 1 ] As part of his studies, he travelled in Europe for ten years. He stayed in the Netherlands, England, France and Italy. In 1647, he took a Master's degree at the University of Copenhagen . In 1654, he received a Doctoral degree at the University of Padua .

He was a professor at the University of Copenhagen , first in Geometry , later in Medicine. He was also dean of the faculty of medicine, librarian, and rector.

[ 2 ] He wrote, in Latin, the first grammar of the Danish language , the 1657 De studio lingvæ danicæ .

Rasmus Bartholin is remembered especially for his discovery (1669) of the double refraction of a light ray by Iceland spar ( calcite ).

[ 3 ] He published an accurate description of the phenomenon, but since the physical nature of light was poorly understood at the time, he was unable to explain it.

[ 4 ] It was only after Thomas Young proposed the wave theory of light, c. 1801 that an explanation became possible.

Personal [ edit ] He was a younger brother of Thomas Bartholin (1616–1680).
