Pfu DNA polymerase Identifiers Organism Pyrococcus furiosus Symbol pol PDB 4ahc UniProt P61875 Search for Structures Swiss-model Domains InterPro Pfu Polymerase ribbon diagram Pfu DNA polymerase is an enzyme found in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus , where it functions to copy the organism's DNA during cell division ( thermostable DNA polymerase ). In the laboratory setting, Pfu is used to amplify DNA in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), where the enzyme serves the central function of copying a new strand of DNA during each extension step.

It is a family B DNA polymerase . It has an RNase H -like 3'-5' exonuclease domain, typical of B-family polymerase such as DNA polymerase II .

[ 1 ] Proofreading ability of Pfu polymerase [ edit ] Pfu DNA polymerase has superior thermostability and proofreading properties compared with Taq DNA polymerase . Unlike Taq DNA polymerase, Pfu DNA polymerase possesses 3' to 5' exonuclease proofreading activity, meaning that as the DNA is assembled from the 5' end to 3' end , the exonuclease activity immediately removes nucleotides misincorporated at the 3' end of the growing DNA strand. Consequently, Pfu DNA polymerase-generated PCR fragments will have fewer errors than Taq -generated PCR inserts.

Commercially available Pfu typically results in an error rate of 1 in 1.3 million base pairs and can yield 2.6% mutated products when amplifying 1 kb fragments using PCR. However, Pfu is slower and typically requires 1–2 minutes per cycle to amplify 1kb of DNA at 72 °C.  Using Pfu DNA polymerase in PCR reactions also results in blunt-ended PCR products.

[ 2 ] Pfu DNA polymerase is hence superior to Taq DNA polymerase for techniques that require high-fidelity DNA synthesis, but can also be used in conjunction with Taq polymerase to obtain the fidelity of Pfu with the speed of Taq polymerase activity.

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] Scientists led by Eric Mathur at the biotech company Stratagene, based in La Jolla, California , discovered Pfu DNA polymerase which exhibits significantly higher fidelity of replication than Taq DNA polymerase in 1991.

[ 4 ] They received patents for exonuclease-deficient Pfu and the full Pfu in 1996.

[ 5 ] Other polymerases from Pyrococcus strains such as "Deep Vent" ( Q51334 ) from strain GB-D and Pwo DNA polymerase have also seen use.
