Native name चैत्र ( Sanskrit ) Calendar Hindu calendar Month number 1 Number of days 31 Season Spring Gregorian equivalent March 22, 2023–April Significant days Holi Gudi Padwa Ugadi Chaitra Navaratri Rama Navami ← Phalguna Vaisakha → Chaitra ( Sanskrit : चैत्र , romanized : Caitra ) is a month of the Hindu calendar .

In the standard Hindu calendar and India's national civil calendar , Chaitra is the first month of the year. It is the last month in the Bengali calendar , where it is called Choitro. Chaitra or Chait is also the last month in the Nepali calendar (the Vikram Samvat ), where it commences in mid-March. Chittirai is the first month in the Tamil calendar . In the Sindhi calendar, this month is referred to as Chet and is marked by the celebration of the Cheti Chand (birth of Jhulelal , an incarnation of Vishnu). In the Vaishnava calendar, Vishnu governs this month. In solar religious calendars, Chaitra begins with the Sun's entry into Aries .

[ citation needed ] In the more traditional reckoning, the first month commences in March or April of the Gregorian calendar , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] depending upon whether the adhika masa (extra month for alignment of lunar or solar calendar) was observed in the year. The first day of Chaitra is marked as the Chaitra Navaratri , the Hindu lunar new year.

Festivals [ edit ] According to Jain texts , Mahavira was born on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the moon in the month of Chaitra in the year 599 BCE (Chaitra Sud 13).

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] So Jains celebrate Mahavir Janma Kalyanak , one of the most important religious festivals in Jainism during Chaitra.

The month of Chaitra is also associated with the departure of spring.

Holi , the Hindu spring festival of colours, is celebrated on the full moon day ( Purnima ) of Phalguna , the month before Chaitra , exactly six days after which the Chaiti form of the Chhath festival is observed.

In Chandramana (lunar) religious calendars, Chaitra begins with the new moon in March−April and is the first month of the year. The nine-day festival Chaitra Navratri [ 5 ] or Navadurga (or "Nava Durga", the 'nine forms of the Goddess Durga ') starts from Chaitra Shukla Pratipada . The first day of month Chaitra is celebrated as Hindu New Year's Day, known as Gudi Padwa [ 6 ] [ better source needed ] in Maharashtra , Puthandu in Tamil Nadu [ 7 ] and Ugadi in Karnataka , Telangana , and Andhra Pradesh . In West Bengal , Basanti Puja, Annapurna Puja, Ram Nabami, Neel Puja and Chorok Puja ( a.k.a.

'Gajon') are held consecutively before the beginning of Bengali New Year on Poila Baishakh .
