In it, he states that he fears that Open Orthodoxy is acting as an ideological echo chamber in which any unapproved views are ridiculed and quashed without debate. Hazony describes his concern that elements of Open Orthodoxy have seemingly decided to accept all conclusions of academic Bible critics as indisputable fact, without even going through the motions of investigating whether these conclusions are true.

[ 18 ] Hazony is an outspoken Judeo-nationalist and has written that nationalism uniquely provides "the collective right of a free people to rule themselves".

[ 19 ] In 2018, his book, The Virtue of Nationalism was released by Basic Books. In 2019, it was named "Conservative Book of the Year" by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute . It has been read and recommended by heads of state, including Viktor Orbán [ 20 ] and Giorgia Meloni .

[ 21 ] It has been called a "key text of the nationalist right", and Hazony has been cited as an intellectual influence on American vice president JD Vance .

[ 22 ] Some critics maintain that The Virtue of Nationalism is theoretically inconsistent or incoherent and that it bears little relation to the historical body of nationalist thought.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Writing for the Tel Aviv Review of Books , Yair Wallach argued that Hazony's 2020 book, A Jewish State: Herzl and the Promise of Nationalism , is characterised by " intellectual dishonesty ", in part for presenting a selective account of Theodor Herzl 's understanding of Zionism and nationalism.

[ 27 ] Hazony organized and spoke at the National Conservatism Conference in England in May 2023, where he stated that the United Kingdom was plagued with woke " neo-Marxist " agitators who want to detach Britons from their entire past, and called for the return of mandatory military service .

[ 28 ] In a 1990 issue of The Jerusalem Post , Hazony wrote an obituary praising the ultra-nationalist politician, rabbi, writer, and convicted terrorist Meir Kahane . He stated that he and other American Jewish students were inspired by Kahane's speeches and books to believe that Judaism and their Jewish identity "could be something we didn't have to be embarrassed about, that we should be proud to wear a kipa and make our stand on the world stage as Jews". Hazony said that he and many other Jews did not adopt Kahane's political beliefs because of Kahane's "predilection for violent solutions to problems" and his "abusive manner of presenting his case", but he expressed gratitude to Kahane for being someone who "changed our lives, thrilled and entertained us, helped us grow up into strong Jewish men and women".

[ 29 ] After first hearing Kahane speak in 1984, Hazony began to quote him in political debates.

[ 30 ] Some critics [ who?

] believe Hazony adopted some of Kahane's extremist beliefs, such as his racist views towards Arabs [ 31 ] and his opinions on how Israel should be governed.

I've been in that room many times in my life. Too many times. And by now I know it quite well. It's a room in which there is a single, politically correct point of view that everyone is expected to express. A room in which those who toe the party line are praised over and over for being enlightened, fearless, and committed to the search for truth, while anyone who raises a doubt is greeted with anger and ridicule. A room in which those who might have disagreed or asked a tough question make a quick calculation that it's just not worth being publicly embarrassed over it and retreat into silence, or else adjust their views to fit in. A room that is said to be set upon by enemies from the outside, enemies who are invariably lacking in any capacity for intelligent thought, who have no good points of their own to make, who in fact possess no recognizable virtues at all. In other words, it is a room in which the persuaded are lavishly rewarded for being persuaded, the undecided are relentlessly pressed to choose the right side or face the consequences, and skeptics—unless they are in the mood for a serious bruising—are made to shut up.
