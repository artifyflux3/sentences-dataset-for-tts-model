**Diatomic molecules** (from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language")_di-_'two') are [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") composed of only two [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"), of the same or different [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element"). If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") (H 2) or [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") (O 2), then it is said to be [homonuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonuclear_molecule "Homonuclear molecule"). Otherwise, if a diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms, such as [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide") (CO) or [nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide") (NO), the molecule is said to be [heteronuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronuclear_molecule "Heteronuclear molecule"). The bond in a homonuclear diatomic molecule is [non-polar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-polar "Non-polar").

A [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table") showing the elements that exist as [homonuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonuclear_molecule "Homonuclear molecule") diatomic molecules under typical laboratory conditions.

The only [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element") that form stable homonuclear diatomic molecules at [standard temperature and pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_temperature_and_pressure "Standard temperature and pressure") (STP) (or at typical laboratory conditions of 1 [bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(pressure) "Bar (pressure)") and 25°C) are the [gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas") hydrogen (H 2), [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") (N 2), oxygen (O 2), [fluorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine "Fluorine") (F 2), and [chlorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine "Chlorine") (Cl 2), and the liquid [bromine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromine "Bromine") (Br 2).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-1)

The [noble gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas "Noble gas") ([helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), [neon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon "Neon"), [argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon "Argon"), [krypton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton "Krypton"), [xenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon "Xenon"), and [radon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon "Radon")) are also gases at STP, but they are [monatomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monatomic "Monatomic"). The homonuclear diatomic gases and noble gases together are called "elemental gases" or "molecular gases", to distinguish them from other gases that are [chemical compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-2)

At slightly elevated temperatures, the halogens [bromine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromine "Bromine") (Br 2) and [iodine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine "Iodine") (I 2) also form diatomic gases.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-Chemistry-3) All halogens have been observed as diatomic molecules, except for [astatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astatine "Astatine") and [tennessine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessine "Tennessine"), which are uncertain.

Other elements form diatomic molecules when evaporated, but these diatomic species repolymerize when cooled. Heating ("cracking") elemental phosphorus gives [diphosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphosphorus "Diphosphorus") (P 2). Sulfur vapor is mostly [disulfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfur "Disulfur") (S 2). [Dilithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilithium "Dilithium") (Li 2) and [disodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disodium "Disodium") (Na 2)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-4) are known in the gas phase. Di[tungsten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten "Tungsten") (W 2) and di[molybdenum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molybdenum "Molybdenum") (Mo 2) form with [sextuple bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextuple_bond "Sextuple bond") in the gas phase. [Dirubidium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirubidium "Dirubidium") (Rb 2) is diatomic.

Heteronuclear molecules
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diatomic_molecule&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Heteronuclear molecules")]

All other diatomic molecules are [chemical compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound") of two different elements. Many elements can combine to form [heteronuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronuclear_molecule "Heteronuclear molecule") diatomic molecules, depending on temperature and pressure.

Examples are gases [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide") (CO), [nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide") (NO), and [hydrogen chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride "Hydrogen chloride") (HCl).

Many 1:1 [binary compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_compound "Binary compound") are not normally considered diatomic because they are [polymeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer "Polymer") at room temperature, but they form diatomic molecules when evaporated, for example gaseous MgO, SiO, and many others.

Hundreds of diatomic molecules have been identified[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-5) in the environment of the Earth, in the laboratory, and in [interstellar space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_molecules_in_interstellar_space "List of molecules in interstellar space"). About 99% of the [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") is composed of two species of diatomic molecules: nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The natural abundance of [hydrogen (H 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") in the Earth's atmosphere is only of the order of parts per million, but H 2 is the most abundant diatomic molecule in the universe. The interstellar medium is dominated by hydrogen atoms.

All diatomic molecules are linear and characterized by a single parameter which is the [bond length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_length "Bond length") or distance between the two atoms. Diatomic nitrogen has a triple bond, diatomic oxygen has a double bond, and diatomic hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, iodine, and bromine all have single bonds.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-6)

Historical significance
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diatomic_molecule&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Historical significance")]

Diatomic elements played an important role in the elucidation of the concepts of element, atom, and molecule in the 19th century, because some of the most common elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, occur as diatomic molecules. [John Dalton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton "John Dalton")'s original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed water's formula to be HO, giving the atomic weight of oxygen as eight times that of hydrogen,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-7) instead of the modern value of about 16. As a consequence, confusion existed regarding atomic weights and molecular formulas for about half a century.

As early as 1805, [Gay-Lussac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Gay-Lussac "Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac") and [von Humboldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt "Alexander von Humboldt") showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, and by 1811 [Amedeo Avogadro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amedeo_Avogadro "Amedeo Avogadro") had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called [Avogadro's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro%27s_law "Avogadro's law") and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules. However, these results were mostly ignored until 1860, partly due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no [chemical affinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_affinity "Chemical affinity") toward atoms of the same element, and also partly due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro's law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.

At the 1860 [Karlsruhe Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlsruhe_Congress "Karlsruhe Congress") on atomic weights, [Cannizzaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislao_Cannizzaro "Stanislao Cannizzaro") resurrected Avogadro's ideas and used them to produce a consistent table of atomic weights, which mostly agree with modern values. These weights were an important prerequisite for the discovery of the [periodic law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_law "Periodic law") by [Dmitri Mendeleev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev "Dmitri Mendeleev") and [Lothar Meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothar_Meyer "Lothar Meyer").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-8)

Excited electronic states
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diatomic_molecule&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Excited electronic states")]

Diatomic molecules are normally in their lowest or ground state, which conventionally is also known as the ![Image 3: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) state. When a gas of diatomic molecules is bombarded by energetic electrons, some of the molecules may be excited to higher electronic states, as occurs, for example, in the natural aurora; high-altitude nuclear explosions; and rocket-borne electron gun experiments.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-gilmore1992-9) Such excitation can also occur when the gas absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. The excited states are unstable and naturally relax back to the ground state. Over various short time scales after the excitation (typically a fraction of a second, or sometimes longer than a second if the excited state is [metastable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability "Metastability")), transitions occur from higher to lower electronic states and ultimately to the ground state, and in each transition results a [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") is emitted. This emission is known as [fluorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence "Fluorescence"). Successively higher electronic states are conventionally named ![Image 4: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3), ![Image 5: {\displaystyle B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a), ![Image 6: {\displaystyle C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029), etc. (but this convention is not always followed, and sometimes lower case letters and alphabetically out-of-sequence letters are used, as in the example given below). The excitation energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the electronic state in order for the excitation to occur.

In quantum theory, an electronic state of a diatomic molecule is represented by the [molecular term symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_term_symbol "Molecular term symbol")![Image 7: {\displaystyle ^{2S+1}\Lambda (v)_{(g/u)}^{+/-}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/618c1907edad152fa0c2b9b2940e37ad1bb33b0a) where ![Image 8: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2) is the total electronic spin quantum number, ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \Lambda }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0ac0a4a98a414e3480335f9ba652d12571ec6733) is the total electronic angular momentum quantum number along the internuclear axis, and ![Image 10: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) is the vibrational quantum number. ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \Lambda }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0ac0a4a98a414e3480335f9ba652d12571ec6733) takes on values 0, 1, 2, ..., which are represented by the electronic state symbols ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \Sigma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e1f558f53cda207614abdf90162266c70bc5c1e), ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \Pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eed3e3db6cc2028a183af948212ed2551d25c954), ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \Delta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/32769037c408874e1890f77554c65f39c523ebe2), ... For example, the following table lists the common electronic states (without vibrational quantum numbers) along with the energy of the lowest vibrational level (![Image 15: {\displaystyle v=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba3d414a23bf4ecfa36cdd039241efc60a5bd9e0)) of diatomic nitrogen (N 2), the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-laher1991-10)

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_ref-11)**The "energy" units here are actually the reciprocal of the wavelength of a photon emitted in a transition to the lowest energy state. The actual energy can be found by multiplying the given statistic by the product of _c_ (the speed of light) and _h_ (the Planck constant); i.e., about 1.99 × 10−25 joule-metres, and then multiplying by a further factor of 100 to convert from cm−1 to m−1.

The aforementioned [fluorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence "Fluorescence") occurs in distinct regions of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum"), called "[emission bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum "Emission spectrum")": each band corresponds to a particular transition from a higher electronic state and vibrational level to a lower electronic state and vibrational level (typically, many vibrational levels are involved in an excited gas of diatomic molecules). For example, N 2![Image 32: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3)-![Image 33: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) emission bands (a.k.a. Vegard-Kaplan bands) are present in the spectral range from 0.14 to 1.45 μm (micrometres).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-gilmore1992-9) A given band can be spread out over several nanometers in electromagnetic wavelength space, owing to the various transitions that occur in the molecule's rotational quantum number, ![Image 34: {\displaystyle J}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/359e4f407b49910e02c27c2f52e87a36cd74c053). These are classified into distinct sub-band branches, depending on the change in ![Image 35: {\displaystyle J}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/359e4f407b49910e02c27c2f52e87a36cd74c053).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-levine1975-12) The ![Image 36: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33) branch corresponds to ![Image 37: {\displaystyle \Delta J=+1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73645176ec01283e3e1ed9673cde5c66433b9be9), the ![Image 38: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) branch to ![Image 39: {\displaystyle \Delta J=-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eabf6269e448ed518d358b746bacea7df2f5a0ac), and the ![Image 40: {\displaystyle Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed) branch to ![Image 41: {\displaystyle \Delta J=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4e75f16531aead77f8f6cb649637b30188f0b570). Bands are spread out even further by the limited [spectral resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_resolution "Spectral resolution") of the [spectrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrometer "Spectrometer") that is used to measure the [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum "Spectrum"). The spectral resolution depends on the instrument's [point spread function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function "Point spread function").

The [molecular term symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_term_symbol "Molecular term symbol") is a shorthand expression of the angular momenta that characterize the electronic quantum states of a diatomic molecule, which are also [eigenstates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenstate "Eigenstate") of the electronic molecular [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics) "Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)"). It is also convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two-point masses connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies. The theoretical study of the rotational energy levels of the diatomic molecules can be described using the below description of the rotational energy levels. While the study of vibrational energy level of the diatomic molecules can be described using the harmonic oscillator approximation or using the quantum vibrational interaction potentials.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-Swati-13)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-Al-Raeei-14) These potentials give more accurate energy levels because they take multiple vibrational effects into account.

Concerning history, the first treatment of diatomic molecules with quantum mechanics was made by [Lucy Mensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Mensing "Lucy Mensing") in 1926.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-15)

### Translational energies

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diatomic_molecule&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Translational energies")]

The translational energy of the molecule is given by the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") expression: ![Image 42: {\displaystyle E_{\text{trans}}={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f7b7e768f21be3c56ea31625e16e4db10e68cf88) where ![Image 43: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc) is the mass of the molecule and ![Image 44: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) is its velocity.

### Rotational energies

Classically, the kinetic energy of rotation is ![Image 45: {\displaystyle E_{\text{rot}}={\frac {L^{2}}{2I}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f005a66b2a93fbc2ff8a0588eb0fdfa090453306) where

For microscopic, atomic-level systems like a molecule, angular momentum can only have specific discrete values given by ![Image 46: {\displaystyle L^{2}=\ell (\ell +1)\hbar ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2e3b03674c8a4a582c5e3da5dee113080ba2941) where ![Image 47: {\displaystyle \ell }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f066e981e530bacc07efc6a10fa82deee985929e) is a non-negative integer and ![Image 48: {\displaystyle \hbar }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/de68de3a92517953436c93b5a76461d49160cc41) is the [reduced Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_Planck_constant "Reduced Planck constant").

Also, for a diatomic molecule the moment of inertia is ![Image 49: {\displaystyle I=\mu r_{0}^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/762e1cfb5f7cbc262818033e72c2e65df17f1f10) where

So, substituting the angular momentum and moment of inertia into _E_ rot, the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule are given by: ![Image 50: {\displaystyle E_{\text{rot}}={\frac {\ell (\ell +1)\hbar ^{2}}{2\mu r_{0}^{2}}},\quad \ell =0,1,2,\dots }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8e6b3d43ad153d208d83704b02c006b0b7d08b3c)

### Vibrational energies

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diatomic_molecule&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Vibrational energies")]

Another type of motion of a diatomic molecule is for each atom to oscillate—or [vibrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration "Vibration")—along the line connecting the two atoms. The vibrational energy is approximately that of a [quantum harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator "Quantum harmonic oscillator"): ![Image 51: {\displaystyle E_{\text{vib}}=\left(n+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\right)\hbar \omega ,\quad n=0,1,2,\dots ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/859df11c9da28913238928d295f20bd9b085a62f) where

### Comparison between rotational and vibrational energy spacings

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diatomic_molecule&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Comparison between rotational and vibrational energy spacings")]

The spacing, and the energy of a typical spectroscopic transition, between vibrational energy levels is about 100 times greater than that of a typical transition between [rotational energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_energy "Rotational energy") levels.

The [good quantum numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_quantum_number "Good quantum number") for a diatomic molecule, as well as good approximations of rotational energy levels, can be obtained by modeling the molecule using [Hund's cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hund%27s_cases "Hund's cases").

The mnemonics _BrINClHOF_, pronounced "Brinklehof",[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-16)_HONClBrIF_, pronounced "Honkelbrif",[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule#cite_note-sherman-17) “HOBrFINCl”, pronounced “Hoberfinkel”, and _HOFBrINCl_, pronounced "Hofbrinkle", have been coined to aid recall of the list of diatomic elements. Another method, for English-speakers, is the sentence: "_Never Have Fear of Ice Cold Beer_" as a representation of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Oxygen, Iodine, Chlorine, Bromine.
