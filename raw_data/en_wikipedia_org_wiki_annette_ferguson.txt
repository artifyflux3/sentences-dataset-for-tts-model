She is a professor at the Institute for Astronomy, Edinburgh , [ 1 ] and holds the Personal Chair in Observational Astrophysics at the School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Edinburgh .

[ 2 ] Career [ edit ] Ferguson's research focuses on conducting observations of stars and interstellar gas in nearby galaxies to gain insights into the formation and evolution of systems in the Milky Way . Much of her recent work has focused on the Andromeda Galaxy , a giant spiral galaxy in our galactic neighbourhood.

Her research exploits ground-based telescopes in the Canary Islands , Chile , and Hawaii as well as sophisticated instruments on board the Hubble Space Telescope . Ferguson is also involved in planning for future exploitation of data collected by the European Space Agency 's Euclid mission, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory , which is currently under construction in Chile.

Originally from Scotland , Ferguson graduated with a BSc with Distinction in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Toronto , and obtained a PhD in Astrophysics from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore .

She has previously held postdoctoral fellowships at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge , the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in Groningen , Netherlands , and was a Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow at the Max-Planck-Institut für Astrophysik in Garching , Germany .

[ 3 ] Ferguson returned to Scotland in 2005, taking up a Lectureship at The University of Edinburgh , [ 4 ] before being promoted to a Readership in 2007, and a Professorship in 2013.
