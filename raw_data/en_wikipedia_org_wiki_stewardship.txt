Former EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson teaches environmental stewardship to Roberto Clemente Middle School Students.

Stewardship is a practice committed to ethical value that embodies the responsible planning and management of resources . The concepts of stewardship can be applied to the environment and nature, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] economics, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] health, [ 6 ] places, [ 7 ] property, [ 8 ] information, [ 9 ] theology, [ 10 ] and cultural resources.

Etymology [ edit ] Stewardship was originally made up of the tasks of a domestic steward , from stiġ ( house , hall ) and weard , ( ward , guard , guardian , keeper ).

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] In the beginning, it referred to the household servant's duties for bringing food and drink to the castle's dining hall. Stewardship responsibilities were eventually expanded to include the domestic, service and management needs of the entire household.

External links [ edit ] NOAA Planet Stewards Educational Project The NOAA Planet Stewards Education Project (PSEP) is an example of an environmental stewardship program in the United States to advance scientific literacy especially in areas that conserve, restore, and protect human communities and natural resources in the areas of climate, ocean, and atmosphere. It includes professional teachers of students of all ages and abilities, and informal educators who work with the public in nature and science centers, aquaria, and zoos. The project began in 2008 as the NOAA Climate Stewards Project. Its name was changed to NOAA Planet Stewards Educational Project in 2016.
