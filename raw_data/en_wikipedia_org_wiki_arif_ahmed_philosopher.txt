[ 1 ] Before this, Ahmed was a philosopher at the University of Cambridge .

Biography [ edit ] Ahmed was born on 18 March 1974 in Taunton , Somerset, England.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] He was educated at Bishop's Hull Primary School and Queen's College , an independent school in Taunton.

[ 3 ] He studied mathematics at St Anne's College, Oxford , graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1995.

[ 4 ] He then changed direction and studied for a Master of Arts (MA) in philosophy at the University of Sussex , graduating in 1996.

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] Next, he undertook a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in philosophy at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge , [ 4 ] [ 6 ] which he completed in 2001.

[ 5 ] In 2000, he joined Girton College, Cambridge , as a college teaching officer.

[ 5 ] [ 7 ] He was elected a fellow of Girton in 2004.

[ 5 ] He became a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 2015.

[ 6 ] The University of Cambridge promoted him to reader in philosophy in 2016.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] He was made Nicholas Sallnow-Smith College Lecturer by his college in 2019.

[ 10 ] The university appointed him Professor of Philosophy in 2022.

[ 11 ] His research interests include decision theory and the philosophy of religion , from an atheist and libertarian point of view.

[ 6 ] At Cambridge he was an advocate for the protection of freedom of speech. Ahmed was part of a network of academics associated with Peter Thiel and the online magazine Quillette originating around 2017 and centred around the university's Faculty of Divinity.

[ 12 ] One of the group's first initiatives [ 13 ] was to invite Canadian psychologist and social media influencer Jordan Peterson for a visiting fellowship at the university. The university administration intervened to rescind Peterson's invitation, although Peterson eventually did visit Cambridge, which Ahmed hailed as an "important victory." [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] In 2020, Ahmed also led opposition to the University's proposed amendments to its freedom of speech policy, ultimately concluding with the rejection of the amendments.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to education.

[ 20 ] In late 2022 the Minister for Women and Equalities, and Trade Secretary, Kemi Badenoch MP, appointed Ahmed as new commissioner to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) Board.

[ 21 ] He took up the post on 1 January 2023 for a four-year term.

[ 22 ] He left the EHRC after being appointed Director for Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom at the Office for Students (OfS) in June 2023.

[ 1 ] [ 23 ] Books [ edit ] Ahmed is the author of the books Saul Kripke (Continuum Books, 2007), which analyses the philosophy of Saul Kripke , [ 24 ] and Evidence, Decision and Causality (Cambridge University Press, 2014), which defends evidential decision theory and critiques causal decision theory .

[ 25 ] Ahmed is also the editor of both Wittgenstein's Philosophical investigations: A critical guide (Cambridge University Press, 2010) [ 26 ] and Newcomb's Problem (Cambridge University Press, 2018).

[ 27 ] Personal life [ edit ] Ahmed's parents migrated from India to the United Kingdom in the 1970s.

[ 28 ] His father worked as a psychiatrist and his mother as a nurse.

[ 28 ] He became an atheist as a teenager, having been raised a Muslim .

[ 28 ] He has been described as a " new atheist ".

[ 29 ] Ahmed's partner is Frisbee Sheffield , a classicist specialising in ancient philosophy.

[ 28 ] [ 30 ] Together they have three children.
