Canberra , the capital city of Australia, is situated within the territory, and is the territory's primate city . It is located in southeastern Australian mainland as an enclave surrounded by the state of New South Wales (NSW). Exclaved from NSW after federation as the seat of government for the new nation, the territory hosts parliament house , High Court of Australia and the head offices of many Australian Government agencies.

On 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved. Section 125 of the new Australian Constitution provided that land, situated in New South Wales and at least 100 miles (160 km) from Sydney , would be ceded to the new federal government . Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales, the Seat of Government Act 1908 was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region. The territory was transferred to the federal government by New South Wales in 1911, two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913.

While the overwhelming majority of the territory population resides in the city of Canberra in the territory's north-east, the territory also includes some towns such as Williamsdale , Oaks Estate , Uriarra , Tharwa and Hall . The territory also includes the Namadgi National Park , which comprises the majority of land area of the territory. Despite a common misconception, the Jervis Bay Territory is not part of the ACT, although ACT laws apply in the Jervis Bay Territory.

[ 20 ] The territory has a relatively dry, continental climate, experiencing warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters. Among the states and territories of Australia , the Australian Capital Territory is the only one which is landlocked .

The territory is home to many important institutions of the federal government, national monuments and museums. These include the Parliament of Australia , the High Court of Australia , the National Gallery of Australia , the Australian Defence Force Academy and the Australian War Memorial . It also hosts the majority of foreign embassies in Australia, as well as regional headquarters of many international organisations, not-for-profit groups, lobbying groups and professional associations. Several major universities also have campuses in the territory, including the Australian National University , the University of Canberra , the University of New South Wales , Charles Sturt University and the Australian Catholic University .

A locally elected legislative assembly has governed the territory since 1988. However, the Commonwealth maintains authority over the territory and may disallow or overturn local laws. The Commonwealth maintains control over the area known as the Parliamentary Triangle through the National Capital Authority . Residents of the territory, together with residents of the Jervis Bay Territory and Norfolk Island , elect three members of the House of Representatives and two senators . While senators who represent Australian states have fixed six-year terms, the terms of Territory senators are not fixed but are governed by the opening and dissolution of the House of Representatives.

With 453,324 residents, the territory is the second smallest mainland state or territory by population. At the 2016 census , the median weekly income for people in the territory aged over 15 was $998, significantly higher than the national median of $662.

[ 21 ] The average level of degree qualification in the territory is also higher than the national average. Within the territory, 37.1% of the population hold a bachelor's degree level or above education compared to the national figure of 20%.

[ 21 ] In 2022, the territory recorded the equal fourth highest Human Development Index score (0.976) out of over 1,700 subnational regions , coming close to a perfect score of 1.

History [ edit ] Main article: History of the Australian Capital Territory Indigenous inhabitants [ edit ] Indigenous Australians have long inhabited the area.

[ 22 ] Evidence indicates habitation dating back at least 25,000 years, [ 23 ] and it is possible that the area was inhabited for considerably longer. The principal group occupying the region were the Ngunnawal people , with the Ngarigo and Walgalu living immediately to the south, the Wandadian to the east, the Gandangara to the north and the Wiradjuri to the north-west.

[ 24 ] European colonisation [ edit ] Following European settlement, the growth of the new colony of New South Wales led to an increasing demand for arable land .

[ 24 ] Governor Lachlan Macquarie supported expeditions to open up new lands to the south of Sydney .

[ 25 ] The 1820s saw further exploration in the Canberra area associated with the construction of a road from Sydney to the Goulburn plains. While working on the project, Charles Throsby learned of a nearby lake and river from the local Indigenous peoples and he accordingly sent Wild to lead a small party to investigate the site. The search was unsuccessful, but they did discover the Yass River , and it is surmised that they would have set foot on part of the future territory.

[ 26 ] A second expedition was mounted shortly thereafter, and they became the first Europeans to camp at the Molonglo (Ngambri) and Queanbeyan (Jullergung) Rivers.

[ 22 ] However, they failed to find the Murrumbidgee River .

[ 26 ] The issue of the Murrumbidgee was solved in 1821 when Throsby mounted a third expedition and successfully reached the watercourse, on the way providing the first detailed account of the land that now comprises the territory.

[ 26 ] The last expedition in the region before settlement was undertaken by Allan Cunningham in 1824.

[ 22 ] He reported that the region was suitable for grazing and the settlement of the Limestone Plains followed immediately thereafter.

[ 27 ] Early settlement [ edit ] Significant homesteads, structures and settlements in the ACT prior to 1909.

The first land grant in the region was made to Joshua John Moore in 1823, and European settlement in the area began in 1824 with the construction of a homestead by his stockmen on what is now the Acton Peninsula .

[ 25 ] Moore formally purchased the site in 1826 and named the property Canberry or Canberra .

[ 22 ] A significant influx of population and economic activity occurred around the 1850s gold rushes .

[ 28 ] The gold rushes prompted the establishment of communication between Sydney and the region by way of the Cobb & Co coaches, which transported mail and passengers.

[ 29 ] The first post offices opened in Ginninderra in 1859 and at Lanyon in 1860.

[ 25 ] During colonial times, the European communities of Ginninderra, Molonglo and Tuggeranong settled and farmed the surrounding land. The region was also called the Queanbeyan - Yass district, after the two largest towns in the area. The villages of Ginninderra and Tharwa developed to service the local agrarian communities.

During the first 20 years of settlement, there was only limited contact between the settlers and Aboriginal people. Over the succeeding years, the Ngunnawal and other local indigenous people effectively ceased to exist as cohesive and independent communities adhering to their traditional ways of life.

[ 25 ] Those who had not succumbed to disease and other predations either dispersed to the local settlements or were relocated to more distant Aboriginal reserves set up by the New South Wales government in the latter part of the 19th century.

[ citation needed ] Creation of the territory [ edit ] The Federal Capital survey camp was established c. 1909. An extensive survey of the territory was completed by Charles Scrivener and his team in 1915.

In 1898, a referendum on a proposed Constitution was held in four of the colonies – New South Wales , South Australia , Tasmania , and Victoria . Although the referendum achieved a majority in all four colonies, the New South Wales referendum failed to gain the minimum number of votes needed for the bill to pass. Following this result, a meeting of the four Premiers in 1898 heard from George Reid , the Premier of New South Wales , who argued that locating the future capital in New South Wales would be sufficient to ensure the passage of the Bill. The 1899 referendum on this revised bill was successful and passed with sufficient numbers.

[ 30 ] Section 125 of the Australian Constitution thus provided that, following Federation in 1901, land would be ceded freely to the new federal government .

This, however, left open the question of where to locate the capital. In 1906 and after significant deliberations, New South Wales agreed to cede sufficient land on the condition that it was in the Yass - Canberra region, [ 22 ] this site being closer to Sydney.

[ 31 ] Initially, Dalgety, New South Wales remained at the forefront, but Yass-Canberra prevailed after voting by federal representatives.

[ 26 ] The Seat of Government Act 1908 was passed in 1908, which repealed the 1904 Act and specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region.

[ 22 ] [ 32 ] Government surveyor Charles Scrivener was deployed to the region in the same year to map out a specific site and, after an extensive search, settled upon the present location, [ 33 ] basing the borders primarily on the need to secure a stable water supply for the planned capital.

[ 36 ] The Commonwealth gained control of all land within the borders of the new territory but ownership only of NSW Crown land, with significant parcels of extant freehold remaining in the hands of their pre-existing owners. Much of this was acquired during World War One , though a few titles were not transferred until the late 20th Century.

Land within the territory is granted under a leasehold system, with 99-year residential leases sold to buyers as new suburbs are planned, surveyed, and developed. The current policy is for these leases to be extended for another 99-year period on expiry, subject to payment of an administrative fee.

[ 37 ] In an arrangement inspired by Georgism , the ideas of 19th-century American economist Henry George , leaseholders had to pay 5% of the unimproved value of the underlying land in rent until the Gorton government abolished it in 1970.

[ 38 ] Development throughout 20th century [ edit ] The ceremony for the naming of Canberra, 12 March 1913. Prime Minister Andrew Fisher is standing, centre, in dark suit. To his right is the Governor-General, Lord Denman , and to his left, Lady Denman .

In 1911, an international competition to design the future capital was held; it was won by the Chicago architect Walter Burley Griffin in 1912.

[ 25 ] The official naming of Canberra occurred on 12 March 1913 and construction began immediately.

[ 25 ] After Griffin's departure following difficulty in implementing his project, [ 39 ] the Federal Capital Advisory Committee was established in 1920 to advise the government of the construction efforts.

[ 22 ] The committee had limited success meeting its goals. However, the chairman, John Sulman , was instrumental in applying the ideas of the garden city movement to Griffin's plan. The committee was replaced in 1925 by the Federal Capital Commission .

[ 22 ] In 1930, the ACT Advisory Council was established to advise the minister for territories on the community's concerns. In 1934, the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory was established.

[ 40 ] From 1938 to 1957, the National Capital Planning and Development Committee continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra. However, it did not have executive power, and decisions were made on the development of Canberra without consulting the committee.

[ 29 ] During this time, Prime Minister Robert Menzies regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment.

[ 41 ] After World War II, there was a shortage of housing and office space in Canberra.

[ 42 ] A Senate Select Committee hearing was held in 1954 to address its development requirements. This Committee recommended the creation of a single planning body with executive power. Consequently, the National Capital Planning and Development Committee was replaced by the National Capital Development Commission in 1957.

[ 43 ] The National Capital Development Commission ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of Lake Burley Griffin and construction was completed in 1964 after four years of work. The completion of the centrepiece of Griffin's design finally laid the platform for the development of Griffin's Parliamentary Triangle .

[ 41 ] Self-government [ edit ] In 1978, an advisory referendum was held to determine the views of citizens resident in the territory about whether there should be self-government. Just under 64 percent of voters rejected devolved government options, in favour of the status quo.

[ 44 ] Nevertheless, in 1988, the new federal minister for the territory Gary Punch received a report recommending the abolition of the National Capital Development Commission and the formation of a locally elected government. Punch recommended that the Hawke government accept the report's recommendations and subsequently Clyde Holding introduced legislation to grant self-government to the territory in October 1988.

[ 45 ] The enactment on 6 December 1988 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 established the framework for self-government.

[ 46 ] The first election for the 17-member Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly was held on 4 March 1989.

[ 47 ] The initial years of self-government were difficult and unstable.

[ 48 ] A majority of territory residents had opposed self-government and had it imposed upon them by the federal parliament. At the first election, 4 of the 17 seats were won by anti-self-government single-issue parties due to a protest vote by disgruntled Canberrans and a total of 8 were won by minor parties and independents.

[ 48 ] In 1992, Labor won eight seats and the minor parties and independents won only three. Stability increased, and in 1995, Kate Carnell became the first elected Liberal chief minister. In 1998, Carnell became the first chief minister to be re-elected.

Geography [ edit ] Location of the ACT and Jervis Bay The territory is 2,358 km 2 (910 sq mi) in area, slightly smaller than Luxembourg.

It is bounded by the Bombala railway line in the east, the watershed of Naas Creek in the south, the watershed of the Cotter River in the west and the watershed of the Molonglo River in the north-east. These boundaries were set to give the territory an adequate water supply.

[ 49 ] The territory extends about 88.5 km (55.0 mi) north-south between 35.124°S and 35.921°S, and 57.75 km (35.88 mi) west-east between 148.763°E and 149.399°E.

[ note 1 ] The city area of Canberra occupies the north-eastern corner of this area.

The territory includes the city of Canberra and some towns such as Williamsdale , Oaks Estate , Uriarra Village , Tharwa and Hall . The territory also contains agricultural land ( sheep , dairy cattle , vineyards and small amounts of crops) and a large area of national park ( Namadgi National Park ), much of it mountainous and forested.

The Molonglo River , located in the north-east of the region Tidbinbilla is a locality to the south-west of Canberra that features the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve and the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex , operated by the United States' NASA as part of its Deep Space Network . The Southern Tablelands Temperate Grassland straddles the state.

The territory includes a large range of mountains, rivers and creeks, largely contained within the Namadgi National Park . These include the Naas and Murrumbidgee Rivers.

In September 2022, a proposal was announced to change the border between NSW and the territory, the first change since the territory was created in 1911.

[ 50 ] ACT chief minister Andrew Barr said NSW premier Dominic Perrottet had agreed to a proposed border change of 330 ha (1.3 sq mi) in the Ginninderra watershed.

[ 51 ] Climate [ edit ] Autumn foliage in Canberra The territory has a relatively dry, continental climate, experiencing warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters.

[ 52 ] Under the Köppen-Geiger classification , the territory has an oceanic climate ( Cfb ).

[ 53 ] January is the hottest month with an average high of 27.7 °C.

[ 52 ] July is the coldest month when the average high drops to 11.2 °C (52.2 °F).

[ 52 ] The highest maximum temperature recorded in the territory was 44.0 °C on 4 January 2020. The lowest minimum temperature was −10.0 °C on 11 July 1971.

[ 52 ] Rainfall varies significantly across the territory.

[ 52 ] Much higher rainfall occurs in the mountains to the west of Canberra compared to the east.

[ 52 ] The mountains act as a barrier during winter with the city receiving less rainfall.

[ 52 ] Average annual rainfall in the territory is 629mm and there is an average of 108 rain days annually.

[ 52 ] The wettest month is October, with an average rainfall of 65.3mm, and the driest month is June, with an average of 39.6mm.

[ 52 ] Frost is common in the winter months.

Snow is rare in Canberra's city centre, but the surrounding areas get annual snowfall through winter and often the snow-capped mountains can be seen from the city. The last significant snowfall in the city centre was in 1968.

[ 52 ] Smoke haze became synonymous with the 2019/2020 Australian summer. On 1 January 2020 Canberra had the worst air quality of any major city in the world, with an AQI of 7700 (USAQI 949).

In the 1840s fossils of brachiopods and trilobites from the Silurian period were discovered at Woolshed Creek near Duntroon . At the time, these were the oldest fossils discovered in Australia, though this record has now been far surpassed.

[ 57 ] Other specific geological places of interest include the State Circle cutting and the Deakin anticline .

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] The oldest rocks in the territory date from the Ordovician around 480 million years ago. During this period the region along with most of Eastern Australia was part of the ocean floor; formations from this period include the Black Mountain Sandstone formation and the Pittman Formation consisting largely of quartz -rich sandstone , siltstone and shale . These formations became exposed when the ocean floor was raised by a major volcanic activity in the Devonian forming much of the east coast of Australia.

Flora and fauna [ edit ] Main articles: Fauna of the Australian Capital Territory and Flora of the Australian Capital Territory The environments range from alpine area on the higher mountains, to sclerophyll forest and to woodland . Much of the territory has been cleared for grazing and is also burnt off by bushfires several times per century. The kinds of plants can be grouped into vascular plants , that include gymnosperms , flowering plants, and ferns , as well as bryophytes , lichens , fungi and freshwater algae . Four flowering plants are endemic to the territory. Several lichens are unique to the territory. Most plants in the territory are characteristic of the Flora of Australia and include well known plants such as Grevillea , Eucalyptus trees and kangaroo grass .

The native forest in the territory was almost wholly eucalypt species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including Pinus radiata on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.

[ 60 ] Fauna in the territory includes representatives from most major Australian animal groups . This includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, platypus, echidna, emu, kookaburras and dragon lizards.

Government and politics [ edit ] Canberra , in the northeast of the ACT, is an entirely planned city.

The public entrance to the ACT Legislative Assembly in Civic Square Territory government [ edit ] See also: Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly , Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories , and Government of the Australian Capital Territory Unlike the states of Australia which have their own constitutions, territories are governed under a Commonwealth statute [ 61 ] —for the ACT, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 .

[ 62 ] The Self-Government Act constitutes a democratic government for the territory consisting of a popularly elected Legislative Assembly which elects a Chief Minister from among its membership who, in turn, appoints an Executive consisting of a number of Ministers.

The executive power of the territory rests with the ACT government , headed by the Chief Minister (currently the Labor Party 's Andrew Barr ) and consists of ministers appointed by them. The ministers are supported by the ACT Public Service, which is arranged into directorates, and a number of public authorities.

[ 63 ] The Chief Minister is the equivalent of a State Premier and sits on the National Cabinet.

[ 64 ] Unlike the states, there is no vice-regal representative who chairs the executive government council. The Chief Minister performs many of the roles that a state governor normally holds in the context of a state; however, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly gazettes the laws and summons meetings of the Assembly.

The ACT Labor party has been in power since 2001.

The legislative power of the territory is vested in the unicameral Legislative Assembly .  The assembly has 25 members , elected from five electorates using the Hare-Clark single transferable voting system.

[ 65 ] The assembly is presided over by the Speaker (currently the Labor Party's Joy Burch ). The assembly has almost all of the same powers as the state parliaments, the power to "make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Territory", with limited exceptions relating to the territory's unique relationship with the commonwealth.
