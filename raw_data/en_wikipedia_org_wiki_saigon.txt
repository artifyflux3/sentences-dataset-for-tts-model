[ 4 ] The city's geography is defined by rivers and canals, of which the largest is Saigon River . As the largest financial centre in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City has the largest gross regional domestic product out of all Vietnam provinces and municipalities, [ 7 ] contributing around a quarter of the country's total GDP .

[ 8 ] Ho Chi Minh City's metropolitan area is ASEAN's 5th largest economy , also the biggest outside an ASEAN country capital.

The area was initially part of Cambodian states until it became part of the Vietnamese Nguyễn lords in 1698, due to Đại Việt 's expansionist policy of Nam tiến . It was capital of the Nguyễn lords at the end of their existence before the Nguyễn dynasty was formed. After the fall of the Citadel of Saigon , it became the capital of French Cochinchina from 1862 to 1949.

It was also the capital of French Indochina from 1887 to 1902, and again from 1945 until its cessation in 1954. After France recognized Vietnam's independence and unity, [ nb 1 ] it was the capital of the State of Vietnam from 1949 to 1955. Following the 1954 partition , it became the capital of South Vietnam until it was captured by North Vietnam , who created a unified communist state in 1976 and renamed the city after their former leader Ho Chi Minh , though the former name is still widely used in informal usages. Beginning in the 1990s, the city underwent rapid expansion and modernization, which contributed to Vietnam's post-war economic recovery and helped revive its international trade hub status.

Ho Chi Minh City has a long tradition of being one of the centers of economy, entertainment and education in Southern Vietnam in particular and Vietnam in general. It is also the busiest international transport hub in Vietnam, with Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport accounting for nearly half of all international arrivals to Vietnam and the Port of Saigon among the busiest container ports in Southeast Asia .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] The city is also a tourist attraction; some of its historic landmarks with modern landmarks, including the Independence Palace , Bitexco Financial Tower , Landmark 81 Tower , the War Remnants Museum , and Bến Thành Market . The city is also known for its narrow walkable alleys and bustling night life , notable is the Phạm Ngũ Lão Ward and the Bùi Viện street in the ward. Since 2025, when Bình Dương and Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu provinces were merged into Ho Chi Minh City, the city has officially become a megacity, while inheriting major industrial towns and coastal cities from the two former provinces. Currently, Ho Chi Minh City is facing increasing threats of sea level rise and flooding as well as heavy strains on public infrastructures.

Etymology Main article: Names of Ho Chi Minh City The first known human habitation in the area was either a Cham settlement called Baigaur, [ nb 2 ] or a Cambodian city named Prey Nokor, [ 12 ] which was a small fishing village.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Over time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Định ( 嘉 定 ) in 1698, a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name Sài Gòn , francized as Saïgon , [ 14 ] although the city was still indicated as 嘉 定 on Vietnamese maps written in chữ Hán until at least 1891.

[ 15 ] An old name of Gia Định was Phan Yên 藩安 , which was later commonly glossed as Phiên An .

[ 16 ] The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after reunification in 1976 to honour Ho Chi Minh .

[ nb 3 ] Even today, however, the informal name of Sài Gòn remains in daily speech. However, there is a technical difference between the two terms: Sài Gòn is commonly used to refer to the city centre in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers to all of its urban and rural districts.

[ 14 ] Saigon Saigon is written here as 柴棍 along with other Southern Vietnamese cities. (On the left of the page, first row after " 城庯三 ") The original toponym behind Sài Gòn was attested earliest as 柴棍 , with two phonograms whose Sino-Vietnamese readings are sài and côn respectively, in Lê Quý Đôn's "Miscellaneous Chronicles of the Pacified Frontier" ( 撫邊雜錄 , Phủ biên tạp lục c. 1776), wherein Lê relates that, in 1674, Cambodian prince Ang Nan was installed as uparaja in 柴棍 (Sài Gòn) by Vietnamese forces.

柴棍 also appears later in Trịnh Hoài Đức's "Comprehensive Records about the Gia Định Citadel" ( 嘉定城通志 , Gia Định thành thông chí , c. 1820), "Textbook on the Geography of the Southern Country" ( 南國地輿教科書 , Nam quốc địa dư giáo khoa thư , 1908), [ 18 ] etc.

Adrien Launay's Histoire de la Mission de Cochinchine (1688–1823), "Documents Historiques II: 1728 – 1771" (1924: 190 ) cites 1747 documents containing the toponyms: provincia Rai-gon, Rai-gon thong (for *Sài Gòn thượng "Upper Saigon"), & Rai-gon-ha (for *Sài Gòn hạ "Lower Saigon").

It is probably a transcription of Khmer ព្រៃនគរ (Prey Nokôr) [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ nb 4 ] , or Khmer ព្រៃគរ (Prey Kôr).

The proposal that Sài Gòn is from non-Sino-Vietnamese reading of Chinese 堤岸 ("embankment", tai4 ngon6 , SV: đê ngạn) [ nb 5 ] , the Cantonese name of Chợ Lớn , (e.g. by Vương Hồng Sển) has been critiqued as folk-etymological, as: (1) the Vietnamese source Phủ biên tạp lục (albeit written in literary Chinese) was the earliest extant one containing the local toponym's transcription; (2) 堤岸 has variant form 提岸 , thus suggesting that both were transcriptions of a local toponym and thus are cognates to, not originals of, Sài Gòn. Saigon is unlikely to be from 堤岸 since in "Textbook on the Geography of the Southern Country", it also lists Chợ Lớn as 𢄂𢀲 separate from 柴棍 Sài Gòn.

[ original research?

] Ho Chi Minh City The current official name, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh , was first proposed by the Viet Minh in August 1946 and was later officially adopted in July 1976. It is abbreviated as TP.HCM, and translated in English as Ho Chi Minh City , abbreviated as HCMC, and in French as Hô-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated as HCMV.

The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh , the first leader of North Vietnam . This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname ( Hồ , 胡 ) with a given name meaning "enlightened will" (from Sino-Vietnamese , 志 明 ; Chí meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning "light bringer".

[ 23 ] Nowadays, "Saigon" is still used as a semi-official name for the city, in some cases being used interchangeably with Ho Chi Minh City, partly due to its long history and familiarity.

[ 24 ] History Early settlement The earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Phụng Sơn Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD.

[ 25 ] A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa .

[ 25 ] Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor after conquest by the Khmer Empire around 1145, [ 25 ] Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest.

[ 26 ] The first Vietnamese people crossed the sea to explore this land completely without the organisation of the Nguyễn Lords . Thanks to the marriage between Princess Nguyễn Phúc Ngọc Vạn – daughter of Lord Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên – and the King of Cambodia Chey Chettha II in 1620, the relationship between Vietnam and Cambodia became smooth, and the people of the two countries could freely move back and forth. In exchange, Chey Chettha II gifted Prei Nokor to the Nguyễn lords .

[ 27 ] Vietnamese settlers began to migrate to the area of Saigon, Đồng Nai. Before that, the Funanese, Khmer, and Cham had lived there, scattered from time immemorial.

The period from 1623 to 1698 is considered the period of the formation of later Saigon. In 1623, Lord Nguyen sent a mission to ask his son-in-law, King Chey Chettha II, to set up tax collection stations in Prey Nokor (Sài Gòn) and Kas Krobei (Bến Nghé). Although this was a deserted jungle area, it was located on the traffic routes between Vietnam, Cambodia, and Siam. The next two important events of this period were the establishment of the barracks and residence of Vice King Ang Non and the establishment of a palace at Tân Mỹ (near the present-day Cống Quỳnh–Nguyễn Trãi crossroads). It can be said that Saigon was formed from these three government agencies.

Map of Gia Định in 1815 In 1679, Lord Nguyễn Phúc Tần allowed a group of Chinese refugees from the Qing dynasty to settle in Mỹ Tho , Biên Hòa and Saigon to seek refuge. In 1698, Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh , a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyễn rulers of Huế by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] King Chey Chettha IV of Cambodia tried to stop the Vietnamese but was defeated by Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh in 1700. In February 1700, he invaded Cambodia from An Giang . In March, the Vietnamese expedition under Cảnh and a Chinese general Trần Thượng Xuyên (Chen Shangchuan) defeated the main Cambodian army at Bích Đôi citadel, king Chey Chettha IV took flight while his nephew Ang Em surrendered to the invaders, as the Vietnamese marched onto and captured Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh .

[ 30 ] As a result, Saigon and Long An were officially and securely obtained by the Nguyễn, more Vietnamese settlers moved into the new conquered lands.

[ 30 ] In 1788, Nguyễn Ánh captured the city, and used it as a centre of resistance against Tây Sơn.

[ 31 ] Two years later, a large Vauban citadel called Gia Định , or Thành Bát Quái ("Eight Diagrams") was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel , one of the Nguyễn Ánh's French mercenaries .

[ 32 ] The citadel was captured by Lê Văn Khôi during his revolt of 1833–35 against Emperor Minh Mạng . Following the revolt, Minh Mạng ordered it to be dismantled, and a new citadel, called Phụng Thành , was built in 1836.

[ 33 ] In 1859, the citadel was destroyed by the French following the Battle of Kỳ Hòa .

[ 33 ] Initially called Gia Định, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.

[ 25 ] French colonial era Ceded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon , [ 34 ] the city was planned by the French to transform into a large town for colonization. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, construction of various French-style buildings began, including a botanical garden , the Norodom Palace , Hotel Continental , Notre-Dame Cathedral , and Bến Thành Market , among many others.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] In April 1865, Gia Định Báo was established in Saigon, becoming the first newspaper published in Vietnam.

[ 37 ] During the French colonial era, Saigon became known as "Pearl of the Orient" ( Hòn ngọc Viễn Đông ), [ 38 ] or "Paris of the Extreme Orient".

On 27 April 1931, a new région called Saigon–Cholon consisting of Saigon and Cholon was formed; the name Cholon was dropped after South Vietnam gained independence from France in 1955.

[ 40 ] From about 256,000 in 1930, [ 41 ] Saigon's population rose to 1.2 million in 1950.

State of Vietnam and Republic of Vietnam era On 14 June 1949, 10 days after France returned Cochinchina to Vietnam, former Emperor Bảo Đại made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam within the French Union with himself as head of state.

[ 42 ] The state was proclaimed in July. In July 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel ( Bến Hải River ), with the Việt Minh , under Ho Chi Minh , gaining complete control of the northern half of the country , while the southern half remained the rule of the State of Vietnam.

[ 43 ] The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when Bảo Đại was deposed by his Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm in the 1955 referendum , [ 43 ] with Saigon as its capital.

[ 44 ] On 22 October 1956, the city was given the official name, Đô Thành Sài Gòn ("Capital City Saigon").

[ 45 ] After the decree of 27 March 1959 came into effect, Saigon was divided into eight districts and 41 wards.

[ 45 ] In December 1966, two wards from old An Khánh Commune of Gia Định, were formed into District 1, then seceded shortly later to become District 9.

[ 46 ] In July 1969, District 10 and District 11 were founded, and by 1975, the city's area consisted of eleven districts, Gia Định , Củ Chi District ( Hậu Nghĩa ), and Phú Hòa District ( Bình Dương ).

[ 46 ] Saigon served as the financial, industrial and transport centre of the Republic of Vietnam.

[ 47 ] In the late 1950s, with the U.S. providing nearly $2 billion in aid to the Diệm regime, the country's economy grew rapidly under the capitalist model ; [ 45 ] by 1960, over half of South Vietnam's factories were located in Saigon.

[ 48 ] However, beginning in the 1960s, Saigon experienced economic downturn and high inflation, as it was completely dependent on U.S. aid and imports from other countries.

[ 45 ] As a result of widespread urbanisation, with the population reaching 3.3 million by 1970, the city was described by the USAID as being turned "into a huge slum".

[ 49 ] The city also suffered from "prostitutes, drug addicts, corrupt officials, beggars, orphans, and Americans with money", and according to Stanley Karnow , it was "a black-market city in the largest sense of the word".

[ 44 ] On 28 April 1955, the Vietnamese National Army launched an attack against Bình Xuyên military force in the city. The battle lasted until May, killing an estimated 500 people and leaving about 20,000 homeless.

[ 44 ] [ 50 ] Ngô Đình Diệm then later turned on other paramilitary groups in Saigon, including the Hòa Hảo Buddhist reform movement.

[ 44 ] On 11 June 1963, Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức self-immolated in the city, in protest of the Diệm regime. On 1 November of the same year, Diệm was assassinated in Saigon, in a successful coup by Dương Văn Minh .

[ 44 ] During the 1968 Tet Offensive , communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city . Seven years later, on 30 April 1975, Saigon was captured , ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam, [ 51 ] and the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army .

Post–Vietnam War and today In July 1976, upon the establishment of the unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam , the city of Saigon (including the Cholon area), the province of Gia Ðịnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City, in honour of the late Communist leader Ho Chi Minh.

[ nb 6 ] At the time, the city covered an area of 1,295.5 square kilometres (500.2 sq mi) with eight districts and five rurals: Thủ Đức , Hóc Môn , Củ Chi , Bình Chánh , and Nhà Bè .

[ 46 ] Since 1978, administrative divisions in the city have been revised numerous times, [ 46 ] most recently in 2020, when District 2 , District 9 , and Thủ Đức District were consolidated to form a municipal city .

[ 52 ] Ho Chi Minh City during sunset (November 2017) On 29 October 2002, 60 people died and 90 were injured in the International Trade Center building fire in Ho Chi Minh City.

[ 53 ] Today, Ho Chi Minh City, along with its surrounding provinces, is described as "the manufacturing hub" of Vietnam, and "an attractive business hub".

[ 54 ] In terms of cost, it was ranked the 178th-most expensive major city in the world according to the Mercer Cost Of Living 2024 survey of 226 cities.

[ 55 ] In terms of international connectedness, as of 2024, the city was classified as a "Beta+" city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network .

[ 56 ] Geography Population density and elevation above sea level in the city (2010). Ho Chi Minh City is vulnerable to sea level rise The city is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam , 1,760 km (1,090 mi) south of Hanoi . The average elevation is 5 m (16 ft) above sea level for the city centre and 16 m (52 ft) for the suburb areas.

[ 57 ] It borders Tây Ninh Province and Bình Dương Province to the north, Đồng Nai Province and Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province to the east, Long An Province to the west, and Tiền Giang Province and the South China Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km 2 (809 sq mi) or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to Củ Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to Cần Giờ on the Eastern Sea.

The distance from the northernmost point (Phú Mỹ Hưng Commune, Củ Chi District ) to the southernmost one (Long Hòa Commune, Cần Giờ District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point ( Long Bình ward , District Nine) to the westernmost one (Bình Chánh Commune, Bình Chánh District) is 47 km (29 mi).

[ citation needed ] Due to its location on the Mekong Delta, the city is fringed by tidal flats that have been heavily modified for agriculture.

[ 58 ] Flooding Saigon is considered one of the most vulnerable cities to the effects of climate change , particularly flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Đồng Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to suffer flooding.
