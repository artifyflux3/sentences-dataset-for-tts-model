The theorem was proved by Sean Keel and Shigefumi Mori ( 1997 ).

A consequence of the Keel–Mori theorem is the existence of a coarse moduli space of a separated algebraic stack , which is roughly a "best possible" approximation to the stack by a separated algebraic space.

Statement [ edit ] All algebraic spaces are assumed of finite type over a locally Noetherian base. Suppose that j : R → X × X is a flat groupoid whose stabilizer j −1 Δ is finite over X (where Δ is the diagonal of X × X ). The Keel–Mori theorem states that there is an algebraic space that is a geometric and uniform categorical quotient of X by j , which is separated if j is finite.

A corollary is that for any flat group scheme G acting properly on an algebraic space X with finite stabilizers there is a uniform geometric and uniform categorical quotient X / G which is a separated algebraic space.

János Kollár ( 1997 ) proved a slightly weaker version of this and described several applications.
