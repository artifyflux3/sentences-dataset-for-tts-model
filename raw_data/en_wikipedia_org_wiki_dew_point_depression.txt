A lower dew point depression indicates that the air is more moist at a given temperature.

[ 1 ] : 83 For a constant temperature, the smaller the difference, the more moisture there is, and the higher the relative humidity . In the lower troposphere , more moisture (small dew point depression) results in lower cloud bases and lifted condensation levels (LCL). LCL height is an important factor modulating severe thunderstorms . One example concerns tornadogenesis , with tornadoes most likely if the dew point depression is 20 °F (11 °C) or less, and the likelihood of large, intense tornadoes increasing as dew point depression decreases. LCL height also factors in downburst and microburst activity. Conversely, instability is increased when there is a mid-level dry layer (large dew point depression) known as a " dry punch ", which is favorable for convection if the lower layer is buoyant .

[ citation needed ] As it measures moisture content in the atmosphere, the dew point depression is also an important indicator in agricultural and forest meteorology, particularly in predicting wildfires .
