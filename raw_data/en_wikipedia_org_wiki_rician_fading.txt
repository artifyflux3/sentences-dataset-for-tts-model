Rician fading occurs when one of the paths, typically a line of sight signal or some strong reflection signals, is much stronger than the others. In Rician fading, the amplitude gain is characterized by a Rician distribution .

Rayleigh fading is sometimes considered a special case of Rician fading for when there is no line of sight signal . In such a case, the Rician distribution, which describes the amplitude gain in Rician fading, reduces to a Rayleigh distribution .  Rician fading itself is a special case of two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) fading .

Channel characterization [ edit ] Bit error ratio performance of the PSK and QAM transmission over Rician flat fading channel ( K {\displaystyle K} = 0.6, Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } = 1).

A Rician fading channel can be described by two parameters.

[ 1 ] The first one, K {\displaystyle K} , is the ratio between the power in the direct path and the power in the other, scattered, paths: [ 2 ] K = ν ν 2 2 σ σ 2 {\displaystyle K={\frac {\nu ^{2}}{2\sigma ^{2}}}} The second one, Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } , is the total power from both paths, and acts as a scaling factor to the distribution: Ω Ω = ν ν 2 + 2 σ σ 2 {\displaystyle \Omega =\nu ^{2}+2\sigma ^{2}} The received signal amplitude ( not the received signal power) R {\displaystyle R} is then Rice distributed with the following parameters: [ 3 ] ν ν 2 = K 1 + K Ω Ω {\displaystyle \nu ^{2}={\frac {K}{1+K}}\Omega } σ σ 2 = Ω Ω 2 ( 1 + K ) {\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}={\frac {\Omega }{2(1+K)}}} The resulting Probability density function is: f ( x ) = 2 ( K + 1 ) x Ω Ω exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − K − − ( K + 1 ) x 2 Ω Ω ) I 0 ( 2 K ( K + 1 ) Ω Ω x ) , {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {2(K+1)x}{\Omega }}\exp \left(-K-{\frac {(K+1)x^{2}}{\Omega }}\right)I_{0}\left(2{\sqrt {\frac {K(K+1)}{\Omega }}}x\right),} where I 0 ( ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle I_{0}(\cdot )} is the 0th order modified Bessel function of the first kind.
