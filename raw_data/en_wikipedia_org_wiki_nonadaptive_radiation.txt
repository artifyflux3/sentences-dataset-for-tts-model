[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The species that are a part of a nonadaptive radiation will tend to have very similar niches, and in many (though not all) cases will be morphologically similar.

[ 4 ] Nonadaptive radiations are driven by nonecological speciation .

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] In many cases, this nonecological speciation is allopatric , and the organisms are dispersal-limited such that populations can be geographically isolated within a landscape with relatively similar ecological conditions.

[ 4 ] For example, Albinaria land snails on islands in the Mediterranean [ 1 ] and Batrachoseps salamanders from California [ 2 ] each include relatively dispersal-limited, and closely related, ecologically similar species often have minimal range overlap, a pattern consistent with allopatric, nonecological speciation. In other cases, such as certain damselflies [ 3 ] and crickets from Hawaii , [ 5 ] there can be range overlap in closely related species, and it is likely that sexual selection (and species recognition ) plays a role in maintaining (and perhaps giving rise to) species boundaries.
