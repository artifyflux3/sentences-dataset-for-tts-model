A [bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_(physics) "Bubble (physics)") of [exhaled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation "Exhalation") gas in [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water")

In [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language") and [physical science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_science "Physical science"), a **physical object** or **material object** (or simply an **object** or **body**) is a [contiguous](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contiguous "wiktionary:contiguous") collection of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), within a defined boundary (or [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface "Surface")), that exists in [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"). Usually contrasted with [abstract objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_objects "Abstract objects") and [mental objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_representation "Mental representation").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object#cite_note-2)

Also in common usage, an object is not constrained to consist of the same collection of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"). Atoms or parts of an object may change over time. An object is usually meant to be defined by the simplest representation of the boundary consistent with the observations. However the laws of physics only apply directly to objects that consist of the same collection of matter.

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), an object is an [identifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy) "Identity (philosophy)") collection of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), which may be constrained by an identifiable boundary, and may move as a unit by [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(physics) "Translation (physics)") or rotation, in [3-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space").

Each object has a unique identity, independent of any other properties. Two objects may be identical, in all properties except position, but still remain distinguishable. In most cases the boundaries of two objects may not overlap at any point in time. The property of identity allows objects to be counted.

Examples of [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_model "Scientific model") of physical bodies include, but are not limited to a [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle"), several [interacting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction "Fundamental interaction") smaller bodies ([particulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulate "Particulate") or otherwise). Discrete objects are in contrast to [continuous media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_media "Continuous media").

The common conception of physical objects includes that they have [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(metaphysics) "Extension (metaphysics)") in the [physical world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"), although there do exist [theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_theory "Physical theory") of [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics") and [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") which arguably challenge[_[how?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] this. In modern physics, "extension" is understood in terms of the [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"): roughly speaking, it means that for a given moment of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") the body has some location in the space (although not necessarily amounting to the abstraction of a [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") in [space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time "Space-time")). A physical body as a whole is assumed to have such [quantitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity") properties as [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"), [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"), [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge"), other [conserved quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law_(physics) "Conservation law (physics)"), and possibly other quantities.

An object with known composition and described in an adequate physical theory is an example of [physical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system "Physical system").

An object is known by the application of [senses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense "Sense"). The properties of an object are inferred by learning and reasoning based on the information perceived. Abstractly, an object is a construction of our mind consistent with the information provided by our senses, using [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor "Occam's razor").

In common usage an object is the material inside the boundary of an object, in three-dimensional space. The boundary of an object is a contiguous surface which may be used to determine what is inside, and what is outside an object. An object is a single piece of material, whose extent is determined by a description based on the properties of the material. An imaginary sphere of granite within a larger block of granite would not be considered an identifiable object, in common usage. A fossilized skull encased in a rock may be considered an object because it is possible to determine the extent of the skull based on the properties of the material.

For a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body"), the boundary of an object may change over time by [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_(mathematics) "Continuity (mathematics)")[translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") and [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation"). For a [deformable body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformable_body "Deformable body") the boundary may also be continuously [deformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(mechanics) "Deformation (mechanics)") over time in other ways.

An object has an [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy) "Identity (philosophy)"). In general two objects with identical properties, other than position at an instance in time, may be distinguished as two objects and may not occupy the same space at the same time (excluding component objects). An object's identity may be tracked using the continuity of the change in its boundary over time. The identity of objects allows objects to be arranged in [sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") and [counted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting "Counting").

The material in an object may change over time. For example, a rock may wear away or have pieces broken off it. The object will be regarded as the same object after the addition or removal of material, if the system may be more simply described with the continued existence of the object, than in any other way. The addition or removal of material may discontinuously change the boundary of the object. The continuation of the object's identity is then based on the description of the system by continued identity being simpler than without continued identity.

For example, a particular car might have all its wheels changed and still be regarded as the same car.

The identity of an object may not split. If an object is broken into two pieces at most one of the pieces has the same identity. An object's identity may also be destroyed if the simplest description of the system at a point in time changes from identifying the object to not identifying it. Also an object's identity is created at the first point in time that the simplest model of the system consistent with perception identifies it.

An object may be composed of components. A component is an object completely within the boundary of a containing object.

A living thing may be an object, and is distinguished from non-living things by the designation of the latter as _inanimate objects_. Inanimate objects generally lack the capacity or desire to undertake actions, although humans in some cultures may tend to attribute such characteristics to non-living things.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object#cite_note-3)

### Classical mechanics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physical_object&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Classical mechanics")]

In [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") a physical body is a collection of matter having properties including [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"), [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") and [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"). The matter exists in a volume of [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"). This space is its [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(metaphysics) "Extension (metaphysics)").

Interactions between objects are partly described by orientation and external shape.

In [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics") an object may be described as a collection of sub-objects, down to an infinitesimal division, which interact with each other by forces that may be described internally by [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") and [mechanical stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics) "Stress (mechanics)").

In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") an object is a particle or collection of particles. Until measured, a particle does not have a physical position. A particle is defined by a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function "Wave function") of finding the particle at a particular position. There is a [limit to the accuracy with which the position and velocity may be measured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle"). A particle or collection of particles is described by a [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state").

These ideas vary from the common usage understanding of what an object is.

In [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), there is a debate as to whether some [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") are not bodies, but are [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") without [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(metaphysics) "Extension (metaphysics)") in [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space") within [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), or are always extended in at least one dimension of space as in [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory") or [M theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_theory "M theory").

In some branches of [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), depending on [school of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_thought "School of thought"), a physical object has [physical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_properties "Physical properties"), as compared to [mental objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_objects "Mental objects"). In ([reductionistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionistic "Reductionistic")) [behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism "Behaviorism"), objects and their properties are the (only) [meaningful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaningful "Meaningful") objects of study. While in modern-day behavioral psychotherapy, it is still only the means for goal-oriented behavior modifications, in [Body Psychotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Psychotherapy "Body Psychotherapy") it is not a means only anymore, but its felt sense is a goal of its own. In [cognitive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology "Cognitive psychology"), physical bodies as they occur in [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") are studied in order to understand the [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind"), which may not be a physical body, as in [functionalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind) "Functionalism (philosophy of mind)") schools of thought.

A physical body is an enduring object that exists throughout a particular [trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory") of [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and orientation over a particular duration of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"), and which is located in the [world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_world "Physical world") of [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space") (i.e., as studied by [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics")). This contrasts with [abstract objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_object "Abstract object") such as [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") which do not exist at any particular time or place.

Examples are a [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud "Cloud"), a [human body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body "Human body"), a [banana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana "Banana"), a billiard ball, a table, or a [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton"). This is contrasted with abstract objects such as [mental objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_object "Mental object"), which exist in the [mental world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_world "Mental world"), and [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object"). Other examples that are _not_ physical bodies are [emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotions "Emotions"), the concept of "[justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice "Justice")", a feeling of hatred, or the [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number") "3". In some philosophies, like the [idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism "Idealism") of [George Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley "George Berkeley"), a physical body _is_ a [mental object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_object "Mental object"), but still has extension in the space of a visual field.
