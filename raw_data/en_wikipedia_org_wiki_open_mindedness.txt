For other uses, see Open mind (disambiguation) .

Open-mindedness is receptiveness to new ideas. Open-mindedness relates to the way in which people approach the views and knowledge of others.

[ 1 ] Jason Baehr defines an open-minded person as one who "characteristically moves beyond or temporarily sets aside his own doxastic commitments in order to give a fair and impartial hearing to the intellectual opposition".

[ 2 ] Jack Kwong's definition sees open-mindedness as the "willingness to take a novel viewpoint seriously".

[ 3 ] According to Wayne Riggs, open-mindedness springs from an awareness of the inherent fallibility of one's beliefs; hence, open-minded individuals are more inclined to listen to, and seriously consider, alternative viewpoints.

[ 4 ] There are various scales for the measurement of open-mindedness.

[ 5 ] Harding and Hare argued that schools should emphasize open-mindedness more than relativism in their science instruction , because the scientific community does not embrace a relativistic way of thinking.

[ 6 ] Among other things, the critical attitude [ clarification needed ] involves an open-minded outlook with respect to one's beliefs.

[ 7 ] Open-mindedness is generally considered [ by whom?

] an important personal attribute for effective participation in management teams and other groups .

[ citation needed ] Open-mindedness is usually encouraged [ by whom?

] in group settings, within different cultures and new environments.

[ 8 ] [ need quotation to verify ] According to David DiSalvo, closed-mindedness , or an unwillingness to consider new ideas, can result from the brain's natural dislike for ambiguity. According to this view, the brain has a " search and destroy " relationship with ambiguity and evidence contradictory to people's current beliefs tends to make them uncomfortable by introducing such ambiguity.

[ 9 ] Research confirms that belief-discrepant-closed-minded persons have less tolerance for cognitive inconsistency .

[ 10 ] Virtues contrasting with open-mindedness include steadfastness, loyalty , and fundamentalism .
