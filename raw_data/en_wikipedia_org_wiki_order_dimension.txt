A partial order of dimension 4 (shown as a [Hasse diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram "Hasse diagram")) and four total orderings that form a realizer for this partial order.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the **dimension** of a [partially ordered set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set "Partially ordered set") (poset) is the smallest number of [total orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order "Total order") the [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory) "Intersection (set theory)") of which gives rise to the partial order. This concept is also sometimes called the **order dimension** or the **Dushnik–Miller dimension** of the partial order. [Dushnik & Miller (1941)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_dimension#CITEREFDushnikMiller1941) first studied order dimension; for a more detailed treatment of this subject than provided here, see [Trotter (1992)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_dimension#CITEREFTrotter1992).

The dimension of a poset _P_ is the least integer _t_ for which there exists a family

![Image 2: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}=(<_{1},\dots ,<_{t})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa99a818e5e39a58a02f90c15aae850db346ef26)
of [linear extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_extension "Linear extension") of _P_ so that, for every _x_ and _y_ in _P_, _x_ precedes _y_ in _P_ if and only if it precedes _y_ in all of the linear extensions, if any such _t_ exists. That is,

![Image 3: {\displaystyle P=\bigcap {\mathcal {R}}=\bigcap _{i=1}^{t}<_{i}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e02030ef3bdc0658d1e6b927a7f6f6d236b628b9)
An alternative definition of order dimension is the minimal number of [total orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order "Total order") such that _P_[embeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-embedding "Order-embedding") into their product with [componentwise ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Componentwise_order "Componentwise order") i.e. ![Image 4: {\displaystyle x\leq y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c07a0bc023490be1c08e6c33a9cdc93bec908224) if and only if ![Image 5: {\displaystyle x_{i}\leq y_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad6970aeb2cd95d4354f712786de89a75997c625) for all _i_ ([Hiraguti 1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_dimension#CITEREFHiraguti1955), [Milner & Pouzet 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_dimension#CITEREFMilnerPouzet1990)).

A family ![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}=(<_{1},\dots ,<_{t})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa99a818e5e39a58a02f90c15aae850db346ef26) of linear orders on _X_ is called a **realizer** of a poset _P_ = (_X_, <_P_) if

![Image 7: {\displaystyle <_{P}=\bigcap {\mathcal {R}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4a06965f777e70dc899a8457d360594c2bb44cd3),
which is to say that for any _x_ and _y_ in _X_, _x_<_P_ _y_ precisely when _x_<1 _y_, _x_<2 _y_, ..., and _x_<_t_ _y_. Thus, an equivalent definition of the dimension of a poset _P_ is "the least [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality "Cardinality") of a realizer of _P_."

It can be shown that any nonempty family _R_ of linear extensions is a realizer of a finite partially ordered set _P_ if and only if, for every [critical pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_pair_(order_theory) "Critical pair (order theory)") (_x_,_y_) of _P_, _y_<_i_ _x_ for some order <_i_ in _R_.

Let _n_ be a positive integer, and let _P_ be the partial order on the elements _a i_ and _b i_ (for 1 ≤ _i_ ≤ _n_) in which _a i_ ≤ _b j_ whenever _i_ ≠ _j_, but no other pairs are comparable. In particular, _a i_ and _b i_ are incomparable in _P_; _P_ can be viewed as an oriented form of a [crown graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_graph "Crown graph"). The illustration shows an ordering of this type for _n_ = 4.

Then, for each _i_, any realizer must contain a linear order that begins with all the _a j_ except _a i_ (in some order), then includes _b i_, then _a i_, and ends with all the remaining _b j_. This is so because if there were a realizer that didn't include such an order, then the intersection of that realizer's orders would have _a i_ preceding _b i_, which would contradict the incomparability of _a i_ and _b i_ in _P_. And conversely, any family of linear orders that includes one order of this type for each _i_ has _P_ as its intersection. Thus, _P_ has dimension exactly _n_. In fact, _P_ is known as the _standard example_ of a poset of dimension _n_, and is usually denoted by _S n_.

Order dimension two
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Order_dimension&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Order dimension two")]

The partial orders with order dimension two may be characterized as the partial orders whose [comparability graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparability_graph "Comparability graph") is the [complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(graph_theory) "Complement (graph theory)") of the comparability graph of a different partial order ([Baker, Fishburn & Roberts 1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_dimension#CITEREFBakerFishburnRoberts1971)). That is, _P_ is a partial order with order dimension two if and only if there exists a partial order _Q_ on the same set of elements, such that every pair _x_, _y_ of distinct elements is comparable in exactly one of these two partial orders. If _P_ is realized by two linear extensions, then partial order _Q_ complementary to _P_ may be realized by reversing one of the two linear extensions. Therefore, the comparability graphs of the partial orders of dimension two are exactly the [permutation graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_graph "Permutation graph"), graphs that are both themselves comparability graphs and complementary to comparability graphs.

The partial orders of order dimension two include the [series-parallel partial orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series-parallel_partial_order "Series-parallel partial order") ([Valdes, Tarjan & Lawler 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_dimension#CITEREFValdesTarjanLawler1982)). They are exactly the partial orders whose [Hasse diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram "Hasse diagram") have [dominance drawings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_drawing "Dominance drawing"), which can be obtained by using the positions in the two permutations of a realizer as Cartesian coordinates.

Computational complexity
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Order_dimension&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Computational complexity")]

It is possible to determine in [polynomial time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_time "Polynomial time") whether a given finite partially ordered set has order dimension at most two, for instance, by testing whether the comparability graph of the partial order is a permutation graph. However, for any _k_≥3, it is [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete "NP-complete") to test whether the order dimension is at most _k_ ([Yannakakis 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_dimension#CITEREFYannakakis1982)).

Incidence posets of graphs
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Order_dimension&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Incidence posets of graphs")]

The [incidence poset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_poset "Incidence poset") of any [undirected graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undirected_graph "Undirected graph")_G_ has the vertices and edges of _G_ as its elements; in this poset, _x_ ≤ _y_ if either _x_ = _y_ or _x_ is a vertex, _y_ is an edge, and _x_ is an endpoint of _y_. Certain kinds of graphs may be characterized by the order dimensions of their incidence posets: a graph is a [path graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_graph "Path graph") if and only if the order dimension of its incidence poset is at most two, and according to [Schnyder's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnyder%27s_theorem "Schnyder's theorem") it is a [planar graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph "Planar graph") if and only if the order dimension of its incidence poset is at most three ([Schnyder 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_dimension#CITEREFSchnyder1989)).

For a complete graph on _n_ vertices, the order dimension of the incidence poset is ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \Theta (\log \log n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4285c3027821d0441426e416cbb8605224292bc4) ([Hoşten & Morris 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_dimension#CITEREFHo%C5%9FtenMorris1999)). It follows that all simple _n_-vertex graphs have incidence posets with order dimension ![Image 9: {\displaystyle O(\log \log n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a9f3ded7e013a35c8039ff3276bee6e183d7f1a7).

_k_-dimension and 2-dimension
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Order_dimension&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: k-dimension and 2-dimension")]

A generalization of dimension is the notion of _k_-dimension (written ![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\textrm {dim}}_{k}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6eba3ffb63559a53e2fc2bfeaa4f0961197fc4ee)) which is the minimal number of [chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(order_theory) "Chain (order theory)") of length at most _k_ in whose product the partial order can be embedded. In particular, the 2-dimension of an order can be seen as the size of the smallest set such that the order embeds in the [inclusion order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_order "Inclusion order") on this set.
