A formal ballot decided to award the degree, but Mellor said it was undeserved, explaining: "He is a mediocre, unoriginal philosopher — he is not even interestingly bad."

Real Time 2 is the second version of the book ... It's a treatise on the nature of time ... It presents a vision of the world in metaphysical categories. It tells you about the nature of time, the nature of space, things, objects, events, in a way that is connected, but not the same as the physics of time and space. The relationship between the philosophy of time and the physics of time is much closer than ...  the relationship between the question of change and the question of chemical change, because there's nothing in science that really tells you about what change is as such. But there are physicists who talk about the nature of time and space.  Hugh Mellor is ... is very informed by those views, and knows the physics of space and time very well. He uses his knowledge of those, and his philosophical arguments, to defend a view of time, where time is rather like space. I think the simplest way to put it is to say that there's no such thing in reality as now, there's nothing that marks out in fundamental reality, which time is now, anymore than there's something that marks out in the fundamental reality of space which place is here. Here is just where I am, and now is just the point in time which we're thinking or uttering those words ...
