In this system, the base physical units are chosen so that the total mass, M , the gravitational constant , G , and the virial radius , R , are normalized. The underlying assumption is that the system of N objects (stars) satisfies the virial theorem . The consequence of standard N -body units is that the velocity dispersion of the system, v , is 1 2 2 {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\frac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {2}}} and that the dynamical or crossing time, t , is 2 2 {\displaystyle \scriptstyle 2{\sqrt {2}}} .
The use of standard N -body units was advocated by Michel Hénon in 1971.

[ 1 ] Early adopters of this system of units included H. Cohn in 1979 [ 2 ] and D. Heggie and R. Mathieu in 1986.

[ 3 ] At the conference MODEST14 in 2014, D. Heggie proposed that the community abandon the name " N -body units" and replace it with the name "Hénon units" to commemorate the originator.
