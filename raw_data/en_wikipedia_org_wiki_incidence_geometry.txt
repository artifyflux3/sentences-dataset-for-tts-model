This article is about the field of mathematics. For the class of geometric structures, see [Buekenhout geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buekenhout_geometry "Buekenhout geometry").

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **incidence geometry** is the study of [incidence structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_structure "Incidence structure"). A geometric structure such as the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") is a complicated object that involves concepts such as length, angles, continuity, betweenness, and [incidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(geometry) "Incidence (geometry)"). An _incidence structure_ is what is obtained when all other concepts are removed and all that remains is the data about which points lie on which lines. Even with this severe limitation, theorems can be proved and interesting facts emerge concerning this structure. Such fundamental results remain valid when additional concepts are added to form a richer geometry. It sometimes happens that authors blur the distinction between a study and the objects of that study, so it is not surprising to find that some authors refer to incidence structures as incidence geometries.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-1)

Incidence structures arise naturally and have been studied in various areas of mathematics. Consequently, there are different terminologies to describe these objects. In [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory") they are called [hypergraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph "Hypergraph"), and in [combinatorial design theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_design "Combinatorial design") they are called [block designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_design "Block design"). Besides the difference in terminology, each area approaches the subject differently and is interested in questions about these objects relevant to that discipline. Using geometric language, as is done in incidence geometry, shapes the topics and examples that are normally presented. It is, however, possible to translate the results from one discipline into the terminology of another, but this often leads to awkward and convoluted statements that do not appear to be natural outgrowths of the topics. In the examples selected for this article we use only those with a natural geometric flavor.

A special case that has generated much interest deals with finite sets of points in the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") and what can be said about the number and types of (straight) lines they determine. Some results of this situation can extend to more general settings since only incidence properties are considered.

Incidence structures
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incidence_geometry&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Incidence structures")]

An _incidence structure_(_P_, _L_, I) consists of a set _P_ whose elements are called _points_, a disjoint set _L_ whose elements are called _lines_ and an _incidence relation_ I between them, that is, a subset of _P_ × _L_ whose elements are called _flags_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-2) If (_A_, _l_) is a flag, we say that _A_ is _incident with_ _l_ or that _l_ is incident with _A_ (the terminology is symmetric), and write _A_ I _l_. Intuitively, a point and line are in this relation if and only if the point is _on_ the line. Given a point _B_ and a line _m_ which do not form a flag, that is, the point is not on the line, the pair (_B_, _m_) is called an _anti-flag_.

### Distance in an incidence structure

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incidence_geometry&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Distance in an incidence structure")]

There is no natural concept of distance (a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)")) in an incidence structure. However, a combinatorial metric does exist in the corresponding [incidence graph (Levi graph)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_graph "Levi graph"), namely the length of the shortest [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) "Path (graph theory)") between two vertices in this [bipartite graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph "Bipartite graph"). The distance between two objects of an incidence structure – two points, two lines or a point and a line – can be defined to be the distance between the corresponding vertices in the incidence graph of the incidence structure.

Another way to define a distance again uses a graph-theoretic notion in a related structure, this time the _collinearity graph_ of the incidence structure. The vertices of the collinearity graph are the points of the incidence structure and two points are joined if there exists a line incident with both points. The distance between two points of the incidence structure can then be defined as their distance in the collinearity graph.

When distance is considered in an incidence structure, it is necessary to mention how it is being defined.

Partial linear spaces
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incidence_geometry&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Partial linear spaces")]

Incidence structures that are most studied are those that satisfy some additional properties (axioms), such as [projective planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"), [affine planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane_(incidence_geometry) "Affine plane (incidence geometry)"), [generalized polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_polygon "Generalized polygon"), [partial geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_geometry "Partial geometry") and [near polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_polygon "Near polygon"). Very general incidence structures can be obtained by imposing "mild" conditions, such as:

A [partial linear space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_linear_space "Partial linear space") is an incidence structure for which the following axioms are true:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-3)

*   Every pair of distinct points determines at most one line.
*   Every line contains at least two distinct points.

In a partial linear space it is also true that every pair of distinct lines meet in at most one point. This statement does not have to be assumed as it is readily proved from axiom one above.

Further constraints are provided by the regularity conditions:

**RLk**: Each line is incident with the same number of points. If finite this number is often denoted by _k_.

**RPr**: Each point is incident with the same number of lines. If finite this number is often denoted by _r_.

The second axiom of a partial linear space implies that _k_> 1. Neither regularity condition implies the other, so it has to be assumed that _r_> 1.

A finite partial linear space satisfying both regularity conditions with _k_, _r_> 1 is called a _tactical configuration_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-4) Some authors refer to these simply as _[configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration\_(geometry) "Configuration (geometry)")_,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-5) or _projective configurations_.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-6) If a tactical configuration has _n_ points and _m_ lines, then, by double counting the flags, the relationship _nr_ = _mk_ is established. A common notation refers to (_n_ _r_, _m_ _k_)-_configurations_. In the special case where _n_ = _m_ (and hence, _r_ = _k_) the notation (_n_ _k_, _n_ _k_) is often simply written as (_n_ _k_).

Simplest non-trivial linear space

A [_linear space_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_space_(geometry) "Linear space (geometry)") is a partial linear space such that:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-7)

*   Every pair of distinct points determines exactly one line.

Some authors add a "non-degeneracy" (or "non-triviality") axiom to the definition of a (partial) linear space, such as:

*   There exist at least two distinct lines.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-8)

This is used to rule out some very small examples (mainly when the sets _P_ or _L_ have fewer than two elements) that would normally be exceptions to general statements made about the incidence structures. An alternative to adding the axiom is to refer to incidence structures that do not satisfy the axiom as being _trivial_ and those that do as _non-trivial_.

Each non-trivial linear space contains at least three points and three lines, so the simplest non-trivial linear space that can exist is a triangle.

A linear space having at least three points on every line is a [Sylvester–Gallai design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester%E2%80%93Gallai_configuration "Sylvester–Gallai configuration").

Fundamental geometric examples
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incidence_geometry&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Fundamental geometric examples")]

Some of the basic concepts and terminology arises from geometric examples, particularly [projective planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane") and [affine planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane_(incidence_geometry) "Affine plane (incidence geometry)").

A _projective plane_ is a linear space in which:

*   Every pair of distinct lines meet in exactly one point,

and that satisfies the non-degeneracy condition:

*   There exist four points, no three of which are [collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear "Collinear").

There is a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") between _P_ and _L_ in a projective plane. If _P_ is a finite set, the projective plane is referred to as a _finite_ projective plane. The **order** of a finite projective plane is _n_ = _k_ – 1, that is, one less than the number of points on a line. All known projective planes have orders that are [prime powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_power "Prime power"). A projective plane of order _n_ is an ((_n_ 2 + _n_ + 1)_n_ + 1) configuration.

The smallest projective plane has order two and is known as the _Fano plane_.

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Fano_plane.svg/250px-Fano_plane.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fano_plane.svg)

Projective plane of order 2 

 the Fano plane

This famous incidence geometry was developed by the Italian mathematician [Gino Fano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gino_Fano "Gino Fano"). In his work[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-9) on proving the independence of the set of axioms for [projective _n_-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space") that he developed,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-10) he produced a finite three-dimensional space with 15 points, 35 lines and 15 planes, in which each line had only three points on it.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-11) The planes in this space consisted of seven points and seven lines and are now known as [Fano planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane "Fano plane").

The Fano plane cannot be represented in the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") using only points and straight line segments (i.e., it is not realizable). This is a consequence of the [Sylvester–Gallai theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester%E2%80%93Gallai_theorem "Sylvester–Gallai theorem"), according to which every realizable incidence geometry must include an _ordinary line_, a line containing only two points. The Fano plane has no such line (that is, it is a [Sylvester–Gallai configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester%E2%80%93Gallai_configuration "Sylvester–Gallai configuration")), so it is not realizable.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAignerZiegler2010-12)

A [complete quadrangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_quadrangle "Complete quadrangle") consists of four points, no three of which are collinear. In the Fano plane, the three points not on a complete quadrangle are the diagonal points of that quadrangle and are collinear. This contradicts the _Fano axiom_, often used as an axiom for the Euclidean plane, which states that the three diagonal points of a complete quadrangle are never collinear.

An _affine plane_ is a linear space satisfying:

*   For any point _A_ and line _l_ not incident with it (an **anti-flag**) there is exactly one line _m_ incident with _A_ (that is, _A_ I _m_), that does not meet _l_ (known as [Playfair's axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom "Playfair's axiom")),

and satisfying the non-degeneracy condition:

*   There exists a triangle, i.e. three non-collinear points.

The lines _l_ and _m_ in the statement of Playfair's axiom are said to be _parallel_. Every affine plane can be uniquely extended to a projective plane. The _order_ of a finite affine plane is _k_, the number of points on a line. An affine plane of order _n_ is an ((_n_ 2)_n_ + 1, (_n_ 2 + _n_)_n_) configuration.

Affine plane of order 3 

 (Hesse configuration)

#### Hesse configuration

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incidence_geometry&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Hesse configuration")]

The affine plane of order three is a (9 4, 12 3) configuration. When embedded in some ambient space it is called the **[Hesse configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesse_configuration "Hesse configuration")**. It is not realizable in the Euclidean plane but is realizable in the [complex projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_projective_plane "Complex projective plane") as the nine [inflection points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_point "Inflection point") of an [elliptic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve "Elliptic curve") with the 12 lines incident with triples of these.

The 12 lines can be partitioned into four classes of three lines apiece where, in each class the lines are mutually disjoint. These classes are called _parallel classes_ of lines. Adding four new points, each being added to all the lines of a single parallel class (so all of these lines now intersect), and one new line containing just these four new points produces the projective plane of order three, a (13 4) configuration. Conversely, starting with the projective plane of order three (it is unique) and removing any single line and all the points on that line produces this affine plane of order three (it is also unique).

Removing one point and the four lines that pass through that point (but not the other points on them) produces the (8 3)[Möbius–Kantor configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobius-Kantor_configuration "Mobius-Kantor configuration").

Partial geometry pg(2,2,1)

Given an integer _α_ ≥ 1, a tactical configuration satisfying:

*   For every anti-flag (_B_, _m_) there are _α_ flags (_A_, _l_) such that _B_ I _l_ and _A_ I _m_,

is called a _partial geometry_. If there are _s_ + 1 points on a line and _t_ + 1 lines through a point, the notation for a partial geometry is pg(_s_, _t_, _α_).

If _α_ = 1 these partial geometries are [generalized quadrangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_quadrangle "Generalized quadrangle").

If _α_ = _s_ + 1 these are called [Steiner systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_system "Steiner system").

Generalized polygons
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incidence_geometry&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Generalized polygons")]

For _n_> 2,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-13) a **generalized _n_-gon** is a partial linear space whose incidence graph Γ has the property:

*   The [girth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girth_(graph_theory) "Girth (graph theory)") of Γ (length of the shortest [cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory) "Cycle (graph theory)")) is twice the [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter_(graph_theory) "Diameter (graph theory)") of Γ (the largest distance between two vertices, _n_ in this case).

A _generalized 2-gon_ is an incidence structure, which is not a partial linear space, consisting of at least two points and two lines with every point being incident with every line. The incidence graph of a generalized 2-gon is a complete bipartite graph.

A generalized _n_-gon contains no [ordinary _m_-gon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon") for 2 ≤ _m_<_n_ and for every pair of objects (two points, two lines or a point and a line) there is an ordinary _n_-gon that contains them both.

Generalized 3-gons are projective planes. Generalized 4-gons are called [generalized quadrangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_quadrangle "Generalized quadrangle"). By the Feit-Higman theorem the only finite generalized _n_-gons with at least three points per line and three lines per point have _n_ = 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8.

For a non-negative integer _d_ a **near 2 _d_-gon** is an incidence structure such that:

*   The maximum distance (as measured in the collinearity graph) between two points is _d_, and
*   For every point _X_ and line _l_ there is a unique point on _l_ that is closest to _X_.

A near 0-gon is a point, while a near 2-gon is a line. The collinearity graph of a near 2-gon is a [complete graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph "Complete graph"). A near 4-gon is a generalized quadrangle (possibly degenerate). Every finite generalized polygon except the projective planes is a near polygon. Any connected bipartite graph is a near polygon and any near polygon with precisely two points per line is a connected bipartite graph. Also, all [dual polar spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_space "Polar space") are near polygons.

Many near polygons are related to [finite simple groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_simple_groups "Finite simple groups") like the [Mathieu groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_group "Mathieu group") and the [Janko group J2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janko_group_J2 "Janko group J2"). Moreover, the generalized 2 _d_-gons, which are related to [Groups of Lie type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groups_of_Lie_type "Groups of Lie type"), are special cases of near 2 _d_-gons.

An abstract Möbius plane (or inversive plane) is an incidence structure where, to avoid possible confusion with the terminology of the classical case, the lines are referred to as _cycles_ or _blocks_.

Specifically, a Möbius plane is an incidence structure of points and cycles such that:

*   Every triple of distinct points is incident with precisely one cycle.
*   For any flag (_P_, _z_) and any point _Q_ not incident with _z_ there is a unique cycle _z_∗ with _P_ I _z_∗, _Q_ I _z_∗ and _z_ ∩ _z_∗ = {_P_}. (The cycles are said to _touch_ at _P_.)
*   Every cycle has at least three points and there exists at least one cycle.

The incidence structure obtained at any point _P_ of a Möbius plane by taking as points all the points other than _P_ and as lines only those cycles that contain _P_ (with _P_ removed), is an affine plane. This structure is called the _residual_ at _P_ in design theory.

A finite Möbius plane of _order_ _m_ is a tactical configuration with _k_ = _m_ + 1 points per cycle that is a [3-design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_design "Block design"), specifically a 3-(_m_ 2 + 1, _m_ + 1, 1) block design.

Incidence theorems in the Euclidean plane
-----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incidence_geometry&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Incidence theorems in the Euclidean plane")]

### The Sylvester-Gallai theorem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incidence_geometry&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: The Sylvester-Gallai theorem")]

A question raised by [J.J. Sylvester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.J._Sylvester "J.J. Sylvester") in 1893 and finally settled by [Tibor Gallai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibor_Gallai "Tibor Gallai") concerned incidences of a finite set of points in the Euclidean plane.

**Theorem (Sylvester-Gallai)**: A finite set of points in the Euclidean plane is either [collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear "Collinear") or there exists a line incident with exactly two of the points.

A line containing exactly two of the points is called an _ordinary line_ in this context. Sylvester was probably led to the question while pondering about the embeddability of the Hesse configuration.

### The de Bruijn–Erdős theorem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incidence_geometry&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: The de Bruijn–Erdős theorem")]

A related result is the [de Bruijn–Erdős theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn%E2%80%93Erd%C5%91s_theorem_(incidence_geometry) "De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (incidence geometry)"). [Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaas_Govert_de_Bruijn "Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn") and [Paul Erdős](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s "Paul Erdős") proved the result in the more general setting of projective planes, but it still holds in the Euclidean plane. The theorem is:[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-14)

In a [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"), every non-collinear set of _n_ points determines at least _n_ distinct lines.
As the authors pointed out, since their proof was combinatorial, the result holds in a larger setting, in fact in any incidence geometry in which there is a unique line through every pair of distinct points. They also mention that the Euclidean plane version can be proved from the Sylvester-Gallai theorem using [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction").

### The Szemerédi–Trotter theorem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incidence_geometry&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: The Szemerédi–Trotter theorem")]

A bound on the number of flags determined by a finite set of points and the lines they determine is given by:

**Theorem (Szemerédi–Trotter)**: given _n_ points and _m_ lines in the plane, the number of flags (incident point-line pairs) is:

![Image 5: {\displaystyle O\left(n^{2/3}m^{2/3}+n+m\right),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fefded921ca2654436f412a23ace0741e771b128)
and this bound cannot be improved, except in terms of the implicit constants.

This result can be used to prove Beck's theorem.

A similar bound for the number of incidences is conjectured for point-circle incidences, but only weaker upper bounds are known.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry#cite_note-15)

Beck's theorem says that finite collections of points in the plane fall into one of two extremes; one where a large fraction of points lie on a single line, and one where a large number of lines are needed to connect all the points.

The theorem asserts the existence of positive constants _C_, _K_ such that given any _n_ points in the plane, at least one of the following statements is true:

1.   There is a line that contains at least ⁠_n_/_C_⁠ of the points.
2.   There exist at least ⁠_n_ 2/_K_⁠ lines, each of which contains at least two of the points.

In Beck's original argument, _C_ is 100 and _K_ is an unspecified constant; it is not known what the optimal values of _C_ and _K_ are.
