( November 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In signal processing , noise is a general term for unwanted (and, in general, unknown) modifications that a signal may suffer during capture, storage, transmission, processing, or conversion.

[ 1 ] Sometimes the word is also used to mean signals that are random ( unpredictable ) and carry no useful information ; even if they are not interfering with other signals or may have been introduced intentionally, as in comfort noise .

Noise reduction , the recovery of the original signal from the noise-corrupted one, is a very common goal in the design of signal processing systems, especially filters .  The mathematical limits for noise removal are set by information theory .

Types of noise [ edit ] Signal processing noise can be classified by its statistical properties (sometimes called the " color " of the noise) and by how it modifies the intended signal: Additive noise , gets added to the intended signal White noise Additive white Gaussian noise Black noise Gaussian noise Pink noise or flicker noise , with 1/ f power spectrum Brownian noise , with 1/ f 2 power spectrum Contaminated Gaussian noise, whose PDF is a linear mixture of Gaussian PDFs Power-law noise Cauchy noise Multiplicative noise , multiplies or modulates the intended signal Quantization error , due to conversion from continuous to discrete values Poisson noise , typical of signals that are rates of discrete events Shot noise , e.g. caused by static electricity discharge Transient noise , a short pulse followed by decaying oscillations Burst noise , powerful but only during short intervals Phase noise , random time shifts in a signal Noise in specific kinds of signals [ edit ] Noise may arise in signals of interest to various scientific and technical fields, often with specific features: Noise (audio) , such as "hiss" or "hum", in audio signals Background noise , due to spurious sounds during signal capture Comfort noise , added to voice communications to fill silent gaps Electromagnetically induced noise , audible noise due to electromagnetic vibrations in systems involving electromagnetic fields Noise (video) , such as "snow" Noise (radio) , such as "static", in radio transmissions Image noise , affects images, usually digital ones Salt and pepper noise or spike noise, scattered very dark or very light pixels Fixed pattern noise , tied to pixel sensors Shadow noise , made visible by increasing brightness or contrast Speckle noise , typical of radar imaging and interferograms Film grain in analog photography Compression artifacts or "mosquito noise" around edges in JPEG and other formats Noise (electronics) in electrical signals Johnson–Nyquist noise , in semiconductors Quantum noise Quantum 1/f noise , a disputed theory about quantum systems Generation-recombination noise , in semiconductor devices Oscillator phase noise , random fluctuations of the phase of an oscillator Barkhausen effect or Barkhausen noise, in the strength of a ferromagnet Spectral splatter or switch noise, caused by on/off transmitter switching Ground noise , appearing at the ground terminal of audio equipment Synaptic noise , observed in neuroscience Neuronal noise , observed in neuroscience Transcriptional noise in the transcription of genes to proteins Cosmic noise , in radioastronomy Phonon noise in materials science Internet background noise , packets sent to unassigned or inactive IP addresses Fano noise , in particle detectors Mode partition noise in optical cables Seismic noise , spurious ground vibrations in seismology Cosmic microwave background , microwave noise left over from the Big Bang Measures of noise in signals [ edit ] A long list of noise measures has been defined to measure noise in signal processing: in absolute terms, relative to some standard noise level, or relative to the desired signal level.  They include: Dynamic range , often defined by inherent noise level Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ratio of noise power to signal power Peak signal-to-noise ratio , maximum SNR in a system Signal to noise ratio (imaging) , for images Carrier-to-noise ratio , the signal-to-noise ratio of a modulated signal Noise power Noise figure Noise-equivalent flux density , a measure of noise in astronomy Noise floor Noise margin , by how much a signal exceeds the noise level Reference noise , a reference level for electronic noise Noise spectral density , noise power per unit of bandwidth Noise temperature Effective input noise temperature Noise-equivalent power , a measure of sensitivity for photodetectors Relative intensity noise , in a laser beam Antenna noise temperature , measure of noise in telecommunications antenna Received noise power , noise at a telecommunications receiver Circuit noise level , ratio of circuit noise to some reference level Channel noise level , some measure of noise in a communication channel Noise-equivalent target, intensity of a target when the signal-to-noise level is 1 [ 2 ] Equivalent noise resistance , a measure of noise based on an equivalent resistor Carrier-to-receiver noise density , ratio of received carrier power to receiver noise Carrier-to-noise-density ratio , Spectral signal-to-noise ratio Antenna gain-to-noise temperature , a measure of antenna performance Contrast-to-noise ratio , a measure of image quality Noise print , statistical signature of ambient noise for its suppression Equivalent pulse code modulation noise , measure of noise by comparing to PCM quantization noise Technology for noise in signals [ edit ] Almost every technique and device for signal processing has some connection to noise.  Some random examples are: Noise shaping Antenna analyzer or noise bridge, used to measure the efficiency of antennas Noise gate Noise generator , a circuit that produces a random electrical signal Radio noise source used to calibrate radiotelescopes Friis formulas for noise in telecommunications Noise-domain reflectometry , uses existing signals to find cable faults Noise-immune cavity-enhanced optical heterodyne molecular spectroscopy See also [ edit ] Anti-information Noise (electronics) Signal-to-noise statistic , a mathematical formula to measure the difference of two values relative to their standard deviations References [ edit ] ^ Vyacheslav Tuzlukov (2010), Signal Processing Noise , Electrical Engineering and Applied Signal Processing Series, CRC Press. 688 pages.
