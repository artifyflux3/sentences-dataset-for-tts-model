A **constellation** is an area on the [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere") in which a group of visible [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") forms [a perceived pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy) "Asterism (astronomy)") or outline, typically representing an animal, mythological subject, or inanimate object.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-oxforddic2-1)

The first constellations were likely defined in [prehistory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory "Prehistory"). People used them to relate stories of their beliefs, experiences, [creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth "Creation myth"), and [mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology "Mythology"). Different cultures and countries invented their own constellations, some of which lasted into the early 20th century before today's constellations were internationally recognized. The recognition of constellations has changed significantly over time. Many changed in size or shape. Some became popular, only to drop into obscurity. Some were limited to a single culture or nation. Naming constellations also helped astronomers and navigators identify stars more easily.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-britannica1-2)

Twelve (or thirteen) ancient constellations belong to the [zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac "Zodiac") (straddling the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic"), which the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), and [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") all traverse). The origins of the zodiac remain historically uncertain; its [astrological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology") divisions became prominent c. 400 BC in [Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy "Babylonian astronomy") or [Chaldean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaldea "Chaldea") astronomy.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-3) Constellations appear in Western culture via Greece and are mentioned in the works of [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod"), [Eudoxus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus "Eudoxus of Cnidus") and [Aratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aratus "Aratus"). The traditional 48 constellations, consisting of the zodiac and 36 more (now 38, following the division of [Argo Navis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argo_Navis "Argo Navis") into three constellations) are listed by [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy"), a Greco-Roman astronomer from [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria"), Egypt, in his _[Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest")_. The formation of constellations was the subject of extensive [mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology "Mythology"), most notably in the _[Metamorphoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses\_(Ovid) "Metamorphoses (Ovid)")_ of the Latin poet [Ovid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid "Ovid"). Constellations in the far [southern sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_celestial_hemisphere "Southern celestial hemisphere") were added from the 15th century until the mid-18th century when European explorers began traveling to the [Southern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere "Southern Hemisphere"). Due to Roman and European transmission, each constellation has a Latin name.

In 1922, the [International Astronomical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union "International Astronomical Union") (IAU) formally accepted the modern list of [88 constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_designated_constellations "IAU designated constellations"), and in 1928 adopted official constellation boundaries that together cover the entire celestial sphere.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-IAU1928-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-auto-5) Any given point in a [celestial coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_coordinate_system "Celestial coordinate system") lies in one of the modern constellations. Some [astronomical naming systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_designation "Stellar designation") include the constellation where a given celestial object is found to convey its approximate location in the sky. The [Flamsteed designation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamsteed_designation "Flamsteed designation") of a star, for example, consists of a number and the genitive form of the constellation's name.

Other star patterns or groups called [asterisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy) "Asterism (astronomy)") are not constellations under the formal definition, but are also used by observers to navigate the night sky. Asterisms may be several stars within a constellation, or they may share stars with more than one constellation. Examples of asterisms include the teapot within the constellation [Sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation) "Sagittarius (constellation)"), or the [Big Dipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper "Big Dipper") in the constellation of [Ursa Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major_(constellation) "Ursa Major (constellation)").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-DOCdb2018-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-SoftBisque2018-7)

The word _constellation_ comes from the [Late Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Latin "Late Latin") term _cōnstellātiō_, which can be translated as "set of stars"; it came into use in [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English "Middle English") during the 14th century.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-8) The [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") word for constellation is [ἄστρον](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%84%CF%83%CF%84%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD "wikt:ἄστρον") (_astron_). These terms historically referred to any recognisable pattern of stars whose appearance was associated with mythological characters or creatures, earthbound animals, or objects.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-oxforddic2-1) Over time, among European astronomers, the constellations became clearly defined and widely recognised. In the 20th century, the [International Astronomical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union "International Astronomical Union") (IAU) recognized [88 constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_designated_constellations "IAU designated constellations").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-oxforddicastro-9)

A constellation or star that never sets below the [horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon "Horizon") when viewed from a particular [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") on Earth is termed [circumpolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumpolar_star "Circumpolar star"). From the [North Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole "North Pole") or [South Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole "South Pole"), all constellations south or north of the [celestial equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator "Celestial equator") are [circumpolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumpolar_constellation "Circumpolar constellation"). Depending on the definition, equatorial constellations may include those that lie between declinations 45° north and 45° south,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-harbord_goodwin1897-10) or those that pass through the declination range of the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic") (or [zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac "Zodiac")) ranging between [23.5°north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer "Tropic of Cancer") and [23.5°south](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Capricorn "Tropic of Capricorn").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Norton14th-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-steele1884-12)

Stars in constellations can appear near each other in the sky, but they usually lie at a variety of distances away from the Earth. Since each star has its own independent motion, all constellations will change slowly over time. After tens to hundreds of thousands of years, familiar outlines will become unrecognizable.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-marc-13) Astronomers can predict the past or future constellation outlines by measuring [common proper motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_proper_motion "Common proper motion") of individual stars[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Koupelis2007-14) by accurate [astrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrometry "Astrometry")[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-c1-16) and their [radial velocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_velocity "Radial velocity") by [astronomical spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy "Astronomical spectroscopy").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-IAUInfBull91_c1-17)

The 88 constellations recognized by the IAU as well as those by cultures throughout history are imagined figures and shapes derived from the patterns of stars in the observable sky. Many officially recognized constellations are based on the imaginations of ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean mythologies.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-19) Some of these stories seem to relate to the appearance of the constellations, e.g. the assassination of [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(mythology) "Orion (mythology)") by Scorpius, their constellations appearing at opposite times of year.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-20)

[![Image 5: Spanish-language star chart with dotted line indicating zodiac (ecliptic)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Celestial_chart_%28asterisms_and_areas%29_%28esp%29.png/960px-Celestial_chart_%28asterisms_and_areas%29_%28esp%29.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Celestial_chart_(asterisms_and_areas)_(esp).png "Spanish-language star chart with dotted line indicating zodiac (ecliptic)")

Spanish-language [star chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_chart "Star chart") with dotted line indicating zodiac (ecliptic)

Constellation positions change throughout the year due to [night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night "Night") on Earth occurring at gradually different portions of [its orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit "Earth's orbit") around the Sun. As [Earth rotates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") toward the east, the [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere") appears to rotate west, with stars circling counterclockwise around the northern [pole star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_star "Pole star") and clockwise around the southern pole star.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-21)

Because of Earth's 23.5° [axial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt "Axial tilt"), the zodiac is distributed equally across hemispheres (along the ecliptic), approximating a [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle"). Zodiacal constellations of the northern sky are [Pisces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_(constellation) "Pisces (constellation)"), [Aries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aries_(constellation) "Aries (constellation)"), [Taurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(constellation) "Taurus (constellation)"), [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation) "Gemini (constellation)"), [Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_(constellation) "Cancer (constellation)"), and [Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(constellation) "Leo (constellation)"). In the southern sky are [Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(constellation) "Virgo (constellation)"), [Libra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(constellation) "Libra (constellation)"), [Scorpius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpius "Scorpius"), [Sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation) "Sagittarius (constellation)"), [Capricornus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricornus "Capricornus"), and [Aquarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(constellation) "Aquarius (constellation)").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-:0-22)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-23) The zodiac appears directly overhead from latitudes of 23.5°north to 23.5°south, depending on the time of year. In summer, the ecliptic appears higher up in the daytime and lower at night, while in winter the reverse is true, for both hemispheres.

Due to the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System")'s 60° tilt, the [galactic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_plane "Galactic plane") of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") is inclined 60° from the ecliptic,[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-24) between Taurus and Gemini (north) and Scorpius and Sagittarius (south and near which the [Galactic Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center "Galactic Center") can be found).[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-:0-22) The galaxy appears to pass through [Aquila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_(constellation) "Aquila (constellation)") (near the celestial equator) and northern constellations [Cygnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation) "Cygnus (constellation)"), [Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation) "Cassiopeia (constellation)"), [Perseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_(constellation) "Perseus (constellation)"), [Auriga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auriga_(constellation) "Auriga (constellation)"), and [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation) "Orion (constellation)") (near [Betelgeuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse "Betelgeuse")), as well as [Monoceros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoceros "Monoceros") (near the celestial equator), and southern constellations [Puppis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppis "Puppis"), [Vela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_(constellation) "Vela (constellation)"), [Carina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_(constellation) "Carina (constellation)"), [Crux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux "Crux"), [Centaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus "Centaurus"), [Triangulum Australe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulum_Australe "Triangulum Australe"), and [Ara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_(constellation) "Ara (constellation)").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-:0-22)

### Northern hemisphere

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constellation&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Northern hemisphere")]

[Polaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris "Polaris"), being the North Star, is the approximate center of the northern celestial hemisphere. It is part of [Ursa Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Minor "Ursa Minor"), constituting the end of the Little Dipper's handle.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-:0-22)

From latitudes of around 35° north, in January, [Ursa Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major "Ursa Major") (containing the [Big Dipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper "Big Dipper")) appears to the northeast, while Cassiopeia is the northwest. To the west are Pisces (above the horizon) and Aries. To the southwest [Cetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus "Cetus") is near the horizon. Up high and to the south are Orion and Taurus. To the southeast above the horizon is [Canis Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major "Canis Major"). Appearing above and to the east of Orion is [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation) "Gemini (constellation)"): also in the east (and progressively closer to the horizon) are Cancer and Leo. In addition to Taurus, Perseus and Auriga appear overhead.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-:0-22)

From the same latitude, in July, Cassiopeia (low in the sky) and [Cepheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_(constellation) "Cepheus (constellation)") appear to the northeast. Ursa Major is now in the northwest. [Boötes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C3%B6tes "Boötes") is high up in the west. Virgo is to the west, with Libra southwest and Scorpius south. Sagittarius and Capricorn are southeast. Cygnus (containing the [Northern Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cross_(asterism) "Northern Cross (asterism)")) is to the east. [Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(constellation) "Hercules (constellation)") is high in the sky along with [Corona Borealis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_Borealis "Corona Borealis").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-:0-22)

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Pole01-eng.svg/330px-Pole01-eng.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pole01-eng.svg)

The Southern Cross in [Crux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux "Crux") and the 'Southern Pointers' of [Centaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus "Centaurus") can be used to find the southern pole star, [Sigma Octantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Octantis "Sigma Octantis").

### Southern hemisphere

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constellation&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Southern hemisphere")]

January constellations include [Pictor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictor "Pictor") and [Reticulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulum "Reticulum") (near Hydrus and Mensa, respectively).[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-25)

In July, Ara (adjacent to Triangulum Australe) and Scorpius can be seen.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-26)

Constellations near the pole star include [Chamaeleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamaeleon "Chamaeleon"), [Apus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apus "Apus") and Triangulum Australe (near Centaurus), [Pavo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavo_(constellation) "Pavo (constellation)"), [Hydrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrus "Hydrus"), and [Mensa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensa_(constellation) "Mensa (constellation)").

[Sigma Octantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Octantis "Sigma Octantis") is the closest star approximating a southern pole star, but is faint in the night sky. Thus, the pole can be triangulated using the constellation Crux as well as the stars [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri "Alpha Centauri") and [Beta Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Centauri "Beta Centauri") (about 30° counterclockwise from Crux) of the constellation Centaurus (arching over Crux).[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-:0-22)

### Lascaux Caves, southern France

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constellation&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Lascaux Caves, southern France")]

It has been suggested that the 17,000-year-old [cave paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting "Cave painting") in [Lascaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux "Lascaux"), southern France, depict star constellations such as Taurus, Orion's Belt, and the Pleiades. However, this view is not generally accepted among scientists.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-27)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-28)

Inscribed stones and [clay writing tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_tablet "Clay tablet") from [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia") (in modern [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq")) dating to 3000 BC provide the earliest generally accepted evidence for humankind's identification of constellations.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Rogers-29) It seems that the bulk of the Mesopotamian constellations were created within a relatively short interval from around 1300 to 1000 BC. Mesopotamian constellations appeared later in many of the classical Greek constellations.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Greek_Constellations_2007-30)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Babylonian_tablet_recording_Halley%27s_comet.jpg/250px-Babylonian_tablet_recording_Halley%27s_comet.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_tablet_recording_Halley%27s_comet.jpg)

 Babylonian tablet recording [Halley's Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet "Halley's Comet") in 164 BC

The oldest [Babylonian catalogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_star_catalogues "Babylonian star catalogues") of stars and constellations date back to the beginning of the [Middle Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Bronze_Age "Middle Bronze Age"), most notably the _Three Stars Each_ texts and the _[MUL.APIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUL.APIN "MUL.APIN")_, an expanded and revised version based on more accurate observation from around 1000 BC. However, the numerous [Sumerian names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language "Sumerian language") in these catalogues suggest that they built on older, but otherwise unattested, [Sumerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer "Sumer") traditions of the [Early Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Bronze_Age "Early Bronze Age").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-31)

The classical Zodiac is a revision of [Neo-Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Babylonian "Neo-Babylonian") constellations from the 6th century BC. The Greeks adopted the Babylonian constellations in the 4th century BC. Twenty Ptolemaic constellations are from the Ancient Near East. Another ten have the same stars but different names.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Greek_Constellations_2007-30)

Biblical scholar [E. W. Bullinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._W._Bullinger "E. W. Bullinger") interpreted some of the creatures mentioned in the books of [Ezekiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Ezekiel "Book of Ezekiel") and [Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation") as the middle signs of the four-quarters of the Zodiac,[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-32)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-33) with the Lion as [Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(astrology) "Leo (astrology)"), the Bull as [Taurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(astrology) "Taurus (astrology)"), the Man representing [Aquarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(astrology) "Aquarius (astrology)"), and the Eagle standing in for [Scorpio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpio_(astrology) "Scorpio (astrology)").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Allen1899-34) The biblical [Book of Job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job "Book of Job") also makes reference to a number of constellations, including עיש _‘Ayish_ "bier", כסיל _chesil_ "fool" and כימה _chimah_ "heap" (Job 9:9, 38:31–32), rendered as "Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades" by the [KJV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KJV "KJV"), but _‘Ayish_ "the bier" actually corresponding to Ursa Major.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-35) The term _[Mazzaroth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazzaroth "Mazzaroth")_ מַזָּרוֹת, translated as _a garland of crowns_, is a _[hapax legomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax\_legomenon "Hapax legomenon")_ in Job 38:32, and it might refer to the zodiacal constellations.

There is only limited information on ancient Greek constellations, with some fragmentary evidence being found in the _[Works and Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works\_and\_Days "Works and Days")_ of the Greek poet [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod"), who mentioned the "heavenly bodies".[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-36) Greek astronomy essentially adopted the older Babylonian system in the [Hellenistic era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_era "Hellenistic era"),[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] first introduced to Greece by [Eudoxus of Cnidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus "Eudoxus of Cnidus") in the 4th century BC. The original work of Eudoxus is lost, but it survives as a versification by [Aratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aratus "Aratus"), dating to the 3rd century BC. The most complete existing works dealing with the mythical origins of the constellations are by the Hellenistic writer termed [pseudo-Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Eratosthenes "Pseudo-Eratosthenes") and an early Roman writer styled pseudo-[Hyginus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_astronomia "De astronomia"). The basis of Western astronomy as taught during [Late Antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Antiquity "Late Antiquity") and until the [Early Modern period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_period "Early Modern period") is the _[Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest")_ by [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy"), written in the 2nd century.

In the [Ptolemaic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom "Ptolemaic Kingdom"), [native Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_astronomy "Egyptian astronomy") tradition of anthropomorphic figures represented the planets, stars, and various constellations.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Marshall_Clagett_1995,_p._111-37) Some of these were combined with Greek and Babylonian astronomical systems culminating in the [Zodiac of Dendera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendera_zodiac "Dendera zodiac"), the oldest known depiction of the zodiac showing all the now familiar constellations, along with some original Egyptian constellations, [decans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decans "Decans"), and [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planets "Planets").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Rogers-29)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-38) It remains unclear when this occurred, but most were placed during the Roman period between 2nd to 4th centuries AD. Ptolemy's _Almagest_ remained the standard definition of constellations in the medieval period both in Europe and in [Islamic astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world "Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world").

[Ancient China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China#Ancient_China "History of China") had a long tradition of observing celestial phenomena.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-39) Nonspecific [Chinese star names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_star_names "Chinese star names"), later categorized in the [twenty-eight mansions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-eight_mansions "Twenty-eight mansions"), have been found on [oracle bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bones "Oracle bones") from [Anyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyang "Anyang"), dating back to the middle [Shang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty "Shang dynasty"). These [constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_constellations "Chinese constellations") are some of the most important observations of Chinese sky, attested from the 5th century BC. The Chinese system developed independently from the Greco-Roman system, although there may have been earlier mutual influence, suggested by parallels to ancient [Babylonian astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy "Babylonian astronomy").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-sun-40)

Three schools of classical [Chinese astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_astronomy "Chinese astronomy") in the [Han period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_period "Han period") are attributed to astronomers of the earlier [Warring States period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period "Warring States period"). The constellations of the three schools were conflated into a single system by [Chen Zhuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Zhuo "Chen Zhuo"), an astronomer of the 3rd century ([Three Kingdoms period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms_period "Three Kingdoms period")). Chen Zhuo's work has been lost, but information on his system of constellations survives in [Tang period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_period "Tang period") records, notably by [Qutan Xida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutan_Xida "Qutan Xida"). The oldest extant Chinese star chart dates to that period and was preserved as part of the [Dunhuang Manuscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunhuang_Manuscripts "Dunhuang Manuscripts"). Native Chinese astronomy flourished during the [Song dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty "Song dynasty"), and during the [Yuan dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty "Yuan dynasty") became increasingly influenced by [medieval Islamic astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Islamic_astronomy "Medieval Islamic astronomy") (see [Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Astrology_of_the_Kaiyuan_Era "Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era")).[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-sun-40) As maps were prepared during this period on more scientific lines, they were considered as more reliable.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Selin2008-41)

A well-known map from the Song period is the [Suzhou Astronomical Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_star_maps "Chinese star maps"), which was prepared with carvings of stars on the [planisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planisphere "Planisphere") of the Chinese sky on a stone plate; it is done accurately based on observations, and it shows the [1054 supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1054 "SN 1054") in Taurus.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Selin2008-41)

Influenced by European astronomy during the late [Ming dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty "Ming dynasty"), charts depicted more stars but retained the traditional constellations. Newly observed stars were incorporated as supplementary to old constellations in the southern sky, which did not depict the traditional stars recorded by ancient Chinese astronomers. Further improvements were made during the later part of the Ming dynasty by [Xu Guangqi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Guangqi "Xu Guangqi") and [Johann Adam Schall von Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Adam_Schall_von_Bell "Johann Adam Schall von Bell"), the German Jesuit and was recorded in [Chongzhen Lishu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongzhen_calendar "Chongzhen calendar") (Calendrical Treatise of [Chongzhen period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongzhen_Emperor "Chongzhen Emperor"), 1628).[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] Traditional Chinese star maps incorporated 23 new constellations with 125 stars of the southern hemisphere of the sky based on the knowledge of Western star charts; with this improvement, the Chinese Sky was integrated with the World astronomy.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Selin2008-41)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-42)

Early modern astronomy
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constellation&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Early modern astronomy")]

Historically, the origins of the constellations of the northern and southern skies are distinctly different. Most northern constellations date to antiquity, with names based mostly on Classical Greek legends.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Norton14th-11) Evidence of these constellations has survived in the form of [star charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_charts "Star charts"), whose oldest representation appears on the statue known as the [Farnese Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnese_Atlas "Farnese Atlas"), based perhaps on the star catalogue of the Greek astronomer [Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Bradley2005-43) Southern constellations are more modern inventions, sometimes as substitutes for ancient constellations (e.g. [Argo Navis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argo_Navis "Argo Navis")). Some southern constellations had long names that were shortened to more usable forms; e.g. Musca Australis became simply Musca.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Norton14th-11)

Some of the early constellations were never universally adopted. Stars were often grouped into constellations differently by different observers, and the arbitrary constellation boundaries often led to confusion as to which constellation a celestial object belonged. Before astronomers delineated precise boundaries (starting in the 19th century), constellations generally appeared as ill-defined regions of the sky.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Norton2nd-44) Today they now follow officially accepted designated lines of [right ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension "Right ascension") and [declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination "Declination") based on those defined by [Benjamin Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Apthorp_Gould "Benjamin Apthorp Gould") in [Equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox_(celestial_coordinates) "Equinox (celestial coordinates)") B1875.0 in his star catalogue _Uranometria Argentina_.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-45)

The 1603 star atlas "[Uranometria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranometria "Uranometria")" of [Johann Bayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bayer "Johann Bayer") assigned stars to individual constellations and formalized the division by assigning a series of Greek and Latin letters to the stars within each constellation. These are known today as [Bayer designations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_designation "Bayer designation").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Swerdlow1986-46) Subsequent star atlases led to the development of today's accepted modern constellations.

### Origin of the southern constellations

A [celestial map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_chart "Celestial chart") from the [Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Netherlandish_cartography "Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography"), by the Dutch cartographer [Frederik de Wit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_de_Wit "Frederik de Wit")

The southern sky, below about −65° [declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination "Declination"), was only partially catalogued by ancient Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, Chinese, and Persian astronomers of the north. The knowledge that northern and southern star patterns differed goes back to Classical writers, who describe, for example, the [African circumnavigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Africa "Exploration of Africa") expedition commissioned by Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II in c.600 BC and those of [Hanno the Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanno_the_Navigator "Hanno the Navigator") in c.500 BC.

The history of southern constellations is not straightforward. Different groupings and different names were proposed by various observers, some reflecting national traditions or designed to promote various sponsors. Southern constellations were important from the 14th to 16th centuries, when sailors used the stars for [celestial navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_navigation "Celestial navigation"). Italian explorers who recorded new southern constellations include [Andrea Corsali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Corsali "Andrea Corsali"), [Antonio Pigafetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Pigafetta "Antonio Pigafetta"), and [Amerigo Vespucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerigo_Vespucci "Amerigo Vespucci").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Allen1899-34)

Many of the 88 IAU-recognized constellations in this region first appeared on celestial globes developed in the late 16th century by [Petrus Plancius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrus_Plancius "Petrus Plancius"), based mainly on observations of the Dutch navigators [Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Dirkszoon_Keyser "Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser")[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-47) and [Frederick de Houtman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_de_Houtman "Frederick de Houtman").[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-48)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-49)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-50)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-51) These became widely known through [Johann Bayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bayer "Johann Bayer")'s [star atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_atlas "Star atlas")_[Uranometria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranometria "Uranometria")_ of 1603.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-52)[Fourteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Constellations_listed_by_Lacaille "Category:Constellations listed by Lacaille") more were created in 1763 by the French astronomer [Nicolas Louis de Lacaille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Louis_de_Lacaille "Nicolas Louis de Lacaille"), who also split the ancient constellation Argo Navis into three; these new figures appeared in his star catalogue, published in 1756.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-53)

Several modern proposals have not survived. The French astronomers [Pierre Lemonnier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Lemonnier_(physicist) "Pierre Lemonnier (physicist)") and [Joseph Lalande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lalande "Joseph Lalande"), for example, proposed constellations that were once popular but have since been dropped. The northern constellation [Quadrans Muralis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrans_Muralis "Quadrans Muralis") survived into the 19th century (when its name was attached to the [Quadrantid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrantid "Quadrantid") meteor shower), but is now divided between [Boötes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C3%B6tes "Boötes") and [Draco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_(constellation) "Draco (constellation)").

### 88 modern constellations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constellation&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: 88 modern constellations")]

A list of 88 constellations was produced for the IAU in 1922.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-auto-5) It is roughly based on the traditional Greek constellations listed by Ptolemy in his _Almagest_ in the 2nd century and [Aratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aratus "Aratus")' work _Phenomena_, with early modern modifications and additions (most importantly introducing constellations covering the parts of the southern sky unknown to Ptolemy) by Petrus Plancius (1592, 1597/98 and 1613), [Johannes Hevelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hevelius "Johannes Hevelius") (1690) and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1763),[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-iau-const-54)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-55)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-56) who introduced fourteen new constellations.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-57) Lacaille studied the stars of the southern hemisphere from 1751 until 1752 from the [Cape of Good Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope "Cape of Good Hope"), when he was said to have observed more than 10,000 stars using a [refracting telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refracting_telescope "Refracting telescope") with an aperture of 0.5 inches (13 mm).

In 1922, [Henry Norris Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell "Henry Norris Russell") produced a list of 88 constellations with three-letter abbreviations for them.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-58) However, these constellations did not have clear borders between them. In 1928, the IAU formally accepted the 88 modern constellations, with contiguous boundaries[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-59) along vertical and horizontal lines of [right ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension "Right ascension") and [declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination "Declination") developed by [Eugene Delporte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Joseph_Delporte "Eugène Joseph Delporte") that, together, cover the entire celestial sphere;[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-auto-5)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Lachi%C3%A8ze-ReyLuminet2001-60) this list was finally published in 1930.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-IAU1928-4) Where possible, these modern constellations usually share the names of their Graeco-Roman predecessors, such as Orion, Leo, or Scorpius. The aim of this system is area-mapping, i.e. the division of the celestial sphere into contiguous fields.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-iau-const-54) Out of the 88 modern constellations, 36 lie predominantly in the northern sky, and the other 52 predominantly in the southern.

[![Image 12: Equirectangular plot of declination vs right ascension of stars brighter than apparent magnitude 5 on the Hipparcos Catalogue, coded by spectral type and apparent magnitude, relative to the modern constellations and the ecliptic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Hipparcos_Catalogue_equirectangular_plot.svg/650px-Hipparcos_Catalogue_equirectangular_plot.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hipparcos_Catalogue_equirectangular_plot.svg "Equirectangular plot of declination vs right ascension of stars brighter than apparent magnitude 5 on the Hipparcos Catalogue, coded by spectral type and apparent magnitude, relative to the modern constellations and the ecliptic")

The boundaries developed by Delporte used data that originated back to epoch [B1875.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy)#Besselian_years "Epoch (astronomy)"), which was when [Benjamin A. Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_A._Gould "Benjamin A. Gould") first made his proposal to designate boundaries for the celestial sphere,[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-61) a suggestion on which Delporte based his work. The consequence of this early date is that because of the [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession_(astronomy) "Precession (astronomy)") of the [equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox "Equinox"), the borders on a modern star map, such as epoch [J2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2000 "J2000"), are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-62) This effect will increase over the years and centuries to come.

The constellations have no official symbols, though those of the ecliptic may take the signs of the zodiac.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-63) Symbols for the other modern constellations, as well as older ones that still occur in modern nomenclature, have occasionally been published.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-64)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-constellations-65)

Members of the [Inca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca "Inca") civilization identified various dark areas or [dark nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_nebula "Dark nebula") in the Milky Way as animals and associated their appearance with the seasonal rains.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-67)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-68)[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-69)[Australian Aboriginal astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_astronomy "Australian Aboriginal astronomy") also describes dark cloud constellations, the most famous being the "emu in the sky" whose head is formed by the [Coalsack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalsack "Coalsack"), a dark nebula, instead of the stars.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation#cite_note-Bordeleau2013-70)
