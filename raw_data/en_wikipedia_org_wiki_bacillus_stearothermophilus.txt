The bacterium is a thermophile and is widely distributed in soil, hot springs, ocean sediment, and is a cause of spoilage in food products. It will grow within a temperature range of 30–75 °C. Some strains are capable of oxidizing carbon monoxide aerobically.  It is commonly used as a challenge organism for sterilization validation studies and periodic check of sterilization cycles. The biological indicator contains spores of the organism on filter paper inside a vial.  After sterilizing, the cap is closed, an ampule of growth medium inside of the vial is crushed and the whole vial is incubated .  A color and/or turbidity change indicates the results of the sterilization process; no change indicates that the sterilization conditions were achieved, otherwise the growth of the spores indicates that the sterilization process has not been met.

Fluorescent-tagged strains, known as rapid-read BIs, [ 3 ] are becoming more common to verify sterilization, since the visible fluorescence appears in about one-tenth the time needed for pH-indicator color change and an inexpensive light sensor can detect the growing colonies.

It was first described in 1920 as Bacillus stearothermophilus , [ 4 ] but, together with Bacillus thermoglucosidasius , it was reclassified as a member of the genus Geobacillus in 2001.

[ 5 ] Applications in molecular biology [ edit ] DNA polymerase [ edit ] DNA polymerase I Identifiers Organism Geobacillus stearothermophilus Symbol PolA PDB 2XY5 UniProt E1C9K5 Search for Structures Swiss-model Domains InterPro Thermostable Group II Intron Reverse Transcriptase GsI-IIC Identifiers Organism Geobacillus stearothermophilus Symbol TRT PDB 6AR1 UniProt E2GM63 Search for Structures Swiss-model Domains InterPro Recently, a DNA polymerase derived from these bacteria, Bst polymerase, has become important in molecular biology applications.

Bst polymerase has a helicase -like activity, making it able to unwind DNA strands. Its optimum functional temperature is between 60 and 65 °C and it is denatured at temperatures above 70 °C. These features make it useful in loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) .

[ 6 ] LAMP is similar to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) but does not require the high temperature (96 °C) step required to denature DNA.

Reverse transcriptase [ edit ] In 2013, a thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase (TGIRT), GsI-IIC-MRF, from G. stearothermophilus was found to retain activity up to 70 °C and to exhibit high processivity and a low error rate.

[ 7 ] These properties make this enzyme useful for reverse transcribing long and/or highly structured RNA molecules. A method for determining RNA secondary structure , DMS-MaPseq, uses this enzyme because it converts normal RNA to DNA accurately but introduces mutations at unpaired bases that have been methylated by dimethyl sulfate , and the mutations can be identified via sequencing .
