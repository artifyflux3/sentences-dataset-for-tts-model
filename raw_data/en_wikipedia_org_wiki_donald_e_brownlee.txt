Brownlee Born Donald Eugene Brownlee ( 1943-12-21 ) December 21, 1943 (age 81) Las Vegas , Nevada , United States Alma mater University of California, Berkeley Known for co-originator of the term Rare Earth Awards J. Lawrence Smith Medal , Leonard Medal , NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement Scientific career Fields Astrobiology, Astronomy Institutions University of Washington at Seattle Donald Eugene Brownlee (born December 21, 1943) is a professor of astronomy at the University of Washington at Seattle and the principal investigator for NASA 's Stardust mission.

[ 1 ] In 2000, along with his co-author Peter Ward , he co-originated the term Rare Earth , in reference to the possible scarcity of life elsewhere in the universe.

[ 2 ] His primary research interests include astrobiology, comets, and cosmic dust.

[ 3 ] He was born in Las Vegas, Nevada.

[ 4 ] Education and employment [ edit ] Brownlee studied electrical engineering at University of California, Berkeley , prior to attending graduate school at the University of Washington .  Brownlee received his doctorate in astronomy from the University of Washington in 1971, [ 5 ] joining the astronomy department as faculty in 1975.  He has also conducted research as a distinguished visiting professor at the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago . Alongside paleontologist Peter Ward , Brownlee is the coauthor of two books, Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe (which put forth the Rare Earth Hypothesis) [ 2 ] and The Life and Death of Planet Earth , with his third book The Sixth Element: How Carbon Shapes Our World being co-authored with Theodore P. Snow.

Honors [ edit ] Asteroid 3259 was named after Brownlee in 1991.

[ 6 ] The International Mineralogical Association has also named a new mineral in honor of Donald Brownlee.  This new silicide mineral (with chemical formula MnSi ) is now called brownleeite , and is the first mineral found from a comet.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] He has been awarded the J. Lawrence Smith Medal [ 9 ] from the National Academy of Sciences , the Leonard Medal from the Meteoritical Society , and the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement in 2007. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 [ 10 ] and in 1999 a fellow of the American Geophysical Union .
