Volume integrals are especially important in physics for many applications, for example, to calculate flux densities, or to calculate mass from a corresponding density function.

In coordinates [ edit ] Often the volume integral is represented in terms of a differential volume element d V = d x d y d z {\displaystyle dV=dx\,dy\,dz} .

∭ ∭ D f ( x , y , z ) d V .

{\displaystyle \iiint _{D}f(x,y,z)\,dV.} It can also mean a triple integral within a region D ⊂ ⊂ R 3 {\displaystyle D\subset \mathbb {R} ^{3}} of a function f ( x , y , z ) , {\displaystyle f(x,y,z),} and is usually written as: ∭ ∭ D f ( x , y , z ) d x d y d z .

{\displaystyle \iiint _{D}f(x,y,z)\,dx\,dy\,dz.} A volume integral in cylindrical coordinates is ∭ ∭ D f ( ρ ρ , φ φ , z ) ρ ρ d ρ ρ d φ φ d z , {\displaystyle \iiint _{D}f(\rho ,\varphi ,z)\rho \,d\rho \,d\varphi \,dz,} and a volume integral in spherical coordinates (using the ISO convention for angles with φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } as the azimuth and θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } measured from the polar axis (see more on conventions )) has the form ∭ ∭ D f ( r , θ θ , φ φ ) r 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ d r d θ θ d φ φ .

{\displaystyle \iiint _{D}f(r,\theta ,\varphi )r^{2}\sin \theta \,dr\,d\theta \,d\varphi .} The triple integral can be transformed from Cartesian coordinates to any arbitrary coordinate system using the Jacobian matrix and determinant . Suppose we have a transformation of coordinates from ( x , y , z ) ↦ ↦ ( u , v , w ) {\displaystyle (x,y,z)\mapsto (u,v,w)} . We can represent the integral as the following.

∭ ∭ D f ( x , y , z ) d x d y d z = ∭ ∭ D f ( u , v , w ) | ∂ ∂ ( x , y , z ) ∂ ∂ ( u , v , w ) | d u d v d w {\displaystyle \iiint _{D}f(x,y,z)\,dx\,dy\,dz=\iiint _{D}f(u,v,w)\left|{\frac {\partial (x,y,z)}{\partial (u,v,w)}}\right|\,du\,dv\,dw} Where we define the Jacobian determinant to be.

J = ∂ ∂ ( x , y , z ) ∂ ∂ ( u , v , w ) = | ∂ ∂ x ∂ ∂ u ∂ ∂ x ∂ ∂ v ∂ ∂ x ∂ ∂ w ∂ ∂ y ∂ ∂ u ∂ ∂ y ∂ ∂ v ∂ ∂ y ∂ ∂ w ∂ ∂ z ∂ ∂ u ∂ ∂ z ∂ ∂ v ∂ ∂ z ∂ ∂ w | {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} ={\frac {\partial (x,y,z)}{\partial (u,v,w)}}={\begin{vmatrix}{\frac {\partial x}{\partial u}}&{\frac {\partial x}{\partial v}}&{\frac {\partial x}{\partial w}}\\{\frac {\partial y}{\partial u}}&{\frac {\partial y}{\partial v}}&{\frac {\partial y}{\partial w}}\\{\frac {\partial z}{\partial u}}&{\frac {\partial z}{\partial v}}&{\frac {\partial z}{\partial w}}\\\end{vmatrix}}} Example [ edit ] Integrating the equation f ( x , y , z ) = 1 {\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=1} over a unit cube yields the following result: ∫ ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ 0 1 1 d x d y d z = ∫ ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ 0 1 ( 1 − − 0 ) d y d z = ∫ ∫ 0 1 ( 1 − − 0 ) d z = 1 − − 0 = 1 {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}\int _{0}^{1}\int _{0}^{1}1\,dx\,dy\,dz=\int _{0}^{1}\int _{0}^{1}(1-0)\,dy\,dz=\int _{0}^{1}\left(1-0\right)dz=1-0=1} So the volume of the unit cube is 1 as expected. This is rather trivial however, and a volume integral is far more powerful. For instance if we have a scalar density function on the unit cube then the volume integral will give the total mass of the cube. For example for density function: { f : R 3 → → R f : ( x , y , z ) ↦ ↦ x + y + z {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}f:\mathbb {R} ^{3}\to \mathbb {R} \\f:(x,y,z)\mapsto x+y+z\end{cases}}} the total mass of the cube is: ∫ ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ 0 1 ( x + y + z ) d x d y d z = ∫ ∫ 0 1 ∫ ∫ 0 1 ( 1 2 + y + z ) d y d z = ∫ ∫ 0 1 ( 1 + z ) d z = 3 2 {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}\int _{0}^{1}\int _{0}^{1}(x+y+z)\,dx\,dy\,dz=\int _{0}^{1}\int _{0}^{1}\left({\frac {1}{2}}+y+z\right)dy\,dz=\int _{0}^{1}(1+z)\,dz={\frac {3}{2}}} See also [ edit ] Mathematics portal Divergence theorem Surface integral Volume element Line element Line integral External links [ edit ] "Multiple integral" , Encyclopedia of Mathematics , EMS Press , 2001 [1994] Weisstein, Eric W.
