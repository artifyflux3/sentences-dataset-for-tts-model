Under an agreement with RASCOM, RascomStar-QAF (a private company registered in Mauritius ) will implement RASCOM's first 14 communications satellite project. This joint African project is expected to lower the continent's dependency on international satellite networks such as Intelsat .

RASCOM-QAF1 [ edit ] RASCOM-QAF1 is the first satellite entirely dedicated to the African continent.

Thales Alenia Space built the satellite in the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center , France . The company has delivered the satellite in-orbit, and will supply the ground infrastructure needed to operate it. The spacecraft is based on the Spacebus 4000B3 platform, with a payload of twelve Ku-band transponders and eight C-band transponders. It weighed about 3,200 kilograms (7,100 lb) at launch.

Launch aboard an Ariane 5GS rocket took place on 2007-12-21.

[ 1 ] On 2007-12-29 Thales Alenia Space announced that a  helium leak aboard the spacecraft would delay its activation.

[ 2 ] On 2008-01-08 the company announced the perigee of the satellite's orbit would be raised, and also acknowledged that if the satellite eventually reached geostationary orbit its useful lifetime would be significantly reduced.

[ 3 ] On 2008-02-04 Thales Alenia Space announced the satellite had reached its intended geostationary orbit at 2.85° East. They expect its lifetime to be slightly over 2 years.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] RASCOM-QAF1R [ edit ] On 2008-09-09 Thales Alenia Space announced it would supply RASCOMSTAR-QAF with a new satellite which will provide continuity of service for RASCOMSTAR-QAF customers. Like RASCOM-QAF1, RASCOM-QAF1R will be based on the Spacebus 4000 B3 platform and will be fitted with twelve Ku-band and eight C-band transponders.

[ 6 ] Launch aboard an Ariane 5 ECA occurred on August 4, 2010.
