[ 10 ] The first sale of town lots was held on June 18, 1902. Nearly three thousand people attended the sale.

[ 10 ] Waurika was incorporated in May 1903. On May 8 of that year, C.A. McBrian was sworn in as the town's first mayor.

[ 10 ] At the time of its founding, Waurika was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation .

[ 12 ] The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway came to Waurika in January 1902 after the railroad superintendent "designated the town as a flag station." [ 10 ] Waurika was formerly the northern terminus for the Wichita Falls and Oklahoma Railway , one of the 20th century properties of Frank Kell and Joseph A. Kemp of Wichita Falls, Texas , [ 13 ] where the Kell House Museum is located today.
