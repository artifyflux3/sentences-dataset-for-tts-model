1498/1500 Évora , Portugal Died ( 1573-12-09 ) 9 December 1573 Évora , Portugal Nationality Portuguese Occupation(s) Dominican friar, [ a ] humanist André de Resende ( c.

1498/1500 –1573) was a Portuguese humanist Dominican friar, classical scholar, poet, and antiquarian .

[ 2 ] Resende is regarded as the father of archeology in Portugal.

[ 3 ] Early life and travels [ edit ] Resende was born c. 1498 in Évora , the son of Pêro Vaz de Resende and Ângela Leonor de Góis.

[ 4 ] After his father died, he entered the local Dominican Order at the age of ten or twelve.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Education [ edit ] Resende spent much of his youth traveling through Spain , France , and the Low Countries .

[ 6 ] In Spain, he attended the universities of Salamanca and Alcalá de Henares , [ 4 ] [ 6 ] studying Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.

[ 7 ] In France, he received theological training in Paris , Marseille , and Aix , becoming archdeacon of St. Maxime-les-Baumes .

[ 5 ] In the late 1520s and early 1530s, Resende resided in Belgium, specifically the cities of Leuven and Brussels .

[ 8 ] He continued his education in Leuven, developing close ties with his Latin professor, Conrad Goclenius , a close friend of Erasmus .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ b ] Goclenius helped Resende publish his first Latin poem, Encomium urbis et academiae , in 1530 and subsequently a poem in praise of Erasmus, Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami Encomium .

[ 12 ] Impressed, Erasmus wrote to Resende expressing admiration of the poem and requesting more of his work. Resende responded by sending him a copy of Genethliacon Principis Lusitani , or
Birthday Poem to the Portuguese Prince, which had been written for the newly born Prince Manuel .

[ 13 ] Despite this correspondence and Resende's deep admiration for Erasmus, the two never met in person.

[ 10 ] [ 13 ] Still, in his letters to Damião de Góis , a close friend of Resende, Erasmus repeatedly inquired about the Portuguese poet.

[ 14 ] While studying under Goclenius, Resende encountered other notable humanists, namely Johannes Secundus and Marius Nizolius .

[ 15 ] He also befriended Nicolaus Clenardus and offered him a position to serve as a tutor at the Portuguese court.

[ 16 ] Service to Charles V [ edit ] After several years of study, Resende departed from Leuven in 1531 and went to the court of Emperor Charles V in Brussels to work alongside the Portuguese ambassador, Pedro de Mascarenhas .

[ 8 ] [ 11 ] In 1532 and 1533, in the entourage of Charles V, Resende travelled across the Holy Roman Empire , residing briefly in Regensburg , Bologna , and Barcelona .

[ 17 ] During his stay in Bologna, he had access to a press and published a series of lengthy works ( Genethliacon, Epicedion, and his satirical Epistola de Vita Aulica ad Speratum Ferrarium ) as well as a few short poems.

[ 18 ] In July 1533, while the entourage was in Barcelona, Resende and Mascarenhas left the Emperor's Court and headed to the Portuguese Court in Évora.

[ 19 ] Career in Portugal [ edit ] Resende returned to Portugal in 1533 and remained there for the rest of his life, becoming one of the most eminent humanists in the country.

[ 20 ] He was a familiar figure at the court of King John III , where he led a group of Erasmian scholars and acted as tutor to the Infante D. Duarte .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ c ] Resende expressed disdain for life at court, complaining about the lack of leisure and stating he'd prefer to live abroad.

[ 23 ] He also expressed frustration with the academic conservatism that existed in Portugal.

[ 24 ] Beginning in 1551, Resende was a professor of Sacred Theology at the University of Coimbra.

[ 2 ] After administration of the university was taken over by Jesuits in 1555, the contracts of Resende and other humanists were not renewed, and subsequently Resende went back to Évora.

[ 25 ] In addition to teaching, Resende devoted himself to the study of antiquities , [ 26 ] especially with respect to Évora.

[ 6 ] An admirer of ancient Rome and devout Catholic, Resende sought to construct a past and, by extension, a cultural identity for Portugal that was simultaneously Roman and Christian.

[ 27 ] In 1553, he published his História da antiguidade da cidade de Évora (History of the
Antiquity of the City of Évora).

[ 6 ] In this work he claims that the Roman general Sertorius resided in Évora and frames him as a symbol of Lusitanian independence.

[ 28 ] He also argues that Évora is one of the oldest Christian cities in the Peninsula .

[ 29 ] In his comprehensive study of Iberian antiquarianism, De Antiquitatibus Lusitaniae , [ 2 ] Resende largely neglects the period between the Romans and the Reconquista , making no reference to the era that Portugal was under Islamic rule.

[ 30 ] Besides the aforementioned works, Resende also wrote two books on aqueducts and one on ancient epitaphs.

[ 31 ] After years of semi-retirement, Resende died in his home in Évora on 9 December 1573.

[ 19 ] At the time of his death, he was still working on De Antiquitatibus Lusitaniae . The work was completed posthumously and published in 1593.

[ 32 ] Resende is buried in the chapel of the right transept of the Cathedral of Évora .

Legacy [ edit ] Together with Clenardus , Resende is considered a pioneer in advancing Christian humanism in Renaissance Portugal.

[ 33 ] Although Resende's work was largely endorsed in his time, modern historians deem his construction of Portuguese history with regards to Rome as largely fabricated with little basis.

[ 29 ] Moreover, in the 19th century epigraphy specialist Emil Hübner concluded that an inscription brought forth by Resende, supposedly from ancient Rome, was inauthentic.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ d ] Accordingly, Philip Spann (1981) describes Resende as "one of the great 16th-century forgers of inscriptions." [ 37 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ Historian John Martyn writes that Resende no longer wore Dominican habit after the death of Cardinal Afonso in 1540.

[ 1 ] ^ Resende had travelled to Leuven in hopes of meeting Erasmus, whose work he greatly respected. However, the Dutch humanist had already left for Basel in 1521.

[ 11 ] ^ Resende later wrote Duarte's biography.

[ 22 ] ^ The inscription corroborated Resende's assertion that Sertorius lived in the city and was responsible for the construction of its aqueduct.

[ 7 ] Although the artifact is universally recognized as a fake, modern archeologists concur that a Roman aqueduct did once bring water from Divor to Évora, somewhat validating Resende's claim.
