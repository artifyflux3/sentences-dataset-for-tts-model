According to the 2021 Census, 46,720 people in Australia were born in Brazil while 24,377 claimed Brazilian ancestry .

[ 3 ] According to the Brazilian consulate, almost 60,000 Brazilians are living in Australia as of 2020 (making around 0.25% of the country's population).

Brazilian immigration [ edit ] Although Brazilian migration in the eighteenth and nineteenth and centuries has not been documented, there is evidence of early Brazilian interest in Australia. However, concrete evidence of a Brazilian presence in Australia does not appear until the turn of the twentieth century, when census officials in 1901 counted 105 Brazilian-born in Australia.

[ 4 ] Two waves of immigration [ edit ] The first Brazilian migrants began arriving in Australia in the mid-1970s. They were attracted to Australia by an Australian government assistance scheme. The second wave of migration began in the late 1990s and continues today. It is widely attributed to growing socio-economic power within Brazil since the 1980s and Brazilians’ strong desire to learn English. Australia 
has become the third most popular destination for Brazilians to learn English after the United States and England .

There has also been an influx of Brazilian students who have come to attend Australian colleges and universities. These students come independent of their families on study visa. Some go home after completion of their studies, while others settle in Australia permantly.

[ 5 ] Brazilians have become the largest source of international student enrollments in Australia outside of Europe and Asia.

[ 6 ] [ verification needed ] Demographics and statistics [ edit ] As of the 2021 Census, there are approximately 46,720 people in Australia who were born in Brazil, and around 24,377 people who claimed Brazilian ancestry, making the total number of people with Brazilian connections in Australia approximately 71,097.

[ 7 ] Brazil is a country home to various ethnic and racial groups, but the largest ancestries reported in the 2021 census aside from the general 'Brazilian' response were Japanese, Italian, Lebanese, and Portuguese.
