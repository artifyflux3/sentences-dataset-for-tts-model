, United States. Founded by Bishop John Carroll in 1789, [ d ] it is the oldest Catholic institution of higher education in the United States, the oldest university in Washington, D.C., [ e ] and the nation's first federally chartered university.

The university has eleven undergraduate and graduate schools. Its main campus, located in the Georgetown historic neighborhood, is on a hill above the Potomac River and identifiable by Healy Hall , a National Historic Landmark . It is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity." The university offers degree programs in forty-eight disciplines, enrolling an average of 7,500 undergraduate and 10,000 graduate students from more than 135 countries.

Georgetown has educated more U.S. diplomats than any other university including at least 92 ambassadors of the United States , as well as a number of American politicians and civil servants .

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Georgetown University See also: List of presidents of Georgetown University Founding [ edit ] John Carroll , the first Archbishop of Baltimore and founder of Georgetown University in 1789 In 1634, Jesuit settlers from England founded the Province of Maryland in colonial-era British America .

[ 13 ] In 1646, the defeat of the Royalists in the English Civil War led to stringent laws against Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including missionary Andrew White , and the destruction of their school at Calverton Manor.

[ 5 ] During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely. Following the end of the American Revolutionary War , plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for education in the United States were realized.

[ 14 ] At Benjamin Franklin 's recommendation, Pope Pius VI appointed former Jesuit John Carroll the first head of the Catholic Church in the United States , even though the papal suppression of the Jesuit order was still in effect. Carroll began meetings of local clergy in 1783 near Annapolis , where they orchestrated the development of a new university.

[ 15 ] On January 23, 1789, Carroll finalized the purchase of the property in Georgetown on which Dahlgren Quadrangle was later built.

[ 16 ] Future Congressman William Gaston was enrolled as the school's first student on November 22, 1791, and instruction began on January 2, 1792.

[ 15 ] 19th century [ edit ] During its early years, Georgetown College suffered from considerable financial strain.

[ 17 ] The Maryland Society of Jesus began its restoration in 1805, and Jesuit affiliation, in the form of teachers and administrators, bolstered confidence in the college.

[ 18 ] The school relied on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local lands which had been donated to the Jesuits. To raise money for Georgetown and other schools in 1838, Maryland Jesuits conducted a mass sale of some 272 slaves to two Deep South plantations in Maringouin, Louisiana , from their six in Maryland, ending their slaveholding.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Georgetown University, c.

1850 President James Madison signed into law Georgetown's congressional charter on March 1, 1815, creating the first federal university charter , which allowed it to confer degrees, with the first bachelor's degrees being awarded two years later.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] In 1844, the school received a corporate charter under the name " The President and Directors of Georgetown College ", affording the growing school additional legal rights. In response to the demand for a local option for Catholic students, the Medical School was founded in 1851.

[ 23 ] Union Army soldiers on Theodore Roosevelt Island with the Potomac River and the university visible in the background in 1861 at the beginning of the American Civil War Patrick Francis Healy , the first African-American to become a Jesuit , helped transform the school into a modern university after the Civil War [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The American Civil War greatly impacted Georgetown as 1,141 students and alumni enlisted in one army or the other, and the Union Army commandeered university buildings in order to defend the national capital from a feared a Confederate attack.

[ 14 ] By the time President Abraham Lincoln visited the Georgetown campus in May 1861, 1,400 troops were living in temporary quarters there. The number of lives lost in the Civil war caused enrollment levels to remain low until well after the war. Only seven students graduated in 1869, down from over 300 in the previous decade.

[ 26 ] When the Georgetown College Boat Club, the school's rowing team, was founded in 1876 it adopted two colors: blue, used for Union uniforms , and gray, used for Confederate uniforms . These colors signified the peaceful existence of students who held various loyalties.

[ 27 ] Enrollment did not recover until the late 19th century, during the presidency of Patrick Francis Healy from 1873 to 1881. Born in Athens, Georgia as a slave by law and mixed-race by ancestry, Healy was the first person of African descent to head a predominantly white American university.

[ f ] He identified as Irish Catholic, like his father, and was educated in Catholic schools in the United States and France. He is credited with reforming the undergraduate curriculum , lengthening the medical and law programs, and creating the Alumni Association . One of his largest undertakings was the construction of a major new building, subsequently named Healy Hall in his honor. For his work, Healy is known as the school's "second founder".

[ 28 ] In 1870, after the founding of the Law Department , Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on higher education .

[ 18 ] 20th century [ edit ] In 1901, the School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate School of Nursing in 1903.

[ 29 ] Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the university in 1927.

[ 30 ] The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh to prepare students for leadership in diplomacy and foreign commerce.

[ 18 ] The School of Dentistry became independent of the School of Medicine in 1956.

[ 31 ] The School of Business Administration was separated from the SFS in 1957 and was renamed the McDonough School of Business (MSB) in 1998 in honor of SFS alumnus Robert E. McDonough.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Georgetown also aimed to expand its resources and student body. The School of Nursing has admitted female students since its founding, and most of the university classes were made available to women on a limited basis by 1952.

[ 34 ] With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first female students in the 1969–1970 academic year , Georgetown became fully coeducational .

[ 35 ] In 1962, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) was founded at Georgetown University as a think tank to conduct policy studies and strategic analyses of political, economic and security issues throughout the world.

[ 36 ] When Henry Kissinger retired from his position as U.S. Secretary of State in 1977, he taught at Georgetown SFS, making CSIS the base for his Washington operations.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] In 1986, the university's board of directors voted to sever all ties with CSIS due to differences in academic direction and competing fund-raising efforts.

[ 40 ] Healy Hall , which houses classrooms and the university's executive body In 1975, Georgetown established the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies , soliciting funds from the governments of the United States, Saudi Arabia , Oman , and Libya as well as American corporations with business interests in the Middle East.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] It later returned the money it received from Muammar Qaddafi 's Libyan government, which had been used to fund a chair for Hisham Shirabi , and also returned further donations from Iraq .

[ 43 ] Georgetown ended its bicentennial year of 1989 by electing Leo J. O'Donovan , S.J. as president. He subsequently launched the Third Century Campaign to expand the school's endowment.

[ 44 ] 21st century [ edit ] In December 2003, Georgetown completed the campaign after raising over $1 billion for financial aid, academic chair endowment, and new capital projects.

[ 45 ] In October 2002, Georgetown University began studying the feasibility of opening a campus of the SFS in Qatar, when the non-profit Qatar Foundation first proposed the idea. The School of Foreign Service in Qatar opened in 2005 along with four other U.S. universities in the Education City development. Additionally, the Center for International and Regional Studies (CIRS) opened in 2005 at the new Qatar campus.

[ 46 ] Between 2012 and 2018, Georgetown received more than $350 million from Gulf Cooperation Council countries including Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and the United Arab Emirates .

[ 47 ] In 2005, Georgetown received a $20 million gift from Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Alsaud , a member of the Saudi Royal Family ; at that time the second-largest donation ever to the university, it was used to expand the activities of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding .

[ 48 ] The same year, Georgetown began hosting a two-week workshop at Fudan University 's School of International Relations and Public Affairs in Shanghai , China, which developed into a more formal connection when Georgetown opened a liaison office at Fudan on January 12, 2008, to further collaboration.

[ 49 ] John J. DeGioia , Georgetown's first lay president, led the school from 2001 to 2024. DeGioia continued its financial modernization and sought to "expand opportunities for intercultural and interreligious dialogue." [ 50 ] DeGioia also founded the annual Building Bridges Seminar in 2001, which brings global religious leaders together, and is part of Georgetown's effort to promote religious pluralism.

[ 51 ] The Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs began as an initiative in 2004, and after a grant from William R. Berkley , was launched as an independent organization in 2006.

[ 51 ] Jesuit tradition [ edit ] Dahlgren Chapel on the university campus Georgetown University was founded by former Jesuits in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola ; it is a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities .

[ 16 ] [ 52 ] Georgetown is not a pontifical university , though seven Jesuits serve on the 36 member Board of Directors, the university's governing body.

[ 53 ] Catholic spaces at the university, including Dahlgren Chapel , the university's principal place of Catholic worship, fall within the territorial jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Washington , [ 54 ] Fifty-two members of the Society of Jesus live on campus, and are employed by Georgetown mostly as professors or administrators.

[ 55 ] Jesuit Heritage Week has been held every year since 2001 to celebrate the contributions of Jesuits to the Georgetown tradition.

[ 56 ] Georgetown's Catholic heritage has been controversial at times, even though its influence is relatively limited.

[ 57 ] Stores in university-owned buildings are prohibited from selling or distributing birth control products.

[ 58 ] The university hosts the Cardinal O'Connor Conference on Life annually in January to discuss the pro-life movement.

[ 59 ] Georgetown University Medical Center and Georgetown University Hospital , operated by MedStar Health , are prohibited from performing abortions.

[ 60 ] However, as of 2004 [update] , the hospital was performing research using embryonic stem cells .

[ 61 ] Between 1996 and 1999, the administration added crucifixes to many classroom walls, a change that attracted national attention.

[ 62 ] Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms.

[ 63 ] Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such.

[ 64 ] In May 2004, Imam Yahya Hendi , the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, faced pressure to remove crucifixes while he and other campus faith leaders defended their placement.

[ 65 ] The Edward B. Bunn, S.J. Intercultural Center rotates displays of various faith and culture symbols in its lobby.

[ 66 ] In September 2005, Georgetown was criticized by religious groups, including the Cardinal Newman Society , for not following the teachings of the church and  hosting pro-abortion rights speakers, including John Kerry and Barack Obama .

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] In 2009, Georgetown's religious symbols were brought back to national attention after the university administration covered-up the name of Jesus in preparation for then President Barack Obama's speech on campus.

[ 69 ] In May 2012, Washington's Archbishop Donald Wuerl criticized the university for inviting pro-abortion rights Kathleen Sebelius to be a commencement speaker.

[ 70 ] Georgetown neighborhood In August 2013, religious groups denounced Georgetown for allowing gay-themed events, including a performance, during which "a male student went as a high-heeled Mary and danced to Madonna 's " Like a Virgin " while Jesus (a woman) looked on."

[ citation needed ] Campuses [ edit ] Main articles: Campuses of Georgetown University and List of Georgetown University buildings Georgetown University has four campuses in Washington, D.C.: the undergraduate campus located in the neighborhood of Georgetown, the Medical Center, the School of Continuing Studies (in Chinatown) and the Law Center. The undergraduate campus and Medical Center are together in the Georgetown neighborhood in the Northwest Quadrant of Washington and form the main campus. Other centers are located around Washington, D.C., including the Center for Continuing and Professional Education at Clarendon in Arlington County, Virginia . Transit between these locations and the Washington Metro is supplied by a system of shuttles, known as GUTS buses.

[ 133 ] Georgetown also has branches of the School of Foreign Service in Doha , Qatar, and Jakarta , Indonesia, as well as villas in Alanya , Turkey, and Fiesole , Italy. In their campus layout, Georgetown's administrators consistently used the traditional quadrangle design.

[ 134 ] Main campus [ edit ] Georgetown's campus is built on a rise above the Potomac River Healy Hall at sunset Georgetown's undergraduate and medical school campuses are situated on an elevated site above the Potomac River overlooking Northern Virginia . Because of this, Georgetown University is often referred to as "The Hilltop". The main gates, known as the Healy Gates , are located at the intersection of 37th and O Streets NW, and lead directly to the heart of campus. The main campus is relatively compact, being 104 acres (0.4 km 2 ) in area, but includes fifty-four buildings, student residences and apartments capable of accommodating 80% of undergraduates, and various athletic facilities.

[ 135 ] Most buildings employ collegiate Gothic architecture and Georgian brick architecture . Campus green areas include fountains, a cemetery , large clusters of flowers, groves of trees, and open quadrangles.

[ 136 ] New buildings and major renovations are required to meet LEED Silver criteria, [ 137 ] and the campus was nominated for the District Sustainability People's Choice Award in 2018.

[ 138 ] Healy Hall, designed by Paul J. Pelz in Neo-Medieval style and built from 1877 to 1879, is the architectural gem of Georgetown's campus, and is a National Historic Landmark .

[ 139 ] Within Healy Hall are a number of notable rooms including Gaston Hall , Riggs Library, and the Bioethics Library Hirst Reading Room.

[ 140 ] Both Healy Hall and the Georgetown University Astronomical Observatory , built in 1844, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

[ 141 ] In addition to the front lawn, the main campus has traditionally centered on Dahlgren Quadrangle behind Healy Hall, which is home to Dahlgren Chapel; however, in recent decades, Red Square has replaced the Dahlgren Quadrangle as the focus of student life.

[ 142 ] North of Red Square is an extended pathway that is home to buildings such as the Intercultural Center (ICC), the Reiss Science building, the newly constructed dormitory named after Pedro Arrupe , and the large Leavey Student Center.

[ 143 ] The medical school is located in the northwestern part of the main campus on Reservoir Road. It is integrated with Georgetown University Hospital.

[ 144 ] In the 21st-century, the West side of the Hilltop has emerged as a newly developing area of the main campus. The university completed the Southwest Quadrangle Project in late 2003 and brought a new 907-bed upperclassmen residence hall, the Leo J. O'Donovan dining hall, a large underground parking facility, and a new Jesuit Residence to the campus.

[ 145 ] The school's first performing arts center , named for Royden B. Davis , was completed in November 2005. The new business school headquarters, named for Rafik Hariri , opened in Fall 2009, and Regents Hall, the new science building, opened in Fall 2012. Along with the adjacent Leavey Student Center, these two large buildings have become popular study spaces and overlook a newly developed scenic lawn space.

[ 146 ] In the fall of 2014, the university opened a new student center, the Healey Family Student Center (HFSC) to complement the longstanding Leavey Center. The Healey Family Student Center is located on the first floor of New South Hall , a space that functioned as the university's main dining facility until the Leo J. O'Donovan dining hall opening in 2003. It features over 43,000 square feet including several study spaces, conference rooms, dance, and music studios, as well as a pub called Bulldog Tavern and a salad store Hilltoss, which is operated by The Corp .

[ 148 ] The Georgetown neighborhood west of Wisconsin Avenue NW is dominated by the presence of university students. Students have easy access to the M Street commercial area, the Georgetown Waterfront, and numerous trails that lead to the National Mall and other parks. Despite this, " town and gown " relations between the university communities and other Georgetown residents are often strained by facilities construction, enlargement of the student body, as well as noise and alcohol violations.

[ 149 ] Several groups of neighborhood residents have attempted to slow University growth in Georgetown, creating friction between students and the surrounding neighborhood. Despite the relative safety of the neighborhood, crime is a persistent issue, with campus security responding to 257 crimes in 2008, the majority of which were petty crimes.

[ 150 ] Law Center campus [ edit ] Main article: Georgetown University Law Center Georgetown Law School 's campus on Capitol Hill The Law Center campus is located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood on New Jersey Avenue, near Washington Union Station , and consists of five buildings.
