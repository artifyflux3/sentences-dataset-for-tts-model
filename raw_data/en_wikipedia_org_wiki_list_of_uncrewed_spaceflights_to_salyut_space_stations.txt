The list includes Soyuz 34 , which was launched uncrewed but landed crewed, however it does not include Soyuz 32 , which was launched crewed, but landed uncrewed.

Prior to the launch of Salyut 6, the only uncrewed spaceflights of the Salyut programme were the stations themselves, and the Soyuz 20 spacecraft, which docked with Salyut 4.
