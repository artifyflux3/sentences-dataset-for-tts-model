16000394 Edmund B. Hayes Hall The State University of New York at Buffalo (commonly referred to as University at Buffalo , UB , or sometimes SUNY Buffalo ) is a public research university in Buffalo and Amherst, New York , United States. The university was founded in 1846 as a private medical college and merged with the State University of New York system in 1962. It is one of two flagship institutions of the SUNY system, along with Stony Brook University .

[ 6 ] As of fall 2023, the university enrolled nearly 32,000 students in 13 schools and colleges, making it the largest public university in the state of New York.

[ 3 ] Since its founding by a group which included future United States president Millard Fillmore , the university has evolved from a small medical school to a research university . Today, in addition to the College of Arts and Sciences, the university houses the largest state-operated medical school , dental school , education school , business school , engineering school , and pharmacy school , and is also home to SUNY's only law school .

[ 7 ] UB has the largest endowment and most research funding among the universities in the SUNY system.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The university offers bachelor's degrees in over 140 areas of study, as well as over 220 master's programs and over 95 doctoral programs, and 55 combined degree programs. The University at Buffalo is one of two universities founded by United States Presidents.

[ 11 ] The University at Buffalo is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 12 ] In 1989, UB was elected to the Association of American Universities . The University at Buffalo intercollegiate athletic teams are the Bulls . They compete in Division I of the NCAA and are members of the Mid-American Conference .

History [ edit ] White House portrait of Millard Fillmore City leaders of Buffalo sought to establish a university in the city from the earliest days of Buffalo. A "University of Western New-York" was begun at Buffalo under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church and property was purchased at North Street and College, (the site of the later YMCA), on the north side of the Allentown district . "University of Western New-York" was chartered by the state on April 8, 1836. Following the charter, private funding was secured for the "Western University," which would endow six or seven professorships at $5,000 each; an addition $12,000 or $15,000 was also collected for a general fund, and a building lot was donated by Judge Ebenezer Walden , one of the wealthiest men in the city.

[ 13 ] However, the project collapsed and no classes were ever offered, and only the layout of the College Street campus remains.

[ 14 ] Founding [ edit ] The University of Buffalo (as it was originally named) was founded on May 11, 1846, [ 14 ] as a private medical school to train the doctors for the communities of Buffalo , Niagara Falls , and surrounding villages. Future U.S. President Millard Fillmore , then a lawyer who had recently served in the United States House of Representatives , was one of the principal founders.

[ 15 ] James Platt White was instrumental in obtaining a charter for the university from the state legislature in 1846. He also taught the first class of 89 men in obstetrics. State Assemblyman Nathan K. Hall was also "particularly active in procuring the charter".

[ 16 ] The doors first opened to students in 1847 and after associating with a hospital for teaching purposes, the first class of students graduated the medical school in July 1847. Fillmore served as the school's first chancellor , a position he held until 1874, even as he served in other capacities during that time, including Comptroller of New York , U.S.

Vice President, and eventually President.

1907 Pub Scene, students singing Initially, the university did not have its own facilities, and early lectures were given at an old post office on Seneca and Washington streets in Buffalo. The first building specially built for the university was a stone structure at the corner of Main and Virginia streets, built in 1849–50, through donations, public subscription, and a state grant.

[ 16 ] There were continuous expansions to the college medical programs, including a separate pharmacy division, which is now The School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In 1887, a law school was organized in Buffalo, which quickly became associated with Niagara University just to the north of Buffalo. After four years, in 1891, the law school was acquired by the University of Buffalo as the University of Buffalo Law School , which had a downtown Buffalo facility. In the first few years of the 20th century, the university began planning for a comprehensive undergraduate college to complete the basic structure of a university, and in 1909 the university acquired the Erie County Almshouse grounds from the county of Erie, which became the University of Buffalo's initial campus. The establishment may have been influenced by the 1910 Flexner Report which criticized the preparation of the medical students at the university.

[ 17 ] With that additional space, in 1915, the then University of Buffalo formed the College of Arts and Sciences , creating an undergraduate division in addition to its prior educational work in the licensed professional fields. In 1916, Grace Millard Knox pledged $500,000 (equivalent to $14,448,000 in 2024) for the establishment of a "department of liberal arts and sciences in the University of Buffalo", which was at the time still a private institution. The initial gift of $100,000 was for the purchase of what would become Townsend Hall and the remainder was to establish the university's first endowment, in her husband's name, to support the department.

[ 18 ] First home of the Medical College In 1950, the Industrial Engineering department branched off from the Mechanical Engineering department. In 1956, a Civil Engineering Department was formed under Lehigh University graduate Robert L. Ketter , who went on to become Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , and later President of the university. In 1959, WBFO was launched as an AM radio station by UB's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , and run by UB's students. The station has since become the launching pad of two modern National Public Radio personalities: Terry Gross and Ira Flatow . In 1961, the Western New York nuclear research program was created at the university. This program installed a miniature, active nuclear fission reactor on the university's South (Main Street) Campus. This program was not particularly active, nor could it compete with other government-run research labs, consequently, the programs performed in this facility were abandoned somewhat shortly after its inception. This reactor was decommissioned in 2005 with little fanfare due to material security concerns.

Acquisition by the SUNY system and second campus [ edit ] The private University of Buffalo was purchased by and incorporated into the State University of New York (SUNY) system in 1962, and became known as the State University of New York at Buffalo, more commonly known as the University at Buffalo. This acquisition was championed by then-Governor of New York, Nelson Rockefeller .

[ 19 ] As a part of the agreement to merge the university into the SUNY system, the state began to build an extensive second campus for the university. In 1964, the state acquired several hundred acres in the town of Amherst on the northeast of Buffalo, for development as a comprehensive campus for most of the non-medical disciplines at the University at Buffalo. This is often called the North Campus; it is the center of most University at Buffalo activities. The North Campus project included several major buildings, dormitory complexes, a separate spur of the interstate highway, and a new lake. The undergraduate college, the law school, and graduate schools were all moved to the new campus. During the late 1960s, the College of Arts and Sciences was divided into three separate schools: arts and letters, natural sciences and mathematics, and social sciences. During the 1998–1999 academic year, the three schools were reunited to re-create the existing College of Arts and Sciences, when the faculties of Arts and Letters, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences and Mathematics were combined, according to a memorandum issued by the State University of New York.

[ 20 ] Since 1989, UB has been a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU), an organization of 65 leading research universities in the United States and Canada. UB president Satish K. Tripathi serves on the AAU board of directors.

[ 21 ] "UB 2020" strategic plan [ edit ] Started in 2004 under President John B. Simpson, UB 2020 was a strategic planning initiative to develop and implement a vision for the university over the subsequent 15 years.

[ 22 ] The centerpiece of UB 2020 was to add about 10,000 more students, 750 faculty members and 600 staff, increasing the size of the university by about 40 percent. UB 2020 also recognized the university's contribution to the surrounding region. The most recent estimates of UB's impact on the local and regional economies of Western New York report approximately $1.7 billion are brought into the local economy from the presence of UB. This figure is also expected to rise by 40 percent, corresponding with UB's institutional growth.

One of the keys to helping UB achieve the goals of the UB 2020 plan, proponents said, was the passage of S2020 and A2020, known as the UB 2020 Flexibility and Economic Growth Act, by the New York State Legislature. On June 3, 2009, the State Senate passed S2020 and sent the bill to the Assembly for their consideration.

[ 23 ] UB student Silvana D'Ettorre introduces President Barack Obama at a speech given in Alumni Arena in 2013.

The current president, Satish K. Tripathi , continued his vocal support of UB 2020 [ 24 ] [ 25 ] and has been actively engaging in campus-wide discussion on the proposed tuition increases introduced by the bill.

[ 26 ] In 2011, the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences received a donation of $40 million from an alumnus, George Melvin Ellis Jr., MD, who earned his medical degree from the university in 1945.

[ 27 ] The donation contributed to the $375 million project which has relocated the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences to UB's downtown campus.

[ 28 ] The new school building was designed by HOK Architects . A subsequent donation of $30 million from Jeremy Jacobs and family was received in 2015 and the medical school was renamed the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences .

From FY2011 to FY2012, UB spent over $300 million on the strategic plan to construct and open four new buildings, including Davis Hall , William R. Greiner Residence Hall, the Clinical and Translational Research Center and Kaleida Health medical research building, and Crossroads Culinary Center.

[ 29 ] On August 22, 2013, President Barack Obama came to UB's campus to give a speech about needed higher education reform in the country. President Obama highlighted UB's accolades and specifically chose Buffalo for its excellence and commitment to the future, graduation rates and retention, and quality education at an affordable price.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] As part of the UB 2020 initiative, "Heart of the Campus" projects were initiated in phases on each of UB's three campuses. In Fall 2019, UB began construction of the One World Café, an "international eatery" located on North Campus, adjacent to Capen Hall, Norton Hall, and Founder's Plaza.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Beginning in 2019, UB took steps to distance the institution from Millard Fillmore and ceased its co-sponsorship of his annual gravesite ceremony, due to his controversial policies regarding slavery in the United States . A year later, Fillmore's name was removed from the Millard Fillmore Academic Center, and the names of UB's fourth chancellor James O. Putnam and SUNY regent Peter Buell Porter were also removed from campus due to the former's openly racist views and the latter's ownership of slaves.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Name [ edit ] The university's official legal name is "State University of New York at Buffalo". The more commonly used name and the school's formal academic name is "University at Buffalo", informally "UB". This name is similar to the university's former name of over 100 years, "University of Buffalo". Other names like "SUNY Buffalo", "SUNY at Buffalo", and "Buffalo" are also seen.

[ 40 ] The university's athletic department, particularly on uniforms, uses the name "Buffalo".

The medical campus, which is designed to meet LEED Silver criteria, incorporates high efficiency lighting, heat recovery systems, and an Energy Star roof.

Also located in the downtown area is UB's Clinical and Research Institute on Addictions (CRIA), Educational Opportunity Center (EOC) [ 107 ] and the Jacobs Executive Development Center (JEDC). The campus includes six major properties and a total of 43 buildings, counting shared lease space (588,506 sq ft (54,674 m 2 )).

[ 108 ] In September 2007, UB added the former M. Wile and Company Factory Building on the southeast corner of Goodell and Ellicott streets and the former Trico Products Corp. building complex on the northwest corner of Goodell and Ellicott streets to its properties downtown. The UB Regional Institute, Center on Rehabilitation Synergy, and a number of pre-K-16 initiatives related to UB's civic engagement mission, such as the UB-Buffalo Public Schools Partnership office, are set to relocate to the first site. The latter location has been purchased to house additional biomedical and life science-related businesses connected to the Buffalo-Niagara Medical Campus.

[ 109 ] [ 110 ] Teaching hospitals [ edit ] UB's teaching hospitals include Buffalo General Hospital , Erie County Medical Center , Millard Fillmore Hospital , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Veterans Affairs Western New York Health Care System, and the John R. Oishei Children's Hospital . Additional facilities include free clinics such as the Kaleida Health's Niagara Family Health Center and the Lighthouse Free Medical Clinic, a program run by UB medical students.

UB art galleries [ edit ] See also: List of university art museums and galleries in New York State UB is home to two university art galleries: the UB Anderson Art Gallery and the UB Art Gallery at the Center for the Arts.
Adjacent to the UB South Campus is the UB Anderson Art Gallery, a converted elementary school with an all-glass atrium exhibit space.

[ 111 ] The UB Anderson Gallery hosts exhibitions curated by faculty and visiting curators and features works from international and professional artist in its two floor facility. The UB Anderson Gallery building, along with over 1,200 works of art, was donated to the university in 2000 by collector and gallery owner David K. Anderson, son of legendary New York gallerist Martha Jackson .

[ 112 ] Selections from the personal collection of Jackson that was donated to the UB Anderson Gallery by David Anderson are on display in a 360 degree permanent installation in the Martha Jackson Gallery Archives and Research Center, on the second floor of the gallery.

The UB Art Gallery at the Center for the Arts is located on the north campus, and features works from contemporary artists, as well as faculty and students across disciplines.

Comprehensive Physical Plan [ edit ] The University at Buffalo has grown to an enrollment of approximately 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students , and a staff of 14,000 employees, across three campuses in the last 160 years. In order to accommodate both students and faculty, the university is currently implementing a $4.5 million Comprehensive Physical Plan to help in growth as well as to best utilize and enhance current facilities. Connecting all three campuses, as well as the facilities UB uses, is also a major element of the project. The firm granted the contract to lead the project is Beyer Blinder Belle .

The comprehensive physical planning process is broken into four phases. Currently, UB is implementing "phase one" by seeking input from the local and university communities to pinpoint issues, opportunities, and concerns related to this expansion. The project recognizes UB's potential for excellence, in regard to the university's physical environment, by highlighting and evaluating various positive and negative attributes of the three campuses, including housing, circulation, functionality, landscape, and community interface.

The Spectrum is a campus newspaper, which distributes on campus and online.

Subject is a student-run online multimedia outlet that includes student-written articles, and radio shows, video, and podcasts by students and alumni.

Subject was founded in 2020 by alumni of former campus radio station WRUB, [ 121 ] and campus magazine Generation , , [ 122 ] after Sub-Board I, [ 123 ] the student services corporation that funded them both, was shut down in 2019.

[ 124 ] After the retirement of John B. Simpson , the undergraduate students have also developed a university forum [ 125 ] with the hopes of developing a thriving online campus. This move was supported by now-incumbent president Satish K. Tripathi who called it a "model of University spirit and entrepreneurship".

[ 126 ] The UB Student Alumni Association (UBSAA) annually hosts the world's largest collegiate mud-volleyball game known as "Oozefest". One hundred ninety-two teams of at least six students compete in a double elimination volleyball tournament at "The Mud Pit" each Spring before finals. Fire trucks are brought in to saturate the dirt courts to create the mud. Awards are handed out to not only the victors, but the most creatively dressed. In the past, students have worn business suits and even dresses to the tournament.

Held annually from 1991 to 2018 has been the Linda Yalem Safety Run, formerly called the Linda Yalem Memorial Run. Linda Yalem was a sophomore at UB who was studying communications and training for the New York City Marathon when she was raped and killed by Altemio Sanchez after going for a run on the Ellicott Creek Bike Path on September 29, 1990.  The Run was held every year in her memory and to promote safety for runners.

In 1923, an honorary senior society called Bisonhead was founded. It has since represented twelve undergraduate leaders at UB each year.

[ 127 ] Many of UB's clubs, such as the UB Accounting Association, are run through the Undergraduate Student Association and the Graduate Student Association, with each level requiring respective senate recognition for clubs.

Student housing [ edit ] Greiner Hall on North Campus Student residence halls are located on both the North and South Campuses. On the North Campus, there is the Ellicott Complex, which consists of Evans (formerly Porter), Fargo, Red Jacket, Richmond, Spaulding, and Wilkeson Quadrangles. The Ellicott Complex is also known as "Lego Land" because the shapes of the buildings resemble Legos stacked upon each other.  Next to Fargo Quad is the newly built in 2011 Greiner Hall, a dorm strictly for sophomores. Also on North Campus is the Governors Complex, home to the Freshman Honors Housing and various other living communities. There are also off-campus housing options close to the north campus such as The Triad Apartments.

On South Campus is Goodyear and Clement Hall. The unique aspect of these dorms is that residents share a bathroom with the adjacent room, rather than have a communal bathroom. Up until Spring of 2011, there were four other dorm buildings, referred to as "The Quad": MacDonald (named for Lillias MacDonald , UB's first dean of women), Pritchard, Schoellkopf, and Michael Hall. Michael Hall currently exists as the Student Health Center, the other three were demolished in 2018.

In 1999, the university built its first apartment complex for families and graduate students at Flickinger Court. Since the success of Flickinger, UB has developed South Lake Village, Hadley Village, Flint Village, and Creekside Apartments. Most students who wish to still live on or near the North Campus but enjoy the lifestyle of apartment living take advantage of these apartments. University Village at Sweethome, Villas at Rensch, and Villas at Chestnut Ridge are student apartment communities adjacent to the North Campus and offer a shuttle service.

[ 128 ] Collegiate Village off campus apartments offers transportation to both North and South Campus.

[ 129 ] Students also find housing in private locations. Those locations are generally situated in the University Heights district of Buffalo, and other areas close to the North and South Campuses. The school assigns rooms based on a lottery system.

The Bulls were champions of the Mid-American Conference in 2015 , 2016 , 2018 and 2019 and thus earned the automatic bid to March Madness in each of those seasons. In 2018 the Bulls upset No. 4 seed Arizona in the first round of March Madness , advancing to the second round (round of 32) for the first time in school history.

[ 136 ] In the 2018–19 season Buffalo, led by C.J. Massinburg , earned a national ranking for the first time in the Associated Press poll.

[ 137 ] [ 138 ] The basketball team was nationally ranked for most of the season with a high ranking of #11 on both the AP and Coaches Polls. For the second year in a row the Bulls won a game in the NCAA tournament, defeating Arizona State .

[ 139 ] [ 140 ] The women's basketball team won the MAC championship and made their first trip to the NCAA tournament in program history in 2016 .

The team finished with a final ranking of #21 in the Coaches Poll.

[ 141 ] In 2019 , the men's and women's basketball teams both won the MAC championship on the same day, the second time the Bulls had done so in four seasons. The women's team defeated Rutgers in the NCAA tournament in their third appearance in March Madness in four years.

Football [ edit ] Linebacker Khalil Mack from the University at Buffalo The university football team plays their home games at the 31,000+ capacity University at Buffalo Stadium . In 1958, the football team won the Lambert Cup , emblematic of supremacy in Eastern U.S. small-college football. That led to the team's first bowl invitation, to the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando, Florida , against Florida State University . But the Bulls would be allowed to participate only if backup defensive end Mike Wilson and starting halfback Willie Evans , who were black, did not play . The team stood behind the two, and refused the bowl offer. Buffalo did not receive another bowl invitation until the 2008 season when they won the MAC championship against previously undefeated Ball State .

[ 142 ] Several UB football stars from the 1950s and early 1960s went on to play professional football, including quarterback John Stofa with the American Football League 's Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals , and defensive lineman Gerry Philbin with the AFL 's New York Jets . Philbin is a member of the AFL Hall of Fame and the All-time All-AFL Team . Philbin and UB's Willie Ross were the first two UB graduates to play on professional football championship teams in the United States: Ross with the 1964 AFL Champion Buffalo Bills ; and Philbin with the 1968 AFL Champion New York Jets , who also won that season's AFL-NFL World Championship Game ( Super Bowl III ).

James Starks was on the Green Bay Packers Super Bowl XLV champions as a rookie.

Ramon Guzman played on the 2009 Grey Cup champion Montreal Alouettes .

Khalil Mack was selected as the first-round fifth pick in the NFL draft, becoming the first UB football player to be selected in the first round of the NFL Draft . In his time at Buffalo, Mack became the all-time NCAA record for forced fumbles and is also tied for most career tackles for loss in NCAA history.

The 2020 season saw Buffalo ranked in the AP Poll for the first time in program history led by running back Jaret Patterson en route to an undefeated regular season.
