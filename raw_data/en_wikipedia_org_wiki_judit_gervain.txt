[ 4 ] In the same year she was elected Member of the Academia Europaea .

[ 1 ] Research [ edit ] Gervain's research is interdisciplinary, spanning linguistics , psychology and developmental cognitive neuroscience . She has worked on information-theoretic approaches to speech, speech perception , the perceptual and learning abilities of newborns, and early language acquisition .

[ 1 ] The optical brain-monitoring technique functional near-infrared spectroscopy has been a central method in her work.

[ 5 ] Her ERC project BabyRhythm (2018–2023) dealt with how speech prosody lays the foundations for language acquisition in infants, both before and after birth.
