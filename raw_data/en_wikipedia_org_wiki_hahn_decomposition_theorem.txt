For every E ∈ ∈ Σ Σ {\displaystyle E\in \Sigma } such that E ⊆ ⊆ P {\displaystyle E\subseteq P} , one has μ μ ( E ) ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle \mu (E)\geq 0} , i.e., P {\displaystyle P} is a positive set for μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } .

For every E ∈ ∈ Σ Σ {\displaystyle E\in \Sigma } such that E ⊆ ⊆ N {\displaystyle E\subseteq N} , one has μ μ ( E ) ≤ ≤ 0 {\displaystyle \mu (E)\leq 0} , i.e., N {\displaystyle N} is a negative set for μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } .

Moreover, this decomposition is essentially unique , meaning that for any other pair ( P ′ , N ′ ) {\displaystyle (P',N')} of Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subsets of X {\displaystyle X} fulfilling the three conditions above, the symmetric differences P △ △ P ′ {\displaystyle P\triangle P'} and N △ △ N ′ {\displaystyle N\triangle N'} are μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } - null sets in the strong sense that every Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subset of them has zero measure. The pair ( P , N ) {\displaystyle (P,N)} is then called a Hahn decomposition of the signed measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } .

Jordan measure decomposition [ edit ] A consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is the Jordan decomposition theorem , which states that every signed measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } defined on Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } has a unique decomposition into a difference μ μ = μ μ + − − μ μ − − {\displaystyle \mu =\mu ^{+}-\mu ^{-}} of two positive measures, μ μ + {\displaystyle \mu ^{+}} and μ μ − − {\displaystyle \mu ^{-}} , at least one of which is finite, such that μ μ + ( E ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\mu ^{+}}(E)=0} for every Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subset E ⊆ ⊆ N {\displaystyle E\subseteq N} and μ μ − − ( E ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\mu ^{-}}(E)=0} for every Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subset E ⊆ ⊆ P {\displaystyle E\subseteq P} , for any Hahn decomposition ( P , N ) {\displaystyle (P,N)} of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } . We call μ μ + {\displaystyle \mu ^{+}} and μ μ − − {\displaystyle \mu ^{-}} the positive and negative part of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } , respectively. The pair ( μ μ + , μ μ − − ) {\displaystyle (\mu ^{+},\mu ^{-})} is called a Jordan decomposition (or sometimes Hahn–Jordan decomposition ) of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } . The two measures can be defined as μ μ + ( E ) := μ μ ( E ∩ ∩ P ) and μ μ − − ( E ) := − − μ μ ( E ∩ ∩ N ) {\displaystyle {\mu ^{+}}(E):=\mu (E\cap P)\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad {\mu ^{-}}(E):=-\mu (E\cap N)} for every E ∈ ∈ Σ Σ {\displaystyle E\in \Sigma } and any Hahn decomposition ( P , N ) {\displaystyle (P,N)} of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } .

Note that the Jordan decomposition is unique, while the Hahn decomposition is only essentially unique.

The Jordan decomposition has the following corollary: Given a Jordan decomposition ( μ μ + , μ μ − − ) {\displaystyle (\mu ^{+},\mu ^{-})} of a finite signed measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } , one has μ μ + ( E ) = sup B ∈ ∈ Σ Σ , B ⊆ ⊆ E μ μ ( B ) and μ μ − − ( E ) = − − inf B ∈ ∈ Σ Σ , B ⊆ ⊆ E μ μ ( B ) {\displaystyle {\mu ^{+}}(E)=\sup _{B\in \Sigma ,~B\subseteq E}\mu (B)\quad {\text{and}}\quad {\mu ^{-}}(E)=-\inf _{B\in \Sigma ,~B\subseteq E}\mu (B)} for any E {\displaystyle E} in Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } . Furthermore, if μ μ = ν ν + − − ν ν − − {\displaystyle \mu =\nu ^{+}-\nu ^{-}} for a pair ( ν ν + , ν ν − − ) {\displaystyle (\nu ^{+},\nu ^{-})} of finite non-negative measures on X {\displaystyle X} , then ν ν + ≥ ≥ μ μ + and ν ν − − ≥ ≥ μ μ − − .

{\displaystyle \nu ^{+}\geq \mu ^{+}\quad {\text{and}}\quad \nu ^{-}\geq \mu ^{-}.} The last expression means that the Jordan decomposition is the minimal decomposition of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } into a difference of non-negative measures. This is the minimality property of the Jordan decomposition.

Proof of the Jordan decomposition: For an elementary proof of the existence, uniqueness, and minimality of the Jordan measure decomposition see Fischer (2012) .

Proof of the Hahn decomposition theorem [ edit ] Preparation: Assume that μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } does not take the value − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } (otherwise decompose according to − − μ μ {\displaystyle -\mu } ). As mentioned above, a negative set is a set A ∈ ∈ Σ Σ {\displaystyle A\in \Sigma } such that μ μ ( B ) ≤ ≤ 0 {\displaystyle \mu (B)\leq 0} for every Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subset B ⊆ ⊆ A {\displaystyle B\subseteq A} .

Claim: Suppose that D ∈ ∈ Σ Σ {\displaystyle D\in \Sigma } satisfies μ μ ( D ) ≤ ≤ 0 {\displaystyle \mu (D)\leq 0} . Then there is a negative set A ⊆ ⊆ D {\displaystyle A\subseteq D} such that μ μ ( A ) ≤ ≤ μ μ ( D ) {\displaystyle \mu (A)\leq \mu (D)} .

Proof of the claim: Define A 0 := D {\displaystyle A_{0}:=D} .

Inductively assume for n ∈ ∈ N 0 {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} _{0}} that A n ⊆ ⊆ D {\displaystyle A_{n}\subseteq D} has been constructed. Let t n := sup ( { μ μ ( B ) ∣ ∣ B ∈ ∈ Σ Σ and B ⊆ ⊆ A n } ) {\displaystyle t_{n}:=\sup(\{\mu (B)\mid B\in \Sigma ~{\text{and}}~B\subseteq A_{n}\})} denote the supremum of μ μ ( B ) {\displaystyle \mu (B)} over all the Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subsets B {\displaystyle B} of A n {\displaystyle A_{n}} . This supremum might a priori be infinite. As the empty set ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \varnothing } is a possible candidate for B {\displaystyle B} in the definition of t n {\displaystyle t_{n}} , and as μ μ ( ∅ ∅ ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu (\varnothing )=0} , we have t n ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle t_{n}\geq 0} . By the definition of t n {\displaystyle t_{n}} , there then exists a Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subset B n ⊆ ⊆ A n {\displaystyle B_{n}\subseteq A_{n}} satisfying μ μ ( B n ) ≥ ≥ min ( 1 , t n 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (B_{n})\geq \min \!\left(1,{\frac {t_{n}}{2}}\right).} Set A n + 1 := A n ∖ ∖ B n {\displaystyle A_{n+1}:=A_{n}\setminus B_{n}} to finish the induction step. Finally, define A := D \ ⋃ ⋃ n = 0 ∞ ∞ B n .

{\displaystyle A:=D{\Bigg \backslash }\bigcup _{n=0}^{\infty }B_{n}.} As the sets ( B n ) n = 0 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle (B_{n})_{n=0}^{\infty }} are disjoint subsets of D {\displaystyle D} , it follows from the sigma additivity of the signed measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } that μ μ ( D ) = μ μ ( A ) + ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ μ μ ( B n ) ≥ ≥ μ μ ( A ) + ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ min ( 1 , t n 2 ) ≥ ≥ μ μ ( A ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (D)=\mu (A)+\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\mu (B_{n})\geq \mu (A)+\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\min \!\left(1,{\frac {t_{n}}{2}}\right)\geq \mu (A).} This shows that μ μ ( A ) ≤ ≤ μ μ ( D ) {\displaystyle \mu (A)\leq \mu (D)} . Assume A {\displaystyle A} were not a negative set. This means that there would exist a Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subset B ⊆ ⊆ A {\displaystyle B\subseteq A} that satisfies μ μ ( B ) > 0 {\displaystyle \mu (B)>0} . Then t n ≥ ≥ μ μ ( B ) {\displaystyle t_{n}\geq \mu (B)} for every n ∈ ∈ N 0 {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} _{0}} , so the series on the right would have to diverge to + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } , implying that μ μ ( D ) = + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mu (D)=+\infty } , which is a contradiction, since μ μ ( D ) ≤ ≤ 0 {\displaystyle \mu (D)\leq 0} . Therefore, A {\displaystyle A} must be a negative set.

Construction of the decomposition: Set N 0 = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle N_{0}=\varnothing } . Inductively, given N n {\displaystyle N_{n}} , define s n := inf ( { μ μ ( D ) ∣ ∣ D ∈ ∈ Σ Σ and D ⊆ ⊆ X ∖ ∖ N n } ) .

{\displaystyle s_{n}:=\inf(\{\mu (D)\mid D\in \Sigma ~{\text{and}}~D\subseteq X\setminus N_{n}\}).} as the infimum of μ μ ( D ) {\displaystyle \mu (D)} over all the Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subsets D {\displaystyle D} of X ∖ ∖ N n {\displaystyle X\setminus N_{n}} . This infimum might a priori be − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } . As ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \varnothing } is a possible candidate for D {\displaystyle D} in the definition of s n {\displaystyle s_{n}} , and as μ μ ( ∅ ∅ ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu (\varnothing )=0} , we have s n ≤ ≤ 0 {\displaystyle s_{n}\leq 0} . Hence, there exists a Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subset D n ⊆ ⊆ X ∖ ∖ N n {\displaystyle D_{n}\subseteq X\setminus N_{n}} such that μ μ ( D n ) ≤ ≤ max ( s n 2 , − − 1 ) ≤ ≤ 0.

{\displaystyle \mu (D_{n})\leq \max \!\left({\frac {s_{n}}{2}},-1\right)\leq 0.} By the claim above, there is a negative set A n ⊆ ⊆ D n {\displaystyle A_{n}\subseteq D_{n}} such that μ μ ( A n ) ≤ ≤ μ μ ( D n ) {\displaystyle \mu (A_{n})\leq \mu (D_{n})} . Set N n + 1 := N n ∪ ∪ A n {\displaystyle N_{n+1}:=N_{n}\cup A_{n}} to finish the induction step. Finally, define N := ⋃ ⋃ n = 0 ∞ ∞ A n .

{\displaystyle N:=\bigcup _{n=0}^{\infty }A_{n}.} As the sets ( A n ) n = 0 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle (A_{n})_{n=0}^{\infty }} are disjoint, we have for every Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subset B ⊆ ⊆ N {\displaystyle B\subseteq N} that μ μ ( B ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ μ μ ( B ∩ ∩ A n ) {\displaystyle \mu (B)=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\mu (B\cap A_{n})} by the sigma additivity of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } . In particular, this shows that N {\displaystyle N} is a negative set. Next, define P := X ∖ ∖ N {\displaystyle P:=X\setminus N} . If P {\displaystyle P} were not a positive set, there would exist a Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subset D ⊆ ⊆ P {\displaystyle D\subseteq P} with μ μ ( D ) < 0 {\displaystyle \mu (D)<0} . Then s n ≤ ≤ μ μ ( D ) {\displaystyle s_{n}\leq \mu (D)} for all n ∈ ∈ N 0 {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} _{0}} and [ clarification needed ] μ μ ( N ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ μ μ ( A n ) ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ max ( s n 2 , − − 1 ) = − − ∞ ∞ , {\displaystyle \mu (N)=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\mu (A_{n})\leq \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\max \!\left({\frac {s_{n}}{2}},-1\right)=-\infty ,} which is not allowed for μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } . Therefore, P {\displaystyle P} is a positive set.

Proof of the uniqueness statement: Suppose that ( N ′ , P ′ ) {\displaystyle (N',P')} is another Hahn decomposition of X {\displaystyle X} . Then P ∩ ∩ N ′ {\displaystyle P\cap N'} is a positive set and also a negative set. Therefore, every measurable subset of it has measure zero. The same applies to N ∩ ∩ P ′ {\displaystyle N\cap P'} . As P △ △ P ′ = N △ △ N ′ = ( P ∩ ∩ N ′ ) ∪ ∪ ( N ∩ ∩ P ′ ) , {\displaystyle P\triangle P'=N\triangle N'=(P\cap N')\cup (N\cap P'),} this completes the proof.
