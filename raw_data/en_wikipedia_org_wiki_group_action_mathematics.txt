The [cyclic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group "Cyclic group")C 3 consisting of the [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)") by 0°, 120° and 240° acts on the set of the three vertices.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **group action** of a group ![Image 2: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) on a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)")![Image 3: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2) is a [group homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homomorphism "Group homomorphism") from ![Image 4: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) to some group (under [function composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition")) of functions from ![Image 5: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2) to itself. It is said that ![Image 6: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b)**acts** on ![Image 7: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2).

Many sets of [transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(function) "Transformation (function)") form a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") under [function composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition"); for example, the [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)") around a point in the plane. It is often useful to consider the group as an [abstract group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_group "Abstract group"), and to say that one has a group action of the abstract group that consists of performing the transformations of the group of transformations. The reason for distinguishing the group from the transformations is that, generally, a group of transformations of a [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure "Mathematical structure") acts also on various related structures; for example, the above rotation group also acts on triangles by transforming triangles into triangles.

If a group acts on a structure, it will usually also act on objects built from that structure. For example, the group of [Euclidean isometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_isometry "Euclidean isometry") acts on [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") and also on the figures drawn in it; in particular, it acts on the set of all [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle"). Similarly, the group of [symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetries "Symmetries") of a [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") acts on the [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)"), the [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(geometry) "Edge (geometry)"), and the [faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry) "Face (geometry)") of the polyhedron.

A group action on a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") is called a [representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation "Group representation") of the group. In the case of a finite-dimensional vector space, it allows one to identify many groups with [subgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroups "Subgroups") of the [general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group")![Image 8: {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (n,K)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2db88d5e706cd229bf26271ee6d2eafec92c5d8), the group of the [invertible matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrices "Invertible matrices") of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")![Image 9: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) over a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")![Image 10: {\displaystyle K}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0).

The [symmetric group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group "Symmetric group")![Image 11: {\displaystyle S_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9f049ac28d4ac8097b625f9d71c1f22b2ebd1bc4) acts on any [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") with ![Image 12: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) elements by permuting the elements of the set. Although the group of all [permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation "Permutation") of a set depends formally on the set, the concept of group action allows one to consider a single group for studying the permutations of all sets with the same [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality "Cardinality").

If ![Image 13: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) is a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") with [identity element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element "Identity element")![Image 14: {\displaystyle e}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cd253103f0876afc68ebead27a5aa9867d927467), and ![Image 15: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is a set, then a (_left_) _group action_![Image 16: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3) of ![Image 17: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) on X is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")

![Image 18: {\displaystyle \alpha :G\times X\to X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/598eec4c225ac61765d42b71d3ce06a469d5518f)
that satisfies the following two [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axioms "Axioms"):[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-1)

for all g and h in G and all x in ![Image 19: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab).

The group ![Image 20: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) is then said to act on ![Image 21: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) (from the left). A set ![Image 22: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) together with an action of ![Image 23: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) is called a (_left_) ![Image 24: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b)-_set_.

It can be notationally convenient to [curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying "Currying") the action ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3), so that, instead, one has a collection of [transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(geometry) "Transformation (geometry)")_α_ _g_: _X_ → _X_, with one transformation _α_ _g_ for each group element _g_ ∈ _G_. The identity and compatibility relations then read

![Image 26: {\displaystyle \alpha _{e}(x)=x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5d879f406b55745b0266e93fa0993c36dacbeb9)
and

![Image 27: {\displaystyle \alpha _{g}(\alpha _{h}(x))=(\alpha _{g}\circ \alpha _{h})(x)=\alpha _{gh}(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8cc509b62b21ace4715c3a05c229cfacca89065d)
The second axiom states that the function composition is compatible with the group multiplication; they form a [commutative diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_diagram "Commutative diagram"). This axiom can be shortened even further, and written as ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \alpha _{g}\circ \alpha _{h}=\alpha _{gh}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a96475a34651750e251137d32e88bfb66d1a7711).

With the above understanding, it is very common to avoid writing ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3) entirely, and to replace it with either a dot, or with nothing at all. Thus, _α_(_g_, _x_) can be shortened to _g_⋅_x_ or _gx_, especially when the action is clear from context. The axioms are then

![Image 30: {\displaystyle e{\cdot }x=x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e9ceb0477ff18e21bd41f3f6c331c03cde4a898)![Image 31: {\displaystyle g{\cdot }(h{\cdot }x)=(gh){\cdot }x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/901503f3f767332e832b09c0b695a49d278c94d8)
From these two axioms, it follows that for any fixed g in ![Image 32: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b), the function from X to itself which maps x to _g_⋅_x_ is a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection"), with inverse bijection the corresponding map for _g_−1. Therefore, one may equivalently define a group action of G on X as a group homomorphism from G into the symmetric group Sym(_X_) of all bijections from X to itself.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-2)

Likewise, a _right group action_ of ![Image 33: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) on ![Image 34: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is a function

![Image 35: {\displaystyle \alpha :X\times G\to X,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e61498147c50e65dea76103deca92d4e00959638)
that satisfies the analogous axioms:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-3)

(with _α_(_x_, _g_) often shortened to _xg_ or _x_⋅_g_ when the action being considered is clear from context)

for all g and h in G and all x in X.

The difference between left and right actions is in the order in which a product _gh_ acts on x. For a left action, h acts first, followed by g second. For a right action, g acts first, followed by h second. Because of the formula (_gh_)−1 = _h_−1 _g_−1, a left action can be constructed from a right action by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, a right action of a group G on X can be considered as a left action of its [opposite group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposite_group "Opposite group")_G_ op on X.

Thus, for establishing general properties of group actions, it suffices to consider only left actions. However, there are cases where this is not possible. For example, the multiplication of a group [induces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_representation "Induced representation") both a left action and a right action on the group itself—multiplication on the left and on the right, respectively.

Notable properties of actions
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Group_action&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Notable properties of actions")]

Let _G_ be a group acting on a set _X_. The action is called _faithful_ or _effective_ if _g_⋅_x_ = _x_ for all _x_ ∈ _X_ implies that _g_ = _e_ _G_. Equivalently, the [homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism "Homomorphism") from _G_ to the group of bijections of _X_ corresponding to the action is [injective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective "Injective").

The action is called _free_ (or _semiregular_ or _fixed-point free_) if the statement that _g_⋅_x_ = _x_ for some _x_ ∈ _X_ already implies that _g_ = _e_ _G_. In other words, no non-trivial element of _G_ fixes a point of _X_. This is a much stronger property than faithfulness.

For example, the action of any group on itself by left multiplication is free. This observation implies [Cayley's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%27s_theorem "Cayley's theorem") that any group can be [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") in a symmetric group (which is infinite when the group is). A finite group may act faithfully on a set of size much smaller than its cardinality (however such an action cannot be free). For instance the abelian 2-group (**Z** / 2**Z**)_n_ (of cardinality 2 _n_) acts faithfully on a set of size 2 _n_. This is not always the case, for example the [cyclic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group "Cyclic group")**Z** / 2 _n_**Z** cannot act faithfully on a set of size less than 2 _n_.

In general the smallest set on which a faithful action can be defined can vary greatly for groups of the same size. For example, three groups of size 120 are the symmetric group S 5, the icosahedral group A 5 × **Z** / 2**Z** and the cyclic group **Z** / 120**Z**. The smallest sets on which faithful actions can be defined for these groups are of size 5, 7, and 16 respectively.

### Transitivity properties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Group_action&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Transitivity properties")]

The action of _G_ on _X_ is called _transitive_ if for any two points _x_, _y_ ∈ _X_ there exists a _g_ ∈ _G_ so that _g_ ⋅ _x_ = _y_.

The action is _simply transitive_ (or _sharply transitive_, or _regular_) if it is both transitive and free. This means that given _x_, _y_ ∈ _X_ there is exactly one _g_ ∈ _G_ such that _g_ ⋅ _x_ = _y_. If _X_ is acted upon simply transitively by a group _G_ then it is called a [principal homogeneous space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_homogeneous_space "Principal homogeneous space") for _G_ or a _G_-torsor.

For an integer _n_ ≥ 1, the action is _n-transitive_ if _X_ has at least _n_ elements, and for any pair of _n_-tuples (_x_ 1, ..., _x_ _n_), (_y_ 1, ..., _y_ _n_) ∈ _X_ _n_ with pairwise distinct entries (that is _x_ _i_ ≠ _x_ _j_, _y_ _i_ ≠ _y_ _j_ when _i_ ≠ _j_) there exists a _g_ ∈ _G_ such that _g_⋅_x_ _i_ = _y_ _i_ for _i_ = 1, ..., _n_. In other words, the action on the subset of _X_ _n_ of tuples without repeated entries is transitive. For _n_ = 2, 3 this is often called double, respectively triple, transitivity. The class of [2-transitive groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-transitive_group "2-transitive group") (that is, subgroups of a finite symmetric group whose action is 2-transitive) and more generally [multiply transitive groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply_transitive_group "Multiply transitive group") is well-studied in finite group theory.

An action is _sharply n-transitive_ when the action on tuples without repeated entries in _X_ _n_ is sharply transitive.

The action of the symmetric group of _X_ is transitive, in fact _n_-transitive for any _n_ up to the cardinality of _X_. If _X_ has cardinality _n_, the action of the [alternating group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_group "Alternating group") is (_n_ − 2)-transitive but not (_n_ − 1)-transitive.

The action of the [general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group") of a vector space _V_ on the set _V_ ∖ {0} of non-zero vectors is transitive, but not 2-transitive (similarly for the action of the [special linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_linear_group "Special linear group") if the dimension of _v_ is at least 2). The action of the [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group") of a Euclidean space is not transitive on nonzero vectors but it is on the [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere").

The action of _G_ on _X_ is called _primitive_ if there is no [partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set "Partition of a set") of _X_ preserved by all elements of _G_ apart from the trivial partitions (the partition in a single piece and its [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space "Dual space"), the partition into [singletons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(mathematics) "Singleton (mathematics)")).

### Topological properties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Group_action&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Topological properties")]

Assume that _X_ is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") and the action of _G_ is by [homeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism").

The action is _wandering_ if every _x_ ∈ _X_ has a [neighbourhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)")_U_ such that there are only finitely many _g_ ∈ _G_ with _g_⋅_U_ ∩ _U_ ≠ ∅.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThurston1997Definition_3.5.1(iv)-4)

More generally, a point _x_ ∈ _X_ is called a point of discontinuity for the action of _G_ if there is an open subset _U_ ∋ _x_ such that there are only finitely many _g_ ∈ _G_ with _g_⋅_U_ ∩ _U_ ≠ ∅. The _domain of discontinuity_ of the action is the set of all points of discontinuity. Equivalently it is the largest _G_-stable open subset Ω ⊂ _X_ such that the action of _G_ on Ω is wandering.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKapovich2009p._73-5) In a dynamical context this is also called a _[wandering set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering\_set "Wandering set")_.

The action is _properly discontinuous_ if for every [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") subset _K_ ⊂ _X_ there are only finitely many _g_ ∈ _G_ such that _g_⋅_K_ ∩ _K_ ≠ ∅. This is strictly stronger than wandering; for instance the action of **Z** on **R**2 ∖ {(0, 0)} given by _n_⋅(_x_, _y_) = (2 _n_ _x_, 2−_n_ _y_) is wandering and free but not properly discontinuous.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThurston1980176-6)

The action by [deck transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_transformation "Deck transformation") of the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") of a locally [simply connected space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected_space "Simply connected space") on a [universal cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space#Universal_covering "Covering space") is wandering and free. Such actions can be characterized by the following property: every _x_ ∈ _X_ has a neighbourhood _U_ such that _g_⋅_U_ ∩ _U_ = ∅ for every _g_ ∈ _G_ ∖ {_e_ _G_}.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHatcher2002p._72-7) Actions with this property are sometimes called _freely discontinuous_, and the largest subset on which the action is freely discontinuous is then called the _free regular set_.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaskit1988II.A.1,_II.A.2-8)

An action of a group _G_ on a [locally compact space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact_space "Locally compact space")_X_ is called _[cocompact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocompact\_group\_action "Cocompact group action")_ if there exists a compact subset _A_ ⊂ _X_ such that _X_ = _G_ ⋅ _A_. For a properly discontinuous action, cocompactness is equivalent to compactness of the [quotient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(topology) "Quotient space (topology)")_X_ / _G_.

### Actions of topological groups

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Group_action&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Actions of topological groups")]

Now assume _G_ is a [topological group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_group "Topological group") and _X_ a topological space on which it acts by homeomorphisms. The action is said to be _continuous_ if the map _G_ × _X_ → _X_ is continuous for the [product topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology "Product topology").

The action is said to be _proper_ if the map _G_ × _X_ → _X_ × _X_ defined by (_g_, _x_) ↦ (_x_, _g_⋅_x_) is [proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_map "Proper map").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEtom_Dieck1987-9) This means that given compact sets _K_, _K_′ the set of _g_ ∈ _G_ such that _g_⋅_K_ ∩ _K_′ ≠ ∅ is compact. In particular, this is equivalent to proper discontinuity if _G_ is a [discrete group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_group "Discrete group").

It is said to be _locally free_ if there exists a neighbourhood _U_ of _e_ _G_ such that _g_⋅_x_ ≠ _x_ for all _x_ ∈ _X_ and _g_ ∈ _U_ ∖ {_e_ _G_}.

The action is said to be _strongly continuous_ if the orbital map _g_ ↦ _g_⋅_x_ is continuous for every _x_ ∈ _X_. Contrary to what the name suggests, this is a weaker property than continuity of the action.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

If _G_ is a [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") and _X_ a [differentiable manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"), then the subspace of _smooth points_ for the action is the set of points _x_ ∈ _X_ such that the map _g_ ↦ _g_⋅_x_ is [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_map "Smooth map"). There is a well-developed theory of [Lie group actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group_action "Lie group action"), i.e. action which are smooth on the whole space.

If _g_ acts by [linear transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map") on a [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics) "Module (mathematics)") over a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring"), the action is said to be [irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_representation "Irreducible representation") if there are no proper nonzero _g_-invariant submodules. It is said to be _[semisimple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-simplicity "Semi-simplicity")_ if it decomposes as a [direct sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_sum "Direct sum") of irreducible actions.

In the [compound of five tetrahedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_of_five_tetrahedra "Compound of five tetrahedra"), the symmetry group is the (rotational) icosahedral group _I_ of order 60, while the stabilizer of a single chosen tetrahedron is the (rotational) [tetrahedral group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedral_group "Tetrahedral group")_T_ of order 12, and the orbit space _I_ / _T_ (of order 60/12=5) is naturally identified with the 5 tetrahedra – the coset _gT_ corresponds to the tetrahedron to which _g_ sends the chosen tetrahedron.

Consider a group _G_ acting on a set _X_. The _orbit_ of an element _x_ in _X_ is the set of elements in _X_ to which _x_ can be moved by the elements of _G_. The orbit of _x_ is denoted by _G_⋅_x_: ![Image 37: {\displaystyle G{\cdot }x=\{g{\cdot }x:g\in G\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cf07be5473d2e0459718618f2c1f0f380ec880c3)

The defining properties of a group guarantee that the set of orbits of (points _x_ in) _X_ under the action of _G_ form a [partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set "Partition of a set") of _X_. The associated [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") is defined by saying _x_ ~ _y_[if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") there exists a _g_ in _G_ with _g_⋅_x_ = _y_. The orbits are then the [equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") under this relation; two elements _x_ and _y_ are equivalent if and only if their orbits are the same, that is, _G_⋅_x_ = _G_⋅_y_.

The group action is [transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#Notable_properties_of_actions "Group action (mathematics)") if and only if it has exactly one orbit, that is, if there exists _x_ in _X_ with _G_⋅_x_ = _X_. This is the case if and only if _G_⋅_x_ = _X_ for _all_ _x_ in _X_ (given that _X_ is non-empty).

The set of all orbits of _X_ under the action of _G_ is written as _X_ / _G_ (or, less frequently, as _G_ \ _X_), and is called the _quotient_ of the action. In geometric situations it may be called the _orbit space_, while in algebraic situations it may be called the space of _coinvariants_, and written _X_ _G_, by contrast with the invariants (fixed points), denoted _X_ _G_: the coinvariants are a _quotient_ while the invariants are a _subset_. The coinvariant terminology and notation are used particularly in [group cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_cohomology "Group cohomology") and [group homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homology "Group homology"), which use the same superscript/subscript convention.

If _Y_ is a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of _X_, then _G_⋅_Y_ denotes the set {_g_⋅_y_: _g_ ∈ _G_ and _y_ ∈ _Y_}. The subset _Y_ is said to be _invariant under_ _G_ if _G_⋅_Y_ = _Y_ (which is equivalent _G_⋅_Y_ ⊆ _Y_). In that case, _G_ also operates on _Y_ by [restricting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_(mathematics) "Restriction (mathematics)") the action to _Y_. The subset _Y_ is called _fixed under_ _G_ if _g_⋅_y_ = _y_ for all _g_ in _G_ and all _y_ in _Y_. Every subset that is fixed under _G_ is also invariant under _G_, but not conversely.

Every orbit is an invariant subset of _X_ on which _G_ acts [transitively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#Notable_properties_of_actions "Group action (mathematics)"). Conversely, any invariant subset of _X_ is a union of orbits. The action of _G_ on _X_ is _transitive_ if and only if all elements are equivalent, meaning that there is only one orbit.

A _G_ _-invariant_ element of _X_ is _x_ ∈ _X_ such that _g_⋅_x_ = _x_ for all _g_ ∈ _G_. The set of all such _x_ is denoted _X_ _G_ and called the _G_ _-invariants_ of _X_. When _X_ is a [_G_-module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-module "G-module"), _X_ _G_ is the zeroth [cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_cohomology "Group cohomology") group of _G_ with coefficients in _X_, and the higher cohomology groups are the [derived functors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_functor "Derived functor") of the [functor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor "Functor") of _G_-invariants.

### Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Group_action&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups")]

Given _g_ in _G_ and _x_ in _X_ with _g_⋅_x_ = _x_, it is said that "_x_ is a fixed point of _g_" or that "_g_ fixes _x_". For every _x_ in _X_, the **stabilizer subgroup** of _G_ with respect to _x_ (also called the **isotropy group** or **little group**[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-Procesi-10)) is the set of all elements in _G_ that fix _x_: ![Image 38: {\displaystyle G_{x}=\{g\in G:g{\cdot }x=x\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a84445f34b016a3662405602af20a618e4ad1861) This is a [subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup "Subgroup") of _G_, though typically not a normal one. The action of _G_ on _X_ is [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#Notable_properties_of_actions "Group action (mathematics)") if and only if all stabilizers are trivial. The kernel _N_ of the homomorphism with the symmetric group, _G_ → Sym(_X_), is given by the [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory) "Intersection (set theory)") of the stabilizers _G_ _x_ for all _x_ in _X_. If _N_ is trivial, the action is said to be faithful (or effective).

Let _x_ and _y_ be two elements in _X_, and let _g_ be a group element such that _y_ = _g_⋅_x_. Then the two stabilizer groups _G_ _x_ and _G_ _y_ are related by _G_ _y_ = _gG_ _x_ _g_−1.

Proof: by definition, _h_ ∈ _G_ _y_ if and only if _h_⋅(_g_⋅_x_) = _g_⋅_x_. Applying _g_−1 to both sides of this equality yields (_g_−1 _hg_)⋅_x_ = _x_; that is, _g_−1 _hg_ ∈ _G_ _x_.

An opposite inclusion follows similarly by taking _h_ ∈ _G_ _x_ and _x_ = _g_−1⋅_y_.

The above says that the stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are [conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugacy_class "Conjugacy class") to each other. Thus, to each orbit, we can associate a [conjugacy class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugacy_class "Conjugacy class") of a subgroup of _G_ (that is, the set of all conjugates of the subgroup). Let (_H_) denote the conjugacy class of _H_. Then the orbit _O_ has type (_H_) if the stabilizer _G_ _x_ of some/any _x_ in _O_ belongs to (_H_). A maximal orbit type is often called a [principal orbit type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_orbit_type "Principal orbit type").

### Orbit–stabilizer theorem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Group_action&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Orbit–stabilizer theorem")]

Orbits and stabilizers are closely related. For a fixed _x_ in _X_, consider the map _f_: _G_ → _X_ given by _g_ ↦ _g_⋅_x_. By definition the image _f_(_G_) of this map is the orbit _G_⋅_x_. The condition for two elements to have the same image is ![Image 39: {\displaystyle f(g)=f(h)\iff g{\cdot }x=h{\cdot }x\iff g^{-1}h{\cdot }x=x\iff g^{-1}h\in G_{x}\iff h\in gG_{x}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2abb119ece1b4cabc0f87b562bc3441c50c8f755) In other words, _f_(_g_) = _f_(_h_)_if and only if_ _g_ and _h_ lie in the same [coset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coset "Coset") for the stabilizer subgroup _G_ _x_. Thus, the [fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(mathematics) "Fiber (mathematics)")_f_−1({_y_}) of _f_ over any _y_ in _G_⋅_x_ is contained in such a coset, and every such coset also occurs as a fiber. Therefore _f_ induces a _bijection_ between the set _G_ / _G_ _x_ of cosets for the stabilizer subgroup and the orbit _G_⋅_x_, which sends _gG_ _x_ ↦ _g_⋅_x_.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-11) This result is known as the _orbit–stabilizer theorem_.

If _G_ is finite then the orbit–stabilizer theorem, together with [Lagrange's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_theorem_(group_theory) "Lagrange's theorem (group theory)"), gives ![Image 40: {\displaystyle |G\cdot x|=[G\,:\,G_{x}]=|G|/|G_{x}|,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb2cf9bb1f43b44e6798feefb9854929e9dcdc33) in other words the length of the orbit of _x_ times the order of its stabilizer is the [order of the group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(group_theory) "Order (group theory)"). In particular that implies that the orbit length is a divisor of the group order.

**Example:** Let _G_ be a group of prime order _p_ acting on a set _X_ with _k_ elements. Since each orbit has either 1 or _p_ elements, there are at least _k_ mod _p_ orbits of length 1 which are _G_-invariant elements. More specifically, _k_ and the number of _G_-invariant elements are congruent modulo _p_.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-12)
This result is especially useful since it can be employed for counting arguments (typically in situations where _X_ is finite as well).

[![Image 41](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Labeled_cube_graph.png/250px-Labeled_cube_graph.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Labeled_cube_graph.png)

Cubical graph with vertices labeled

**Example:** We can use the orbit–stabilizer theorem to count the automorphisms of a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)"). Consider the [cubical graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubical_graph "Cubical graph") as pictured, and let _G_ denote its [automorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_automorphism "Graph automorphism") group. Then _G_ acts on the set of vertices {1, 2, ..., 8}, and this action is transitive as can be seen by composing rotations about the center of the cube. Thus, by the orbit–stabilizer theorem, |_G_| = |_G_ ⋅ 1| |_G_ 1| = 8 |_G_ 1|. Applying the theorem now to the stabilizer _G_ 1, we can obtain |_G_ 1| = |(_G_ 1) ⋅ 2| |(_G_ 1)2|. Any element of _G_ that fixes 1 must send 2 to either 2, 4, or 5. As an example of such automorphisms consider the rotation around the diagonal axis through 1 and 7 by 2 _π_/3, which permutes 2, 4, 5 and 3, 6, 8, and fixes 1 and 7. Thus, |(_G_ 1) ⋅ 2| = 3. Applying the theorem a third time gives |(_G_ 1)2| = |((_G_ 1)2) ⋅ 3| |((_G_ 1)2)3|. Any element of _G_ that fixes 1 and 2 must send 3 to either 3 or 6. Reflecting the cube at the plane through 1, 2, 7 and 8 is such an automorphism sending 3 to 6, thus |((_G_ 1)2) ⋅ 3| = 2. One also sees that ((_G_ 1)2)3 consists only of the identity automorphism, as any element of _G_ fixing 1, 2 and 3 must also fix all other vertices, since they are determined by their adjacency to 1, 2 and 3. Combining the preceding calculations, we can now obtain |G| = 8 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 1 = 48.
A result closely related to the orbit–stabilizer theorem is [Burnside's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_lemma "Burnside's lemma"): ![Image 42: {\displaystyle |X/G|={\frac {1}{|G|}}\sum _{g\in G}|X^{g}|,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8e179e15955324945461f18a84260256e5deb0d3) where _X_ _g_ is the set of points fixed by _g_. This result is mainly of use when _G_ and _X_ are finite, when it can be interpreted as follows: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of points fixed per group element.

Fixing a group _G_, the set of formal differences of finite _G_-sets forms a ring called the [Burnside ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside_ring "Burnside ring") of _G_, where addition corresponds to [disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union "Disjoint union"), and multiplication to [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product").

*   The _trivial_ action of any group _G_ on any set _X_ is defined by _g_⋅_x_ = _x_ for all _g_ in _G_ and all _x_ in _X_; that is, every group element induces the [identity permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function "Identity function") on _X_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-13)
*   In every group _G_, left multiplication is an action of _G_ on _G_: _g_⋅_x_ = _gx_ for all _g_, _x_ in _G_.

*   In every group _G_ with subgroup _H_, left multiplication is an action of _G_ on the set of cosets _G_ / _H_: _g_⋅_aH_ = _gaH_ for all _g_, _a_ in _G_.

*   In every group _G_, [conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_automorphism "Inner automorphism") is an action of _G_ on _G_: _g_⋅_x_ = _gxg_−1. An exponential notation is commonly used for the right-action variant: _x g_ = _g_−1 _xg_; it satisfies (_x_ _g_)_h_ = _x_ _gh_.
*   In every group _G_ with subgroup _H_, conjugation is an action of _G_ on conjugates of _H_: _g_⋅_K_ = _gKg_−1 for all _g_ in _G_ and _K_ conjugates of _H_.
*   An action of **Z** on a set _X_ uniquely determines and is determined by an [automorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism "Automorphism") of _X_, given by the action of 1. Similarly, an action of **Z** / 2**Z** on _X_ is equivalent to the data of an [involution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics) "Involution (mathematics)") of _X_.

This is a quotient of the action of the general linear group on projective space.

This is useful, for instance, in studying the action of the large [Mathieu group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_group "Mathieu group") on a 24-set and in studying symmetry in certain models of [finite geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry "Finite geometry").

This _G_-set has the property that its fixed points correspond to equivariant maps _X_ → _Y_; more generally, it is an [exponential object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_object "Exponential object") in the category of _G_-sets.

Group actions and groupoids
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Group_action&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Group actions and groupoids")]

The notion of group action can be encoded by the _action [groupoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupoid "Groupoid")_ _G_′ = _G_ ⋉ _X_ associated to the group action. The stabilizers of the action are the vertex groups of the groupoid and the orbits of the action are its components.

Morphisms and isomorphisms between _G_-sets
-------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Group_action&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Morphisms and isomorphisms between G-sets")]

If _X_ and _Y_ are two _G_-sets, a _morphism_ from _X_ to _Y_ is a function _f_: _X_ → _Y_ such that _f_(_g_⋅_x_) = _g_⋅_f_(_x_) for all _g_ in _G_ and all _x_ in _X_. Morphisms of _G_-sets are also called _[equivariant maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivariant\_map "Equivariant map")_ or _G_-_maps_.

The composition of two morphisms is again a morphism. If a morphism _f_ is bijective, then its inverse is also a morphism. In this case _f_ is called an _[isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism")_, and the two _G_-sets _X_ and _Y_ are called _isomorphic_; for all practical purposes, isomorphic _G_-sets are indistinguishable.

Some example isomorphisms:

*   Every regular _G_ action is isomorphic to the action of _G_ on _G_ given by left multiplication.
*   Every free _G_ action is isomorphic to _G_ × _S_, where _S_ is some set and _G_ acts on _G_ × _S_ by left multiplication on the first coordinate. (_S_ can be taken to be the set of orbits _X_ / _G_.)
*   Every transitive _G_ action is isomorphic to left multiplication by _G_ on the set of left cosets of some subgroup _H_ of _G_. (_H_ can be taken to be the stabilizer group of any element of the original _G_-set.)

With this notion of morphism, the collection of all _G_-sets forms a [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory"); this category is a [Grothendieck topos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_topos "Grothendieck topos") (in fact, assuming a classical [metalogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalogic "Metalogic"), this [topos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topos "Topos") will even be Boolean).

Variants and generalizations
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Group_action&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Variants and generalizations")]

We can also consider actions of [monoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid "Monoid") on sets, by using the same two axioms as above. This does not define bijective maps and equivalence relations however. See [semigroup action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup_action "Semigroup action").

Instead of actions on sets, we can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an arbitrary category: start with an object _X_ of some category, and then define an action on _X_ as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of [endomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomorphisms "Endomorphisms") of _X_. If _X_ has an underlying set, then all definitions and facts stated above can be carried over. For example, if we take the category of vector spaces, we obtain [group representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation "Group representation") in this fashion.

We can view a group _G_ as a category with a single object in which every morphism is [invertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_element "Inverse element").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-15) A (left) group action is then nothing but a (covariant) [functor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor "Functor") from _G_ to the [category of sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_sets "Category of sets"), and a group representation is a functor from _G_ to the [category of vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_vector_spaces "Category of vector spaces").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-16) A morphism between _G_-sets is then a [natural transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_transformation "Natural transformation") between the group action functors.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#cite_note-17) In analogy, an action of a [groupoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupoid "Groupoid") is a functor from the groupoid to the category of sets or to some other category.

In addition to [continuous actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_group_action "Continuous group action") of topological groups on topological spaces, one also often considers [smooth actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group_action "Lie group action") of Lie groups on [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), regular actions of [algebraic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_group "Algebraic group") on [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety"), and [actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group-scheme_action "Group-scheme action") of [group schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_scheme "Group scheme") on [schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)"). All of these are examples of [group objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_object "Group object") acting on objects of their respective category.
