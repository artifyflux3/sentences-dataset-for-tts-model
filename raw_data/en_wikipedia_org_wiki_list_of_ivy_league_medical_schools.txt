All Ivy League medical schools are located in the Northeastern United States and are privately owned and controlled.

Medical Schools [ edit ] At two universities, Dartmouth College and the University of Pennsylvania , medical instruction takes place on a contiguous campus shared with undergraduate students. The medical schools of Brown University , Columbia University , Harvard University , and Yale University are located on independent campuses within the same metropolitan area as their parent institutions' primary campuses.

Cornell University 's school of medicine is located in New York City, at a distance from the university's main campus in Ithaca .

Most of the schools have multiple primary teaching affiliates, although only the most notable ones are listed on this page. Two of the medical schools, Columbia and Cornell, share a medical campus at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, albeit in separate medical centers (Irving and Weill, respectively).

They are some of the oldest institutions of medical education. In 2023, many of the Ivy League schools (as part of a national trend) stopped sending information to the U.S. News medical school rankings ; [ 5 ] as of 2024 all but Yale and Dartmouth chose to withdraw and are currently unranked. Current rankings are listed below.
