[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] More abstractly, it is the study of semimetric spaces and the isometric transformations between them. In this view, it can be considered as a subject within general topology .

[ 4 ] Historically, the first result in distance geometry is Heron's formula in 1st century AD. The modern theory began in 19th century with work by Arthur Cayley , followed by more extensive developments in the 20th century by Karl Menger and others.

Distance geometry problems arise whenever one needs to infer the shape of a configuration of points ( relative positions ) from the distances between them, such as in biology , [ 4 ] sensor networks , [ 5 ] surveying , navigation , cartography , and physics .

Introduction and definitions [ edit ] The concepts of distance geometry will first be explained by describing two particular problems.

Problem of hyperbolic navigation First problem: hyperbolic navigation [ edit ] Consider three ground radio stations A, B, C, whose locations are known. A radio receiver is at an unknown location. The times it takes for a radio signal to travel from the stations to the receiver, t A , t B , t C {\displaystyle t_{A},t_{B},t_{C}} , are unknown, but the time differences, t A − − t B {\displaystyle t_{A}-t_{B}} and t A − − t C {\displaystyle t_{A}-t_{C}} , are known. From them, one knows the distance differences c ( t A − − t B ) {\displaystyle c(t_{A}-t_{B})} and c ( t A − − t C ) {\displaystyle c(t_{A}-t_{C})} , from which the position of the receiver can be found.

Second problem: dimension reduction [ edit ] In data analysis , one is often given a list of data represented as vectors v = ( x 1 , … … , x n ) ∈ ∈ R n {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , and one needs to find out whether they lie within a low-dimensional affine subspace. A low-dimensional representation of data has many advantages, such as saving storage space, computation time, and giving better insight into data.

Definitions [ edit ] Now we formalize some definitions that naturally arise from considering our problems.

Semimetric space [ edit ] Given a list of points on R = { P 0 , … … , P n } {\displaystyle R=\{P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n}\}} , n ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle n\geq 0} , we can arbitrarily specify the distances between pairs of points by a list of d i j > 0 {\displaystyle d_{ij}>0} , 0 ≤ ≤ i < j ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle 0\leq i<j\leq n} . This defines a semimetric space : a metric space without triangle inequality .

Explicitly, we define a semimetric space as a nonempty set R {\displaystyle R} equipped with a semimetric d : R × × R → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle d:R\times R\to [0,\infty )} such that, for all x , y ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle x,y\in R} , Positivity: d ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(x,y)=0} if and only if x = y {\displaystyle x=y} .

Symmetry: d ( x , y ) = d ( y , x ) {\displaystyle d(x,y)=d(y,x)} .

Any metric space is a fortiori a semimetric space. In particular, R k {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{k}} , the k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional Euclidean space , is the canonical metric space in distance geometry.

The triangle inequality is omitted in the definition, because we do not want to enforce more constraints on the distances d i j {\displaystyle d_{ij}} than the mere requirement that they be positive.

In practice, semimetric spaces naturally arise from inaccurate measurements. For example, given three points A , B , C {\displaystyle A,B,C} on a line, with d A B = 1 , d B C = 1 , d A C = 2 {\displaystyle d_{AB}=1,d_{BC}=1,d_{AC}=2} , an inaccurate measurement could give d A B = 0.99 , d B C = 0.98 , d A C = 2.00 {\displaystyle d_{AB}=0.99,d_{BC}=0.98,d_{AC}=2.00} , violating the triangle inequality.

Isometric embedding [ edit ] Given two semimetric spaces, ( R , d ) , ( R ′ , d ′ ) {\displaystyle (R,d),(R',d')} , an isometric embedding from R {\displaystyle R} to R ′ {\displaystyle R'} is a map f : R → → R ′ {\displaystyle f:R\to R'} that preserves the semimetric, that is, for all x , y ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle x,y\in R} , d ( x , y ) = d ′ ( f ( x ) , f ( y ) ) {\displaystyle d(x,y)=d'(f(x),f(y))} .

For example, given the finite semimetric space ( R , d ) {\displaystyle (R,d)} defined above, an isometric embedding from R {\displaystyle R} to R k {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{k}} is defined by points A 0 , A 1 , … … , A n ∈ ∈ R k {\textstyle A_{0},A_{1},\ldots ,A_{n}\in \mathbb {R} ^{k}} , such that d ( A i , A j ) = d i j {\displaystyle d(A_{i},A_{j})=d_{ij}} for all 0 ≤ ≤ i < j ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle 0\leq i<j\leq n} .

Affine independence [ edit ] Given the points A 0 , A 1 , … … , A n ∈ ∈ R k {\textstyle A_{0},A_{1},\ldots ,A_{n}\in \mathbb {R} ^{k}} , they are defined to be affinely independent , iff they cannot fit inside a single l {\displaystyle l} -dimensional affine subspace of R k {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{k}} , for any ℓ ℓ < n {\displaystyle \ell <n} , iff the n {\displaystyle n} - simplex they span, v n {\displaystyle v_{n}} , has positive n {\displaystyle n} -volume, that is, Vol n ⁡ ⁡ ( v n ) > 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Vol} _{n}(v_{n})>0} .

In general, when k ≥ ≥ n {\displaystyle k\geq n} , they are affinely independent, since a generic n -simplex is nondegenerate. For example, 3 points in the plane, in general, are not collinear, because the triangle they span does not degenerate into a line segment. Similarly, 4 points in space, in general, are not coplanar, because the tetrahedron they span does not degenerate into a flat triangle.

When n > k {\displaystyle n>k} , they must be affinely dependent. This can be seen by noting that any n {\displaystyle n} -simplex that can fit inside R k {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{k}} must be "flat".

Cayley–Menger determinants [ edit ] Main article: Cayley–Menger determinant Cayley–Menger determinants, named after Arthur Cayley and Karl Menger, are determinants of matrices of distances between sets of points.

Let A 0 , A 1 , … … , A n {\textstyle A_{0},A_{1},\ldots ,A_{n}} be n + 1 points in a semimetric space, their Cayley–Menger determinant is defined by CM ⁡ ⁡ ( A 0 , ⋯ ⋯ , A n ) = | 0 d 01 2 d 02 2 ⋯ ⋯ d 0 n 2 1 d 01 2 0 d 12 2 ⋯ ⋯ d 1 n 2 1 d 02 2 d 12 2 0 ⋯ ⋯ d 2 n 2 1 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋱ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ d 0 n 2 d 1 n 2 d 2 n 2 ⋯ ⋯ 0 1 1 1 1 ⋯ ⋯ 1 0 | {\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (A_{0},\cdots ,A_{n})={\begin{vmatrix}0&d_{01}^{2}&d_{02}^{2}&\cdots &d_{0n}^{2}&1\\d_{01}^{2}&0&d_{12}^{2}&\cdots &d_{1n}^{2}&1\\d_{02}^{2}&d_{12}^{2}&0&\cdots &d_{2n}^{2}&1\\\vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots &\vdots \\d_{0n}^{2}&d_{1n}^{2}&d_{2n}^{2}&\cdots &0&1\\1&1&1&\cdots &1&0\end{vmatrix}}} If A 0 , A 1 , … … , A n ∈ ∈ R k {\textstyle A_{0},A_{1},\ldots ,A_{n}\in \mathbb {R} ^{k}} , then they make up the vertices of a possibly degenerate n -simplex v n {\displaystyle v_{n}} in R k {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{k}} . It can be shown that [ 6 ] the n -dimensional volume of the simplex v n {\displaystyle v_{n}} satisfies Vol n ⁡ ⁡ ( v n ) 2 = ( − − 1 ) n + 1 ( n !

) 2 2 n CM ⁡ ⁡ ( A 0 , … … , A n ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Vol} _{n}(v_{n})^{2}={\frac {(-1)^{n+1}}{(n!)^{2}2^{n}}}\operatorname {CM} (A_{0},\ldots ,A_{n}).} Note that, for the case of n = 0 {\displaystyle n=0} , we have Vol 0 ⁡ ⁡ ( v 0 ) = 1 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Vol} _{0}(v_{0})=1} , meaning the "0-dimensional volume" of a 0-simplex is 1, that is, there is 1 point in a 0-simplex.

A 0 , A 1 , … … , A n {\textstyle A_{0},A_{1},\ldots ,A_{n}} are affinely independent iff Vol n ⁡ ⁡ ( v n ) > 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Vol} _{n}(v_{n})>0} , that is, ( − − 1 ) n + 1 CM ⁡ ⁡ ( A 0 , … … , A n ) > 0 {\displaystyle (-1)^{n+1}\operatorname {CM} (A_{0},\ldots ,A_{n})>0} . Thus Cayley–Menger determinants give a computational way to prove affine independence.

If k < n {\displaystyle k<n} , then the points must be affinely dependent, thus CM ⁡ ⁡ ( A 0 , … … , A n ) = 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (A_{0},\ldots ,A_{n})=0} . Cayley's 1841 paper studied the special case of k = 3 , n = 4 {\displaystyle k=3,n=4} , that is, any five points A 0 , … … , A 4 {\displaystyle A_{0},\ldots ,A_{4}} in 3-dimensional space must have CM ⁡ ⁡ ( A 0 , … … , A 4 ) = 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (A_{0},\ldots ,A_{4})=0} .

History [ edit ] The first result in distance geometry is Heron's formula , from 1st century AD, which gives the area of a triangle from the distances between its 3 vertices.

Brahmagupta's formula , from 7th century AD, generalizes it to cyclic quadrilaterals .

Tartaglia , from 16th century AD, generalized it to give the volume of tetrahedron from the distances between its 4 vertices.

The modern theory of distance geometry began with Arthur Cayley and Karl Menger .

[ 7 ] Cayley published the Cayley determinant in 1841, [ 8 ] which is a special case of the general Cayley–Menger determinant. Menger proved in 1928 a characterization theorem of all semimetric spaces that are isometrically embeddable in the n -dimensional Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] In 1931, Menger used distance relations to give an axiomatic treatment of Euclidean geometry.

[ 11 ] Leonard Blumenthal 's book [ 12 ] gives a general overview for distance geometry at the graduate level, a large part of which is treated in English for the first time when it was published.

Menger characterization theorem [ edit ] Menger proved the following characterization theorem of semimetric spaces: [ 2 ] A semimetric space ( R , d ) {\displaystyle (R,d)} is isometrically embeddable in the n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , but not in R m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}} for any 0 ≤ ≤ m < n {\displaystyle 0\leq m<n} , if and only if: R {\displaystyle R} contains an ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle (n+1)} -point subset S {\displaystyle S} that is isometric with an affinely independent ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle (n+1)} -point subset of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} ; any ( n + 3 ) {\displaystyle (n+3)} -point subset S ′ {\displaystyle S'} , obtained by adding any two additional points of R {\displaystyle R} to S {\displaystyle S} , is congruent to an ( n + 3 ) {\displaystyle (n+3)} -point subset of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} .

A proof of this theorem in a slightly weakened form (for metric spaces instead of semimetric spaces) is in.

[ 13 ] Characterization via Cayley–Menger determinants [ edit ] The following results are proved in Blumethal's book.

[ 12 ] Embedding n + 1 points in the real numbers [ edit ] Given a semimetric space ( S , d ) {\displaystyle (S,d)} , with S = { P 0 , … … , P n } {\displaystyle S=\{P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n}\}} , and d ( P i , P j ) = d i j ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle d(P_{i},P_{j})=d_{ij}\geq 0} , 0 ≤ ≤ i < j ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle 0\leq i<j\leq n} , an isometric embedding of ( S , d ) {\displaystyle (S,d)} into R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is defined by A 0 , A 1 , … … , A n ∈ ∈ R n {\textstyle A_{0},A_{1},\ldots ,A_{n}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , such that d ( A i , A j ) = d i j {\displaystyle d(A_{i},A_{j})=d_{ij}} for all 0 ≤ ≤ i < j ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle 0\leq i<j\leq n} .

Again, one asks whether such an isometric embedding exists for ( S , d ) {\displaystyle (S,d)} .

A necessary condition is easy to see: for all k = 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle k=1,\ldots ,n} , let v k {\displaystyle v_{k}} be the k -simplex formed by A 0 , A 1 , … … , A k {\textstyle A_{0},A_{1},\ldots ,A_{k}} , then ( − − 1 ) k + 1 CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P k ) = ( − − 1 ) k + 1 CM ⁡ ⁡ ( A 0 , … … , A k ) = 2 k ( k !

) k Vol k ⁡ ⁡ ( v k ) 2 ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle (-1)^{k+1}\operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{k})=(-1)^{k+1}\operatorname {CM} (A_{0},\ldots ,A_{k})=2^{k}(k!)^{k}\operatorname {Vol} _{k}(v_{k})^{2}\geq 0} The converse also holds. That is, if for all k = 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle k=1,\ldots ,n} , ( − − 1 ) k + 1 CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P k ) ≥ ≥ 0 , {\displaystyle (-1)^{k+1}\operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{k})\geq 0,} then such an embedding exists.

Further, such embedding is unique up to isometry in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . That is, given any two isometric embeddings defined by A 0 , A 1 , … … , A n {\displaystyle A_{0},A_{1},\ldots ,A_{n}} , and A 0 ′ , A 1 ′ , … … , A n ′ {\displaystyle A'_{0},A'_{1},\ldots ,A'_{n}} , there exists a (not necessarily unique) isometry T : R n → → R n {\displaystyle T:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , such that T ( A k ) = A k ′ {\displaystyle T(A_{k})=A'_{k}} for all k = 0 , … … , n {\displaystyle k=0,\ldots ,n} . Such T {\displaystyle T} is unique if and only if CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P n ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n})\neq 0} , that is, A 0 , A 1 , … … , A n {\displaystyle A_{0},A_{1},\ldots ,A_{n}} are affinely independent.

Embedding n + 2 and n + 3 points [ edit ] If n + 2 {\displaystyle n+2} points P 0 , … … , P n + 1 {\displaystyle P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n+1}} can be embedded in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} as A 0 , … … , A n + 1 {\displaystyle A_{0},\ldots ,A_{n+1}} , then other than the conditions above, an additional necessary condition is that  the ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle (n+1)} -simplex formed by A 0 , A 1 , … … , A n + 1 {\displaystyle A_{0},A_{1},\ldots ,A_{n+1}} , must have no ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle (n+1)} -dimensional volume. That is, CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P n , P n + 1 ) = 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n},P_{n+1})=0} .

The converse also holds. That is, if for all k = 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle k=1,\ldots ,n} , ( − − 1 ) k + 1 CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P k ) ≥ ≥ 0 , {\displaystyle (-1)^{k+1}\operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{k})\geq 0,} and CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P n , P n + 1 ) = 0 , {\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n},P_{n+1})=0,} then such an embedding exists.

For embedding n + 3 {\displaystyle n+3} points in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , the necessary and sufficient conditions are similar: For all k = 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle k=1,\ldots ,n} , ( − − 1 ) k + 1 CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P k ) ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle (-1)^{k+1}\operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{k})\geq 0} ; CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P n , P n + 1 ) = 0 ; {\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n},P_{n+1})=0;} CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P n , P n + 2 ) = 0 ; {\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n},P_{n+2})=0;} CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P n , P n + 1 , P n + 2 ) = 0.

{\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n},P_{n+1},P_{n+2})=0.} Embedding arbitrarily many points [ edit ] The n + 3 {\displaystyle n+3} case turns out to be sufficient in general.

In general, given a semimetric space ( R , d ) {\displaystyle (R,d)} , it can be isometrically embedded in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} if and only if there exists P 0 , … … , P n ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n}\in R} , such that, for all k = 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle k=1,\ldots ,n} , ( − − 1 ) k + 1 CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P k ) ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle (-1)^{k+1}\operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{k})\geq 0} , and for any P n + 1 , P n + 2 ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle P_{n+1},P_{n+2}\in R} , CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P n , P n + 1 ) = 0 ; {\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n},P_{n+1})=0;} CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P n , P n + 2 ) = 0 ; {\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n},P_{n+2})=0;} CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P n , P n + 1 , P n + 2 ) = 0.

{\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n},P_{n+1},P_{n+2})=0.} And such embedding is unique up to isometry in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} .

Further, if CM ⁡ ⁡ ( P 0 , … … , P n ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {CM} (P_{0},\ldots ,P_{n})\neq 0} , then it cannot be isometrically embedded in any R m , m < n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m},m<n} . And such embedding is unique up to unique isometry in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} .

Thus, Cayley–Menger determinants give a concrete way to calculate whether a semimetric space can be embedded in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , for some finite n {\displaystyle n} , and if so, what is the minimal n {\displaystyle n} .

Applications [ edit ] There are many applications of distance geometry.

[ 3 ] In telecommunication networks such as GPS , the positions of some sensors are known (which are called anchors) and some of the distances between sensors are also known: the problem is to identify the positions for all sensors.

[ 5 ] Hyperbolic navigation is one pre-GPS technology that uses distance geometry for locating ships based on the time it takes for signals to reach anchors.

There are many applications in chemistry.

[ 4 ] [ 12 ] Techniques such as NMR can measure distances between pairs of atoms of a given molecule, and the problem is to infer the 3-dimensional shape of the molecule from those distances.

Some software packages for applications are: DGSOL . Solves large distance geometry problems in macromolecular modeling .

Xplor-NIH . Based on X-PLOR , to determine the structure of molecules based on data from NMR experiments. It solves distance geometry problems with heuristic methods (such as simulated annealing ) and local search methods (such as conjugate gradient minimization ).

TINKER . Molecular modeling and design. It can solve distance geometry problems.

SNLSDPclique . MATLAB code for locating sensors in a sensor network based on the distances between the sensors.
