**Common Era** (**CE**) and **Before the Common Era** (**BCE**) are year notations for the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar") (and its predecessor, the [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar")), the world's most widely used [calendar era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_era "Calendar era"). Common Era and Before the Common Era are alternatives to the original [Anno Domini (AD) and Before Christ (BC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini "Anno Domini") notations used for the same calendar era. The two notation systems are numerically equivalent: "2025 CE" and "AD 2025" each describe the current year; "400 BCE" and "400 BC" are the same year.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-2)

The expression can be traced back to 1615, when it first appears in a book by [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") as the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _annus aerae nostrae vulgaris_ (_year of our common era_),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-VulgarisAerae1-4) and to 1635 in English as "[Vulgar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vulgar "wikt:vulgar") Era".[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-5) The term "Common Era" can be found in English as early as 1708,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-1708CommonInEnglish-6) and became more widely used in the mid-19th century by [Jewish religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism "Judaism") scholars. Since the late 20th century, BCE and CE have become popular in academic and scientific publications on the grounds that BCE and CE are religiously neutral terms.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-7)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-8) They have been promoted as more sensitive to non-Christians by not referring to [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus "Jesus"), the central figure of [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"), especially via the religious terms "[Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_(title) "Christ (title)")" and _[Dominus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominus\_(title) "Dominus (title)")_ ("Lord") used by the other abbreviations.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-9)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-10)[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-nostri-12) Nevertheless, its [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch "Epoch") remains the same as [that used for the Anno Domini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini#History "Anno Domini") era.

Around the year 525, the Christian monk [Dionysius Exiguus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_Exiguus "Dionysius Exiguus") devised the principle of taking the moment that he believed to be the [date of the incarnation of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_birth_of_Jesus#According_to_Dionysius "Date of birth of Jesus") to be the point from which years are numbered (the [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch "Epoch")) of the Christian [ecclesiastical calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_calendar "Ecclesiastical calendar").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Pedersen-13)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-14)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-15) Dionysius labeled the column of the table in which he introduced the new era as "_Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi_" (the years of our Lord Jesus Christ).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Pedersen-13): 52  He did this to replace the [Era of the Martyrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_the_Martyrs "Era of the Martyrs") system (then used for some [Easter tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_Easter "Date of Easter")) because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Pedersen-13): 50

This way of numbering years became more widespread in Europe, with its use by [Bede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede "Bede") in England in 731. Bede also introduced the practice of dating years before what he supposed to have been the year of birth of Jesus,[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-17) without a [year zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero "Year zero").[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-18)

[Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") (1571–1630), the German [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer"), [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_mathematician "German mathematician"), [astrologer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrologer "Astrologer"), [natural philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy "Natural philosophy") and writer on music[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-19)

The term "Common Era" is traced back in English to its appearance as "Vulgar Era" to distinguish years of the Anno Domini era, which was in popular use, from dates of the [regnal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regnal_year "Regnal year") (the year of the reign of a sovereign) typically used in national law.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-20) (The word 'vulgar' originally meant 'of the ordinary people', with no derogatory associations.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-OED_vulgar-21))

The first use of the Latin term _anno aerae nostrae vulgaris_[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-VulgarisAerae0-22) may be in a 1615 book by [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-VulgarisAerae1-4) Kepler uses it again, as _ab Anno vulgaris aerae_, in a 1616 table of [ephemerides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris "Ephemeris"),[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-23) and again, as _ab anno vulgaris aerae_, in 1617.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-24) An English edition of that book from 1635 may contain the earliest known use of "Vulgar Era" in its title page.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-25)[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-26) A 1701 book edited by John Le Clerc includes the phrase "Before Christ according to the Vulgar Æra,6".[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-27)

The [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam-Webster_Dictionary "Merriam-Webster Dictionary") gives 1716 as the date of first use of the term "vulgar era" (which it defines as "Christian era").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-28)[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-30)

The first published use of "Christian Era" may be the Latin phrase _annus aerae christianae_ on the title page of a 1584 theology book, _De Eucharistica controuersia_.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-31) In 1649, the Latin phrase _annus æræ Christianæ_ appeared in the title of an English almanac.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-32) A 1652 ephemeris may be the first instance of the English use of "Christian Era".[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-33)

The English phrase "Common Era" appears at least as early as 1708,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-1708CommonInEnglish-6) and in a 1715 book on astronomy, it is used interchangeably with "Christian Era" and "Vulgar Era".[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-34) A 1759 history book uses _common æra_ in a generic sense to refer to "the common era of the Jews".[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-35) The phrase "before the common era" may have first appeared in a 1770 work that also uses _common era_ and _vulgar era_ as synonyms in a translation of a book originally written in German. [[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-36) The 1797 edition of the [Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica "Encyclopædia Britannica") uses the terms _vulgar era_ and _common era_ synonymously.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-37)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-38) In 1835, in his book _[Living Oracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living\_Oracles "Living Oracles")_, [Alexander Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Campbell_(Restoration_movement) "Alexander Campbell (Restoration movement)") wrote: "The vulgar Era, or Anno Domini; the fourth year of Jesus Christ, the first of which was but eight days".[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-39) He refers to the _common era_ as a synonym for _vulgar era_: "the fact that our Lord was born on the 4th year before the vulgar era, called Anno Domini, thus making (for example) the 42d year from his birth to correspond with the 38th of the common era".[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-40) The _[Catholic Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic\_Encyclopedia "Catholic Encyclopedia")_ (1909), in at least one article, reports all three terms (Christian, Vulgar, Common Era) being commonly understood by the early 20th century.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-41)

The phrase "common era", in [lower case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_case "Lower case"), also appeared in the 19th century in a "generic" sense, not necessarily to refer to the Christian Era, but to any system of dates in everyday use throughout a civilization. Thus, "the common era of the Jews",[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-42)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-43) "the common era of the Mahometans",[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-44) "common era of the world",[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-45) or "the common era of the foundation of Rome".[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-46) When it did refer to the Christian Era, it was sometimes qualified (e.g., "common era of the Incarnation",[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-47) "common era of the Nativity",[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-48) or "common era of the birth of Christ").[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-49)

An adapted translation of _Common Era_ into [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") as _Era Vulgaris_[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-51) was adopted in the 20th century by some followers of [Aleister Crowley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley "Aleister Crowley"), and thus the abbreviation "e.v." or "EV" may sometimes be seen as a replacement for AD.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-52)

### History of the use of the CE/BCE abbreviation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_Era&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: History of the use of the CE/BCE abbreviation")]

Although [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews") have the [Hebrew calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar "Hebrew calendar"), they often use the Gregorian calendar without the AD prefix, as [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism "Judaism") does not recognize Jesus as the [Messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_in_Judaism "Messiah in Judaism").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-53) As early as 1825, the abbreviation VE (for Vulgar Era) was in use among Jews to denote years in the Western calendar.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-54) As of 2005, Common Era notation has also been in use for Hebrew lessons for more than a century.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Gormley-55) Jews have also used the term **Current Era**.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-56)

Some academics in the fields of [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology"), [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education"), [archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology "Archaeology") and [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History "History") have adopted CE and BCE notation despite some disagreement.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-57) A study conducted in 2014 found that the BCE/CE notation is not growing at the expense of BC and AD notation in the scholarly literature, and that both notations are used in a relatively stable fashion.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-58)

In 2011, media reports suggested that the BC/AD notation in Australian school textbooks would be replaced by BCE/CE notation.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-59) The change drew opposition from some politicians and church leaders. Weeks after the story broke, the [Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Curriculum,_Assessment_and_Reporting_Authority "Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority") denied the rumours and stated that the BC/AD notation would remain, with CE and BCE as an optional suggested learning activity.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-60)

In 2013, the [Canadian Museum of Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Museum_of_Civilization "Canadian Museum of Civilization") (now the Canadian Museum of History) in [Gatineau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatineau "Gatineau") (opposite [Ottawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa "Ottawa")), which had previously switched to BCE/CE, decided to change back to BC/AD in material intended for the public while retaining BCE/CE in academic content.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-61)

The notation is in particularly common use in [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal "Nepal") in order to disambiguate dates from the local (Indian or Hindu) calendar, Bikram or Vikram Sambat. Disambiguation is needed because the era of the Hindu calendar is quite close to the Common Era.

In 2002, an advisory panel for the religious education syllabus for [England and Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales "England and Wales") recommended introducing BCE/CE dates to schools,[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-62) and by 2018 some local education authorities were using them.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Tel-NT-63)

In 2018, the [National Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty "National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty") said it would continue to use BC/AD as its house style.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Tel-NT-63)[English Heritage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Heritage "English Heritage") explains its era policy thus: "It might seem strange to use a Christian calendar system when referring to British prehistory, but the BC/AD labels are widely used and understood."[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-64) Some parts of the BBC use BCE/CE, but some presenters have said they will not.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Tel-NT-63) As of October 2019, the BBC News style guide has entries for AD and BC, but not for CE or BCE.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-65) The style guide for _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Guardian "The Guardian")_ says, under the entry for CE/BCE: "some people prefer CE (common era, current era, or Christian era) and BCE (before common era, etc.) to AD and BC, which, however, remain our style".[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-66)

In the United States, the use of the BCE/CE notation in [textbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textbook "Textbook") was reported in 2005 to be growing.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Gormley-55) Some publications have transitioned to using it exclusively. For example, the 2007 [World Almanac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Almanac "World Almanac") was the first edition to switch to BCE/CE, ending a period of 138 years in which the traditional BC/AD dating notation was used. BCE/CE is used by the [College Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Board "College Board") in its history tests,[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-67) and by the [Norton Anthology of English Literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Anthology_of_English_Literature "Norton Anthology of English Literature"). Others have taken a different approach. The US-based [History Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_(U.S._TV_channel) "History (U.S. TV channel)") uses BCE/CE notation in articles on non-Christian religious topics such as [Jerusalem and Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_significance_of_Jerusalem#Jerusalem,_Jews_and_Judaism "Religious significance of Jerusalem").[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-68) The 2006 style guide for the Episcopal Diocese _Maryland Church News_ says that BCE and CE should be used.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-69)

In June 2006, in the United States, the Kentucky State School Board reversed its decision to use BCE and CE in the state's new Program of Studies, leaving education of students about these concepts a matter of local discretion.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-70)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-71)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-72)

The use of CE in Jewish scholarship was historically motivated by the desire to avoid the implicit "Our Lord" in the abbreviation _AD_.[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-nostri-12) Although other aspects of dating systems are based in Christian origins, AD is a direct reference to [Jesus as Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_is_Lord "Jesus is Lord").[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-73)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-74)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Ostling-75) Proponents of the Common Era notation assert that the use of BCE/CE shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by [Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"), but who are not themselves Christian.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-RelTolrnc-76) Former United Nations Secretary-General [Kofi Annan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan "Kofi Annan") has argued:[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-77)

> [T]he Christian calendar no longer belongs exclusively to Christians. People of all faiths have taken to using it simply as a matter of convenience. There is so much interaction between people of different faiths and cultures – different civilizations, if you like – that some shared way of reckoning time is a necessity. And so the Christian Era has become the Common Era.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-78)

Adena K. Berkowitz, in her application to argue before the [United States Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court "United States Supreme Court"), opted to use BCE and CE because, "Given the multicultural society that we live in, the traditional Jewish designations– B.C.E. and C.E.– cast a wider net of inclusion."[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-79) In the [World History Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_History_Encyclopedia "World History Encyclopedia"), Joshua J. Mark wrote "Non-Christian scholars, especially, embraced [CE and BCE] because they could now communicate more easily with the Christian community. Jewish, Islamic, Hindu and Buddhist scholars could retain their [own] calendar but refer to events using the Gregorian Calendar as BCE and CE without compromising their own beliefs about the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth."[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-80) In _[History Today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_Today "History Today")_, Michael Ostling wrote: "BC/AD Dating: In the year of whose Lord? The continuing use of AD and BC is not only factually wrong but also offensive to many who are not Christians."[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Ostling-75)

Critics note the fact that there is no difference in the [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch "Epoch") of the two systems—chosen to be close to the [date of birth of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_birth_of_Jesus "Date of birth of Jesus"). Since the year numbers are the same, BCE and CE dates should be equally offensive to other religions as BC and AD.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Pollick-2024-81)[Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") priest and writer on interfaith issues [Raimon Panikkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raimon_Panikkar "Raimon Panikkar") argued that the BCE/CE usage is the less inclusive option since they are still using the Christian calendar numbers and forcing it on other nations.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Panikkar-82) In 1993, the English-language expert [Kenneth G. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_G._Wilson_(author) "Kenneth G. Wilson (author)") speculated a [slippery slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope "Slippery slope") scenario in his style guide that, "if we do end by casting aside the AD/BC convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system [that is, the method of numbering years] itself, given its Christian basis."[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Wilson-83)

Some [Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians") are offended by the removal of the reference to Jesus,[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-84) including the [Southern Baptist Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention "Southern Baptist Convention").[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-SBC-85)

Conventions in style guides
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_Era&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Conventions in style guides")]

The abbreviation BCE, just as with BC, always follows the year number. Unlike AD, which still often precedes the year number, CE always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all).[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-86) Thus, the current year is written as 2025 in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as 2025 CE, or as AD 2025), and the year that [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters, or with [periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") (e.g., "B.C.E." or "C.E.").[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-87) The US-based [Society of Biblical Literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Biblical_Literature "Society of Biblical Literature") style guide for academic texts on religion prefers BCE/CE to BC/AD.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-88)

Similar conventions in other languages
--------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_Era&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Similar conventions in other languages")]

*   In [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), Jews in [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin "Berlin") seem to have already been using words translating to "(before the) common era" in the 18th century, while others like [Moses Mendelssohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Mendelssohn "Moses Mendelssohn") opposed this usage as it would hinder the integration of Jews into German society.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Jewish_Joke-89) The formulation seems to have persisted among German Jews in the 19th century in forms like _vor der gewöhnlichen Zeitrechnung_ (before the common chronology).[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-90)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-91) In 1938 [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"), the use of this convention was also prescribed by the [National Socialist Teachers League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Teachers_League "National Socialist Teachers League").[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-92) However, it was soon discovered that many German Jews had been using the convention ever since the 18th century, and [_Time_ magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)") found it ironic to see "[Aryans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan "Aryan") following Jewish example nearly 200 years later".[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-Jewish_Joke-89)

C._ and _a. de C._ (for "_antes de Cristo_", "before Christ"), with variations in punctuation and sometimes the use of _J. C._ (_Jesucristo_) instead of _C_. The [Real Academia Española](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Academia_Espa%C3%B1ola "Real Academia Española") also acknowledges the use of _a. n. e._ (_antes de nuestra era_, 'before our era') and _d. n. e._ (_después de nuestra era_, 'after our era').[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-RAE-93) In scholarly writing, _a. e. c._ is the equivalent of the English "BCE", "_antes de la era común_" or "Before the Common Era".[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-94)
*   In [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language "Welsh language"), OC can be expanded to equivalents of both AD (_Oed Crist_) and CE (_Oes Cyffredin_); for dates before the Common Era, CC (traditionally, _Cyn Crist_) is used exclusively.
*   In [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language") since the [October Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution") (1917) до н.э. (до нашей эры, lit. _before our era_) and н.э. (нашей эры, lit. _of our era_) are used almost universally. Within Christian churches до Р.Х./от Р.Х. (до/от Рождества Христова, i.e. _before/after the birth of Christ_, equivalent to [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _[Ante Christum natum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante\_Christum\_natum "Ante Christum natum")_) remains in use.
*   In [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language"), "p.n.e." (_przed naszą erą_, lit. _before our era_) and "n.e." (_naszej ery_, lit. _of our era_) are commonly used in historical and scientific literature. _Przed Chrystusem_ (_before Christ_) and _po Chrystusie_ (_after Christ_) see sporadic usage, mostly in religious publications.
*   In [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), upon the foundation of the [Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China "Republic of China"), the [Government in Nanking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Government_of_the_Republic_of_China_(1912) "Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)") adopted the [Republic of China calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_calendar "Republic of China calendar") with 1912 designated as year 1, but used the Western calendar for international purposes. The translated term was [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"): 西元 (_xī yuán_, "Western Era"), which is still used in [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan "Taiwan") in formal documents. In 1949, the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China "People's Republic of China") adopted 公元 (_gōngyuán_, "Common Era") for both internal and external affairs in [mainland China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China "Mainland China"). This notation was extended to Hong Kong in 1997 and Macau in 1999 (de facto extended in 1966) through Annex III of [Hong Kong Basic Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Basic_Law "Hong Kong Basic Law") and [Macau Basic Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau_Basic_Law "Macau Basic Law"), thus eliminating the ROC calendar in these areas. BCE is translated into Chinese as 公元前 (_gōngyuánqián_, "Before the Common Era").
*   In [Czech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language "Czech language"), the "n. l." (_našeho letopočtu_ which translates as _of our year count_) and "př. n. l." or "před n. l." (_před naším letopočtem_ meaning _before our year count_) is used, always after the year number. The direct translation of AD (_léta Páně_, abbreviated as _L. P._) or BC (_před Kristem_, abbreviated as _př. Kr._) is seen as archaic.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-95)
*   In [Croatian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_language "Croatian language") the common form used for _BC_ and _AD_ are _pr. Kr._ (_prije Krista_, "before Christ")[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-96) and _p. Kr._ (_poslije Krista_, _after Christ_).[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-97) The abbreviations _pr. n. e._ (_prije nove ere, before new era_)[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-98) and _n. e. (nove ere, (of the) new era_)[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_note-99) have also recently been introduced.
*   In [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language "Danish language"), "f.v.t." (_før vor tidsregning_, _before our time reckoning_) and "e.v.t." (_efter vor tidsregning_, _after our time reckoning_) are used as BCE/CE are in English. Also commonly used are "f.Kr." (_før Kristus_, _before Christ_) and "e.Kr." (_efter Kristus_, _after Christ_), which are both placed after the year number in contrast with BC/AD in English.
*   In [Macedonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_language "Macedonian language"), the terms "п.н.е." (пред нашата ера "before our era") and "н.е." (наша ера "our era") are used in every aspect.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
*   In [Estonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language "Estonian language"), "e.m.a." (_enne meie ajaarvamist_, _before our time reckoning_) and "m.a.j." (_meie ajaarvamise järgi_, _according to our time reckoning_) are used as BCE and CE, respectively. Also in use are terms "eKr" (_enne Kristust_, _before Christ_) and "pKr" (_pärast Kristust_, _after Christ_). In all cases, the abbreviation is written after the year number.
*   In [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "Finnish language"), "eaa." (_ennen ajanlaskun alkua_, _before time reckoning_) and "jaa." (_jälkeen ajanlaskun alun_, _after the start of time reckoning_) are used as BCE and CE, respectively. Also (decreasingly) in use are terms "eKr", (_ennen Kristusta_, _before Christ_) and "jKr". (_jälkeen Kristuksen_, _after Christ_). In all cases, the abbreviation is written after the year number.

2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Common_Era#cite_ref-8)**Two other systems that also do not use religious titles, the [astronomical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering "Astronomical year numbering") and the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 "ISO 8601") standard, do use a [year zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero "Year zero"). The year 1 BCE (identical to the year 1 BC) is represented as 0 in the astronomical system, and as 0000 in ISO 8601. Presently, ISO 8601 dating requires use of the Gregorian calendar for all dates, however, whereas astronomical dating and Common Era dating allow use of either the Gregorian or Julian calendars.

The influence of western culture and scholarship upon the rest of the world in turn led to this system of dating becoming the most widely used one across the globe today. Many scholars in historical and religious studies in the West in recent years have sought to lessen the explicitly Christian meaning of this system without abandoning the usefulness of a single, common, global form of dating. For this reason the terms _common era_ and _before the common era_, abbreviated as CE and BCE, have grown in popularity as designations. The terms are meant, in deference to non-Christians, to soften the explicit theological claims made by the older Latin terminology, while at the same time providing continuity with earlier generations of mostly western Christian historical research

To call our age 'the Common Era,' even though for the Jews, the Chinese, the Tamil, the Muslims, and many others it is not a common era, constitutes the acme of colonialism.

(16 December 1993). _The Columbia Guide to Standard American English – A.D., B.C., (A.)C.E., B.C.E_. Columbia University Press. [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) "ISBN (identifier)")[978-0-231-06989-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-231-06989-2 "Special:BookSources/978-0-231-06989-2"). A.D. appears either before or after the number of the year... although conservative use has long preferred before only; B.C. always follows the number of the year.... Common era (C.E.) itself needs a good deal of further justification, in view of its clearly Christian numbering. Most conservatives still prefer A.D. and B.C. Best advice: don't use B.C.E., C.E., or A.C.E. to replace B.C. and A.D. without translating the new terms for the very large number of readers who will not understand them. Note too that if we do end by casting aside the A.D./B.C. convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system itself, given its Christian basis.

'I find this attempt to restructure history offensive,' Lori Weintz wrote, in a letter to National Geographic publishers.... 'The forward to your book says B.C. and A.D. were removed so as to "not impose the standards of one culture on others."... It's 2006 this year for anyone on Earth that is participating in day-to-day world commerce and communication. Two thousand six years since what? Most people know, regardless of their belief system, and aren't offended by a historical fact.'
