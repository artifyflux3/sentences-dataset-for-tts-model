[ 6 ] He studied toward a bachelor's in art history from Columbia University .

[ 7 ] His 1996 book The Women [ 8 ] focuses on his mother (who raised him in Brooklyn), Dorothy Dean , and Owen Dodson , who was a mentor and lover of Als.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In the book, Als explores his identification of the confluence of his ethnicity, gender and sexuality, moving from identifying as a "Negress" and then an "Auntie Man", a Barbadian term for homosexuals.

In 2017, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism : "For bold and original reviews that strove to put stage dramas within a real-world cultural context, particularly the shifting landscape of gender, sexuality and race." [ 14 ] The Guardian wrote about him a year later: "Since winning his Pulitzer prize for criticism, Hilton Als has risen more visibly to the role of public intellectual, one that he plays particularly well." [ 15 ] As an art curator, Als has been responsible for exhibitions including the group show Forces in Nature (featuring work by such artists as Njideka Akunyili Crosby , Peter Doig , Chris Ofili , Celia Paul , Tal R , Sarah Sze , Kara Walker , and Francesca Woodman ) in 2015, [ 16 ] and an exhibition of work from the Manhattan years of portraitist Alice Neel , entitled Alice Neel, Uptown , at David Zwirner Gallery in New York City and Victoria Miro Gallery in London (May 18 – July 29, 2017).
