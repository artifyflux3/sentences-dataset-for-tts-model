Find sources: "Slash-and-char" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( August 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Slash-and-char is an alternative to slash-and-burn that has a lesser effect on the environment . It is the practice of charring the biomass resulting from the slashing instead of burning it. Due to incomplete combustion ( pyrolysis ) the resulting residue matter charcoal can be utilized as biochar to improve the soil fertility .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Charcoal production under an earth cover In that context, charcoal can be made using numerous and varied methods. The simplest, used historically in charcoal production , involves burning a pile of biomass by lighting it on the top (known as "top down burn" or "conservation burn" [ 3 ] [ 4 ] ) or an earth cover on the pile of wood, with strategically placed vents. A more sophisticated modern method involves equipment that recuperates and processes strictly all exhaust gases into pyroligneous acid and syngas .

Slash-and-char offers benefits to the environment when compared to slash-and-burn.

[ 5 ] It results in the creation of biochar, which can then be mixed with biomass such as crop residues , food waste , or manure and buried in the soil to bring about the formation of terra preta . Terra preta is one of the richest soils on the planet – and the only one known to regenerate itself.

[ citation needed ] It moreover sequesters considerable quantities of carbon safely and beneficially, as opposed to the adverse effects of the slash-and-burn. Switching to slash-and-char can sequester up to 50% of the carbon in a highly stable form.

[ 5 ] The nascent carbon trading market that sponsors CO 2 sequestration projects could therefore help supplement the farmers' income while supporting a decrease in the pace of deforestation and the development of a more sustainable agriculture .
