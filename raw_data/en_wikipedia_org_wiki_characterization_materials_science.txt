It is a fundamental process in the field of materials science, without which no scientific understanding of engineering materials could be ascertained.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The scope of the term often differs; some definitions limit the term's use to techniques which study the microscopic structure and properties of materials, [ 2 ] while others use the term to refer to any materials analysis process including macroscopic techniques such as mechanical testing, thermal analysis and density calculation.

[ 3 ] The scale of the structures observed in materials characterization ranges from angstroms , such as in the imaging of individual atoms and chemical bonds, up to centimeters, such as in the imaging of coarse grain structures in metals.

While many characterization techniques have been practiced for centuries, such as basic optical microscopy, new techniques and methodologies are constantly emerging. In particular the advent of the electron microscope and secondary ion mass spectrometry in the 20th century has revolutionized the field, allowing the imaging and analysis of structures and compositions on much smaller scales than was previously possible, leading to a huge increase in the level of understanding as to why different materials show different properties and behaviors.

[ 4 ] More recently, atomic force microscopy has further increased the maximum possible resolution for analysis of certain samples in the last 30 years.

[ 5 ] Microscopy [ edit ] Optical microscopy image of aluminium Image of a graphite surface at an atomic level obtained by an STM Microscopy is a category of characterization techniques which probe and map the surface and sub-surface structure of a material. These techniques can use photons , electrons , ions or physical cantilever probes to gather data about a sample's structure on a range of length scales. Some common examples of microscopy techniques include: Optical microscopy Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Field ion microscopy (FIM) Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) Atomic force microscopy (AFM) Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) X-ray diffraction topography (XRT) Atom-Probe Tomography (APT) Spectroscopy [ edit ] Spectroscopy is a category of characterization techniques which use a range of principles to reveal the chemical composition, composition variation, crystal structure and photoelectric properties of materials. Some common examples of spectroscopy techniques include: Optical radiation [ edit ] Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) Thermoluminescence (TL) Photoluminescence (PL) X-ray [ edit ] First X-ray diffraction view of Martian soil - CheMin analysis reveals feldspar, pyroxenes, olivine and more (Curiosity rover at "Rocknest", October 17, 2012).

From the pattern, electric field gradients are obtained that resolve the structure around the radioactive atom, in order to study phase transitions, defects, diffusion.
