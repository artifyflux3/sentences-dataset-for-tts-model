Post-Minkowskian vs. post-Newtonian expansions In general relativity , post-Newtonian expansions ( PN expansions ) are used for finding an approximate solution of Einstein field equations for the metric tensor . The approximations are expanded in small parameters that express orders of deviations from Newton's law of universal gravitation . This allows approximations to Einstein's equations to be made in the case of weak fields. Higher-order terms can be added to increase accuracy, but for strong fields sometimes it is preferable to solve the complete equations numerically. This method is a common mark of effective field theories . In the limit, when the small parameters are equal to 0, the post-Newtonian expansion reduces to Newton's law of gravity.

Expansion in 1/ c 2 [ edit ] The post-Newtonian approximations are expansions in a small parameter, which is the ratio of the velocity of the matter that creates the gravitational field, to the speed of light , which in this case is more precisely called the speed of gravity .

[ 1 ] In the limit, when the fundamental speed of gravity becomes infinite, the post-Newtonian expansion reduces to Newton 's law of gravity.

[ 2 ] A systematic study of post-Newtonian expansions within hydrodynamic approximations was developed by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and his colleagues in the 1960s.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Expansion in h [ edit ] Another approach is to expand the equations of general relativity in a power series in the deviation of the metric from its value in the absence of gravity .

h α α β β = g α α β β − − η η α α β β .

{\displaystyle h_{\alpha \beta }=g_{\alpha \beta }-\eta _{\alpha \beta }\,.} To this end, one must choose a coordinate system in which the eigenvalues of h α α β β η η β β γ γ {\displaystyle h_{\alpha \beta }\eta ^{\beta \gamma }\,} all have absolute values less than 1.

For example, if one goes one step beyond linearized gravity to get the expansion to the second order in h : g μ μ ν ν ≈ ≈ η η μ μ ν ν − − η η μ μ α α h α α β β η η β β ν ν + η η μ μ α α h α α β β η η β β γ γ h γ γ δ δ η η δ δ ν ν .

{\displaystyle g^{\mu \nu }\approx \eta ^{\mu \nu }-\eta ^{\mu \alpha }h_{\alpha \beta }\eta ^{\beta \nu }+\eta ^{\mu \alpha }h_{\alpha \beta }\eta ^{\beta \gamma }h_{\gamma \delta }\eta ^{\delta \nu }\,.} − − g ≈ ≈ 1 + 1 2 h α α β β η η β β α α + 1 8 h α α β β η η β β α α h γ γ δ δ η η δ δ γ γ − − 1 4 h α α β β η η β β γ γ h γ γ δ δ η η δ δ α α .

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {-g}}\approx 1+{\tfrac {1}{2}}h_{\alpha \beta }\eta ^{\beta \alpha }+{\tfrac {1}{8}}h_{\alpha \beta }\eta ^{\beta \alpha }h_{\gamma \delta }\eta ^{\delta \gamma }-{\tfrac {1}{4}}h_{\alpha \beta }\eta ^{\beta \gamma }h_{\gamma \delta }\eta ^{\delta \alpha }\,.} Expansions based only on the metric, independently from the speed, are called post-Minkowskian expansions ( PM expansions ).

0PN corresponds to the case of Newton's theory of gravitation. 0PM (not shown) corresponds to the Minkowski flat space .

[ 8 ] Uses [ edit ] The first use of a PN expansion (to first order) was made by Albert Einstein in calculating the perihelion precession of Mercury's orbit . Today, Einstein's calculation is recognized as a common example of applications of PN expansions, solving the general relativistic two-body problem , which includes the emission of gravitational waves .

Newtonian gauge [ edit ] Main article: Newtonian gauge In general, the perturbed metric can be written as [ 9 ] d s 2 = a 2 ( τ τ ) [ ( 1 + 2 A ) d τ τ 2 − − 2 B i d x i d τ τ − − ( δ δ i j + h i j ) d x i d x j ] {\displaystyle ds^{2}=a^{2}(\tau )\left[(1+2A)d\tau ^{2}-2B_{i}dx^{i}d\tau -\left(\delta _{ij}+h_{ij}\right)dx^{i}dx^{j}\right]} where A {\displaystyle A} , B i {\displaystyle B_{i}} and h i j {\displaystyle h_{ij}} are functions of space and time.

h i j {\displaystyle h_{ij}} can be decomposed as h i j = 2 C δ δ i j + ∂ ∂ i ∂ ∂ j E − − 1 3 δ δ i j ◻ ◻ 2 E + ∂ ∂ i E ^ ^ j + ∂ ∂ j E ^ ^ i + 2 E ~ ~ i j {\displaystyle h_{ij}=2C\delta _{ij}+\partial _{i}\partial _{j}E-{\frac {1}{3}}\delta _{ij}\Box ^{2}E+\partial _{i}{\hat {E}}_{j}+\partial _{j}{\hat {E}}_{i}+2{\tilde {E}}_{ij}} where ◻ ◻ {\displaystyle \Box } is the d'Alembert operator , E {\displaystyle E} is a scalar, E ^ ^ i {\displaystyle {\hat {E}}_{i}} is a vector and E ~ ~ i j {\displaystyle {\tilde {E}}_{ij}} is a traceless tensor.
Then the Bardeen potentials are defined as Ψ Ψ ≡ ≡ A + H ( B − − E ′ ) , + ( B + E ′ ) ′ , Φ Φ ≡ ≡ − − C − − H ( B − − E ′ ) + 1 3 ◻ ◻ E {\displaystyle \Psi \equiv A+H(B-E'),+(B+E')',\quad \Phi \equiv -C-H(B-E')+{\frac {1}{3}}\Box E} where H {\displaystyle H} is the Hubble constant and a prime represents differentiation with respect to conformal time τ τ {\displaystyle \tau \,} .

Taking B = E = 0 {\displaystyle B=E=0} (i.e. setting Φ Φ ≡ ≡ − − C {\displaystyle \Phi \equiv -C} and Ψ Ψ ≡ ≡ A {\displaystyle \Psi \equiv A} ), the Newtonian gauge is d s 2 = a 2 ( τ τ ) [ ( 1 + 2 Ψ Ψ ) d τ τ 2 − − ( 1 − − 2 Φ Φ ) δ δ i j d x i d x j ] {\displaystyle ds^{2}=a^{2}(\tau )\left[(1+2\Psi )d\tau ^{2}-(1-2\Phi )\delta _{ij}dx^{i}dx^{j}\right]\,} .

Note that in the absence of anisotropic stress, Φ Φ = Ψ Ψ {\displaystyle \Phi =\Psi } .

A useful non-linear extension of this is provided by the non-relativistic gravitational fields .
