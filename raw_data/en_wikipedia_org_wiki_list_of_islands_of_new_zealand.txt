Whakaari / White Island Bay of Plenty New Zealand consists of more than six hundred islands, mainly remnants of a larger land mass now beneath the sea.

[ 1 ] New Zealand is the sixth-largest island country , and the third-largest located entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. The following is a list of islands of New Zealand .

The two largest islands – where most of the population lives – have names in both English and in the Māori language . They are the North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui and the South Island or Te Waipounamu .

[ 2 ] Various Māori iwi sometimes use other names, with some preferring to call the South Island Te Waka o Aoraki .

[ 3 ] The two islands are separated by the Cook Strait . In general practice, the term mainland refers to the North Island and South Island.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] However, the South Island alone is sometimes called "the mainland" – especially by its residents, as a nickname – because it is the larger of the two main islands.

[ 6 ] [ Note 1 ] To the south of the South Island, Stewart Island / Rakiura is the largest of the smaller islands, and Waiheke Island in the urban Auckland Region has the largest population of the smaller islands.

Listed by size [ edit ] The following table lists the largest islands of New Zealand proper by area.

[ Note 2 ] River delta islands such as Rakaia Island (25.7 km 2 (9.9 sq mi)), [ 8 ] Fereday Island , Rangitata Island , and Inch Clutha (approximately 15 km 2 (5.8 sq mi), 30 square kilometres (12 square miles), and 35 km 2 (14 sq mi) respectively) are omitted, as are temporary islands in braided river channels and tidal islands such as Rabbit Island, Nelson (17 km 2 (6.6 sq mi)). The country's largest island within a lake, Pomona Island , has an area of just 2.6 km 2 (1.0 sq mi).

[ 7 ] ^ The associated Cook Islands , Niue , Tokelau , and islands of the Antarctic Ross Dependency are excluded from this list.

^ Name of the island as recognised by the New Zealand Geographic Board.

[ 10 ] In most cases this will be an official name, however some geographic features in New Zealand do not have official names. In these instances, the name in this column is the recorded name as per the NZGB.

^ Other island names used by Māori or Moriori . Names that form part of a dual name or are an official name are omitted.

^ South Island and Te Waipounamu are both recognised as distinct official names. This is different to dual place names in which there is a single name consisting of both English and Māori origins.

^ North Island and Te Ika-a-Māui are both recognised as distinct official names. This is different to dual place names in which there is a single name consisting of both English and Māori origins.
