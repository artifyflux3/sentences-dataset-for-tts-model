[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] He received his secondary school education at Bryanston School .

[ 4 ] [ 3 ] He completed his National Service (1957–1959) in the Royal Navy , during which time he qualified as a Russian interpreter.

[ 5 ] The training for this he completed at the Joint Services School for Linguists at Crail .

[ 6 ] From 1959 to 1963, Burnyeat undertook undergraduate studies in Classics and Philosophy at King's College, Cambridge , where he earned a double first .

[ 5 ] Subsequently, between 1963 and 1964, he was a graduate student at University College London .

[ 5 ] There he was a student under the supervision of Bernard Williams .

[ 7 ] Career [ edit ] He became an assistant lecturer in philosophy at University College London in 1964, [ 5 ] and a lecturer in 1965.

[ 3 ] In 1978, he was appointed a lecturer in classics at the University of Cambridge, and became a fellow of the new Robinson College , Cambridge, where he remained until 1996.

[ 5 ] In 1984, he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy [ 8 ] and appointed as the fifth Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy at Cambridge, a position he held until 1996.

[ 9 ] [ 3 ] Burnyeat served as president of the Mind Association in 1987.

[ 10 ] In 1988 he became a member of the Institut International de Philosophie.

[ 10 ] In 1992 he was elected as an Honorary Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences .

[ 11 ] In 2000 he delivered the British Academy's Master-Mind Lecture.

[ 12 ] From 1996 until 2006 he was Senior Research Fellow in Philosophy at All Souls College, Oxford .

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] His partner in later life was the musicologist Margaret Bent .

[ 1 ] Myles Burnyeat died on 20 September 2019 at the age of 80.

[ 1 ] [ 22 ] Concluding her 2012 laureation address, Professor Sarah Broadie noted of Burnyeat that: [ 6 ] "Above all, he is a paradigm to philosophers and classicists for combining formidable learning with first hand engagement in philosophy’s own concerns: principally its concerns with ethics and epistemology . His writings on the ancients take issue with such moderns as Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein , Descartes , Berkeley, and for that matter Ronald Dworkin . The aim – in which he has set and achieved the highest standards – isn’t simply to compare different specimens of the genus ‘philosopher’, but to open us up to the transformative toing and froing of philosophy as an on-going enterprise."

she took a teaching post at Birkbeck and met and married Myles Burnyeat, professor of ancient philosophy at Cambridge. In 1985, their daughter, Gwen, was born ...As the writing took off, however, Padel returned to London with her daughter (then five).

Myles Burnyeat, whom she had come to know through his visiting appointments in the Pittsburgh department ... took her to England, cared for her through the extraordinary pain of her illness, and finally allowed her to find the happiness that had eluded her in America. (They were married in the winter of 2002.) She died in Cambridge in the early spring of 2003... The cause of her death was chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, a disease of the nervous system, compounded by undiagnosed multiple sclerosis.
