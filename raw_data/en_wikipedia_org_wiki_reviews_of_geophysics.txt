The current editor-in-chief is Fabio Florindo  ( National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology –Rome).

History [ edit ] Reviews of Geophysics ( ISSN 0096-1043 ) was established in 1963. Between February 1970 and November 1984 it was named Reviews of Geophysics and Space Physics ( ISSN 0034-6853 ). Throughout the years its frequency varied. It was quarterly in 1970–74, five per year in 1975, quarterly again in 1976–78, eight issues in 1979, quarterly in 1980–82, and finally eight issues in 1983, before being renamed to Reviews of Geophysics in 1984.

Aims and scope [ edit ] As a review publication by invitation only, Reviews of Geophysics provides an overview of geophysics research . It integrates summations of previous scientific investigations with active research areas. Critical analysis of the progress in, and direction of, geophysics is provided. Topical coverage includes solid-earth geophysics, cryospheric science , oceans and atmospheric studies , meteorology , and oceanography ), along with the physics of the Solar System and its processes. For example, coverage includes processes that tend to concern the public such as rainfall rates , trends in marine fisheries , earthquake probabilities , and volcanic eruption potentials.
