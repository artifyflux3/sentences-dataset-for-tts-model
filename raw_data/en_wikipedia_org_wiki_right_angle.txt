A right angle is equal to 90 degrees.

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") and [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry"), a **right angle** is an [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") of exactly 90 [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)") or ⁠![Image 3: {\displaystyle \pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a)/2⁠[radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle#cite_note-1) corresponding to a quarter [turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry) "Turn (geometry)").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle#cite_note-2) If a [ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(mathematics)#Ray "Line (mathematics)") is placed so that its endpoint is on a line and the adjacent angles are equal, then they are right angles.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle#cite_note-3) The term is a [calque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calque "Calque") of [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin")_angulus rectus_; here _rectus_ means "upright", referring to the vertical perpendicular to a horizontal base line.

Closely related and important geometrical concepts are [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") lines, meaning lines that form right angles at their point of intersection, and [orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality "Orthogonality"), which is the property of forming right angles, usually applied to [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector"). The presence of a right angle in a [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") is the defining factor for [right triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle#cite_note-4) making the right angle basic to trigonometry.

The meaning of _right_ in _right angle_ possibly refers to the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Latin "Classical Latin") adjective _rectus_ 'erect, straight, upright, perpendicular'. A [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") equivalent is _orthos_ 'straight; perpendicular' (see [orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality "Orthogonality")).

In elementary geometry
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Right_angle&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: In elementary geometry")]

A [rectangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle "Rectangle") is a [quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral "Quadrilateral") with four right angles. A [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square "Square") has four right angles, in addition to equal-length sides.

The [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem") states how to determine when a triangle is a [right triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle").

Another option of diagrammatically indicating a right angle, using an angle curve and a small dot

In [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode"), the symbol for a right angle is U+221F∟RIGHT ANGLE (&angrt;). It should not be confused with the similarly shaped symbol U+231E⌞BOTTOM LEFT CORNER (&dlcorn;, &llcorner;). Related symbols are U+22BE⊾RIGHT ANGLE WITH ARC (&angrtvb;), U+299C⦜RIGHT ANGLE VARIANT WITH SQUARE (&vangrt;), and U+299D⦝MEASURED RIGHT ANGLE WITH DOT (&angrtvbd;).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle#cite_note-5)

In diagrams, the fact that an angle is a right angle is usually expressed by adding a small right angle that forms a square with the angle in the diagram, as seen in the diagram of a right triangle (in British English, a right-angled triangle) to the right. The symbol for a measured angle, an arc, with a dot, is used in some European countries, including German-speaking countries and Poland, as an alternative symbol for a right angle.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle#cite_note-6)

Right angles are fundamental in [Euclid's Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements"). They are defined in Book 1, definition 10, which also defines perpendicular lines. Definition 10 does not use numerical degree measurements but rather touches at the very heart of what a right angle is, namely two straight lines intersecting to form two equal and adjacent angles.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle#cite_note-7) The straight lines which form right angles are called perpendicular.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle#cite_note-8) Euclid uses right angles in definitions 11 and 12 to define acute angles (those smaller than a right angle) and obtuse angles (those greater than a right angle).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle#cite_note-9) Two angles are called [complementary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_angles "Complementary angles") if their sum is a right angle.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle#cite_note-10)

Book 1 Postulate 4 states that all right angles are equal, which allows Euclid to use a right angle as a unit to measure other angles with. Euclid's commentator [Proclus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclus "Proclus") gave a proof of this postulate using the previous postulates, but it may be argued that this proof makes use of some hidden assumptions. [Saccheri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Girolamo_Saccheri "Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri") gave a proof as well but using a more explicit assumption. In [Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert")'s [axiomatization of geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms "Hilbert's axioms") this statement is given as a theorem, but only after much groundwork. One may argue that, even if postulate 4 can be proven from the preceding ones, in the order that Euclid presents his material it is necessary to include it since without it postulate 5, which uses the right angle as a unit of measure, makes no sense.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle#cite_note-11)

Conversion to other units
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Right_angle&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Conversion to other units")]

A right angle may be expressed in different units:

*   ⁠1/4⁠[turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry) "Turn (geometry)")
*   90° ([degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)"))
*   ⁠π/2⁠[radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian")
*   100 [grad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grad_(angle) "Grad (angle)") (also called _grade_, _gradian_, or _gon_)
*   8 points (of a 32-point [compass rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_rose "Compass rose"))

Throughout history, carpenters and masons have known a quick way to confirm if an angle is a true right angle. It is based on the [Pythagorean triple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple "Pythagorean triple")(3, 4, 5) and the rule of 3-4-5. From the angle in question, running a straight line along one side exactly three units in length, and along the second side exactly four units in length, will create a [hypotenuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotenuse "Hypotenuse") (the longer line opposite the right angle that connects the two measured endpoints) of exactly five units in length.

Thales' theorem states that an angle inscribed in a [semicircle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircle "Semicircle") (with a vertex on the semicircle and its defining rays going through the endpoints of the semicircle) is a right angle.

Two application examples in which the right angle and the Thales' theorem are included (see animations).
