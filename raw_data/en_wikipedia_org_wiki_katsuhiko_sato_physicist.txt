Professor Sato published a paper advocating cosmic inflation in 1981, but it was not widely recognized by Western academic circles.

Life [ edit ] Katsuhiko Sato was born in Sakaide , Kagawa Prefecture , Japan on August 30, 1945. He graduated from the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Kyoto University , and received a Doctor of Science degree.

Since he was a graduate student, Sato has been conducting research on supernovae , following the advice of his mentor, Chushiro Hayashi . Among other things he conducted research on the influence of neutrinos in supernovae.

Sato has served as a research assistant at Kyoto University, a visiting professor at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics , an associate professor/professor at the University of Tokyo , the Chairman of 47th Committee of the International Astronomical Union , and the president of the Physical Society of Japan .

Origin of the Inflation [ edit ] Sato proposed inflationary cosmology in 1981, around the same time as Alan Guth . Sato was the first to submit a paper on this theory, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Guth presented an inflation model similar to Sato's at a seminar at Stanford University in January 1980.

[ 3 ] Alexei Starobinsky also presented the idea of a similar model in 1979 [ 4 ] and published a paper in 1980.

[ 5 ] Alan Guth was the first to use the term "inflation". Sato originally used the term "exponential expansion model". Sato said: "I originally called this model the 'exponential expansion model.' However, American astrophysicist Guth published a similar model six months later, cleverly naming it the 'Inflation  model.' That's why it It's like this." It's now called inflation theory." [ 6 ] JAXA Space Information Center describes it as follows: Katsuhiko Sato published his theory of inflation in 1981. Alan Harvey Goose also published his theory of inflation around the same time as Sato, but Sato published his paper earlier.

[ 7 ] Academic genealogy [ edit ] Sato studied under the world-renowned astronomer Chushiro Hayashi , who was a student of Hideki Yukawa , Japan's first Nobel Prize winner.

On October 8, 2002, Sato was the first person to receive a call from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to the Koshiba Laboratory informing Masatoshi Koshiba that he had won this year's Nobel Prize in Physics . Sato and Yoji Totsuka decided to attend Koshiba's press conference that evening together. Sato sat to the left of Koshiba at the press conference.

[ 8 ] In any case, Japan's leading group of astronomers maintained close contacts.

Recognition [ edit ] 1989 - Inoue Prize for Science 1990 - Nishina Memorial Prize 2002 - Medal with Purple Ribbon 2010 - Japan Academy Prize 2014 - Person of Cultural Merit [ 9 ] 2018 - Order of the Sacred Treasure Namesakes and popular culture [ edit ] The asteroid 7965 Katsuhiko , discovered in 1996, was named after Professor Sato.

In the Japanese role-playing video game Shin Megami Tensei If...

, a character "Sato" is named after Professor Sato.
