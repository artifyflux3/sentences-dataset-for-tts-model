[ 6 ] The formula for samarskite-(Y) is also given as (Y,Fe 3+ ,U)(Nb,Ta)O 4 .

[ 5 ] Samarskite crystallizes in the orthorhombic – dipyramidal class as black to yellowish brown stubby prisms although it is typically found as anhedral masses. Specimens with a high uranium content are typically metamict and appear coated with a yellow brown earthy rind.

Samarskite occurs in rare earth bearing granite pegmatites with other rare minerals. It occurs in association with columbite , zircon , monazite , uraninite , aeschynite , magnetite , albite , topaz , beryl , garnet , muscovite and biotite .

[ 5 ] Samarskite was first described in 1847 for an occurrence in Miass , Ilmen Mountains, Southern Ural Mountains of Russia .

[ 4 ] The chemical element samarium was first isolated from a specimen of samarskite in 1879. Samarium was named after samarskite which was named for the Russian mine official, Colonel Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803–1870).

[ 4 ] Samarskite-(Yb) was first described in 2004 for an occurrence in the South Platte Pegmatite District, Jefferson County, Colorado .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Samarskite specimen, broken to show fresh surface See also [ edit ] Decipium , a mis-identified new element , thought to have been extracted from samarskite in 1878 by Marc Delafontaine .
