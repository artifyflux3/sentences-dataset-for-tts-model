He is a professor of philosophy at York University . Moufawad-Paul espouses Marxism-Leninism-Maoism , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] seeing Shining Path 's 1980s-1990s " People's War " against the Peruvian state as "heroic." [ 3 ] Bruce Gilley dispute [ edit ] In 2020, Moufawad-Paul received media attention when he started a petition in response to publisher Rowman & Littlefield 's planned "Problems in Anti-Colonialism" series. The petition urged the publisher to withdraw Bruce Gilley 's book The Last Imperialist: Sir Alan Burns’ Epic Defense of the British Empire . Gilley had earlier written a controversial essay entitled The Case for Colonialism .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The publisher ultimately scrapped the series.

[ 6 ] and Gilley's own book was published by Regnery Gateway instead.

[ 7 ] Continuity and Rupture [ edit ] Continuity and Rupture: Philosophy in the Maoist Terrain is a 2016 book written by J. Moufawad-Paul. The book provides a philosophical analysis of the theoretical foundation of Maoism , the Marxist school of thought developed by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong . Moufawad-Paul argues that the political ideology of Maoism, despite being formulated in the 1960s, only achieved full theoretical maturity in 1988 in Peru.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Synopsis [ edit ] The book is introduced as an attempt by Moufawad-Paul to reclaim Maoism , as a contemporary political ideology and contest the negative conceptualizations by Trotskyists and Anarchists in the political left. For Moufawad-Paul, Maoism must be understood as being both a continuation of Leninist political, philosophical and strategic positions, while simultaneously, acting as a rupture from the dogmatic orthodoxy and theoretical limits of standard Marxism–Leninism, thus Maoism is characterized as both continuity and rupture. Throughout the work, Moufawad-Paul offers a critique of contemporary and historical Maoist organizations, such as The Revolutionary Communist Party USA , The Shining Path , The Naxalite insurgency in India , and The New People's Army , as well as contemporary Marxist intellectuals, Slavoj Zizek , Alain Badiou , and Tom Clark (author of State and Counter-Revolution ).

Reception [ edit ] J. Moufawad-Paul's work received a positive reception among Marxist critics.

Historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and social activist Gabriel Kuhn both provide positive blurbs of the book in the cover section.

Hamayon Rastgar in Marx and Philosophy gave a positive review of the book, writing, "Moufawad-Paul makes an appealing case for a return to the revolutionary kernel of communism through understanding the most contemporary stage of the development of the ideology and science of revolution, namely Maoism." [ 10 ] Nicholas Marlatte wrote a positive review for Socialist Studies .

[ 11 ] In The Platypus Review , Marc Todoroff concluded that the book presented a persuasive defence of protracted people's war and revolutionary violence: "War is present; war is being waged against us. It is important to understand that socialism or barbarism really means 'socialism or planetary destruction.' State monopoly on violence cannot be allowed to persist." [ 12 ] The website Struggle Sessions (associated with the Red Guards ) [ 13 ] published a negative assessment of Moufawad-Paul's work in 2018.
