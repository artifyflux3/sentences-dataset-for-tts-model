"Describe" redirects here. For the musician, see DeScribe .

Description is any type of communication that aims to make vivid a place, object, person, group, or other physical entity.

[ 1 ] It is one of four rhetorical modes (also known as modes of discourse ), along with exposition , argumentation , and narration .

[ 2 ] Fiction writing [ edit ] Fiction writing specifically has modes such as action , exposition, description, dialogue , summary, and transition.

[ 3 ] Author Peter Selgin refers to methods , including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scenes , and description.

[ 4 ] Description is the mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story. Together with dialogue, narration, exposition, and summarization, it is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes. As stated in Writing from A to Z , edited by Kirk Polking, it is more than the amassing of details; it is bringing something to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.

[ 5 ] Purple prose [ edit ] Main article: Purple prose A purple patch is an over-written passage in which the writer has strained too hard to achieve an impressive effect, by elaborate figures or other means.  The phrase ( Latin :  "purpureus pannus") was first used by the Roman poet Horace in his Ars Poetica (c. 20 BC ) to denote an irrelevant and excessively ornate passage; the sense of irrelevance is normally absent in modern usage, although such passages are usually incongruous.  By extension, purple prose is lavishly figurative, rhythmic, or otherwise overwrought.

[ 6 ] Philosophy [ edit ] In philosophy, the nature of description has been an important question since Bertrand Russell 's classical texts.
