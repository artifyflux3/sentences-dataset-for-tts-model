This page provides lists of best-selling books and book series to date and in any language.

"Best-selling" refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned.

Comics and textbooks are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources.

According to Guinness World Records , as of 1995, the Bible was the best-selling book of all time, with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed.

[ 1 ] Sales estimates for other printed religious texts include at least 800 million copies for the Qur'an and 200 million copies for the Book of Mormon .

[ 2 ] Also, a single publisher has produced more than 162.1 million copies of the Bhagavad Gita . The total number could be much higher considering the widespread distribution and publications by ISKCON . The ISKCON has distributed about 503.39 million Bhagavad Gita since 1965.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Among non-religious texts, the Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung , also known as the Little Red Book , has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures—with estimates ranging from 800 million [ 1 ] to over 6.5 billion printed volumes.

[ 5 ] Some claim the distribution ran into the "billions" [ 6 ] and some cite "over a billion" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as "untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations".

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Exact print figures for these and other books may also be missing or unreliable since these kinds of books may be produced by many different and unrelated publishers, in some cases over many centuries. All books of a religious, ideological, philosophical or political nature have thus been excluded from the lists of best-selling books below for these reasons.

Many books lack comprehensive sales figures as book selling and reselling figures prior to the introduction of point of sale equipment was based on the estimates of book sellers, publishers or the authors themselves. For example, one of the one volume Harper Collins editions of The Lord of the Rings was recorded to have sold only 967,466 copies in the UK by 2009 (the source does not cite the start date), [ 9 ] but at the same time the author's estate claimed global sales figures of in excess of 150 million. Accurate figures are only available from the 1990s [ citation needed ] and in western nations such as US, UK, Canada and Australia, although figures from the US are available from the 1940s. Further, e-books have not been included as out of copyright texts are often available free in this format. Examples of books with claimed high sales include The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas , [ 10 ] Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes , [ 11 ] Journey to the West by Wu Cheng'en [ 12 ] and The Lord of the Rings [ 13 ] (which has been sold as both a three volume series, The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers , and The Return of the King , as a single combined volume and as a six volume set in a slipcase) by J. R. R. Tolkien . Hence, in cases where there is too much uncertainty, they are excluded from the list.

Having sold more than 600 million copies worldwide , [ 14 ] Harry Potter by J. K. Rowling is the best-selling book series in history. The first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , has sold in excess of 120 million copies, [ 15 ] making it one of the best-selling books of all time. As of June 2017, the series has been translated into 85 languages, [ 16 ] placing Harry Potter among history's most translated literary works . The last four books in the series consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books of all time, and the final installment, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , sold roughly fifteen million copies worldwide within twenty-four hours of its release.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] With twelve million books printed in the first US run, it also holds the record for the highest initial print run for any book in history.
