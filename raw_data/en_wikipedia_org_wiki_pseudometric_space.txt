For manifolds with a Pseudo-Riemannian metric tensor, see Pseudo-Riemannian manifold .

In mathematics , a pseudometric space is a generalization of a metric space in which the distance between two distinct points can be zero. Pseudometric spaces were introduced by Đuro Kurepa [ 1 ] [ 2 ] in 1934. In the same way as every normed space is a metric space , every seminormed space is a pseudometric space. Because of this analogy, the term semimetric space (which has a different meaning in topology ) is sometimes used as a synonym, especially in functional analysis .

When a topology is generated using a family of pseudometrics, the space is called a gauge space .

Definition [ edit ] A pseudometric space ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} is a set X {\displaystyle X} together with a non-negative real-valued function d : X × × X ⟶ ⟶ R ≥ ≥ 0 , {\displaystyle d:X\times X\longrightarrow \mathbb {R} _{\geq 0},} called a pseudometric , such that for every x , y , z ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x,y,z\in X,} d ( x , x ) = 0.

{\displaystyle d(x,x)=0.} Symmetry : d ( x , y ) = d ( y , x ) {\displaystyle d(x,y)=d(y,x)} Subadditivity / Triangle inequality : d ( x , z ) ≤ ≤ d ( x , y ) + d ( y , z ) {\displaystyle d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)} Unlike a metric space, points in a pseudometric space need not be distinguishable ; that is, one may have d ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(x,y)=0} for distinct values x ≠ ≠ y .

{\displaystyle x\neq y.} Examples [ edit ] Any metric space is a pseudometric space. 
Pseudometrics arise naturally in functional analysis . Consider the space F ( X ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}(X)} of real-valued functions f : X → → R {\displaystyle f:X\to \mathbb {R} } together with a special point x 0 ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x_{0}\in X.} This point then induces a pseudometric on the space of functions, given by d ( f , g ) = | f ( x 0 ) − − g ( x 0 ) | {\displaystyle d(f,g)=\left|f(x_{0})-g(x_{0})\right|} for f , g ∈ ∈ F ( X ) {\displaystyle f,g\in {\mathcal {F}}(X)} A seminorm p {\displaystyle p} induces the pseudometric d ( x , y ) = p ( x − − y ) {\displaystyle d(x,y)=p(x-y)} . This is a convex function of an affine function of x {\displaystyle x} (in particular, a translation ), and therefore convex in x {\displaystyle x} . (Likewise for y {\displaystyle y} .) Conversely, a homogeneous, translation-invariant pseudometric induces a seminorm.

Pseudometrics also arise in the theory of hyperbolic complex manifolds : see Kobayashi metric .

Every measure space ( Ω Ω , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} can be viewed as a complete pseudometric space by defining d ( A , B ) := μ μ ( A △ △ B ) {\displaystyle d(A,B):=\mu (A\vartriangle B)} for all A , B ∈ ∈ A , {\displaystyle A,B\in {\mathcal {A}},} where the triangle denotes symmetric difference .

If f : X 1 → → X 2 {\displaystyle f:X_{1}\to X_{2}} is a function and d 2 is a pseudometric on X 2 , then d 1 ( x , y ) := d 2 ( f ( x ) , f ( y ) ) {\displaystyle d_{1}(x,y):=d_{2}(f(x),f(y))} gives a pseudometric on X 1 . If d 2 is a metric and f is injective , then d 1 is a metric.

Topology [ edit ] The pseudometric topology is the topology generated by the open balls B r ( p ) = { x ∈ ∈ X : d ( p , x ) < r } , {\displaystyle B_{r}(p)=\{x\in X:d(p,x)<r\},} which form a basis for the topology.

[ 3 ] A topological space is said to be a pseudometrizable space [ 4 ] if the space can be given a pseudometric such that the pseudometric topology coincides with the given topology on the space.

The difference between pseudometrics and metrics is entirely topological. That is, a pseudometric is a metric if and only if the topology it generates is T 0 (that is, distinct points are topologically distinguishable ).

The definitions of Cauchy sequences and metric completion for metric spaces carry over to pseudometric spaces unchanged.

[ 5 ] Metric identification [ edit ] The vanishing of the pseudometric induces an equivalence relation , called the metric identification , that converts the pseudometric space into a full-fledged metric space .  This is done by defining x ∼ ∼ y {\displaystyle x\sim y} if d ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(x,y)=0} . Let X ∗ ∗ = X / ∼ ∼ {\displaystyle X^{*}=X/{\sim }} be the quotient space of X {\displaystyle X} by this equivalence relation and define d ∗ ∗ : ( X / ∼ ∼ ) × × ( X / ∼ ∼ ) ⟶ ⟶ R ≥ ≥ 0 d ∗ ∗ ( [ x ] , [ y ] ) = d ( x , y ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}d^{*}:(X/\sim )&\times (X/\sim )\longrightarrow \mathbb {R} _{\geq 0}\\d^{*}([x],[y])&=d(x,y)\end{aligned}}} This is well defined because for any x ′ ∈ ∈ [ x ] {\displaystyle x'\in [x]} we have that d ( x , x ′ ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(x,x')=0} and so d ( x ′ , y ) ≤ ≤ d ( x , x ′ ) + d ( x , y ) = d ( x , y ) {\displaystyle d(x',y)\leq d(x,x')+d(x,y)=d(x,y)} and vice versa. Then d ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle d^{*}} is a metric on X ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle X^{*}} and ( X ∗ ∗ , d ∗ ∗ ) {\displaystyle (X^{*},d^{*})} is a well-defined metric space, called the metric space induced by the pseudometric space ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] The metric identification preserves the induced topologies. That is, a subset A ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A\subseteq X} is open (or closed) in ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} if and only if π π ( A ) = [ A ] {\displaystyle \pi (A)=[A]} is open (or closed) in ( X ∗ ∗ , d ∗ ∗ ) {\displaystyle \left(X^{*},d^{*}\right)} and A {\displaystyle A} is saturated . The topological identification is the Kolmogorov quotient .

An example of this construction is the completion of a metric space by its Cauchy sequences .

Let ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} be a pseudo-metric space and define an equivalence relation ∼ ∼ {\displaystyle \sim } in X {\displaystyle X} by x ∼ ∼ y {\displaystyle x\sim y} if d ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(x,y)=0} . Let Y {\displaystyle Y} be the quotient space X / ∼ ∼ {\displaystyle X/\sim } and p : X → → Y {\displaystyle p:X\to Y} the canonical projection that maps each point of X {\displaystyle X} onto the equivalence class that contains it. Define the metric ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } in Y {\displaystyle Y} by ρ ρ ( a , b ) = d ( p − − 1 ( a ) , p − − 1 ( b ) ) {\displaystyle \rho (a,b)=d(p^{-1}(a),p^{-1}(b))} for each pair a , b ∈ ∈ Y {\displaystyle a,b\in Y} . It is easily shown that ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is indeed a metric and ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } defines the quotient topology on Y {\displaystyle Y} .
