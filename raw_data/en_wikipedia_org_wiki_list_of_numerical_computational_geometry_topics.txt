This area is also called "machine geometry", computer-aided geometric design, and geometric modelling .

See List of combinatorial computational geometry topics for another flavor of computational geometry that states problems in terms of geometric objects as discrete entities and hence the methods of their solution are mostly theories and algorithms of combinatorial character.

Curves [ edit ] In the list of curves topics , the following ones are fundamental to geometric modelling.

Parametric curve Bézier curve Spline Hermite spline Beta spline B-spline Higher-order spline NURBS Contour line Surfaces [ edit ] Bézier surface Isosurface Parametric surface Other [ edit ] Level-set method Computational topology NewPP limit report
