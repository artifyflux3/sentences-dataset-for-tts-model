A piece of cheese used as bait on a mousetrap Bait is any appetizing substance (e.g.

food ) used to attract prey when hunting or fishing , most commonly in the form of trapping (e.g.

mousetrap and bird trap ), ambushing (e.g. from a hunting blind ) and angling .

Baiting is a ubiquitous practice in both recreational (especially angling ) and commercial fishing , but the use of live bait can be deemed illegal under certain fisheries law and local jurisdictions. For hunting, however, baiting can often be controversial as it violates the principles of fair chase , although it is still a commonly accepted practice in varmint hunting , culling and pest control .

( June 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Live bait and fishing supply store Baiting is ubiquitously practised to catching fish . Traditionally, nightcrawlers , small baitfish , insect adults and larvae have been used as standard hookbait , and offals are commonly used as groundbait (a.k.a.

chumming ) in blue water fishing . Modern fishermen have also begun using more plastic bait and lures , and more recently, electronic bionic baits , to attract the more territorial and aggressive predatory fishes .

Studies show that natural baits like croaker and shrimp are better recognized therefore more readily accepted by fish. The best bait for red drum (red fish) are  [ pogy ( menhaden ) and, in the fall, specks like croaker.

[ 1 ] Hunting [ edit ] Baiting is a common practice in leopard hunting on a safari . A dead, smaller-sized antelope is usually placed high in the tree to lure the otherwise overcautious leopard. The hunter either watches the bait from point within firing range or stalks the animal if it has come for the bait during the night.

[ 5 ] Legal usage [ edit ] In Australia [ edit ] Baiting in Australia refers to specific campaigns to control foxes , wild dogs and dingos by poisoning in areas where they are a problem.
