Discovery .

[ 1 ] The channel features programming focusing on science related to wilderness survival, engineering , manufacturing , technology , space , space exploration , ufology and prehistory .

As of November 2023 [update] , Science Channel is available to approximately 34,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2013 peak of 78,000,000 households. Along with American Heroes Channel , Boomerang , Cooking Channel , Destination America , Discovery Family , and Discovery Life , Science Channel is among the less prevalent networks of Warner Bros. Discovery.

[ 2 ] In recent years, Science Channel has lost carriage with the growth of streaming alternatives including its parent company's HBO Max , and has generally been depreciated by Warner Bros. Discovery in current retransmission consent negotiations with cable and streaming providers. Science Channel is still a major content provider to Discovery+ , a sister streaming service to HBO Max.

History [ edit ] In November 1994, Discovery Networks announced plans for four digital channels set to launch in 1996. Discovery originally named the network under the working title Quark!

; [ 3 ] this was changed before its launch to the Discovery Science Network . Discovery Science launched in October 1996 as part of the simultaneous rollout of the new channel suite (alongside Discovery Home & Leisure , Discovery Kids and Discovery Civilization ).

[ 4 ] In 2007, adult shows began airing around the clock weekdays, while younger children shows began airing around the clock weeknights.

The channel has undergone various rebrandings throughout its history. Its name was first modified to the Discovery Science Channel in 1998, and then was renamed The Science Channel in 2002, as the first network in the Discovery Networks digital suite to drop the "Discovery" brand from its name (however, international versions of the channel continue to use the "Discovery Science" name). The channel later shortened its name to just Science Channel in 2007 as part of a rebrand that included the introduction of a new logo based on the periodic table ; in 2011, the network rebranded as simply Science , introducing a new logo and graphics package designed by Imaginary Forces.

[ 5 ] In 2008, the channel changed its programming to adult-oriented, and removing all shows for elementary children.

[ 6 ] On December 23, 2016, Discovery Communications debuted a new logo for Science after five years. This rebrand was done by Sibling Rivalry, a New York–based design agency.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] High definition [ edit ] The channel launched a high-definition simulcast feed that broadcasts in 1080i ; it was launched on September 1, 2009, along with Discovery Channel HD, TLC HD and Animal Planet HD.

Programming [ edit ] Science Channel broadcasts a number of science-related television series originally produced by or aired on Discovery Channel , such as Beyond Tomorrow , among others. Discovery Communications has also produced a few programs specifically for Science, such as MegaScience and What The Ancients Knew . Programs from other Discovery Networks channels, PBS and the BBC are either regularly or occasionally aired on the network. Television series produced in the 1990s, such as Discover Magazine and Understanding , are carried on the network's weekday schedule. Science also broadcasts programs such as Moments of Impact and An Idiot Abroad . The channel has experienced some drifting from its intended format throughout its existence, increasingly adding reruns on several science fiction series such as Firefly and Fringe to its schedule in recent years.

Series [ edit ] Below is a selected list of Science series.
