To this day, a number of Greek mathematicians are considered for their innovations and influence on mathematics .

This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources .

Ancient Greek mathematicians [ edit ] This list includes mathematicians working within the Greek tradition in places outside Greece such as Alexandria , Egypt, regardless of whether we know their ethnicity to be Greek.
