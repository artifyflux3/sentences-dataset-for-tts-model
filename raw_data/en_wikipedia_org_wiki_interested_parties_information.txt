It is used worldwide by more than 120 countries and three million right holders.

[ 1 ] Two types of IPI-numbers exist, an IPI Name Number and IPI Base Number.

[ 2 ] IPI Name Number [ edit ] The IP Name Number is the code for a name or pseudonym related to an entity (natural person or a legal entity). One entity can have several names.

Prince for example has the IPI-codes
00045620792 (Nelson Prince Rogers), 00052210040 (Prince) and 00334284961 (Nelson Prince R).

The IPI Name Number is composed of eleven numeric digits.

[ 3 ] IPI Base Number [ edit ] The IPI Base Number is the code for a natural person or a legal entity. It has the pattern H-NNNNNNNNN-C.

H: header (a single letter) N: identification number (nine numeric digits) C: check digit (a single number) For example Pablo Picasso has the IP Base Number I-001068130-6.

History [ edit ] In October 2001, the IPI database replaced the CAE numbers .

[ 4 ] Relation with ISWC-numbers [ edit ] IPI codes are connected with International Standard Musical Work Codes (ISWC). For example, one of the songs called Ernie , which has an International Standard Musical Work Code number of ISWC T-010.171.314-7, has just one interested party, that of Benny Hill whose IPI number is 00014107338. This IPI number can then be used to find all other works by him.

Roles [ edit ] In relation to ISWC each party has at least one role. Roles can be: [ 5 ] A: Author, Writer, Lyricist AD: Adaptor AM: Administrator AR: Arranger AQ: Acquirer C: Composer CA: Composer/Author E: Original Publisher ES: Substitute Publisher PA: Publisher Income Participant PR: Associated Performer SA: Sub-Author SE: Sub-Publisher SR: Sub-Arranger TR: Translator The standards describe the person who adapts music as an arranger, and the person who adapts the text of a musical work to be an adapter.
