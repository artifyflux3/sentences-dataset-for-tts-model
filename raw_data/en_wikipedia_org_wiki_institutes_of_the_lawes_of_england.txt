They were first published, in stages, between 1628 and 1644.

[ 1 ] Widely recognized as a foundational document of the common law , they have been cited in over 70 cases decided by the Supreme Court of the United States , [ 2 ] including several landmark cases . For example, in Roe v. Wade (1973), [ 3 ] Coke's Institutes are cited as evidence that under old English common law, an abortion performed before quickening was not an indictable offence . In the much earlier case of United States v. E. C. Knight Co.

(1895), [ 4 ] Coke's Institutes are quoted at some length for their definition of monopolies .

[ 5 ] Sir Edward Coke’s Institutes also had a significant influence on the development of legal principles in the American colonies. For instance, the Institutes were highly regarded by early American legal scholars and practitioners, including Thomas Jefferson, who referenced Coke’s work in his writings on legal theory and the foundation of American law. This influence helped shape the legal system of the United States in its formative years. The Institutes's various reprinted editions well into the 19th century is a clear indication of the long lasting value placed on this work throughout especially the 18th century in Britain and Europe. It has also been associated through the years with high literary connections. For example, David Hume in 1764 requested it from the bookseller Andrew Millar in a cheap format for a French friend.

[ 6 ] Contents [ edit ] A portrait of Edward Coke from the frontispiece of The Third Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England (4th ed., 1669) [ 7 ] First Part [ edit ] See also: English land law The First Part's subtitle is a "Commentary upon Littleton", concerning land law and property law. Often called Coke on Littleton (abbreviated "Co. Litt."), it is a commentary on Thomas de Littleton 's treatise on land tenure .

[ 8 ] Second Part [ edit ] See also: Ancient constitution of England The Second Part's subtitle is "Containing the Exposition of Many Ancient and Other Statutes", particularly Magna Carta .

[ 9 ] Third Part [ edit ] See also: English criminal law The Third Part's subtitle is "Concerning High Treason and other Please of the Crown and Criminal Causes".

Fourth Part [ edit ] The Fourth Part's subtitle is "Concerning the Jurisdiction of the Courts".
