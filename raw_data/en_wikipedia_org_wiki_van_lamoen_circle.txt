It contains the circumcenters of the six triangles that are defined inside T {\displaystyle T} by its three medians .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Specifically, let A {\displaystyle A} , B {\displaystyle B} , C {\displaystyle C} be the vertices of T {\displaystyle T} , and let G {\displaystyle G} be its centroid (the intersection of its three medians).  Let M a {\displaystyle M_{a}} , M b {\displaystyle M_{b}} , and M c {\displaystyle M_{c}} be the midpoints of the sidelines B C {\displaystyle BC} , C A {\displaystyle CA} , and A B {\displaystyle AB} , respectively. It turns out that the circumcenters of the six triangles A G M c {\displaystyle AGM_{c}} , B G M c {\displaystyle BGM_{c}} , B G M a {\displaystyle BGM_{a}} , C G M a {\displaystyle CGM_{a}} , C G M b {\displaystyle CGM_{b}} , and A G M b {\displaystyle AGM_{b}} lie on a common circle, which is the van Lamoen circle of T {\displaystyle T} .

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The van Lamoen circle is named after the mathematician Floor van Lamoen [ nl ] who posed it as a problem in 2000.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] A proof was provided by Kin Y. Li in 2001, [ 4 ] and the editors of the Amer. Math. Monthly in 2002.

[ 1 ] [ 5 ] Properties [ edit ] The center of the van Lamoen circle is point X ( 1153 ) {\displaystyle X(1153)} in Clark Kimberling 's comprehensive list of triangle centers .

[ 1 ] In 2003, Alexey Myakishev and Peter Y. Woo proved that the converse of the theorem is nearly true, in the following sense: let P {\displaystyle P} be any point in the triangle's interior, and A A ′ {\displaystyle AA'} , B B ′ {\displaystyle BB'} , and C C ′ {\displaystyle CC'} be its cevians , that is, the line segments that connect each vertex to P {\displaystyle P} and are extended until each meets the opposite side.  Then the circumcenters of the six triangles A P B ′ {\displaystyle APB'} , A P C ′ {\displaystyle APC'} , B P C ′ {\displaystyle BPC'} , B P A ′ {\displaystyle BPA'} , C P A ′ {\displaystyle CPA'} , and C P B ′ {\displaystyle CPB'} lie on the same circle if and only if P {\displaystyle P} is the centroid of T {\displaystyle T} or its orthocenter (the intersection of its three altitudes ), at which point the six circumcenters degenerate into the three Euler points of the nine-point circle .

[ 6 ] A simpler proof of this result was given by Nguyen Minh Ha in 2005.
