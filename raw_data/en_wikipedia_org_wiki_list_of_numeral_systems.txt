By culture / time period [ edit ] "A base is a natural number B whose powers (B multiplied by itself some number of times) are specially designated within a numerical system." [ 1 ] : 38 The term is not equivalent to radix , as it applies to all numerical notation systems (not just positional ones with a radix) and most systems of spoken numbers.

[ 1 ] Some systems have two bases, a smaller (subbase) and a larger (base); an example is Roman numerals, which are organized by fives (V=5, L=50, D=500, the subbase) and tens (X=10, C=100, M=1,000, the base).

( April 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A binary clock might use LEDs to express binary values. In this clock, each column of LEDs shows a binary-coded decimal numeral of the traditional sexagesimal time.

The common names are derived somewhat arbitrarily from a mix of Latin and Greek , in some cases including roots from both languages within a single name.

A form of unary notation called Church encoding is used to represent numbers within lambda calculus .

Quinary-vigesimal . This is most frequent. The Greenland Eskimo says 'other hand two' for 7, 'first foot two' for 12, 'other foot two' for 17, and similar combinations to 20, 'man ended.' The Unalit is also quinary to twenty, which is 'man completed.' ...

This article proposes the Unique Number Mapping as an identification scheme, that could replace the E.164 numbers, could be used both with PSTN and VoIP terminals and makes use of the elements of the ENUM technology and the hexatrigesimal number system. […] To have the shortest IDs, we should use the greatest possible number system, which is the hexatrigesimal. Here the place values correspond to powers of 36...
