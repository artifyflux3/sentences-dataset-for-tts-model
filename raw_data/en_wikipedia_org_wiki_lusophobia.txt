Social model of disability Social privilege Christian male white Social stigma Speciesism Stereotype The talk v t e Lusophobia or anti-Portuguese sentiment is hostility, racism, hatred, and/or discrimination toward Portugal , the Portuguese people or the Portuguese language and culture .

Etymology [ edit ] Like " Lusitanic ", the word "Lusophobia" ( Portuguese : lusofobia ) derives from " Lusitania ", the Ancient Roman province that comprised what is now Central and Southern Portugal and Extremadura , and " phobia ", which means "fear of". The opposite concept is "Lusophilia".

Brazil [ edit ] In the 19th century, the term lusofobia was often used to describe nationalist sentiments in Brazil , a former colony of the Portuguese Empire , with liberal politicians in Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco advocating the reduction of Portuguese immigration and involvement in the Brazilian economy, although almost all of them were of Portuguese descent .

[ 1 ] In Rio de Janeiro , the "Jacobinos", a small national radical group, were the strongest opponents of the galegos , the Portuguese immigrants, who have always been the biggest ethnocultural community in Brazil.

[ 2 ] In the immediate aftermath of Pedro I of Brazil 's downfall in 1831, the poor mixed-race and black people, including slaves, staged anti-Portuguese riots in Salvador.

[ 3 ] United Kingdom [ edit ] In 2007, after the three-year-old Madeleine McCann disappeared from Praia da Luz , in the Algarve region, in southern Portugal, many British media outlets wrote articles highly critical of Portugal and Portuguese police that portrayed Portugal as a "backwards banana republic".

[ 4 ] Others in the media promoted anti-Portuguese sentiment with ideas such as boycotting Portugal [ 5 ] as a holiday destination, but that was not reflected in general public opinion, which saw record numbers of British tourists visit Portugal.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Estimates were that a record 2 million British tourists holidayed in Portugal in 2007.

[ 8 ] Notable anti-Portuguese articles by Tony Parsons [ 9 ] received a record number of complaints to the Press Complaints Commission for that year.
