Rank in the fire service is an important element of its structure due to the battle-like conditions found on emergency incidents. Positions of authority need to be clearly defined, as do the type and number of subordinates under a rank, and the ability to manage the number of personnel on an incident or emergency scene.

Virtually every fire department in Canada has at least a fire chief, and usually captains.

Rank insignia is worn either on the collar, (colloquially called "collar dogs" or "collar brass"), or on epaulets, and in some cases, both. Also badges, which also denote rank, are worn in some regions.

Badge, stripe and trumpet colours are a further denotation, silver being non-Chief ranks, gold reserved for Chiefs.

Like the United States, Canada uses speaking trumpets for rank indication - a reference to a megaphone -like device used in the early days of the fire service, for officer ranks. Typically, silver trumpets indicate lieutenant (1 trumpet) or captain (2 trumpets), and gold indicates Chief officer ranks, ranging 2 trumpets (Battalion or District Chief) up to 5 trumpets (Fire Chief).

Due to close ties and histories with Britain, there are also considerable ranking similarities to  the United Kingdom, including the use of rank insignia on uniform epaulets.

Germany [ edit ] In Germany every federal state has its own civil protection laws thus they have different rank systems. Additionally, in the volunteer fire departments, there is a difference between a rank and an official position. This is founded on the military traditions of the fire departments. Every firefighter can hold a high rank without having an official position. A firefighter can be promoted by years of service, training skills and qualifications. Official positions are partly elected or given by capabilities. These conditions allow that older ordinary firefighters have higher ranks than their leaders. But through this ranks are no authorities given ( Brevet ).

There may be jurisdictions that do not utilize this rank structure, though they are rare.

In the United States, helmet colors often denote a fire fighter's rank or position. Generally, white helmets denote chief officers, (battalion chiefs, division chiefs, etc.), and red helmets denote company officers, (captains, lieutenants). While not universal, there are other commonalities, such as black for non-ranked firefighters, blue for EMS, and green for probationary firefighter.

There are some region specifics for helmet colors, though they have little to do with rank. For example, in San Francisco the SFFD paint their helmets based on a color system that denotes the apparatus they are assigned to.

Officer ranks are most commonly denoted by the number of speaking trumpets - a reference to a megaphone -like device used in the early days of the fire service, although currently and incorrectly called " bugles ". , or by striping. Ranks proceed from one (lieutenant) to five (fire chief) trumpets.

The ranks of Deputy and Assistant Chief may differ based on region: one area may have the Assistant Chief as higher rank than Deputy, while another jurisdiction would be the opposite - Deputy out-ranking Assistant.

Rank Insignia Firefighter No rank insignia Engineer/apparatus operator/driver operator No rank insignia Lieutenant Captain or Battalion Chief/District Chief or side by side Division Chief/Assistant Chief/Deputy Chief Deputy Chief or Assistant Chief Fire Chief Typically, the captain is the ranking officer of a fire station, (which may include anywhere from one apparatus up to several apparatus), and the lieutenant is typically in charge of a single apparatus.

There are also both state (e.g. CalFire in California) and   federal (e.g. U.S. Forest Service) rank structures. These align with the typical ranking of the rest of the North American fire service.

Some other U.S. fire departments such as the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) use military rank insignia (specifically sleeve insignia, though it is not an official part of the FDNY uniform code) in addition to the traditional bugles.
