[ 4 ] History [ edit ] The term "4D film" is an extension of 3D film , which gives the illusion of three-dimensional solidity.

[ 5 ] Precursors of the modern 4D film presentation include Sensurround, which debuted in 1974 with the film Earthquake . Only a few films were presented in Sensurround, and it was supplanted by Dolby Stereo in 1977, which featured extended low frequencies and made subwoofers a common addition to cinema.

[ 6 ] Other notable efforts at pushing the boundaries of the film viewing experience include Fantasound , the first use of stereo sound; Cinemiracle and Cinerama , both widescreen formats utilizing multiple projectors; and Smell-O-Vision .

The Sensorium is regarded as the world's first commercial 4D film and was first screened in 1984 at Six Flags Power Plant in Baltimore. It was produced in partnership with Landmark Entertainment .
