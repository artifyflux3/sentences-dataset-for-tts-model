The town is situated on the banks of the river Aller , a tributary of the Weser , and has a population of about 71,000. Celle is the southern gateway to the Lüneburg Heath , has a castle ( Schloss Celle ) built in the Renaissance and Baroque styles and a picturesque old town centre (the Altstadt ) with more than 400 timber-framed houses , making Celle one of the most remarkable members of the German Timber-Frame Road . From 1378 to 1705 Celle was the official residence of the Lüneburg branch of the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg ( House of Welf ), who had been banished from their original ducal seat by its townsfolk.

[ 3 ] Geography [ edit ] The Weser watershed, showing the location of Celle on the Aller.

The town of Celle lies in the glacial valley of the Aller , about 40 kilometres (25 mi) northeast of Hanover , 60 kilometres (37 mi) northwest of Brunswick and 120 kilometres (75 mi) south of Hamburg . With 71,000 inhabitants it is, next to Lüneburg , the largest Lower Saxon town between Hanover and Hamburg.

Expansion [ edit ] The town covers an area of 176.05 square kilometres (67.97 sq mi). Flowing from the northeast, the Lachte discharges into the Aller within the town, as does the Fuhse flowing from the southeast. The Aller heads westwards towards Verden an der Aller , where it joins the Weser .

The wettest month is August, which has 1.5 times the amount of precipitation as February, the driest month. Monthly precipitation varies only slightly and is very evenly spread throughout the year. Only 1% of German weather stations show a lower annual variation.

The Celle weather station has recorded the following extreme values: [ 4 ] Its highest temperature was 37.5 °C (99.5 °F) on 9 August 1992.

Its lowest temperature was −26.8 °C (−16.2 °F) on 27 January 1942.

Its greatest annual precipitation was 982.7 mm (38.69 in) in 2002.

Its least annual precipitation was 350.1 mm (13.78 in) in 1959.

Subdivisions [ edit ] The town of Celle has the following 17 boroughs or Stadtteile , some of which were previously independent villages (population as at 1 January 2005): Altencelle (4,998), Altenhagen (922), Blumlage/Altstadt (8,526), Bostel (455), Boye (832), Garßen (2,978), Groß Hehlen (2,773), Hehlentor (7,974), Hustedt (736), Klein Hehlen (5,782), Lachtehausen (639), Neuenhäusen (8,082), Neustadt/Heese (10,887), Scheuen (1,165), Vorwerk (2,842), Westercelle (7,183) and Wietzenbruch (4,805).

History [ edit ] Middle Ages [ edit ] Celle was first mentioned in a document of A.D.

985 as Kiellu [ 7 ] (which means Fischbucht [ 8 ] or fishing bay). It was granted the right to mint and circulate its own coins under the minting rights during the 11th century and several coins were found in the Sandur hoard in the Faroes . In 1292 Duke Otto II the Strict (1277–1330), a Welf who ruled the Principality of Lüneburg from 1277 to 1330, left Altencelle , where there had been defences in the form of a circular rampart (the Ringwall von Burg ) since the 10th century, and founded a rectangular settlement by the existing castle ( Burg ) 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) to the northwest. In 1301 he granted Celle its town privileges [ 9 ] and in 1308 started construction on the town church.

In 1378 Celle became the Residenz of the dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg and in 1433 the princes of Lüneburg took up residence in the castle ( Schloss ). The ducal palace was situated on a triangle between the Aller and its tributary, the Fuhse. A moat connecting the rivers was built in 1433, turning the town centre into an island. In 1452 Duke Frederick the Pious of Lüneburg founded a Franciscan monastery. In 1464 the grain shipping monopoly generated an economic upturn for the town.

Early modern period [ edit ] Rooftop view of Celle Hugenottenstraße is the main street of the former French quarter Emigrantenstraße, a historical street laid out for Austrian refugees JVA Celle which is often mistaken for a castle In 1524 the Reformation was introduced into Celle. In 1570 Duke William the Younger built the castle chapel, which was consecrated in 1585.

In 1660 Celle had 3,750 inhabitants.

[ 10 ] From 1665 to 1705 Celle experienced a cultural boom as a Residenz under Duke George William . This has been put down in particular to his French wife, Eleonore d'Olbreuse, who brought fellow Huguenot Christians and Italian architects to Celle. During this time the French and Italian Gardens were laid out and the baroque castle theatre built. Because of the persecution of Huguenots under Louis XIV many French Huguenots sought refuge in Germany, especially in Berlin and in the towns of Celle, Neuwied and Hanau . About 300 Huguenots settled in Celle, where a new residential area was laid out for them in the southwest of the centre.  Its main street, Hugenottenstrasse , is still a sightworthy historical street with well-preserved wooden houses built at the beginning of the 18th century. Many French refugees worked in the castle as cooks and servants, but some of them opened shops in Celle as tailors, carpenters, joiners, confectioners, wig makers and glovers, thus introducing some French cuisine, fashion and lifestyle into the town. Some years later protestant refugees from Austria sought refuge in Celle as well.

Emigrantenstraße is another historical street, which was laid out for the Austrians.

In 1705 the last duke of the Brunswick–Lüneburg line died and Celle, along with the Principality of Lüneburg , passed back to the Hanover line of the Welfs . By way of compensation for the loss of its status as a Residenz town numerous administrative institutions were established in Celle, such as the Higher Court of Appeal ( Oberappellationsgericht ), the prison and the State Stud Farm . That began its development into an administrative and judicial centre. Even today the Lower Saxony-Bremen State Social Security Tribunal and the High Court responsible for most of Lower Saxony are based in Celle, amongst others.

Celle is also still home to a prison (the Justizvollzugsanstalt Celle or JVA Celle ), which was built in a baroque style in the west of the city centre between 1710 and 1731.

[ 11 ] Sometimes tourists mistake it for a castle because of its typical baroque architecture. That the citizens of Celle once − in a vote − chose to have a prison in Celle rather than a university in order to protect the virtue of their daughters is not verifiable but it has remained a persistent anecdote in popular folklore.

In August 1714 George Elector of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick–Lüneburg (King George I) ascended to the British throne. Between then and 1866, when the town became Prussian during the Austro-Prussian War as part of the province of Hanover , Celle was a possession of the British Hanoverian line .

In 1786 Albrecht Thaer founded the first German Agricultural Testing Institute in the meadows in the Dammasch ( dam marsh ) (today Thaer's Garden). The Albrecht-Thaer School is nowadays part of a vocational centre in the Celle sub-district of Altenhagen .

New Town Hall Modern period [ edit ] In 1842 the Cambridge Dragoons Barracks ( Cambridge-Dragoner-Kaserne ) for the homonymous regiment named after the Hanoveran Viceroy Duke Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge , was built in Celle. After being extended in 1913 and partially rebuilt after a fire in 1936, it was renamed Goodwood Barracks in 1945 and from 1976 to 1996 was the headquarters of Panzerbrigade 33 in the German armed forces, the Bundeswehr . In 1989 it was renamed again to Cambridge-Dragoner-Kaserne. Since 1996 the area has mainly been used to house one of the largest youth centres in Lower Saxony.

From 1869 to 1872 an infantry barracks was built for the 77th Infantry Regiment which also gave the main street (running the length of the front of the barracks) its name of 77er Strasse. In 1938 it was renamed the Heidekaserne ("Heath Barracks"). After the Second World War the barracks was used by British troops until 1993 during which time 94 Locating Regiment Royal Artillery held residency for over 25 years, followed briefly by 14 Signal Regiment, which relocated from Scheuen until the barracks were handed back to the local authorities. Today the New Town Hall ( Neue Rathaus ) and Celle Council Offices are housed in the restored brick building. Residential buildings and a town park have been established on the rest of the terrain.

Steel engraving of the marketplace around 1845 In 1892 − with the help of numerous citizens' donations − the present-day Bomann Museum with its important folklore and town-history collections was founded. In 1913 the 74 metre high clock tower was built on the town church and its clockwork underwent a major restoration in 2008. In the 1920s the silk mill was built. It was merged in 1932 with the one in Peine to become the Seidenwerk Spinnhütte AG . This concern expanded during the Nazi era into an armaments centre under the name of Seidenwerk Spinnhütte AG. A subsidiary founded in 1936, the Mitteldeutsche Spinnhütte AG, led war preparations through its branches in the central German towns of Apolda , Plauen , Osterode , Pirna and Wanfried . Its only product was the parachute silk needed for the paratroopers of the Wehrmacht .

[ 12 ] During World War I , Germany operated two prisoner-of-war camps in Celle, and among its prisoners were British, Polish, Romanian, French, Belgian and Russian POWs and civilians.

[ 13 ] In 1916–1917, the Germans operated a special sub-sector for Polish POWs at one of the camps, with the aim of subjecting them to propaganda and conscripting them into a planned German-controlled Polish army to fight against Russia.

[ 14 ] In September 1929 Rudolph Karstadt opened a Karstadt department store in Celle town centre, the façade of which was identical to that of the Karstadt store on Berlin 's Hermannplatz. The Celle branch was demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a controversial new building, the aluminium-braced facade of which was meant to represent Celle's timber-framed houses .

Nazi era [ edit ] Memorial of Celler Hasenjagd Information board at the memorial During Kristallnacht , the anti-Jewish pogrom in Nazi Germany on 9/10 November 1938, the synagogue in Celle was saved from complete destruction only because it was in a very narrow lane and there would have been a risk to the adjacent leather factory and other parts of the historical city centre with its old wooden houses.

On 1 April 1939 Altenhäusen, Klein Hehlen, Neuenhäusen, Vorwerk and Wietzenbruch were incorporated into Celle. When World War II broke out, two serious Allied bombings occurred during the bombing of Celle : one on 22 February when the Celle railway station was attacked as a part of Operation Clarion [ citation needed ] and on 8 April 1945, when 2.2% of the town was destroyed, especially the industrial areas and railway freight terminal. A train in which about 4,000 prisoners were being transported to the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was hit. The attack claimed hundreds of casualties, but some of the prisoners managed to escape into the nearby woods.

SS guards and Celle citizens participated in the so-called 'Celle hare hunt' ( Celler Hasenjagd ).

[ 15 ] The 'hunt' claimed several hundred dead and went on until 10 April 1945 and represented the darkest chapter in Celle's history.

[ 16 ] The exact number of victims has not been determined. Several of the perpetrators were later tried and convicted of this war crime . A memorial with an information board and a copper-beech tree was inaugurated in Triftanlagen park on 8 April 1992. The German word for copper-beech is Blutbuche, meaning blood beech.

About 2.2% of Celle (67 houses) was destroyed in the Second World War. 550 houses were heavily damaged and 614 were slightly damaged. Celle was spared from further destruction by surrendering without a fight to advancing allied troops on 12 April 1945, so that the historical city centre and the castle survived the war completely unscathed.

Military [ edit ] German Army Anti-tank helicopter Bölkow Bo 105 at Celle Air Base.

In Nazi Germany , Celle was an important garrison location. Elements of the 17th and 73rd Infantry Regiments and the 19th Artillery Regiment were garrisoned in the town. Celle was also the headquarters of a military district command and a military records office.

The different German Army barracks (including the Freiherr von Fritsch Barracks in Scheuen and the Cambridge Dragoons Barracks in the city) were used as sites for the German 33rd Armoured Brigade until the 1990s. The Celle Air Base (Immelmann Barracks) in the District of Wietzenbruch is now the site of the Training Centre of the Army Aviation School and the Cambridge Dragoons Barracks has now become a youth cultural centre (CD-Kaserne).

The British Army barracks, which as Celle Station formed part of Bergen-Hohne Garrison , were handed over to the German authorities on 5 November 2012. Since German reunification , Celle has largely lost its role as a major garrison town.

Post-war era [ edit ] After the war Celle applied, along with Bonn and Frankfurt , to become the seat for the Parliamentary Council ( Parlamentarischer Rat ), the immediate post-war governmental body in Germany, later superseded by the West German Bundestag . In the end the privilege went to Bonn .

Trenchard Barracks in Celle was the most modern barracks in Germany during the war, with blackout blinds between the double-glazed windows and other features which became commonplace afterwards. The cellar doors were trial rooms for the number of inmates from Belsen who could be gassed.  When Belsen concentration camp was liberated Trenchard Barracks was used as a hospital for surviving inmates who needed treatment. Later it became the Barracks for the 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade.

On 1 January 1973 Celle lost its status as an independent town ( Kreisfreie Stadt ) and became the largest municipality in the new district ( Kreis ) of Celle. It also became the largest town in the new region ( Regierungsbezirk ) of Lüneburg . At the same time the localities of Ummern, Pollhöfen and Hahnenhorn were incorporated into Gifhorn district . Since then the parish of Hohne has looked after six villages ( Hohne , Helmerkamp, Spechtshorn , Ummern, Pollhöfen and Hahnenhorn) in two rural districts. The town of Celle has also incorporated a number of villages from the surrounding area.

On 25 July 1978 a staged bomb attack was made on the outer wall of the prison. This was initially blamed on the Red Army Faction , but was later revealed to have been perpetrated by Lower Saxony 's intelligence service, the Verfassungsschutz . The incident became known as the Celle Hole .

In 2004 the region of Lüneburg was dissolved along with the rest of Lower Saxony's administrative districts. Celle is currently the twelfth largest town in Lower Saxony .

Incorporation of municipalities [ edit ] 1 April 1939: Altenhäusen, Klein Hehlen , Neuenhäusen , Vorwerk und Wietzenbruch 1 January 1973: Altencelle , Altenhagen , Alvern, Bostel, Boye, Burg, Garßen , Groß Hehlen , Hustedt, Lachtehausen, Scheuen and Westercelle .

Growth in population [ edit ] In the Middle Ages and early modern period Celle only had a few thousand inhabitants. The population grew only slowly and dropped frequently as a result of many wars, epidemics and periods of famine. Not until the beginnings of industrialisation in the 19th century did population growth accelerate. It reached a total of 8,800 in 1818 but by 1900 this had more than doubled to 20,000. The incorporation of the surrounding villages on 1 April 1939 saw a further (artificial) rise in numbers to 38,000.

Shortly after the Second World War the many refugees and displaced persons from Eastern Europe led to a steep rise in the number of inhabitants within just a few months from around 17,000 to 55,000 by December 1945. The addition of new municipalities on 1 January 1973 saw an additional 18,691 people being included within the borough of Celle and bringing the total population to 75,178 − its historical high point.
On 30 June 2005 the official number of inhabitants within Celle borough, according to an update by the Lower Saxony State Department of Statistics, was 71,402 (only main residences, and after adjustments with the other state departments).

The following overview shows the population numbers based on the 'catchment area' at the time. The 1818 figure is an estimate, the rest are based on census results(¹) or official updates by the Department of Statistics. From 1871 the returns show the population actually present, from 1925 the resident population and since 1987 the population residing at their main residence. Before 1871 the numbers are based on various, different census-gathering processes.

In 1983, 1987, 1990 and 1994 Klaus-Jürgen Hedrich ( CDU ) won the direct vote. In 1998, 2002 and 2005 Peter Struck ( SPD ) won the majority of votes. In 2009 Henning Otte (CDU) received the direct mandate.

[ 20 ] Twin towns – sister cities [ edit ] Signpost of twin towns of Celle See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany Celle is twinned with: [ 21 ] Celle Ligure , Italy Hämeenlinna , Finland Holbæk , Denmark Kwidzyn , Poland Meudon , France Mazkeret Batya , Israel Sumy , Ukraine Tavistock , England, United Kingdom Tulsa , United States Tyumen , Russia Main sights [ edit ] Half-timbered house (Bergstr.) with incorrectly replaced halves Church St.Marien with its white steeple The buildings in Celle's old town centre date back to the 16th century, among them numerous (and some 480 restored) half-timber houses with wood carvings, making Celle an important city for tourism in the southern Lüneburg Heath region. One of the most famous houses is Hoppenerhaus dating from 1532. The Old Latin School was built in 1602. The most impressive building in Celle is the ducal palace, Schloss Celle , which was built in 1530 in a well-kept park at the site of the former castle. It was enlarged in a baroque style in the 17th century, and a renaissance chapel and a special theatre which is the oldest theatre in Germany were added in 1674. The Old City Hall which is famous for its sandstone carvings was built 1561-1579 in a Renaissance style.

[ 22 ] Another major attraction is the Stadtkirche (town church) with its white tower, from where the town trumpeter blows a fanfare twice a day (an old tradition that was revived as a tourist attraction). Originally it was a small gothic chapel built in 1380,  but it was enlarged from 1675 to 1698 and transformed into a baroque church with impressive stucco ornaments.

Hugenottenstrasse is a historical street with well-preserved wooden houses built at the beginning of the 18th century. It was the main street of a residential area specially laid out for French Huguenots who sought refuge in Celle because of the Persecution of Huguenots under Louis XV in the 17th century. The oldest house dates from 1693. On the corner of Emigrantenstraße, another historical street which was laid out for Austrian refugees at the beginning of the 18th century, Neuhäuser Kirche, a Lutheran church was founded in 1710. It was enlarged from 1852 to 1866. Its steeple dates from the same period.

Even a large prison ( Justizvollzugsanstalt, JVA ) was built in a baroque style in the west of the city centre from 1710 to 1731. It was the only historical building of Celle which was damaged during the air raid on 8 April 1945. It was repaired after the war. Sometimes tourists walking from the railway station to the centre mistake it for a castle because of its typical baroque architecture.

Celle has a synagogue built in 1740, one of the few that survived the Nazi pogrom night of 1938, thanks to its location in a narrow street of wooden half-timber houses next to an important leather factory that would have been collaterally damaged.

The Albrecht Thaer School, a school in Celle, was founded by Albrecht Daniel Thaer in 1796.

And in the old storage barn ( Treppenspeicher ) built in 1607, as well as the orangery , built in 1677 for the Institute of Apiculture, an exhibition of beekeeping may be viewed.

Theatre [ edit ] The Schlosstheater Celle was founded in 1674 and is the oldest, still working theatre in Germany and the oldest baroque theatre in Europe. It has a main auditorium and two smaller stages ( Malersaal and Turmbühne ) as well as an additional external venue ( Halle 19 ).
Located at the edge of the old town ( Altstadt ) is the performing arts theatre Kunst & Bühne which is supported by the town and whose repertoire ranges from comedy to songs, jazz, cabaret and films.

Parks [ edit ] The picturesque French Garden lies immediately south of the Altstadt and is where the Lower Saxon Institute of Apiculture may be found. The Castle Park , with its moats, is on the site of the former defensive fortifications of the ducal castle. Along Bahnhofstraße there is an area of common pasture used as a public park and play area ( Triftanlagen ).
On the right bank of the Aller are the Dammasch Meadows, a popular destination for trips and recreation, and immediately next to them is the garden of medicinal plants and the Thaers Garden with its little manor house. By the New Town Hall ( Neues Rathaus ) is the recently laid-out town park. Other important open areas include the various town cemeteries, such as the picturesque forest cemetery, the Waldfriedhof , with its nature garden.

From 1968 to the mid-1970s Celle's football club, TuS Celle , played in the German second division (then called the Regionalliga or "regional league" ). After two bankruptcies and relegation, it was promoted to the Lower Saxony league for the 2004–2005 season and, since 2005 has played in the Northeast Lower Saxony league ( Oberliga Niedersachsen Nordost ), which is fifth tier of the German football league system.

Celle also hosted Angola 's national football team during the 2006 Football World Cup .

Economy and Infrastructure [ edit ] Economy [ edit ] Tourism is a large contributor to Celle's economy, especially in the summer months during jazz, wine, and other festivals, which attract thousands of visitors.

The town is not really known for heavy industry, but many businesses which have started up in Celle and some, such as Rosa Graf Cosmetics, have reached the world market. Celle does have some links to the oil industry, though, particularly firms engineering parts for drilling; notably Baker Hughes ( INTEQ and Hughes Christensen divisions; oil and gas industry service companies specialising in MWD , Wireline , Drill-bits , Drilling Applications Engineering, etc.), Cameron [ 23 ] (global provider of pressure control, processing, flow control and compression systems as well as project management and aftermarket services for the oil and gas and process industries), and ITAG [ 24 ] (drilling contractors and manufacturing plant).

Halliburton , founded in 1919, is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry and has an office in Celle.

[ 25 ] There is also a school for advance drilling techniques.

Other light industries include electronics, food manufacture, and metal, wood and plastic processing. In addition there an ink manufacturer (formerly Hostmann-Steinberg now hubergroup) , paper factory (Werner Achilles Glanzfolien-Kaschieranstalt) and musical instruments makers (including Moeck ). Celle is also home to Germany's Bee institute which carries out scientific studies on the bee species as well as keeping its own bee hives.

Celle is also known as a town of civil servants, due to the large number of government officials and lawyers who work there providing important administrative and judicial services to the region. Agriculture and forestry also play a role.

Foodstuffs [ edit ] Celle is the base for a crispbread factory, Barilla Wasa Deutschland. Regional and to some extent national suppliers are the high-alcohol drink manufactures of the Ratzeputz and Alter Provisor brands. Originally made in Celle's Altstadt, the herb-based spirit Ratzeputz is now distilled on the Westercelle industrial estate, Alter Provisor is still produced and sold in the Altstadt .

Celler Bier is also established here with its six varieties of beer. Another Celle speciality is Rohe Roulade , which initially gained fame in the Gasthaus Krohne (now Dackel's Krohne ) in the district of Blumlage and is now offered in many of Celle's restaurants and pubs.

Transport and logistics [ edit ] The East Hanoverian Railways ( Osthannoversche Eisenbahnen or OHE ) is a goods and passenger transport company covering the north German area with its headquarters in Celle.
Also based in Celle are the postal distribution centre for Deutsche Post 's post code district 29 and the transport company DTLS – Drilling Tools Logistic & Service.

Transport [ edit ] Rail [ edit ] Celle lies on the Hanover – Celle – Uelzen – Lüneburg – Hamburg line .

Intercity (IC) trains to Hanover and Hamburg stop hourly at the station as do individual ICE trains during the rush hour.

metronom trains link Celle to Uelzen, Hanover and Göttingen as part of the regional transport network. Celle is the terminus for routes S 6 and S 7 of the Hanover S-Bahn .

The section between Celle and Großburgwedel was built in the 1920s as a high-speed line for testing and record journeys across the heath-like, so-called Wietzenbruch. It was nicknamed the Hare Railway ( Hasenbahn ) due to its environment which was devoid of habitation and the numerous hares killed on the line in its early days. In 1965 this section via Langenhagen was electrified for the TEE and IC services from Hamburg to Hanover, in order to save routing them via Lehrte and having to change direction in Hanover. Later it was upgraded for traffic operating regularly at 200 km/h (124 mph).
Formerly there were railway links from Celle via Schwarmstedt to Bremen ( Aller Valley Railway ) and via Plockhorst to Brunswick ; these were closed in the 1970s and have largely been dismantled. In 2004 the last remaining branch line from Gifhorn to Celle via Wienhausen , that was still used in places for goods traffic, was finally closed and work on lifting the line in the area of the town has begun.

The East Hanoverian Railways run goods trains on several branch lines in the Celle area, including those to Wittingen , Soltau and Munster . Occasionally heritage trains and specials also run on these lines.

The Lehrte–Celle railway is an important route for goods trains and was converted in 1998 into a modern S-Bahn line.

A tramway network of 2 lines had been operated since 1907 by the Celler Straßenbahn but this was closed and dismantled between 1954 and 1956.

Road [ edit ] Important links are: North-south: the B 3 running north to Soltau / Hamburg and south to Hanover Southeast-west: the B 214 running southeast to Brunswick and west to Nienburg Northeast: the B 191 to Uelzen / Lüneburg / Ludwigslust Landesstraße 310 via Fuhrberg southwest to the junction at Mellendorf on the A 7 motorway Landesstraße 282 east-northeast via Beedenbostel , Eldingen and Steinhorst to Wittingen Landesstraße 180 via Winsen (Aller) west-northwest to the motorway services of Raststätte Allertal , on the A 7 Air [ edit ] The Berlin Airlift memorial at Celle Air Base Hanover-Langenhagen airport with international flight connections is about 35 kilometres (22 miles) away.

The Army airfield at Celle is 4.5 kilometres southwest of the town centre on the edge of the district of Wietzenbruch . Operated as RAF Celle after the Second World War , it was from here in 1948–49 that supply flights to Berlin took off as part of the Berlin Airlift . Today the airfield is mainly used by the Army Aviation School ( Heeresfliegerwaffenschule ) as a training airfield for helicopter pilots.

Celle-Arloh airfield near the district of Scheuen is a recreational airfield. It also offers round trips over the town of Celle and the Lüneburg Heath. There is also a glider airfield at Scheuen.

Water [ edit ] Celle harbour is only used by tourists today. From Celle the Aller is classified downstream as a federal shipping lane; upstream a weir prevents ships passing. In former centuries Celle was an important transhipment station for ships between Brunswick and the ports in Bremen via Oker , Aller and the (Lower) Weser . Bremen and Brunswick merchants had specific tasks from the Dukes of Celle and later the town of Celle in order to ensure the safety of transport, because the speed of the Aller in the area of Celle made loading and unloading in the port necessary.

From 1900 the quantity of trade through Celle Harbour steadily decreased and switched to road and rail. Until 1970 the transport of grain to the Celle Rathsmühle and the transport of potash salts were still significant.

Town public transport services [ edit ] The firm of CeBus runs eight bus lines around the town. There are 15 bus lines for regional services, with which the villages in the district of Celle can be reached. Sometimes town and region bus services are combined.

Media [ edit ] The Cellesche Zeitung is the local daily newspaper with a circulation of 34,977 (as at: 2nd quarter 2005) . In addition there is the bi-weekly Celler Kurier and weekly Celler Blitz as well as a monthly town magazine, the Celler Scene . Another monthly is the Celler Blickpunkt . The revista appears roughly every 2 months with a left-wing perspective of politics and culture.
