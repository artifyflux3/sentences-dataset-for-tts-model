Robinson published The Lady's Magazine and a serial reference work, The New Annual Register , as well as fiction and non-fiction. He was also known for publishing books written by women.

Life [ edit ] Robinson was baptised at Dalston , Cumberland , in December 1736, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and about 1755 migrated to London in search of work.

John Nichols later said that Robinson came with "a decent education, and a great share of natural sense and shrewdness." [ 3 ] He was an assistant to John Rivington (1720–1792), a publisher in St Paul's Churchyard , and later worked for a Mr. Johnstone on Ludgate Hill . In about 1763 he and a friend, John Roberts, went into business in Paternoster Row as booksellers. In setting himself up in business, Robinson had the support of Thomas Longman, "who liberally, and unasked, offered him any sum, on credit, that might be wanted".

[ 3 ] His partner, Roberts, died about 1776.

[ 2 ] From bookselling, Robinson turned also to publishing and bought many copyrights. This was on his own account, and only rarely in partnership with Roberts. In 1773, he became the printer and publisher of The Lady's Magazine .

[ 4 ] By 1780, he was also a large book wholesaler .

[ 2 ] From 1781, he was the publisher of the New Annual Register .

[ 5 ] In 1784, he took his son George into the business, making him a partner, and also his much younger brother John (1753–1813).

[ 2 ] Robinson printed John Ferdinand Smyth Stuart 's book A Tour in the United States of America (1784), for which Smyth Stuart was to pay £160.

[ 6 ] On 26 November 1793, Robinson's company was fined for selling copies of Thomas Paine 's Rights of Man .

[ 2 ] A radical, in 1794 Robinson published Ann Radcliffe 's The Mysteries of Udolpho , for which he paid her the generous sum of £500, equivalent to £58,735 in 2020, and later also bought her A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794 .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Thomas Cadell said of George Robinson's integrity that "too much cannot be said." Another bookseller, William West, recorded some anecdotes of Robinson and his hospitality at his villa at Streatham , calling him "the Prince, nay, the King of Booksellers".

[ 10 ] Robinson died in Paternoster Row on 6 June 1801. His son and his brother continued the business, but George died in 1811 and John in 1813.
