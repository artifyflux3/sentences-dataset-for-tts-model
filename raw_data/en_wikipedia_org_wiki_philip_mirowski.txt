Find sources: "Philip Mirowski" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( August 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Philosopher of economic thought Philip Mirowski (born 21 August 1951 in Jackson, Michigan ) is a historian and philosopher of economic thought at the University of Notre Dame . He received a PhD in Economics from the University of Michigan in 1979.

[ 1 ] Career [ edit ] In his 1989 book More Heat than Light , Mirowski reveals a history of how physics has drawn inspiration from economics and how economics has sought to emulate physics, especially with regard to the theory of value . He traces the development of the energy concept in Western physics and its subsequent effect on the invention and promulgation of neoclassical economics , the modern orthodox theory. Mirowski's thesis has been challenged by Hal Varian and defended, with some reservations, by D. Wade Hands .

[ 2 ] Machine Dreams explores the historical influences of the military and the cyborg sciences on neoclassical economics. The neglected influence of John von Neumann and his theory of automata are key themes throughout the book. Mirowski claims that many of the developments in neoclassical economics in the 20th century, from game theory to computational economics , are the unacknowledged result of von Neumann's plans for economics. The work expands Mirowski's vision for a computational economics, one in which various market types are constructed in a similar fashion to Noam Chomsky 's generative grammar . The role of economics is to explore how various market types perform in measures of complexity and efficiency, with more complicated markets being able to incorporate the effects of the less complex. By complexity Mirowski means something analogous to computational complexity theory in computer science .

[ citation needed ] Mirowski's criticism of game theory is noted by financial economist and historian Peter L. Bernstein .

[ 3 ] In his book Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste , Mirowski concludes that neoliberal thought has become so pervasive that any countervailing evidence serves only to further convince disciples of its ultimate truth. Once neoliberalism became a Theory of Everything, providing a revolutionary account of self, knowledge, information, markets, and government, it could no longer be falsified by anything as trifling as data from the "real" economy.
