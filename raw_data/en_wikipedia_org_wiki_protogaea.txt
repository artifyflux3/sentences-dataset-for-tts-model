Unpublished in his lifetime, but made known by Johann Georg von Eckhart in 1719, [ 2 ] it was conceived as a preface to his incomplete history of the House of Brunswick .

[ 3 ] Life [ edit ] Protogaea is a history of the Earth written in conjectural terms; it was composed by Leibniz in the period from 1691 to 1693.

[ 4 ] A summary in Latin was published in 1693 in the Leipzig Acta Eruditorum .

[ 5 ] The text was first published in full in 1749, shortly after Benoît de Maillet 's more far-reaching ideas on the origin of the Earth , circulated in manuscript, had been printed.

[ 6 ] Views [ edit ] Protogaea built on, and criticized, the natural philosophy of René Descartes , as expressed in his Principia Philosophiae .

[ 7 ] Leibniz in the work adopted the Cartesian theory of the Earth as a sun crusted over with sunspots .

[ 3 ] He relied on the authority of Agostino Scilla writing about fossils to discredit the speculations of Athanasius Kircher and Johann Joachim Becher ; [ 8 ] he had met Scilla in Rome a few years earlier.

[ 9 ] He took up suggestions of Nicolaus Steno that argued for the forms of fossils being prior to their inclusion in rocks, for stratification, and for the gradual solidification of the Earth.
