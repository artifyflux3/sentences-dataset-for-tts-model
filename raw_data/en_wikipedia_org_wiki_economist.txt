The individual may also study, develop, and apply theories and concepts from economics and write about economic policy . Within this field there are many sub-fields, ranging from the broad philosophical theories to the focused study of minutiae within specific markets , macroeconomic analysis, microeconomic analysis or financial statement analysis , involving analytical methods and tools such as econometrics , statistics , economics computational models , financial economics , regulatory impact analysis and mathematical economics .

Professions [ edit ] Former chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan , who obtained his Ph.D. in economics from New York University , testifies before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services .

Former chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen speaks with IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde , 2014.

Economists work in many fields including [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] academia, government and in the private sector, where they may also "study data and statistics in order to spot trends in economic activity, economic confidence levels, and consumer attitudes. They assess this information using advanced methods in statistical analysis, mathematics, computer programming [and] they make recommendations about ways to improve the efficiency of a system or take advantage of trends as they begin." [ 4 ] In addition to government and academia, economists are also employed in banking , finance , accountancy , commerce , marketing , business administration , lobbying and non- or not-for profit organizations.

[ 5 ] In many organizations, an " Economic Analyst " is a formalized role.

[ 6 ] Professionals here are employed (or engaged as consultants [ 7 ] ) to conduct research, prepare reports, or formulate plans and strategies to address economic problems. Here, as outlined, the analyst provides forecasts, analysis and advice, based upon observed trends and economic principles; this entails also collecting and processing economic and statistical data using econometric methods and statistical techniques.

Economic analysts employed in financial institutions [ 8 ] and in other large corporates, [ 9 ] provide the (long term) economic forecasts used within their organizations. Relatedly, they consult to fund managers, risk managers, and corporate analysts re their investment strategy / capital budgeting decisions. Particularly in the tech sector , [ 10 ] the focus may be microeconomic, addressing pricing, competition, and customer behavior. Re. either perspective, ( chief ) economists are also often included [ 11 ] in strategy formulation . (Well know chief economists are Mohamed El-Erian , Hal Varian and Spencer Dale .) In the public sector , [ 12 ] analysts advise legislators and executives on economic policy, public works, and related; politicians often consult economists before enacting economic policy ; and many statesmen have academic degrees in economics. A Federal Government Economic Analyst [ 13 ] conducts economic analysis of issues directly related to the function of their federal government agency .

In contrast to regulated professions such as engineering, law or medicine, there is not a legally required educational requirement or license for economists. In academia, most economists have a Ph.D. degree in Economics .

[ 3 ] In the U.S. Government, on the other hand, a person can be hired as an economist provided that they have a degree that included or was supplemented by 21 semester hours in economics and three hours in statistics, accounting, or calculus.

[ 14 ] In fact, a professional working inside of one of many fields of economics or having an academic degree in this subject is often considered to be an economist; [ 1 ] see Bachelor of Economics and Master of Economics .

By country [ edit ] Economics graduates are employable in varying degrees depending on the regional economic scenario and labour market conditions at the time for a given country. Apart from the specific understanding of the subject, employers value the skills of numeracy and analysis, the ability to communicate and the capacity to grasp broad issues which the graduates acquire at the university or college . Whilst only a few [ quantify ] economics graduates may be expected to become professional economists, [ citation needed ] many find it a base for entry into a career in finance – including accounting, insurance, tax and banking, or management .

[ citation needed ] A number of economics graduates from around the world have been successful in obtaining employment in a variety of major national and international firms in the financial and commercial sectors, and in manufacturing, retailing and IT, as well as in the public sector – for example, in the health and education sectors, or in government and politics . Some graduates go on to undertake postgraduate studies , either in economics, research, teacher training or further qualifications in specialist areas.

Brazil [ edit ] Unlike most nations, the economist profession in Brazil is regulated by law; specifically, Law No. 1,411, of August 13, 1951. The professional designation of an economist, according to said law, is exclusive to those who graduated with a Bachelor of Economics degree in Brazil.

[ 15 ] United States [ edit ] Economist salaries by educational attainment [ 16 ] According to the United States Department of Labor , there were about 15,000 non-academic economists in the United States in 2008, with a median salary of roughly $83,000, and the top ten percent earning more than $147,040 annually.

[ 17 ] Nearly 135 colleges and universities [ 18 ] [ verification needed ] grant around 900 new Ph.D.s every year. Incomes are highest for those in the private sector, followed by the federal government, with academia paying the lowest incomes. As of January 2013, PayScale.com showed Ph.D. economists' salary ranges as follows: all Ph.D. economists, $61,000 to $160,000; Ph.D. corporate economists, $71,000 to $207,000; economics full professors, $89,000 to $137,000; economics associate professors, $59,000 to $156,000, and economics assistant professors, $72,000 to $100,000.

[ 16 ] United Kingdom [ edit ] The largest single professional grouping of economists in the UK are the more than 3500 members of the Government Economic Service .

[ 19 ] Analysis of destination surveys for economics graduates from a number of selected top schools of economics in the United Kingdom (ranging from Newcastle University to the London School of Economics ), shows nearly 80 percent in employment six months after graduation – with a wide range of roles and employers, including regional, national and international organisations, across many sectors.
