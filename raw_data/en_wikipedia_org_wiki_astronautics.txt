[Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope "Hubble Space Telescope") over Earth (during the [STS-109](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-109 "STS-109") mission)

**Astronautics** (or **cosmonautics**) is the practice of sending [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") beyond [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth") into [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"). [Spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight") is one of its main applications and [space science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_science "Space science") is its overarching field.

The term _astronautics_ (originally _astronautique_ in [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language")) was coined in the 1920s by [J.-H. Rosny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.-H._Rosny_a%C3%AEn%C3%A9 "J.-H. Rosny aîné"), president of the [Goncourt academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Goncourt "Académie Goncourt"), in analogy with [aeronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautics "Aeronautics").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics#cite_note-1) Because there is a degree of technical overlap between the two fields, the term [aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace "Aerospace") is often used to describe both at once. In 1930, [Robert Esnault-Pelterie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Esnault-Pelterie "Robert Esnault-Pelterie") published the first book on the new research field.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics#cite_note-2)

The term _cosmonautics_ (originally _cosmonautique_ in French) was introduced in the 1930s by [Ary Sternfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ary_Abramovich_Sternfeld "Ary Abramovich Sternfeld") with his book _Initiation à la Cosmonautique_ (Introduction to cosmonautics)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics#cite_note-3) (the book brought him the [Prix REP-Hirsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Esnault-Pelterie#Prix_REP-Hirsch "Robert Esnault-Pelterie"), later known as the Prix d'Astronautique, of the [French Astronomical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_astronomique_de_France "Société astronomique de France") in 1934.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics#cite_note-4))

As with aeronautics, the restrictions of mass, temperatures, and external forces require that applications in space survive extreme conditions: high-grade [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"), the [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation") bombardment of [interplanetary space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_space "Interplanetary space") and the [magnetic belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_belts "Van Allen belts") of [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit"). [Space launch vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle "Launch vehicle") must withstand titanic forces, while [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellites "Satellites") can experience huge variations in temperature in very brief periods.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics#cite_note-Sellers-5) Extreme constraints on mass cause astronautical engineers to face the constant need to save mass in the design in order to maximize the actual [payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(air_and_space_craft) "Payload (air and space craft)") that reaches [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit").

The early history of astronautics is theoretical: the fundamental mathematics of space travel was established by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") in his 1687 treatise _[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics#cite_note-BMW-6) Other mathematicians, such as Swiss [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") and Franco-Italian [Joseph Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Lagrange "Joseph Louis Lagrange") also made essential contributions in the 18th and 19th centuries. In spite of this, astronautics did not become a [practical discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_discipline "Practical discipline") until the mid-20th century. On the other hand, the question of [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight") puzzled the literary imaginations of such figures as [Jules Verne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne "Jules Verne") and [H. G. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells "H. G. Wells"). At the beginning of the 20th century, [Russian cosmist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cosmism "Russian cosmism")[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky "Konstantin Tsiolkovsky") derived the [rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_equation "Rocket equation"), the governing [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") for a [rocket-based propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket"), enabling computation of the final velocity of a rocket from the mass of spacecraft (![Image 2: {\displaystyle m_{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31aafa60e48d39ccce922404c0b80340b2cc777a)), combined mass of propellant and spacecraft (![Image 3: {\displaystyle m_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a6ff51ee949104fe6fae553cfbdfba29d5fac1e)) and exhaust velocity of the propellant (![Image 4: {\displaystyle v_{e}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3271a14c35fc1b6cb549d4d462e8d3255185cc9d)).

By the early 1920s, [Robert H. Goddard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Goddard "Robert H. Goddard") was developing [liquid-propellant rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-propellant_rocket "Liquid-propellant rocket"), which would in a few brief decades become a critical component in the designs of such famous rockets as the [V-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2_rocket "V-2 rocket") and [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V "Saturn V").

The [Prix d'Astronautique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Esnault-Pelterie#Prix_REP-Hirsch "Robert Esnault-Pelterie") (Astronautics Prize) awarded by the [Société astronomique de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_astronomique_de_France "Société astronomique de France"), the French astronomical society, was the first prize on this subject. The international award, established by aviation and astronautical pioneer [Robert Esnault-Pelterie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Esnault-Pelterie "Robert Esnault-Pelterie") and André-Louis Hirsch, was given from 1929 to 1939 in recognition of the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics.

By the mid-1950s, the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race") between the USSR and the US had begun.

Although many regard astronautics itself as a rather specialized subject, engineers and scientists working in this area must be knowledgeable in many distinct fields.

*   [Astrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodynamics "Astrodynamics") – the study of orbital motion. Those specializing in this field examine topics such as spacecraft trajectories, ballistics and celestial mechanics.
*   [Spacecraft propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion "Spacecraft propulsion") – how spacecraft change orbits, and how they are launched. Most spacecraft have some variety of [rocket engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine "Rocket engine"), and thus most research efforts focus on some variety of [rocket propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket"), such as chemical, nuclear or electric.
*   [Spacecraft design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_design "Spacecraft design") – a specialized form of [systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering "Systems engineering") that centers on combining all the necessary subsystems for a particular [launch vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle "Launch vehicle") or [satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite").
*   [Controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_engineering "Control engineering") – keeping a satellite or rocket in its desired orbit (as in spacecraft navigation) and orientation (as in [attitude control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_attitude_control "Spacecraft attitude control")).
*   [Space environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment "Space environment") – although more a sub-discipline of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") rather than astronautics, the effects of [space weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather "Space weather") and other environmental issues constitute an increasingly important field of study for spacecraft designers.
*   [Bioastronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioastronautics "Bioastronautics")

*   [Aeronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautics "Aeronautics") and [aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace "Aerospace")
