The most common article-level citation metric is the number of citations.

[ 1 ] Field-weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) by Scopus divides the total citations by the average number of citations for an article in the scientific field .

[ 2 ] Alternative article-level metrics include the CD index, a measure of the disruptiveness of an article.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Adoption [ edit ] Traditionally, bibliometrics have been used to evaluate the usage and impact of research, but have usually been focused on journal-level metrics such as the impact factor or researcher-level metrics such as the h-index .

[ 5 ] Article-level metrics, on the other hand, may demonstrate the impact of an individual article. This is related to, but distinct from, altmetrics .

[ 6 ] Starting in March 2009, the Public Library of Science introduced article-level metrics for all articles.

[ 7 ] The open access publisher PLOS provides article level metrics for all of its journals [ 8 ] including downloads, citations, and altmetrics.

[ 9 ] In March 2014 it was announced that COUNTER statistics, which measure usage of online scholarly resources, are now available at the article level.
