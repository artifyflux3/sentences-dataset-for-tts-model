New Model Army, 2023

**New Model Army** are an English [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music "Rock music") band formed in [Bradford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford "Bradford"), [West Yorkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Yorkshire "West Yorkshire"), in 1980 by lead vocalist, guitarist and principal songwriter [Justin Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Sullivan "Justin Sullivan"), bassist Stuart Morrow and drummer Phil Tompkins. Sullivan has been the only continuous member of the band, which has seen numerous line-up changes in its four-decade history. Their music draws on influences across the musical spectrum, from [punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock "Punk rock") and [folk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music "Folk music") to [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music "Soul music"), [metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_music "Metal music") and [classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music "Classical music"). Sullivan's lyrics, which range from directly political through to spiritual and personal, have always been considered as a key part of the band's appeal.

Whilst having their roots in punk rock, the band have always been difficult to categorise. In 1999, when asked about this, Sullivan said, "We've been labelled as punks, [post-punks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk "Post-punk"), [Goth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_rock "Gothic rock"), metal, folk – the lot, but we've always been beyond those style confines".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-CYBE-2) Following a large turnover of personnel, both permanent and as touring members, as of 2024 New Model Army comprise Sullivan, Dean White (keyboards and guitar), Michael Dean (drums) and Ceri Monger (bass).

### Formation and _Vengeance_ (1980–1984)

The band were formed in [Bradford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford "Bradford"), [West Yorkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Yorkshire "West Yorkshire") in the autumn of 1980, taking their name from [the standing army formed in 1645 by the Parliamentarians during the First English Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army "New Model Army"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-ROBH-3) and played their first concert in Bradford in October of that year, playing songs based on their shared love of punk rock and [Northern soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_soul "Northern soul").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAB-4)

After a few months in the band, original drummer Phil Tompkins lost interest and quit, to be replaced by Rob Waddington. By the time they began making their first records in 1983, [Robert Heaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Heaton "Robert Heaton"), a former drum technician for [space rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rock "Space rock") band [Hawkwind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkwind "Hawkwind"), had replaced Waddington.

Until the mid-1980s, Sullivan used the alter ego of "Slade the Leveller" ([Levellers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levellers "Levellers") being a radical political movement of the 1640s), supposedly so that he would not lose his [unemployment benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits "Unemployment benefits") if the authorities realized he was making money from music.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAS-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-TROC-6) They continued to gig around the United Kingdom with little recognition, but in 1983 released their first singles "Bittersweet" and "Great Expectations" on Abstract Records, and were given airplay by [BBC Radio 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_1 "BBC Radio 1")'s disc jockey (DJ) and radio presenter [John Peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel "John Peel").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAB-4)

In February 1984, they were invited to play on popular music television programme _[The Tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Tube\_(1982\_TV\_series) "The Tube (1982 TV series)")_, being introduced by Scottish host [Muriel Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muriel_Gray "Muriel Gray") as "the ugliest band in [rock and roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll "Rock and roll")".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-TROC-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-DREC-7) The producers of the show however were concerned about the lyrics of "Vengeance", which the band were due to perform ("I believe in justice / I believe in vengeance / I believe in getting the bastards") and so the band played "Christian Militia" instead.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAB-4)

Following this performance, the band's debut studio album _[Vengeance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vengeance\_(New\_Model\_Army\_album) "Vengeance (New Model Army album)")_ reached Number 1 in the UK independent chart in early 1984, pushing [the Smiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiths "The Smiths") from that position.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-ROBH-3) After a further single "The Price" also reached a high placing in the independent charts, the band signed a [recording contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_contract "Recording contract") with major label [EMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI_Records "EMI Records").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-MTV-8)

### The major label years (1985–1993)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Model_Army_(band)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: The major label years (1985–1993)")]

The band then made four studio albums (plus a live album) for EMI and one studio album for [Epic Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records "Epic Records"), in a period of eight years.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-DISC-9) 1985's _[No Rest for the Wicked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\_Rest\_for\_the\_Wicked\_(New\_Model\_Army\_album) "No Rest for the Wicked (New Model Army album)")_ and associated single "No Rest" both made the mainstream top 30 in the UK,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-OFCH-10) the latter leading to some controversy when the band sported T-shirts with the phrase "Only Stupid Bastards Use [Heroin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin "Heroin")" during an appearance on _[Top of the Pops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top\_of\_the\_Pops "Top of the Pops")_.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-BDAW-11) During the "No Rest" tour, bassist Stuart Morrow left the band, and was replaced by 17-year-old [Jason "Moose" Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose_Harris "Moose Harris").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAB-4) However the band were refused work permits to enter the United States, as the US Immigration Department had said the band's work was of "no artistic merit".[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-LAT-12)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/New_Model_Army_2006-02-01_03.jpg/250px-New_Model_Army_2006-02-01_03.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:New_Model_Army_2006-02-01_03.jpg)

Nelson, bassist from 1990 to 2011

In December 1986, the band finally got permission to tour in the US.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMER-13) By this time _[The Ghost of Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Ghost\_of\_Cain "The Ghost of Cain")_, produced by [Glyn Johns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyn_Johns "Glyn Johns"), had been released, and was named best album of the year for 1986 in _[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Times "The Times")_ by David Sinclair, who said that it "was the best thing to happen to English rock music since the first [Clash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash "The Clash") album".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAS-5) Concerts included the [Reading Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Festival "Reading Festival") and a gig with [David Bowie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie "David Bowie") in front of the [Reichstag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_(building) "Reichstag (building)") in Berlin,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-14) and the band for the first time expanded their touring line-up to include a second guitarist in the shape of [Ricky Warwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Warwick "Ricky Warwick"), as well as harmonica player [Mark Feltham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Feltham_(musician) "Mark Feltham (musician)") from [blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues "Blues") band [Nine Below Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Below_Zero "Nine Below Zero").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAB-4)

_[Thunder and Consolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder\_and\_Consolation "Thunder and Consolation")_ was released in February 1989, and saw the band moving towards a more folk rock sound, especially on the tracks including violinist [Ed Alleyne-Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Alleyne-Johnson "Ed Alleyne-Johnson").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-MTV1-15) Described as the band's "landmark" album,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-16) it reached number 20 in the UK charts, the singles "Stupid Questions" and "Vagabonds" making an impression in America,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-17) and the band was able to tour the album there with Alleyne-Johnson also providing additional guitar and keyboards. At the end of the year however, Harris left the band, to be replaced by Peter "Nelson" Nice, who would play with the band for more than 20 years.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-MTV1-15) 1990's _[Impurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impurity\_(New\_Model\_Army\_album) "Impurity (New Model Army album)")_ continued the folk-driven theme with Alleyne-Johnson still to the fore[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-ROBH-3) and [Adrian Portas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Portas "Adrian Portas") joining the band on guitar.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-MTV1-15)

The next studio album was to be a musical change of direction; as Sullivan later said, "just as this folk-cum-[rave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave "Rave")-cum-[crusty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock "Indie rock")-cum-[new-age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New-age_music "New-age music") thing broke and became big in the early 1990s, we went – whoosh – done that – and went and made a very angry [hard rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock "Hard rock") album".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAS-5)_[The Love of Hopeless Causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Love\_of\_Hopeless\_Causes "The Love of Hopeless Causes")_, New Model Army's only release on [Epic Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records "Epic Records"), appeared in 1993 and led with the single "Here Comes the War", which spawned controversy when it came packaged with instructions on how to construct a [nuclear weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-18)

### Hiatus and return to independence (1994–2000)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Model_Army_(band)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Hiatus and return to independence (1994–2000)")]

The band had previously decided to take a year out to concentrate on personal and other musical issues, and reconvened in late 1994 with Dean White, playing keyboards and guitar, replacing Alleyne-Johnson.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-MTV1-15) It became clear that all was not well between Sullivan and Heaton; Sullivan later said, "We wrote _Thunder and Consolation_ and it was brilliant, but very shortly after that, we started falling out, which went on during the making of that album. His life went in one direction and mine went in another".[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-3AMM-19) It was agreed that they would go their separate ways after the forthcoming studio album and tour.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAB-4)_[Strange Brotherhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange\_Brotherhood "Strange Brotherhood")_ was released on 13 April 1998 to mixed reviews,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-20) but then Heaton was diagnosed with a [brain tumour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor "Brain tumor"). He suggested that his drum technician Michael Dean take over from him to tour the album.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-3AMM-19) By this time the band had formed their own independent label, Attack Attack,[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-21) and former tour manager Tommy Tee had returned to manage the band.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAS-5) A live album _[...& Nobody Else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...%26\_Nobody\_Else "...& Nobody Else")_ followed in 1999, and their eighth studio album _[Eight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight\_(New\_Model\_Army\_album) "Eight (New Model Army album)")_ in 2000.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-DISC-9)

### Death of Robert Heaton, and _Carnival_ to _Today is a Good Day_ (2001–2009)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Model_Army_(band)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Death of Robert Heaton, and Carnival to Today is a Good Day (2001–2009)")]

Marshall Gill, guitarist from 2005 to 2021

After touring _Eight_ (2000), the band again took time out, most notably so that Sullivan could concentrate on his debut solo studio album _Navigating by the Stars_ which was eventually released in 2003,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-TGRB-22) and toured by Sullivan, Dean and White.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAB-4) As the band got together to record their ninth studio album, Robert Heaton died from [pancreatic cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer "Pancreatic cancer") on 4 November 2004.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-ROBH-3)_[Carnival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival\_(New\_Model\_Army\_album) "Carnival (New Model Army album)")_ was finally released in September 2005, and includes Sullivan's reaction to Heaton's death, "Fireworks Night".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAB-4)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-23) Dave Blomberg was unable to take part in touring the album, and was replaced by guitarist Marshall Gill.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-24)

The band's tenth studio album, _[High](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High\_(New\_Model\_Army\_album) "High (New Model Army album)")_, was produced relatively quickly and was released in August 2007. The tour suffered a slight setback when the [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Citizenship_and_Immigration_Services "United States Citizenship and Immigration Services") again denied the band visas; this time the issue was relatively quickly resolved[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-25) and the dates rescheduled for early 2008. Soon afterwards, the band was again shaken as manager Tommy Tee died unexpectedly at the age of 46.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-BIGT-26) By 2009, though, the band were again back in the studio. _[Today Is a Good Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today\_Is\_a\_Good\_Day "Today Is a Good Day")_ was a far more uncompromising album, the heavy rock title track and others directly referencing the [stock market crash of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_crash#Crash_of_2008.E2.80.932009 "Stock market crash").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-INTQ-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-28)

Towards the end of 2010, the band's 30th anniversary was celebrated with special shows across four continents every weekend from September until early December; in most cities, the shows were across two nights with completely different sets,[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-29) the band having promised to play at least four songs from each of their eleven studio albums plus _[Lost Songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost\_Songs\_(New\_Model\_Army\_album) "Lost Songs (New Model Army album)")_ (2002) and _[B-Sides and Abandoned Tracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-Sides\_and\_Abandoned\_Tracks "B-Sides and Abandoned Tracks")_ (1994), their rarities and B-sides collections.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-31) The final shows at the [Forum Kentish Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O2_Forum_Kentish_Town "O2 Forum Kentish Town") in London were collected on a double CD and DVD release containing all 58 songs played over the nights of 3 and 4 December.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-32)

After the band had played their traditional [Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas "Christmas") shows the following year, the news was released that Nelson had decided to leave the band for personal reasons, a decision that had been taken some time before.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAB-4)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-33) A few days later, on [Christmas Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Eve "Christmas Eve"), a fire destroyed the band's recording studio and rehearsal space in Bradford. Numerous guitars and other instruments were lost along with recording equipment and memorabilia.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-34) However, the studio was back in operation within three months, and after a number of auditions, Ceri Monger was announced as the band's new bassist and multi-instrumentalist.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-35)

In 2013, the band's twelfth studio album, _[Between Dog and Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between\_Dog\_and\_Wolf "Between Dog and Wolf")_, mixed by [Joe Barresi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Barresi "Joe Barresi"), was released and became the band's most successful since _The Love of Hopeless Causes_ (1993) 20 years earlier.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-OFCH-10) The album showed a marked shift away from the band's traditional sounds,[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-36) including rhythms that were described as "tribal", though Sullivan claimed they were merely different ways of using drums – "We really like complex [tom-tom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom-tom_drum "Tom-tom drum") rhythms, we really like that pounding (beat)".[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-INTQ-27) A year later, _[Between Wine and Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between\_Wine\_and\_Blood "Between Wine and Blood")_ (2014) was released, including six previously unreleased studio tracks from the _Between Dog and Wolf_ (2013) sessions, along with eleven live tracks from that album.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-37) In October 2014, a documentary feature film about the band's career, _Between Dog and Wolf: The New Model Army Story_ by director Matt Reid premiered at the [Raindance Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raindance_Film_Festival "Raindance Film Festival") in London and the [Festival du nouveau cinéma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_du_nouveau_cin%C3%A9ma "Festival du nouveau cinéma") in [Montreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal "Montreal").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-38) The band's fourteenth studio album, _[Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter\_(New\_Model\_Army\_album) "Winter (New Model Army album)")_, was released on 26 August 2016.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-WIN1-39)_Winter_ was named the #1 album of 2016 by [The Big Takeover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Takeover "The Big Takeover").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-40)

On 23 August 2019, the band's fifteenth studio album, _[From Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From\_Here "From Here")_, was released.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-41) The band had intended to play a number of shows for their 40th anniversary in 2020, but these were cancelled due to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"). They did however play an online show on 23 October to mark the exact 40th anniversary of their first show.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-42)

They finally played the 40th anniversary shows towards the end of 2021, although guitarist Marshall Gill was absent for these and the early 2022 shows, the band reverting to a four-piece line-up with Dean White predominantly playing guitar as well as keyboards.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-43) On 11 November 2022, Gill indicated in a [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook "Facebook") post that he had been dropped from the band for refusing a [COVID-19 vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine "COVID-19 vaccine"); at the end of 2021 performers still required proof of vaccination to play in a number of countries that the band were visiting.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-44)

### _Unbroken_ (2023–present)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Model_Army_(band)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Unbroken (2023–present)")]

The band released a live album, _[Sinfonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinfonia\_(New\_Model\_Army\_album) "Sinfonia (New Model Army album)")_ in September 2023; it was recorded with the Sinfonia Leipzig Orchestra at the Tempodrom venue in Berlin on 15 July 2022.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-LTW-45) The band's sixteenth studio album, _Unbroken_, was recorded in 2023 and released on 26 January 2024.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-46) The band toured the album in early 2024, with Nguyen Green on keyboards enabling Dean White to play guitar on those songs requiring two instruments.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-47) A tour later in the year was postponed until 2025 due to medical issues with drummer Michael Dean.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-48) In May 2025, the band will play their first ever tour of Australia.,[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-49) though some shows were curtailed due to poor tickets sales. The Perth show for example, was reduced to a cut down show featuring Justin and Dean instead of the full band.

### Timeline of major contributors

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Model_Army_(band)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Timeline of major contributors")]

This is a list of musicians who were (or currently have been) a permanent – not touring – member of the band for a significant amount of time.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAB-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAS-5)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-MTV1-15)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-TGRB-22)

Over the years, New Model Army have gathered a wide selection of fans, many of whom dedicatedly follow the band. Originally calling themselves "The Militia", after the song "Christian Militia",[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-NMAS-5) they later universally adopted the term "The Family" for their multi-generational and gendered group.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-50)[Joolz Denby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joolz_Denby "Joolz Denby"), long-time collaborator of Sullivan[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-51) and the band's main artist[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-52) has referred to the Family as "not a formal, contrived organisation, but a spontaneous sense of fellowship that has developed over the years",[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-DENB-53) whilst elsewhere it has been described as "sanctuary ... and acceptance".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-CYBE-2)

Frequently noted for their musical lyricism, Justin Sullivan has noted in interviews that some of the band's (and his own) lyrical inspiration has come from [Tom Waits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits "Tom Waits"), [Bruce Springsteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen "Bruce Springsteen"), [Gillian Welch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Welch "Gillian Welch"), [Joni Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Mitchell "Joni Mitchell"), and [Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan"), as well as "lots of [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music") and [hip-hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music "Hip hop music") artists, all for their precision and poetry."[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Model_Army_(band)#cite_note-54)
