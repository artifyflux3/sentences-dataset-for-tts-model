Statistical manifolds provide a setting for the field of information geometry .  The Fisher information metric provides a metric on these manifolds. Following this definition, the log-likelihood function is a differentiable map and the score is an inclusion .

[ 1 ] Examples [ edit ] The family of all normal distributions can be thought of as a 2-dimensional parametric space parametrized by the expected value μ and the variance σ 2 ≥ 0. Equipped with the Riemannian metric given by the Fisher information matrix, it is a statistical manifold with a geometry modeled on hyperbolic space . A way of picturing the manifold is done by inferring the parametric equations via the Fisher Information rather than starting from the likelihood-function.

A simple example of a statistical manifold, taken from physics, would be the canonical ensemble : it is a one-dimensional manifold, with the temperature T serving as the coordinate on the manifold.  For any fixed temperature T , one has a probability space: so, for a gas of atoms, it would be the probability distribution of the velocities of the atoms.  As one varies the temperature T , the probability distribution varies.

Another simple example, taken from medicine, would be the probability distribution of patient outcomes, in response to the quantity of medicine administered.  That is, for a fixed dose, some patients improve, and some do not: this is the base probability space. If the dosage is varied, then the probability of outcomes changes.  Thus, the dosage is the coordinate on the manifold.   To be a smooth manifold , one would have to measure outcomes in response to arbitrarily small changes in dosage; this is not a practically realizable example, unless one has a pre-existing mathematical model of dose-response where the dose can be arbitrarily varied.

Definition [ edit ] Let X be an orientable manifold , and let ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} be a measure on X . Equivalently, let ( Ω Ω , F , P ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},P)} be a probability space on Ω Ω = X {\displaystyle \Omega =X} , with sigma algebra F = Σ Σ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}=\Sigma } and probability P = μ μ {\displaystyle P=\mu } .

The statistical manifold S ( X ) of X is defined as the space of all measures μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on X (with the sigma-algebra Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } held fixed).  Note that this space is infinite-dimensional; it is commonly taken to be a Fréchet space .  The points of S ( X ) are measures.

Rather than dealing with an infinite-dimensional space S ( X ), it is common to work with a finite-dimensional submanifold , defined by considering a set of probability distributions parameterized by some smooth, continuously varying parameter θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } . That is, one considers only those measures that are selected by the parameter. If the parameter θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } is n -dimensional, then, in general, the submanifold will be as well.  All finite-dimensional statistical manifolds can be understood in this way.
