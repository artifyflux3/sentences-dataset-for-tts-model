Pringle [ 8 ] Nick Kaiser [ 9 ] Martin Rees' voice Recorded June 2010 from the BBC Radio 4 programme the Reith Lectures Martin John Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow , (born 23 June 1942) is a British cosmologist and astrophysicist .

[ 10 ] He was the fifteenth Astronomer Royal from 1995 to 2025, [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] and was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge , from 2004 to 2012 and President of the Royal Society between 2005 and 2010.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] He has received various physics awards including the Wolf Prize in Physics in 2024 for fundamental contributions to high-energy astrophysics, galaxies and structure formation, and cosmology.

Early life and education [ edit ] Rees was born on 23 June 1942 in York , England.

[ 1 ] [ 16 ] After a peripatetic life during the war his parents, both teachers, settled with Rees, an only child, in a rural part of Shropshire near the border with Wales. There, his parents founded Bedstone College , a boarding school based on progressive educational concepts.

[ 17 ] He was educated at Bedstone College, then from the age of 13 at Shrewsbury School . He studied for the mathematical tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge , [ 1 ] graduating with first class honours . He then undertook post-graduate research at Cambridge and completed a PhD supervised by Dennis Sciama in 1967.

[ 3 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Rees' post-graduate work in astrophysics in the mid-1960s coincided with an explosion of new discoveries, with breakthroughs ranging from confirmation of the Big Bang , the discovery of neutron stars and black holes , and a host of other revelations.

[ 17 ] Career [ edit ] After holding postdoctoral research positions in the United Kingdom and the United States, he was a professor at Sussex University , during 1972–1973. He later moved to Cambridge , where he was the Plumian Professor at the University of Cambridge until 1991, and the director of the Institute of Astronomy .

He was professor of astronomy at Gresham College , London, in 1975 and became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1979. From 1992 to 2003, he was Royal Society Research Professor, and from 2003 Professor of Cosmology and Astrophysics . He was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, during 2004–2012. He is an Honorary Fellow of Darwin College , [ 20 ] King's College , [ 21 ] Clare Hall , [ 22 ] Robinson College and Jesus College, Cambridge .

[ 23 ] Rees is a member of the Board of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and the Oxford Martin School . He co-founded the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk [ 24 ] and serves on the Scientific Advisory Board for the Future of Life Institute .

[ 25 ] He has formerly been a Trustee of the British Museum , the Science Museum , the Gates Cambridge Trust and the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) .

His doctoral students have included Roger Blandford , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Craig Hogan , [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Nick Kaiser [ 26 ] Priyamvada Natarajan , [ 7 ] and James E. Pringle .

Research [ edit ] Rees is the author of more than 500 research papers.

[ 27 ] He is an author of books on astronomy and science intended for the lay public and gives many public lectures and broadcasts. In 2010 he was invited to deliver the Reith Lectures for the BBC , [ 28 ] now published as From Here to Infinity: Scientific Horizons .

Rees has made contributions to the origin of cosmic microwave background radiation , as well as to galaxy clustering and formation. His studies of the distribution of quasars challenged the now-rejected steady state theory .

[ 29 ] He was one of the first to propose that enormous black holes power quasars, [ 30 ] and that superluminal astronomical observations can be explained as an optical illusion caused by an object moving partly in the direction of the observer.

[ 31 ] Since the 1990s, Rees has worked on gamma-ray bursts , especially in collaboration with Péter Mészáros , [ 32 ] and on how the "cosmic dark ages" ended when the first stars formed. Since the 1970s he has been interested in anthropic reasoning, and the possibility that our visible universe is part of a vaster " multiverse ".

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] Public engagement [ edit ] In addition to expansion of his scientific interests, Rees has written and spoken extensively about the problems and challenges of the 21st century, and interfaces between science, ethics, and politics.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] In his books Our Final Hour and On the Future , Rees warns that humanity faces significant existential risks in the 21st century due to technological advancements, particularly in bioengineering and artificial intelligence . He estimated a 50% chance of human extinction during the 21st century, but remains optimistic that if the risks are successfully managed, technology could drastically improve standards of living.

[ 39 ] In 2007, he delivered the Gifford Lectures on 21st Century Science: Cosmic Perspective and Terrestrial Challenges at the University of St Andrews .

[ 40 ] He made two TED talks on existential risks.

[ 41 ] Rees thinks the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is worthwhile and has chaired the advisory board for the " Breakthrough Listen " project, a programme of SETI investigations funded by the Russian/US investor Yuri Milner .

[ 42 ] In August 2014, Rees was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue .

[ 43 ] To mark the 300th anniversary of the Board of Longitude in 2014, he instigated a programme of new challenge prizes of £5-10m under the name " Longitude Prize 2014" for which he chairs the advisory board. The themes of the first two prizes are the reduction of inappropriate antibiotic use, and enhancing the safety and independence of dementia sufferers. The Longitude Prize on Dementia was announced in 2022.

[ 44 ] In 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the Global Apollo Programme , which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund coordinated research to make carbon-free baseload electricity less costly than electricity from coal by the year 2025.

[ 45 ] In his general writings and in the House of Lords , his focus has been on the uses and abuses of advanced technology and on issues such as assisted dying , preservation of dark skies, and reforms to broaden the post-16 and undergraduate curricula in the UK.

[ 46 ] He is also a current member of the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee.
