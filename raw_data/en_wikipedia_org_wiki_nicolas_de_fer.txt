He also was an engraver and publisher . His works focused more on quantity than quality, there were often geographical errors, [ 1 ] and they were more artistic than accurate.

[ 2 ] Early life [ edit ] De Fer was the youngest of three sons of Antoine de Fer, who was also a cartographer.

[ 3 ] When he was 12, he became the apprentice of Parisian engraver Louis Spirinx, and made his first map, of the Canal du Midi , at the age of 23.

[ 4 ] After the death of his father in June 1673, his mother Geneviève initially took over the map making company, which had begun to decline.

[ 5 ] She passed it and the atelier , called Quai de L'Horloge, on to Nicolas in 1687 because of her old age.

[ 5 ] Carte De La Nouvelle France , 1719 Map of the States of Sweden, Denmark, and Poland; on the Baltic Sea, 1700 Career [ edit ] La Sphère Royale De Fer was so successful at improving the firm that, in 1690, he became the official geographer to Louis , Dauphin of France .

[ 6 ] With support from the Spanish and French royal families, de Fer also became official geographer for Philip V and Louis XIV , the kings of Spain and France, respectively.

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] Because of this, his maps became Bourbon propaganda , endorsing French King Louis XIV .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] His business flourished, producing town plans, atlases , wall maps, and more than 600 sheet maps.

[ 3 ] He made maps of places in Europe and North America, including New Spain , [ 7 ] places fortified by Vauban , [ 8 ] the Low Countries , and the War of the Spanish Succession . In 1698, de Fer published a map of North America, which included a depiction of beavers building dams near Niagara Falls . Seventeen years later, Herman Moll published a map which plagiarized elements of de Fer's work, particularly the beaver scene. It became known as the "Beaver map".

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] De Fer became the official geographer for The King of Spain in 1720.

[ 6 ] Two of his sons-in-law, Guillaume Danet and Jaques-François Bénard, continued the company after de Fer's death on 25 October of that year until around 1760.
