[ 1 ] Early life [ edit ] Merzbach was born in Berlin , where her mother was a philologist and her father was an economist who worked for the Reich Association of Jews in Germany during World War II. The Nazi government closed the association in June 1943; they arrested the family, along with other leading members of the association, and sent them to the Theresienstadt concentration camp on August 4, 1943.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The Merzbachs survived the war and the camp, and after living for a year in a refugee camp in Deggendorf they moved to Georgetown, Texas in 1946, where her father found a faculty position at Southwestern University .

Education [ edit ] After high school in Brownwood, Texas , Merzbach entered Southwestern, but transferred after two years to the University of Texas at Austin , where she graduated in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. In 1954, she earned a master's degree there, also in mathematics.

[ 1 ] Merzbach became a school teacher, but soon returned to graduate study at Harvard University .

[ 1 ] She completed her Ph.D. at Harvard in 1965. Her dissertation, Quantity of Structure: Development of Modern Algebraic Concepts from Leibniz to Dedekind , combined mathematics and the history of science; it was jointly supervised by mathematician Garrett Birkhoff and historian of science I. Bernard Cohen .

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Career [ edit ] Merzbach joined the Smithsonian as an associate curator in 1964 (later curator), and served there until 1988 in the National Museum of American History . As well as collecting mathematical objects at the Smithsonian, she also collected interviews with many of the pioneers of computing.

[ 1 ] In 1991, she co-authored the second edition of A History of Mathematics , originally published in 1968 by Carl Benjamin Boyer .

[ 1 ] [ 5 ] After her retirement she returned to Georgetown, Texas, where she died in 2017.
