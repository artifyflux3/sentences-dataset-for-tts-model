This list does not include upper stages from robotic missions (only the S-IVB upper stages from Apollo missions with astronauts are listed), objects in the Sun–Earth Lagrange points or objects that are escaping from the Solar System .

United States [ edit ] The Federal government of the United States has placed in heliocentric orbit: Pioneer 4 – Moon (1959) Ranger 3 – Moon (1961) Ranger 5 – Moon (1963) Mariner 2 – Venus (1962) Mariner 3 – Intended for Mars , communication lost when launch shroud failed to separate (1964) Mariner 4 – Mars (1964–1967) Mariner 5 – Venus (1967) Pioneer 5 , Pioneer 6 , Pioneer 7 , Pioneer 8 , and Pioneer 9 – Sun (1966–1969) S-IVB for Apollo 8 (1968) S-IVB for Apollo 9 (1969) S-IVB and LM Snoopy (ascent stage) for Apollo 10 (1969) S-IVB for Apollo 11 (1969) Mariner 6 and Mariner 7 – Mars (1969) S-IVB for Apollo 12 (1969) – temporarily recaptured in Earth orbit 2002, escaped again 2003 ICE – Comets Giocabinni-Zinner and Halley (1974–1987) Mariner 10 – Venus and Mercury (1974–1975) Mars Observer (1992) – Intended for Mars, failed prior to orbital insertion (1993) Protective cover of Cassini CDA instrument (1997) [ 1 ] Stardust – Comet Wild 2 (1999–2006) Genesis – Solar wind sample mission (2001–2004) CONTOUR – Intended to flyby several comets, failed after launch (2002), seen as three separate fragments Spitzer Space Telescope (2003–2020) Deep Impact – Comet Tempel 1 STEREO-A and STEREO-B (2006–2016) Kepler Mission (2009–2018) TAGSAM head cover – jettisoned from OSIRIS-REx (2018) [ 2 ] MarCO-A and MarCO-B – CubeSat relays for InSight (2018–2019) Parker Solar Probe (2018–present) Lucy , various orbits between Earth gravity-assists and Jupiter's Trojans (2021–present) LICIACube ( ASI ) – CubeSat flyby of Didymos system (2021–2022) CubeSat for Solar Particles , intended to study Sun, but contact was lost in an hour (2022) Team Miles , intended to test technologies, but contact never established (2022) BioSentinel (2022–present) Near-Earth Asteroid Scout , was intended to conduct an asteroid flyby, but contact never established (2022) On Apollos 8 and 10–17, each S-IVB upper stage jettisoned four sections of a truncated conical adapter that supported the Apollo service module and (except for Apollo 8) enclosed the Apollo Lunar Module . These panels are in heliocentric orbit, including those from Apollos 13–17 whose S-IVBs impacted the Moon, as the S-IVBs jettisoned them before maneuvering themselves into lunar impact trajectories. The panels continued on lunar flyby trajectories into heliocentric orbit. (The adapter panels on Apollo 9 were jettisoned in Earth orbit before the S-IVB burned into an Earth escape trajectory. They eventually decayed.) U.S.-based commercial spaceflight companies have placed in heliocentric orbit: Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster with Falcon Heavy second stage (2018) Odin (Brokkr-2) ; flyby of 2022 OB5 , but failed due to communication and tumbling issues (2025) Soviet Union or Russian Federation [ edit ] The Soviet Union or the Russian Federation has placed in heliocentric orbit: Luna 1 – Intended to crash on Moon (1959) Venera 1 – Intended for Venus, communication lost en route (1961) Mars 1 – Intended for Mars, communication lost en route (1962) Zond 2 – Intended for Mars, communication lost en route (1964) Luna 6 – Intended to land on Moon, but missed (1965) Zond 3 – Moon (far side) and interplanetary space (1965) Venera 2 – Venus (1966) Mars 4 – Intended to orbit Mars, but retrorocket failed, mission partial success (1974) Mars 6 coast stage – Mars (1974) Mars 7 coast stage – Mars (1974) Mars 7 lander – Intended to land on Mars, but missed planet (1974) Venera 11 cruise stage – Venus (1978) [ citation needed ] Venera 12 cruise stage – Venus (1978) [ citation needed ] Venera 13 cruise stage – Venus (1982) Venera 14 cruise stage – Venus (1982) Vega 1 – Venus and Halley's Comet (1984–1986) [ citation needed ] Vega 2 – Venus and Halley's Comet (1984–1986) Phobos 1 – Intended for Mars and moon Phobos , communication lost en route (1988) European Space Agency (ESA) [ edit ] The European Space Agency has placed in heliocentric orbit: Helios 1 (joint U.S./Germany) – Sun (1975–1985), launched on a US Titan III Helios 2 (joint U.S./Germany) – Sun (1976–1979) Giotto mission – Halley's Comet (1985–1992) Ulysses (joint U.S./ESA) – Jupiter and Sun's north and south poles (1990–2009) Japan [ edit ] Japan has placed in heliocentric orbit: Sakigake – Halley's Comet (1985–1999) Suisei – Halley's Comet (1985–1991) Nozomi – Intended for Mars, but retrorocket failed (1998–2003) MINERVA mini-lander – Intended for asteroid Itokawa but missed (2005) IKAROS – Venus flyby [ 3 ] DCAM1 and DCAM2 – Ejected from IKAROS (2010) SHIN-EN – failed mission to Venus SHIN-EN 2 – amateur radio satellite ,  material demonstration (possibly active) [ 4 ] ARTSAT2:DESPATCH – Deep space artwork (2014) China [ edit ] China has placed in heliocentric orbit: Chang'e 2 – asteroid 4179 Toutatis flyby See also [ edit ] List of extraterrestrial orbiters List of artificial objects leaving the Solar System Human presence in space List of objects at Lagrange points References [ edit ] ^ "Lost in Space – A Part of Cassini is Still Out There" .
