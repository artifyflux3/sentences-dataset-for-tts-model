The term is principally used in countries where the political camp is divided into liberals (meaning social liberals ) on the left and conservatives on the right, rather than in countries whose political camps include social democrats on the left and their opponents on the right. For countries belonging to the former, moderate liberalism is sometimes contrasted with moderate conservatism .

[ 1 ] The latter term can be applied to several countries, such as the United States, Poland, [ 2 ] South Korea, [ 3 ] and Japan.

[ 4 ] Overview [ edit ] Moderate conservative is not often used in most parts of Europe, where social democracy or socialist parties have grown into major parties since the early 20th century, because moderate conservatives in many European countries are liberal conservatives or Christian democrats . Despite this, the term has historically been widely used in Europe, particularly in the mid-19th and earlier century, when liberal-to-radical politics, or classical radicalism , formed the mainstream left in Europe and conservatives were the right opposition. The moderate conservatives of this period were contrasted with the moderate liberals.

[ 5 ] It is also used as a contrast to ultra-conservatism .

[ 6 ] By country [ edit ] Canada [ edit ] The main factions of the Conservative Party of Canada are the Red Tory and Blue Tory . Blue Tories value free markets but vary on social policies, Red Tories are known to be more centrist.

Iran [ edit ] Moderate conservatism is mostly seen among Reformists : dissident media Iran International referred to Hassan Rouhani , the 7th President of Iran , as a "moderate conservative", [ 7 ] however, during his 2017 reelection campaign , Rouhani's views moved firmly to the left and he fully aligned with Reformists.

[ 8 ] Ali Larijani is part of Principlists , but is described as a relatively moderate conservative.

[ 9 ] Japan [ edit ] The Kōchikai was a faction that represented moderate conservatives within the right-wing Liberal Democratic Party . Former prime minister Fumio Kishida was a member of the Kōchikai faction, and he is also a "moderate conservative".

[ 4 ] Yomiuri Shimbun is a moderately conservative newspaper.

[ 10 ] Yomiuri Shimbun places more emphasis on moderate pro-American diplomacy rather than hawkish Japanese nationalism .

[ 11 ] Poland [ edit ] The Civic Platform has supported a moderate conservative agenda.

[ 2 ] The party is described in various ways in the Polish political context as centre-right , [ nb 1 ] or centrist .

[ nb 2 ] South Korea [ edit ] In the 20th century, liberal in South Korea had the opposite meaning of socialist or left-wing . Therefore, some historical liberals in South Korea were considered conservatives or moderate conservatives.

[ 12 ] Ahn Cheol-soo was considered centrist reformist or centrist liberal (sometimes centre-left) in the early and mid 2010s but is now classified as centre-right and moderate conservative.

Yoo Seung-min and Choung Byoung-gug are representative moderate conservatives.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] JoongAng Ilbo , a South Korean media outlet, is considered moderate conservative.

[ 3 ] Sweden [ edit ] The major traditional right-wing party in Sweden was initially called the Conservative Party and later the Rightist Party, before adopting the Moderate Party name in 1969 to shed its ultraconservative image and espouse more classical liberal politics.

[ 15 ] United States [ edit ] This article is part of a series on Conservatism in the United States Schools Compassionate Fiscal Fusion Liberal Classical Libertarian Moderate Movement Nationalist Christian Neo- Paleo- Postliberal Populist Progressive Social Straussian Traditionalist Ultra- Principles American exceptionalism Anti-communism Christian Zionism Communitarianism Constitutionalism Familialism Family values Federalism States' rights Subsidiarity Gender essentialism Judeo-Christian values Individualism Law and order Limited government Meritocracy Natural aristocracy Militarism Peace through strength Moral absolutism Natalism Pro-life Natural law Ordered liberty Patriotism Property rights Republicanism Right to bear arms Rule of law Supply-side economics Tradition History Loyalists Federalist Era Southern chivalry Redeemers Boston Brahmins Solid South New Humanism Dunning School Southern Agrarians Old Right Conservative Manifesto Conservative coalition America First Committee McCarthyism Goldwater campaign New Right Reagan era Reagan Doctrine Reaganomics Republican Revolution W.
