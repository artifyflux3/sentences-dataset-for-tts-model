For 2024 book by Jack Posobiec and Joshua Lisec, see Unhumans .

Non-human (also spelled nonhuman ) is any entity displaying some, [ 1 ] but not enough, human characteristics to be considered a human. The term has been used in a variety of contexts and may refer to objects that have been developed with human intelligence , such as robots or vehicles.

Organisms [ edit ] Animal rights and personhood [ edit ] Further information: Personhood § Non-human animals In the animal rights movement, it is common to distinguish between " human animals " and " non-human animals ". Participants in the animal rights movement generally recognize that non-human animals have some similar characteristics to those of human persons . For example, various non-human animals have been shown to register pain, compassion, memory, and some cognitive function.  Some animal rights activists argue that the similarities between human and non-human animals justify giving non-human animals rights that human society has afforded to humans, such as the right to self-preservation, and some even wish for all non-human animals or at least those that bear a fully thinking and conscious mind, such as vertebrates and some invertebrates such as cephalopods , to be given a full right of personhood.

The non-human in philosophy [ edit ] This section may be confusing or unclear to readers .

Please help clarify the section . There might be a discussion about this on the talk page .

( January 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Contemporary philosophers have drawn on the work of Henri Bergson , Gilles Deleuze , Félix Guattari , and Claude Lévi-Strauss (among others) to suggest that the non-human poses epistemological and ontological problems for humanist and post-humanist ethics, [ 2 ] and have linked the study of non-humans to materialist and ethological approaches to the study of society and culture.

[ 3 ] Software and robots [ edit ] The term non-human has been used to describe computer programs and robot-like devices that display some human-like characteristics. In both science fiction and in the real world, computer programs and robots have been built to perform tasks that require human-computer interactions in a manner that suggests sentience and compassion. There is increasing interest in the use of robots in nursing homes and to provide elder care.

[ 4 ] Computer programs have been used for years in schools to provide one-on-one education with children. The Tamagotchi toy required children to provide care, attention, and nourishment to keep it "alive".
