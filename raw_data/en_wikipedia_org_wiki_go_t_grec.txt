The style was more fanciful than historically accurate, though the first archaeological surveys of Greece had begun to appear at this time.

[ 1 ] It was characterized by severe rectilinear and trabeated forms with a somewhat crude Greek detailing incorporating bold pilasters , Ionic scrolls , Greek key and scroll frets and guilloche .

The style's origin may be found in the suite of furniture designed by Louis-Joseph Le Lorrain for the Parisian financier Ange-Laurent de La Live de Jully (now in the Musée Condé , Chantilly). In comparison to the prevailing Rococo style, the austerity of these pieces is stark, and found praise from the contemporary authority on Greek antiquity, the Comte de Caylus . Also influential were the engravings of the architect Jean-François de Neufforge , the architecture of Charles De Wailly , and the designs of Philippe de La Guêpière . The goût grec was a style of avant-garde circles in upper-class Paris, but was ignored at the court at Versailles , where a more conservative, stiffened Louis XV style and modified "Transitional" style obtained.

The goût grec was short-lived and replaced quickly with the delicate, linear (or insipid, according to preference) goût étrusque and goût arabesque , neo-Etruscan and "arabesque" fashions with closer parallels in contemporary British Adam style of the 1770s and 80s.
