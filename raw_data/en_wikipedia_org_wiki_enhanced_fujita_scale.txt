For the radioisotope-containing organic chemical used in cancer research, see 18F-EF5 .

Enhanced Fujita Scale EFU Unknown No surveyable damage EF0 65–85 mph Light damage EF1 86–110 mph Moderate damage EF2 111–135 mph Considerable damage EF3 136–165 mph Severe damage EF4 166–200 mph Devastating damage EF5 >200 mph Incredible damage The National Weather Service 's arrow showing the EF scale. This includes a description word for each level of the scale.

The Enhanced Fujita scale (abbreviated EF-Scale ) is a scale that rates tornado intensity based on the severity of the damage a tornado causes. It is used in the United States and France, among other countries.

[ 1 ] The EF scale is also unofficially used in other countries, including China and Brazil.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The rating of a tornado is determined by conducting a tornado damage survey .

The scale has the same basic design as the original Fujita scale—six intensity categories from zero to five, representing increasing degrees of damage. It was revised to reflect better examinations of tornado damage surveys, in order to align wind speeds more closely with associated storm damage.  Better standardizing and elucidating what was previously subjective and ambiguous, it also adds more types of structures and vegetation , expands degrees of damage, and better accounts for variables such as differences in construction quality. An "EF-Unknown" (EFU) category was later added for tornadoes that cannot be rated due to a lack of damage evidence.

[ 4 ] As with the Fujita scale, the Enhanced Fujita scale is a damage scale and only an estimate for actual wind speeds. While the wind speeds associated with the damage listed did not and have not undergone empirical analysis (such as detailed physical or any numerical modeling) due to expensive costs, the wind speeds were obtained through a process called expert elicitation , which was based on various engineering studies since the 1970s as well as from the field experience of meteorologists and engineers. Unlike the original Fujita scale and International Fujita scale , ratings on the Enhanced Fujita scale are based solely off the effects of 3-second gusts on any given damage indicator.

[ 5 ] History [ edit ] The Enhanced Fujita scale replaced the decommissioned Fujita scale that was introduced in 1971 by Ted Fujita .

[ 6 ] Operational use began in the United States on February 1, 2007, followed by Canada on April 1, 2013, who uses a modified version known as the CEF-scale.

[ note 1 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] It has also been in use in France since 2008, albeit modified slightly by using damage indicators that take into account French construction standards, native vegetation, and the use of metric units.

[ 12 ] In Brazil, the EF Scale is used by the Reporting Platform and Voluntary Network of Severe Storm Observers ( PREVOTS ) since June 2018.

[ 3 ] Similarly, the Japanese implementation of the scale is also modified along similar lines; the Japanese variant is referred to locally in Japan as the JEF or Japanese Enhanced Fujita Scale.

[ 13 ] The scale is also used unofficially in other countries, such as China.

[ 14 ] The newer scale was publicly unveiled by the National Weather Service at a conference of the American Meteorological Society in Atlanta on February 2, 2006. It was developed from 2000 to 2004 by the Fujita Scale Enhancement Project of the Wind Science and Engineering Research Center at Texas Tech University , which brought together dozens of expert meteorologists and civil engineers in addition to its own resources.

[ 15 ] The scale was used for the first time in the United States a year after its public announcement when parts of central Florida were struck by multiple tornadoes , the strongest of which were rated at EF3 on the new scale.

In November 2022, a research paper was published that revealed a more standardized EF-scale was in the works. This newer scale is expected to combine and create damage indicators, and introduce new methods of estimating wind speeds in tornadoes. Some of these newer methods include mobile doppler radar and forensic engineering.

[ 16 ] In 2024, Anthony W. Lyza, Matthew D. Flournoy, and A. Addison Alford, researchers with the National Severe Storms Laboratory , Storm Prediction Center , CIWRO , and the University of Oklahoma 's School of Meteorology, published a paper stating, ">20% of supercell tornadoes may be capable of producing EF4–EF5 damage".

[ 17 ] Parameters [ edit ] The seven categories for the EF scale are listed below, in order of increasing intensity. Although the wind speeds and photographic damage examples have been updated, the damage descriptions given are based on those from the Fujita scale, which are more or less still accurate. However, for the actual EF scale in practice, damage indicators (the type of structure which has been damaged) are predominantly used in determining the tornado intensity.

[ 5 ] Scale Wind speed estimate [ 18 ] Frequency [ 19 ] Potential Damage Example of damage mph km/h EFU N/A N/A 3.11% No surveyable damage.

Intensity cannot be determined due to a lack of information. This rating applies to tornadoes that traverse areas with no damage indicators, cause damage in an area that cannot be accessed by a survey, or cause damage that cannot be differentiated from that of another tornado.

[ 4 ] N/A EF0 65–85 105–137 52.82% Minor damage.

Well-built structures are typically unscathed, though sometimes sustaining broken windows, with minor damage to roofs and chimneys. Billboards and large signs can be knocked down. Trees may have large branches broken off and may be uprooted if they have shallow roots.

[ 20 ] EF1 86–110 138–177 32.98% Moderate damage Damage to mobile homes and other temporary structures becomes significant, and cars and other vehicles may be pushed off the road or flipped. Permanent structures can suffer major damage to their roofs.

EF2 111–135 178–217 8.41% Considerable damage Well-built structures can suffer serious damage, including roof loss, and the collapse of some exterior walls may occur in poorly built structures. Mobile homes, however, are destroyed. Vehicles can be lifted off the ground, and lighter objects can become small missiles, causing damage outside of the tornado's main path. Wooded areas have a large percentage of their trees snapped or uprooted.

EF3 136–165 218–266 2.18% Severe damage A few parts of affected buildings are left standing. Well-built structures lose all outer and some inner walls. Unanchored homes are swept away, and homes with poor anchoring may collapse entirely. Trains and train cars are all overturned. Small vehicles and similarly sized objects are lifted off the ground and tossed as projectiles. Wooded areas suffer an almost total loss of vegetation and some tree debarking may occur.

EF4 166–200 267–322 0.45% Devastating damage Well-built homes are reduced to a short pile of medium-sized debris on the foundation. Homes with poor or no anchoring are swept completely away. Large, heavy vehicles, including airplanes, trains, and large trucks, can be pushed over, flipped repeatedly, or picked up and thrown. Large, healthy trees are entirely debarked and snapped off close to the ground or uprooted altogether and turned into flying projectiles. Passenger cars and similarly sized objects can be picked up and flung for considerable distances.

EF5 201+ 323+ 0.05% Incredible damage Well-built and well-anchored homes are swept cleanly off their foundations and obliterated. Large, steel-reinforced structures such as schools are completely leveled. Low-lying grass and vegetation are shredded from the ground. Trees are completely debarked and snapped. Very little recognizable structural debris is generated with most materials reduced to a coarse, dispersed mix of small, granular particles. Large, multiple-ton steel frame vehicles and farm equipment are often mangled beyond recognition and tossed miles away or reduced entirely to unrecognizable parts. Tall buildings collapse or suffer severe structural deformation. The official description of this damage highlights the extreme nature of the destruction, noting that "incredible phenomena can and will occur".

Damage indicators and degrees of damage [ edit ] The EF scale currently has 28 damage indicators (DI), or types of structures and vegetation, each with a varying number of degrees of damage (DoD). Each structure has a maximum DoD value, which is given by total destruction. Lesser damage to a structure will yield lower DoD values.

[ 21 ] The links in the right column of the following table describe the degrees of damage for the damage indicators listed in each row.

DI No.

Damage indicator (DI) Maximum degrees of damage 1 Small barns or farm outbuildings (SBO) 8 [ 22 ] 2 One- or two-family residences (FR12) 10 [ 23 ] 3 Manufactured home – single wide (MHSW) 9 [ 24 ] 4 Manufactured home – double wide (MHDW) 12 [ 25 ] 5 Apartments, condos, townhouses [three stories or less] (ACT) 6 [ 26 ] 6 Motel (M) 10 [ 27 ] 7 Masonry apartment or motel building (MAM) 7 [ 28 ] 8 Small retail building [fast-food restaurants] (SRB) 8 [ 29 ] 9 Small professional building [doctor's office, branch banks] (SPB) 9 [ 30 ] 10 Strip mall (SM) 9 [ 31 ] 11 Large shopping mall (LSM) 9 [ 32 ] 12 Large, isolated retail building [Wal-Mart, Home Depot] (LIRB) 7 [ 33 ] 13 Automobile showroom (ASR) 8 [ 34 ] 14 Automobile service building (ASB) 8 [ 35 ] 15 Elementary school [single-story; interior or exterior hallways] (ES) 10 [ 36 ] 16 Junior or senior high school (JHSH) 11 [ 37 ] 17 Low-rise building [1–4 stories] (LRB) 7 [ 38 ] 18 Mid-rise building [5–20 stories] (MRB) 10 [ 39 ] 19 High-rise building [more than 20 stories] (HRB) 10 [ 40 ] 20 Institutional building [hospital, government or university building] (IB) 11 [ 41 ] 21 Metal building system (MBS) 8 [ 42 ] 22 Service station canopy (SSC) 6 [ 43 ] 23 Warehouse building [tilt-up walls or heavy-timber construction] (WHB) 7 [ 44 ] 24 Electrical transmission lines (ETL) 6 [ 45 ] 25 Free-standing towers (FST) 3 [ 46 ] 26 Free-standing light poles, luminary poles, flag poles (FSP) 3 [ 47 ] 27 Trees: hardwood (TH) 5 [ 48 ] 28 Trees: softwood (TS) 5 [ 49 ] Differences from the Fujita scale [ edit ] The Enhanced Fujita Scale takes into account the quality of construction and standardizes different kinds of structures. The wind speeds on the original scale were deemed by meteorologists and engineers as being too high, and engineering studies indicated that slower winds than initially estimated cause the respective degrees of damage.

[ 50 ] The old scale lists an F5 tornado as wind speeds of 261–318 mph (420–512 km/h), while the new scale lists an EF5 as a tornado with winds above 200 mph (322 km/h), found to be sufficient to cause the damage previously ascribed to the F5 range of wind speeds. None of the tornadoes in the United States recorded before February 1, 2007, were re-categorized during and after the transition to the EF Scale.

Essentially, there is no functional difference in how tornadoes are rated. The old ratings and new ratings are smoothly connected with a linear formula. The only differences are adjusted wind speeds, measurements of which were not used in previous ratings, and refined damage descriptions; this is to standardize ratings and to make it easier to rate tornadoes which strike few structures. Twenty-eight Damage Indicators (DI), with descriptions such as "double-wide mobile home " or " strip mall ", are used along with Degrees of Damage (DoD) to determine wind estimates. Different structures, depending on their building materials and ability to survive high winds, have their own DIs and DoDs. Damage descriptors and wind speeds will also be readily updated as new information is learned.

[ 21 ] Some differences do exist between the two scales in the ratings assigned to damage. An EF5 rating on the new scale requires a higher standard of construction in houses than does an F5 rating on the old scale. So, the complete destruction and sweeping away of a typical American frame home, which would likely be rated F5 on the Fujita scale, would probably be rated EF4 or lower.

[ 51 ] Since the EF Scale still uses actual tornado damage and similar degrees of damage for each category to estimate the storm's wind speed, the National Weather Service states that the scale will likely not lead to an increase in the number of tornadoes classified as EF5. Additionally, the upper bound of the wind speed range for EF5 is open—in other words, there is no maximum wind speed designated.

[ 5 ] Rating classifications [ edit ] Tornado rating classifications Organization EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 Cit.

NWS Quad Cities, IA/IL Weak Moderate Significant Severe Extreme Catastrophic [ 52 ] NWS Weak Strong Violent [ 53 ] NWS Significant [ 53 ] For purposes such as tornado climatology studies, Enhanced Fujita scale ratings may be grouped into classes.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] The National Weather Service classifies EF0 and EF1 as weak, EF2 and EF3 as strong, as EF4 and EF5 as violent.

[ 53 ] The National Weather Service also uses the EF scale to classify tornadoes with a rating of EF2 and greater as significant.

[ 53 ] The National Weather Service Quad Cities, Iowa/Illinois uses a modified EF scale wording, which gives a new term for each rating on the scale, going from weak to catastrophic.

Next, four damage-based wind speed rating methods for tornados are introduced: the Fujita-Scale  (F-Scale); the Enhanced Fujita-Scale (EF-Scale); the Canadian Enhanced Fujita-Scale (CEF-Scale); and the Japanese Enhanced Fujita-Scale (JEF-Scale)...The CEF-Scale was proposed in 2013 by Environment Canada, closely following the EF-Scale, while the CEF-Scale uses 31 DIs.
