[Infobox references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chemical_infobox#References "Wikipedia:Chemical infobox")

In [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), the **amino radical**, **·NH 2**, also known as the **aminyl** or **azanyl**, is the neutral form of the [amide ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide_ion "Amide ion") (NH−2). Aminyl [radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry) "Radical (chemistry)") are highly [reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry) "Reactivity (chemistry)") and consequently short-lived, like most radicals; however, they form an important part of [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") chemistry. In sufficiently high [concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration "Concentration"), amino radicals [dimerise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimer_(chemistry) "Dimer (chemistry)") to form [hydrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine "Hydrazine"). While NH 2 as a [functional group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group "Functional group") is common in nature, forming a part of many compounds (e.g. the [phenethylamines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenethylamine "Phenethylamine")), the radical cannot be isolated in its free form.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-die.net-2)

### Reaction 1: Formation of amino radical from ammonia

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amino_radical&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Reaction 1: Formation of amino radical from ammonia")]

Amino radicals can be produced by reacting [OH radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical "Hydroxyl radical") with ammonia in irradiated aqueous solutions. This reaction is formulated as a hydrogen abstraction reaction.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-NetaMaruthamuthu1978-3)

NH 3 + **·**OH → **·**NH 2 + H 2 O
The rate constant (_k 1_) for this reaction was determined to be 1.0×10 8 M−1 s−1, while the parallel reaction of OH with NH+

4 was found to be much slower. This rate was redetermined by using two-pulse [radiolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolysis "Radiolysis") competition methods with [benzoate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoate "Benzoate") and thiocyanate ions at pH 11.4. A value of _k_ 1 = (9 + 1)×10 7 M−1 s−1 was obtained from both systems. While in acidic solution, the corresponding reaction of ·OH with NH+4 is too slow to be observed by pulse radiolysis.

### Reaction 2: Formation of amino radical from hydroxylamine

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amino_radical&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Reaction 2: Formation of amino radical from hydroxylamine")]

The amino radical may also be produced by reaction of [e−(aq)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_electron "Aqueous electron") with [hydroxylamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylamine "Hydroxylamine") (NH 2 OH). Several studies also utilized the redox system of [Ti III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium "Titanium")−NH 2 OH for the production of amino radicals using electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and polarography.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-NetaMaruthamuthu1978-3)

Ti III + NH 2 OH → Ti IV + **·**NH 2 + HO−

### Reaction 3: Formation of amino radical from ammoniumyl

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amino_radical&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Reaction 3: Formation of amino radical from ammoniumyl")]

Reduction of hydroxylamine by e−(aq) has also been suggested to produce the amino radical in the following reaction.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-NetaMaruthamuthu1978-3)

**·**NH+3 ⇌ **·**NH 2 + H+
The reactivity of the amino radical in this reaction is expected to be pH dependent and should occur in the region of pH 3–7.

The amino radical has two characteristic electronic states:

[![Image 12: The electronic states of the amino radical](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/The_electronic_states_of_the_amino_radical.jpg/330px-The_electronic_states_of_the_amino_radical.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_electronic_states_of_the_amino_radical.jpg "The electronic states of the amino radical")

The more stable electronic state is 2 B 1, where the unpaired electron is in the p-orbital perpendicular to the plane of the molecule (π type radical). The high energy electronic state, 2 A 1, has the two electrons in the p-orbital and the unpaired electron in the sp 2 orbital (σ type radical).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-NIST-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-KoenigHoobler1974-5)

Nitrogen centered compounds, such as amines, are [nucleophilic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleophile "Nucleophile") in nature. This character is also seen in amino radicals, which can be considered to be nucleophilic species.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-NIST-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-KoenigHoobler1974-5)

### Spectral properties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amino_radical&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Spectral properties")]

The amino radical only exhibits a very low optical absorption in the visible region (_λ_ max = 530 nm, _ε_ max = 81 M−1 s−1), while its absorption in the UV (<260 nm) is similar to that of OH. Due to this, it is impractical to determine the rate of reaction of the amino radical with organic compounds by following the decay of the amino radical.

In general, amino radicals are highly reactive and short lived; however, this is not the case when reacted with some organic molecules. Relative reactivities of the amino radical with several organic compounds have been reported, but the absolute rate constants for such reactions remain unknown. In reaction 1, it was hypothesized that the amino radical might possibly react with NH 3 more rapidly than OH and might oxidize NH+

4 to produce the amino radical in acid solutions, given that radicals are stronger oxidants than OH. In order to test this, [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate "Sulfate") and [phosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate "Phosphate") radical anions were used. The sulfate and phosphate radical anions were found to react more slowly with NH 3 than does the amino radical and they react with ammonia by hydrogen abstraction and not by electron transfer oxidation.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-NetaMaruthamuthu1978-3)

When the amino radical is reacted with [benzoate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoate "Benzoate") ions, the rate constant is very low and only a weak absorption in the UV spectra is observed, indicating that amino radicals do not react with benzene rapidly. [Phenol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol "Phenol"), on the other hand, was found to react more rapidly with the amino radical. In experiments at pH 11.3 and 12, using 1.5 M NH 3 and varying concentrations of phenol between 4 and 10 mM, the formation of the phenoxyl radical absorption was observed with a rate constant of (3 + 0.4)×10 6 M−1 s−1. This reaction can produce phenoxyl radicals via two possible mechanisms:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-NetaMaruthamuthu1978-3)

1.   Addition to the ring followed by elimination of NH 3, or
2.   Oxidation by direct electron transfer

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Rate_constants_for_reaction_of_NH2_radicals_TABLE.png/960px-Rate_constants_for_reaction_of_NH2_radicals_TABLE.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rate_constants_for_reaction_of_NH2_radicals_TABLE.png)

Rate constants for reaction of NH 2 radicals. These rate constants for the amino radical reactions were measured in a 1978 study by Neta et al. by following the kinetics of formation of the resultant radicals. The observations were made at the absorption maxima of these radicals.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-NetaMaruthamuthu1978-3)

While the amino radical is known to be weakly reactive, the recombination process of two amino radicals to form [hydrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine "Hydrazine") appears to be one of the fastest. As a result, it often competes with other NH 2 reactions.

NH 2 + NH 2 → N 2 H 4
At low pressures, this reaction is the fastest and therefore the principal mode of NH 2 disappearance.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_radical#cite_note-KheSoulingnac1977-6)
