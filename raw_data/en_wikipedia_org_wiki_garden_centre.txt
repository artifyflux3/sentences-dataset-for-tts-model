( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Part of a large garden centre near Bristol , England A garden centre ( American English spelling; U.S.

nursery or garden center ) is a retail business that primarily sells plants and related products for domestic gardening .

[ 1 ] Gardening centers usually revolve around outdoor home improvement and décor, selling anything from plants to outdoor ordainments.

It evolved from the concept of a retail plant nursery , offering a broader range of outdoor products and additional on-site facilities.

[ citation needed ] Today, garden centres typically source their plants from specialist nurseries rather than propagating them on-site. In addition to plants, garden centres may offer a variety of other products and services, including homeware , gifts , and cafes .

[ 2 ] Europe [ edit ] Entrance to Bridgemere Garden World Garden centres across Europe play a significant role in supporting the region's horticultural interests, catering to both amateur gardeners and professional landscapers . These centres typically offer a diverse range of plants, gardening tools , outdoor furniture, and decorative items, as well as expert advice and workshops. With a unique blend of local traditions and modern retail practices, garden centres vary widely across the continent, reflecting the environmental and cultural diversity of the region.

United Kingdom [ edit ] The United Kingdom has a large and diverse garden centre industry. There are over 1,500 garden centres in the UK, [ 3 ] ranging from small, independent businesses to large, national chains . The industry is worth an estimated £6.5 billion per year.

[ 4 ] The most popular products sold at garden centres include plants, compost , fertilisers , tools, and landscaping materials. Many garden centres also sell pet-related products, home and interior products, and food and drink.

Garden centres are an important part of the British economy . They provide jobs for over 100,000 people and generate billions of pounds in revenue each year. They also play a role in promoting gardening and outdoor living in the UK.

History of garden centres in the UK [ edit ] The first garden centre in the UK was opened in 1860. It was called the Royal Horticultural Society 's Garden Shop, and it was located in London . The shop sold plants, seeds, and gardening supplies.

In the early 20th century, garden centres began to become more popular. This was due to a number of factors, including the rise of the middle class , the increasing popularity of gardening, and the development of new technologies that made it easier to grow plants.

In the 1970s, garden centres began to grow in size and number. This growth coincided with the development of new shopping centres and the rise of national chains.

In the early days, garden centres were primarily focused on selling plants and gardening supplies. However, over time, they began to offer a wider range of products and services. Today, many garden centres also sell pet supplies, home and garden products, food and drink, and even clothing.

In addition to their product range, garden centres have also evolved in terms of their customer experience. In the past, garden centres were often seen as a place to buy plants and gardening supplies. However, today, they are more of a leisure destination. Many garden centres have cafés, restaurants, play areas, and other amenities that make them a popular destination for families and couples.

The evolution of garden centres in the UK has been driven by a number of factors. The increasing popularity of gardening has been one of the most important factors. Additionally, the development of new shopping centres has provided garden centres with new opportunities to grow.

The rise of national chains has also been a major factor in the evolution of garden centres in the UK. National chains have been able to achieve economies of scale , which has allowed them to offer lower prices and a wider range of products. This has put pressure on independent garden centres, and many of them have been forced to close.

Despite the challenges facing independent garden centres, there is still a strong demand for them. Many people prefer to shop at independent garden centres because they offer a more personal touch. Additionally, independent garden centres often have a wider range of products and services than national chains.

Western Europe [ edit ] In France, garden centres, often referred to as jardineries , are commonly integrated with large agricultural cooperatives. Companies like Truffaut and Jardiland dominate the market, offering extensive selections of plants, garden supplies, and home decor. French garden centres are also known for their focus on organic products and biodiversity , reflecting the country's emphasis on sustainability.

Belgium and the Netherlands boast some of the most innovative garden centres in Europe, given their strong horticultural traditions. The Netherlands, in particular, is home to cutting-edge centres that incorporate advanced greenhouse technology and hydroponics , alongside vast selections of ornamental plants , bulbs, and seeds. Popular names like Intratuin and GroenRijk set industry standards with large, eco-friendly retail spaces.

Southern Europe [ edit ] In Italy and Spain, garden centres often showcase plants and materials suited to Mediterranean climates , such as olive trees, citrus plants , and drought-tolerant flora. Italian garden centres, like Viridea, often combine traditional plant sales with boutique experiences, featuring cafes and cooking classes using home-grown herbs. Meanwhile, Spanish centres, such as Verdecora, emphasise outdoor living trends, including terracotta pottery and furnishings suited to warm climates.

In Portugal, garden centres are smaller in scale but serve as key suppliers of native plants like cork oak and succulents . They often cater to both locals and tourists looking to create sustainable gardens in coastal and arid regions.

Northern Europe [ edit ] Garden centres in Germany and Scandinavia focus heavily on functionality and sustainability. German retailers such as Dehner lead the industry, offering everything from garden equipment to landscaping services, often in collaboration with environmental organisations. Scandinavian garden centres, reflecting their climate, specialise in cold-hardy plants, indoor gardening solutions, and minimalist outdoor décor.

Central and Eastern Europe [ edit ] In Poland, Hungary, and other parts of Central Europe, garden centres are increasingly modernising, with companies like Ogrodnik and OBI expanding their operations. These centres often highlight regional plants and seasonal flowers, catering to the area's strong gardening culture. In Russia, large-scale centres near metropolitan areas focus on ornamental gardening, offering exotic plants alongside traditional varieties.

In the Balkans, smaller garden centres typically act as community hubs, offering locally-grown plants and tailored advice. However, countries like Croatia and Serbia are seeing a rise in larger chains as urban populations grow interested in gardening as a leisure activity.

United States [ edit ] Howe's Farm and Garden in Paxton, Massachusetts In the 1870s, lawn ornaments became popular features, with decorations such as bird baths and gazebos being particularly popular.

[ citation needed ] With the urban sprawl in the United States after WW2 , Americans became more able to spend their money on home improvement and outdoor décor.

[ citation needed ] The increasing popularity of yards and front yards as more Americans moved to newly developed suburban areas strengthened growth for garden centers.

[ 19 ] Having a large, well-maintained lawn began to be seen as a core part of the American Dream , causing the importance of garden centers to increase. In many areas, Americans buy shade or fruit trees from gardening centers or plant nurseries for their backyard or other home-owned outdoor space.

[ 20 ] The United States retail garden center market contained roughly 16,000 independently operated companies in 2010, according to Research and Markets. The combined annual revenue for all of them is about $46.2 billion.

[ 21 ] Most garden centers are independently owned. There are some regional chains, but there is no national US garden center chain, unlike in the UK, where there are several. However, both of the largest home improvement stores in the US— Lowe's and The Home Depot —refer to their gardening departments as garden center and larger hardware stores have "Lawn and Garden" departments.

Some of the items that can be found in US garden centers often called nurseries, include annual and perennial flowers, trees and shrubs, roses, container gardens, hanging baskets, houseplants, water gardening, seeds and bulbs, potting mixes, soil amendments and mulch , fertilizers and chemicals, pottery, garden tools and supplies, fountains and garden décor, much like their UK counterparts.

Many US garden centers have other departments including wild bird feeding , floral, gift, outdoor furniture and barbecue grills, home décor, landscape design , landscaping services, and pet supplies. Most garden centers have a large Christmas department during the holiday season. Some garden centers have added a café or coffee bar, but not like the restaurants found in some European garden centres.

[ citation needed ] Greenhouses are commonly part of a US garden center. Greenhouses protect the plants from late cold snaps, allow stores to keep houseplants in prime condition, and keep the customers dry on rainy days.

Garden centers employ horticulturists who can diagnose problems and make recommendations to gardeners . This is almost always provided as a free service in the store and some of the bigger garden centers have classes that are open to the public.

Many garden centers belong to a buying cooperative. The largest is Master Nursery Garden Centers with just under 800 members followed by Home and Garden Showplace (part of the larger cooperative the True Value Company) with 260 members, Northwest Nursery Buyers Association with 46 members and finally, ECGC with 14 very large garden center members.

[ citation needed ] The trade associations of independent garden centers in the US are the Garden Centers of America and the American Nursery & Landscape Association.

As urban populations increase, centres have begun catering to city dwellers with solutions for balcony and rooftop gardens.

A shift toward providing experiences —such as workshops, cafes, and community events—has helped garden centres attract a broader customer base.

Online platforms and e-commerce have become integral to the success of garden centres, especially in densely populated regions like Germany and France.

European garden centres face challenges including climate change, rising costs of imported plants, and competition from DIY stores and online retailers. Nonetheless, the sector continues to innovate, balancing tradition with modern retail strategies.
