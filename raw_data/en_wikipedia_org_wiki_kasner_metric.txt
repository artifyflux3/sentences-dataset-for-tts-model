Dynamics of Kasner metrics eq. 2 in spherical coordinates towards singularity. The Lifshitz-Khalatnikov parameter is u =2 (1/ u =0.5) and the r coordinate is 2 p α (1/ u )τ where τ is logarithmic time: τ = ln t .

[ 1 ] Shrinking along the axes is linear and uniform (no chaoticity).

The Kasner metric (developed by and named for the American mathematician Edward Kasner in 1921) [ 2 ] is an exact solution to Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity .  It describes an anisotropic universe without matter (i.e., it is a vacuum solution ).  It can be written in any spacetime dimension D > 3 {\displaystyle D>3} and has strong connections with the study of gravitational chaos .

Metric and conditions [ edit ] The metric in D > 3 {\displaystyle D>3} spacetime dimensions is d s 2 = − − d t 2 + ∑ ∑ j = 1 D − − 1 t 2 p j [ d x j ] 2 {\displaystyle {\text{d}}s^{2}=-{\text{d}}t^{2}+\sum _{j=1}^{D-1}t^{2p_{j}}[{\text{d}}x^{j}]^{2}} , and contains D − − 1 {\displaystyle D-1} constants p j {\displaystyle p_{j}} , called the Kasner exponents.

The metric describes a spacetime whose equal-time slices are spatially flat, however space is expanding or contracting at different rates in different directions, depending on the values of the p j {\displaystyle p_{j}} .  Test particles in this metric whose comoving coordinate differs by Δ Δ x j {\displaystyle \Delta x^{j}} are separated by a physical distance t p j Δ Δ x j {\displaystyle t^{p_{j}}\Delta x^{j}} .

The Kasner metric is an exact solution to Einstein's equations in vacuum when the Kasner exponents satisfy the following Kasner conditions, ∑ ∑ j = 1 D − − 1 p j = 1 , {\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{D-1}p_{j}=1,} ∑ ∑ j = 1 D − − 1 p j 2 = 1.

{\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{D-1}p_{j}^{2}=1.} The first condition defines a plane , the Kasner plane, and the second describes a sphere , the Kasner sphere.

The solutions (choices of p j {\displaystyle p_{j}} ) satisfying the two conditions therefore lie on the sphere where the two intersect (sometimes confusingly also called the Kasner sphere).  In D {\displaystyle D} spacetime dimensions, the space of solutions therefore lie on a D − − 3 {\displaystyle D-3} dimensional sphere S D − − 3 {\displaystyle S^{D-3}} .

Features [ edit ] There are several noticeable and unusual features of the Kasner solution: The volume of the spatial slices is always O ( t ) {\displaystyle O(t)} .  This is because their volume is proportional to − − g {\displaystyle {\sqrt {-g}}} , and − − g = t p 1 + p 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + p D − − 1 = t {\displaystyle {\sqrt {-g}}=t^{p_{1}+p_{2}+\cdots +p_{D-1}}=t} where we have used the first Kasner condition.  Therefore t → → 0 {\displaystyle t\to 0} can describe either a Big Bang or a Big Crunch , depending on the sense of t {\displaystyle t} Isotropic expansion or contraction of space is not allowed.  If the spatial slices were expanding isotropically, then all of the Kasner exponents must be equal, and therefore p j = 1 / ( D − − 1 ) {\displaystyle p_{j}=1/(D-1)} to satisfy the first Kasner condition.  But then the second Kasner condition cannot be satisfied, for ∑ ∑ j = 1 D − − 1 p j 2 = 1 D − − 1 ≠ ≠ 1.

{\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{D-1}p_{j}^{2}={\frac {1}{D-1}}\neq 1.} The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric employed in cosmology , by contrast, is able to expand or contract isotropically because of the presence of matter.

With a little more work, one can show that at least one Kasner exponent is always negative (unless we are at one of the solutions with a single p j = 1 {\displaystyle p_{j}=1} , and the rest vanishing).  Suppose we take the time coordinate t {\displaystyle t} to increase from zero.  Then this implies that while the volume of space is increasing like t {\displaystyle t} , at least one direction (corresponding to the negative Kasner exponent) is actually contracting.

The Kasner metric is a solution to the vacuum Einstein equations, and so the Ricci tensor always vanishes for any choice of exponents satisfying the Kasner conditions.  The full Riemann tensor vanishes only when a single p j = 1 {\displaystyle p_{j}=1} and the rest vanish, in which case the space is flat. The Minkowski metric can be recovered via the coordinate transformation t ′ = t cosh ⁡ ⁡ x j {\displaystyle t'=t\cosh x_{j}} and x j ′ = t sinh ⁡ ⁡ x j {\displaystyle x_{j}'=t\sinh x_{j}} .
