Find sources: "Japan Space Systems" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Institute for Unmanned Space Experiment Free Flyer ( USEF ) ( 財団法人無人宇宙実験システム研究開発機構 , Zaidanhōjin mujin uchū jikken shisutemu kenkyū kaihatsu kikō ) was a Japanese space agency, which was founded by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in 1986. Unlike NASDA , ISAS , and NAL , it was not included in the JAXA organization, which was founded in 2003. The chairperson is Ichiro Taniguchi .

In 2012, USEF merged two other organizations— Earth Remote Sensing Data Analysis Center (ERSDAC) and Japan Resources Observation System Organization (JAROS)—to form a new organization Japan Space Systems ( J-spacesystems ).

Goal [ edit ] The aim of USEF is technology development, especially the testing of commercial off-the-shelf parts ( COTS ), robotics, material sciences , and technology for optical earth observations.

Launch vehicle [ edit ] Unlike the JAXA organization, USEF doesn't have its own launch vehicle. Instead, it has used either the H-IIA , the M-3S , or Russian rockets, so far. However, in 2008, METI mentioned the possibility of USEF developing an air-launched vehicle for small payloads.

[ 1 ] Completed missions [ edit ] EXPRESS [ edit ] The Experiment Re-entry Space System ( EXPRESS ) was a 745 kg (1,642 lbs) satellite for microgravity experiments and testing of re-entry technologies. The project was done in cooperation with ISAS (now JAXA) and DLR of Germany. On January 15, 1995, it was launched on the M-3S. However, due to a problem with the rocket, the orbit was much lower than planned. The re-entry capsule was found later in Ghana .

[ 2 ] SERVIS 1 [ edit ] Main article: SERVIS-1 The SERVIS-1 is an 840 kg (1,851 lbs) technology test mission with COTS parts. It was launched on October 30, 2001, with the Russian Rocket launch vehicle. the mission duration was two years.

[ 3 ] USERS [ edit ] Unmanned Space Experiment Recovery System (USERS) was launched on the H-IIA on September 10, 2002. The aim of the mission was microgravity experiments to perform the Super-Conductor Material Processing Experiment and also testing of satellite bus technologies. For the first part of the mission, USERS carried a return capsule. It was retrieved successfully on May 29, 2003. The mission of the main orbiter ended during re-entry in 2007.

[ 4 ] SERVIS 2 [ edit ] Main article: SERVIS-2 SERVIS-2 was a 900 kg (1,984 lbs) technology test mission with COTS parts. It will continue the experiments done with the first SERVIS satellite. It was launched on June 2, 2010, 01:59 UTC, with the Russian Rocket launch vehicle.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] ASNARO missions [ edit ] ASNARO 1 [ edit ] ASNARO [ ja ; fr ; de ] -1, the first of "Advanced Satellite with New system Architecture Observation" series, is a 450 kg (992 lb) earth observation satellite. The expected resolution is less than 0.5 meter (1.6 ft) from an SSO orbit. The satellite was launched on 2014 Nov 6 by a Dnepr rocket from Yasniy, Russia.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] ASNARO 2 [ edit ] ASNARO 2 is small X-band radar satellite for Earth observation. The satellite was launched on 17 January 2018 by an Epsilon rocket.

[ 8 ] Other technology projects [ edit ] USEF developed the robotic arm of the ETS-VII project to test docking technology in the 1990s.

Demonstration of Green Propellant reaction control system (GPRCS) was originally under development for SERVIS-3 project.

[ 9 ] Eventually it was launched and demonstrated successfully aboard RAPIS-1 in 2019.

[ 10 ] Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI) was launched aboard SpaceX CRS-19 on 5 December 2019 to the International Space Station and installed at the External Facility of the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo .
