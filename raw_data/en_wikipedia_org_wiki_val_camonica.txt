It extends about 90 kilometres (56 mi) from the Tonale Pass to Corna Trentapassi, in the commune of Pisogne near Lake Iseo . It has an area of about 1,335 km 2 (515 sq mi) [ note 1 ] and 118,323 inhabitants.

[ note 2 ] The River Oglio runs through its full length, rising at Ponte di Legno and flowing into Lake Iseo between Pisogne and Costa Volpino .

Almost all of the valley is included in the administrative territory of the province of Brescia , except for Lovere , Rogno , Costa Volpino and the Val di Scalve, which belong to the province of Bergamo . Since 1979, the rock drawings located along the valley are a UNESCO World Heritage Site , while the entire valley became a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve in 2018.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Etymology [ edit ] Val Camonica is derived from the Latin Vallis Camunnorum , "Valley of the Camunni ." [ citation needed ] Geography [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources .

( August 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Territory [ edit ] Val Camonica can be divided into three main areas: Lower Val Camonica : a flat area of meadows and fields, starting from the shores of Lake Iseo and extending to the transverse ridge of Bienno , sometimes referred to as the Breno Threshold.

Middle Val Camonica : extending from the Breno Threshold to the municipality of Sonico – Edolo . The lower middle valley extends from Breno to Sellero , while the upper middle valley starts at the narrow gorge at Cedegolo and extends to Sonico – Edolo.

High Val Camonica : This part of the valley follows the Periadriatic Seam , and is  oriented from east to west. Starting in the Val di Corteno, it continues as to the town of Ponte di Legno at the top of the valley. Its climate is similar to that of central Valtellina.

The valley is bounded by these borders: North East South West Province of Sondrio Valtellina Valfurva Trentino Val di Sole Val Rendena Province of Brescia Val Trompia Val Sabbia Lake Iseo Province of Bergamo Val Borlezza Province of Bergamo Val Cavallina Val Seriana Val di Scalve [ note 3 ] Hydrography [ edit ] Val Camonica is traversed by the River Oglio , the fifth longest river in Italy, which rises at Ponte di Legno from the confluence of the Frigidolfo and Narcanello rivers. It flows into Lake Iseo between the municipalities of Pisogne and Costa Volpino .

Numerous streams, some of them seasonal, descend from the mountainsides and flow into the Oglio.

At high altitude there are many alpine lakes, including Lago Moro, as well as many artificial reservoirs, such as the Lago d'Arno.

( January 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Val Camonica likely became habitable only around 15,000 years ago, at the end of last ice age , with the melting of the glacier that first carved out the valley. It is likely that the first humans visited the valley in epipaleolithic times, and appear to have settled by the Neolithic period. When the Ancient Romans extended their dominions north of the River Po , they encountered a people called the Camunni , who were a Rhaetian tribe, populating the valley. About 300,000 petroglyphs survive from this period. By the end of the first century BC, the Valle Camonica was ruled by Ancient Rome , which established the city of Cividate Camuno , with baths, an amphitheater and a large temple dedicated to Minerva .

During the Middle Ages , numerous clashes between the Guelphs and Ghibellines took place in this region. The Guelphs supported the power of the Bishop of Brescia and the papacy, while the Ghibellines sided with the Holy Roman Emperor . In 1287 the Val Camonica rebelled against control by Brescia and sided with the Visconti , lords of Milan , who extended their control over the area during the 14th century. From 1427 to 1454 there were numerous battles between the Duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice for the control of the valley. Ultimately the valley came under the control of Venice. During the following centuries, the civilian population grew and engaged in the iron trade.

Val Camonica was separated from Venice after Venice was conquered by Napoleon in 1797. After the deposition of Napoleon, the area was controlled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire . In 1859, Val Camonica was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy . During World War I battle lines stretched along its eastern border, across the Adamello Group . The battles fought in this area are known as the White War in the Adamello.

In 1955, the National Park of Naquane stone carvings at Capo di Ponte was created by the Archaeological Administration of Lombardy .
