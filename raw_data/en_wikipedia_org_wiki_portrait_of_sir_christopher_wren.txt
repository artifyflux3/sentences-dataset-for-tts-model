[ 1 ] Wren, a polymath , is best known for his design of St Paul's Cathedral along with multiple other buildings in the English Baroque style. It was painted during the reign of Queen Anne , when the cathedral that Wren had designed many years earlier was nearing completion. He is shown as a veteran, established personality, at the age of seventy nine. His right hand holds a pair of compasses and rests on a plan of St Paul's.

[ 2 ] Kneller was the leading portraitist in Britain of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century . The work was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in London in 1860. Copies exist in All Souls, Oxford , Chelsea Hospital and the deanery of St Paul's Cathedral.
