The Dominator Series consists of the Dominator 1, a modified 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe , [ 1 ] the Dominator 2, a modified 2011 GMC Yukon XL , [ 1 ] the Dominator 3, a modified 2012 Ford F-350 Super Duty , [ 1 ] and Dominator Fore, a name utilized for three different Subaru Foresters , [ 1 ] two of which have since been totaled.

[ 2 ] Dominator 1 [ edit ] Dominator 1 was modified from a 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe that was used during the 2008 storm chasing season and debuted in the 2009 chase season. The modifications included adding bulletproof sheet metal and transparent Lexan armor to protect against flying debris near tornadoes, and an external roll cage and racing-style safety harnesses in case of a vehicle roll.

[ 3 ] Dominator 1 is not designed to intercept (due mainly to a lack of an anchoring system as employed on the TIV 2 ) but is able to get as close as "humanly possible" to tornadoes . In 2009, a tornado in Aurora, Nebraska unexpectedly strengthened right over Dominator 1 and blew out the driver's window, when its exterior Lexan window failed to roll up. Reed Timmer and one of his passengers suffered lacerations to the face from flying glass.

[ 4 ] During the 2009 off-season, Dominator 1 was upgraded by strengthening bulletproof and LINE-X sheet metal and Lexan windows. Further upgrades added mid-season include a vertically-scanning radar intended to profile the winds at different heights within a tornado, as well as compressed-air launchers intended to launch wireless parachute probes to gather and transmit data on tornadoes to a chase. At the end of the 2010 season, Dominator 1 slid while intercepting a mile wide EF4 tornado in Wadena, Minnesota , nearly ending in a disaster.

[ 5 ] Early in the 2011 storm season, Dominator 1 suffered various mechanical issues, such as the four-wheel drive not working, the Lexan on the drivers side not fully closing, near-total brake failure, and hydraulic system failure. These issues were later fixed.

In 2018, Dominator 1 was left in the parking lot of Tornado Safe, an Oklahoma City company that built storm shelters. In 2022, after many years of sitting, Timmer was able to get Dominator 1 running and was able to drive it to a new storage location. Dominator 1 had suffered damage sustained from sitting such as faded Lexan windows, Reed losing the keys and other various repairs needed.

[ 6 ] Dominator 1 was put into service for a limited amount of storm chasing during the 2023 season.

[ 7 ] Dominator 2 [ edit ] Motor vehicle SRV Dominator 2 SRV Dominator 2 Overview Designer Reed Timmer , Kevin Barton Body and chassis Class Second Generation Storm Research Vehicle Layout 4-Wheel Drive Powertrain Engine GM LS based small block V-8, E85 Transmission Automatic Transmission Dimensions Curb weight 10,000 lbs (4,500 kg) Chronology Predecessor Stock 2011 Yukon XL In early 2011, Timmer and other members of TVN purchased a 2011 GMC Yukon XL , which would be the base for a second Dominator vehicle named Dominator 2. Changes from Dominator 1 are said to include a flex fuel engine, improved aerodynamic streamlining thanks to the fully sealed outer shell, higher ride height, swiveling rear passenger seats, improved hydraulics, and upgraded armor protection as well as anchoring spikes that could allow it to engage tornadoes stronger than those Dominator 1 could safely face. Reed Timmer also stated that both vehicles would be used, with one going into tornadoes to gather data from inside the funnel while the other would collect data from just outside, allowing them to compare the two sets of data.

[ 8 ] Dominator 2 features reinforced sheet metal and transparent Lexan, and has been strengthened with higher-quality steel and an additional LINE-X coating. This shell is firmly affixed to the frame and chassis of the GMC Yukon XL. Dominator 2 retains a roll cage and racing-car safety seats with full-torso harnesses for added crew protection.

[ 9 ] Dominator 2 first saw action during the tornado outbreak sequence of May 21–26, 2011 in central Oklahoma , shown on the fifth season of Storm Chasers .

[ citation needed ] On May 31, 2013, Dominator 2 was damaged when it intercepted a record breaking multiple-vortex tornado near El Reno . According to KFOR-TV, posts by Reed on Facebook , and as shown in Season 2, episodes 11 and 12 of Tornado Chasers, the hood was ripped off of the vehicle when the Dominator 2 collided with a downed power line. The tornado would go on to be 2.6 miles (4.2 km) wide with winds measured by radar exceeding 312 mph (502 km/h), Unofficially windspeeds are measured by radar at 336 mph (541 km/h) (at about 100 m (330 ft) above the surface), making this the largest and strongest tornado ever intercepted by any of the Dominator vehicles.

[ 10 ] During the chase, Reed and his team found the wrecked SUV of Mike Bettes and his team from The Weather Channel 's Great Tornado Hunt after it had been rolled into a field by a sub-vortex from the main tornado. Joined by members from Oklahoma City's KFOR-TV Channel 4 storm chasing team such as Emily Sutton, and first responders like the Oklahoma Highway Patrol , Bettes and his crew were rescued and evacuated to receive medical attention. Reed later learned that TWISTEX founder Tim Samaras , his son Paul, and storm chasing partner Carl Young, were fatalities of the El Reno tornado.

Dominator 2 sustained engine damage during a storm chase and was parked in a storage lot in Norman, where it sat for many years. In 2022, Timmer made plans to get Dominator 2 back on the road. Dominator 2 needed to be towed to the new warehouse.

[ 6 ] As of July 2024, Dominator 2 remains inoperable.

Dominator 3 [ edit ] Motor vehicle SRV Dominator 3 SRV Dominator 3 Overview Designer Reed Timmer , Kevin Barton, Sean Schofer Body and chassis Class Third Generation Storm Research Vehicle Layout 4-Wheel Drive with Locking Rear Differential.

Powertrain Engine Ford Powerstroke V-8, diesel Transmission Automatic Transmission Dimensions Curb weight 13,000 lbs (~5896.7 kg) Chronology Predecessor Stock 2012 Ford F-350 Super Duty Crew Cab SRW A third Dominator vehicle was completed in late April 2013.

[ 11 ] This vehicle, named Dominator 3, was built using a 2012 Ford F-350 Super Duty pickup truck as the base vehicle — the first Dominator vehicle not to use a General Motors vehicle as the base. The vehicle features an electric winch , airbag lowering suspension, hydraulic anchoring spikes, and gull-wing doors (which were augmented with touch-activated actuators in early 2014) for the driver, front and rear passengers. It is also the first Dominator vehicle to utilize a diesel powerplant .

Dominator 3 first saw action during the tornado outbreak of May 18–21, 2013 , making three separate intercepts on an EF4 tornado near Shawnee, Oklahoma on May 19.

[ citation needed ] Dominator 3 successfully intercepted an EF1 Tornado near Spalding, Nebraska on May 12th, 2023.

[ 12 ] On May 31, 2024, the Dominator 3 hit a large deer while driving in Texas, causing structural damage and a radiator leak.

[ 13 ] After the 2024 season, Dominator 3 experienced total brake failure. Jake's Custom Diesel states that the pads and rotors needed to be replaced as well as an entire rebuild of the brake system. The vehicle was eventually put back in service in time for the 2025 season.

On June 30th, 2025, While driving back to Oklahoma after a chase, the Dominator had once again struck a deer. This left damage to the headlight Lexan and the metal sheeting being pushed in slightly. The Dominator is currently undergoing repairs caused by this deer strike, as well as other damage caused by the 2025 chasing season.

Dominator Fore/4 [ edit ] In Late 2013, Dominator 4 was announced by the 4WARN Storm Team. The Dominator 4 was the Dominator 2 with a new livery. After joining Accuweather in  November 2016, the Dominator 4 (Dominator 2) was repainted, but Reed kept the lightning bolt and black paint.

Powertrain Engine Subaru 2.5 L FB25 H4 Transmission Automatic Transmission Dimensions Curb weight 3,717 Lbs Chronology Predecessor Stock 2018 Subaru Forester 2.0 XT , Stock 2016 Subaru Forester PEZV 2.5i Successor Stock 2015 Subaru Forester Dominator Fore is a Subaru Forester . The Dominator Fore is a stock vehicle, unlike Timmer's other storm-chasing vehicles, which are heavily fortified trucks. Timmer has said that the Forester is a good choice for certain situations due to its smaller size and maneuverability. This allows him to navigate tight spaces and avoid debris during storms. While not specifically built for the purpose like Timmer's other Dominator vehicles, the Subaru has taken its fair share of punishment over the years. Timmer has documented the car's many dents and dings sustained while chasing storms, including hail damage and encounters with tornadoes. In September 2022, the original Dominator Fore was caught in the storm surge of Hurricane Ian and left battered and non-functional. In December 2022, Timmer purchased a 2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i as a replacement Dominator Fore. Timmer swapped the hood from the original Dominator Fore onto the replacement vehicle in honour of the original Dominator Fore. In June 2024, while chasing a tornado in Texas, the engine on the replacement Dominator Fore seized up, [ 14 ] and the vehicle was subsequently scrapped.

[ 15 ] In October 2024, Timmer purchased a 2015 Subaru Forester, which he referred to as "Dominator 4.5" in social media posts.

[ 16 ] Dominator 5 [ edit ] In July 2024, Timmer announced plans to construct Dominator 5.

[ 17 ] Timmer stated that Jake's Custom Diesel out of Norman, Oklahoma would be spearheading the build.

[ 17 ] In February 2025, Timmer replied to a comment on X about Dominator 5, and on Tiktok, Will Clay commented about having multiple designs of the new and improved Dominator 5. Will Clay also stated that Dominator 5 will have 4 spikes and have a slick clean design. Timmer said the building may start in 2026.
