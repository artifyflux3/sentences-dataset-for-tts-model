He is Professor of Mathematics at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) and at Imperial College London . He previously held appointments at the University of Warwick and the Courant Institute of New York University .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] In 2014 he was awarded the Fields Medal , [ 9 ] one of the highest honours a mathematician can achieve.

[ 10 ] In 2020 he won the 2021 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics .

[ 11 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Hairer was born in Geneva , Switzerland.

[ 2 ] He attended the Collège Claparède Geneva where he received his high school diploma in 1994. He entered a school science competition with sound editing software that was developed into Amadeus, [ 12 ] and later continued to maintain the software in addition to his academic work; it continued to be widely used as of 2020 [update] .

[ 11 ] He then attended the University of Geneva , where he obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics in July 1998, Master of Science in Physics in October 1998 and PhD in Physics under the supervision of Jean-Pierre Eckmann in November 2001.

[ 3 ] [ 13 ] Research and career [ edit ] Hairer is active in the field of stochastic partial differential equations in particular, and in stochastic analysis and stochastic dynamics in general.

[ 14 ] He has worked on variants of Hörmander's theorem , systematisation of the construction of Lyapunov functions for stochastic systems, development of a general theory of ergodicity for non- Markovian systems , multiscale analysis techniques , theory of homogenisation , theory of path sampling and theory of rough paths [ 14 ] and, in 2014, on his theory of regularity structures .

[ 15 ] Under the name HairerSoft, he develops Macintosh software.
