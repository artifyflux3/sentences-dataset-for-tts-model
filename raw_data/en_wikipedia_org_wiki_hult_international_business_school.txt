[ 5 ] Hult is named for the school's benefactor Bertil Hult and is affiliated with the EF Education First Group.

[ 7 ] It offers undergraduate , master's , and MBA degree programs, as well as executive education through Hult Ashridge , housed on the Ashridge Estate campus . The school is also the patron of the Hult Prize , a student entrepreneur competition.

[ 8 ] History [ edit ] American background [ edit ] The Arthur D. Little School of Management was founded in 1964 by Arthur Dehon Little in Cambridge, Massachusetts .

[ 9 ] Originally developed as an executive management education program, the school began to grant degrees after receiving full accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges in 1976.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] In 1996, the Arthur D. Little School of Management formed a partnership with Boston College 's Carroll School of Management in order to share access to faculty and facilities.

The same year, Swedish billionaire Bertil Hult purchased the Arthur D. Little School of Management, which resulted in the school's reorganization and reestablishment as Hult International Business School in 2003.

[ 17 ] Under its restructuring, Hult established a new curriculum oriented on international business , which led to the establishment of Hult's global campuses in Dubai (2008), San Francisco (2010), Shanghai (2011), and New York (2014).

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] In 2007, Hult acquired Huron University in London , a private American university located in London's Bloomsbury neighborhood, which subsequently was reestablished as Hult International Business School's London campus.

[ 20 ] In 2014, Hult International Business School acquired and merged with Ashridge Business School, creating one of the largest business schools in the world.

[ 21 ] After 2015, the two schools began operating as a singular entity, with the establishment of Ashridge Executive Education as Hult's executive program.

[ 22 ] Hult opened its undergraduate campus in London, near the City of London financial centre, in 2014.

[ 23 ] The Economist Intelligence Unit , supported by Hult International Business School, launched the Business Professor of the Year Award in 2012.
