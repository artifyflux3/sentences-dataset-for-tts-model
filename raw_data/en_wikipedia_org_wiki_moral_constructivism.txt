For other uses of the term, see Constructivism .

Moral constructivism or ethical constructivism is a view both in meta-ethics and normative ethics which posits that: Ethical sentences express propositions .

Some such propositions are true.

The truth or falsity of such propositions is ineliminably dependent on the result of a suitable constructivist procedure.

Metaethical constructivism holds that correctness of moral judgments, principles and values is determined by being the result of a suitable constructivist procedure. In other words, normative values are a construction of human practical reason . It is opposed to all forms of moral realism, which posit that morality is something discovered by the use of theoretical reason , non-cognitivism , which denies that morality can be constructed rationally, and error theory , which denies the possibility of constructing an objective truth.

In normative ethics, moral constructivism is the view that principles and values within a given normative domain can be justified based on the very fact that they are the result of a suitable constructivist device or procedure.
