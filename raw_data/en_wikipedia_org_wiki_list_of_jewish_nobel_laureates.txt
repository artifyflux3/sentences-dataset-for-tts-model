Jews constitute only 0.2% of the world's population, meaning their share of winners is 110 times their proportion of the world's population.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Jews have been awarded all six of the Nobel Foundation's awards: [ 3 ] Chemistry : 37 (19% of total) Economics : 38 (41% of total) Literature : 16 (13% of total) Peace : 9 (8% of total) Physics : 56 (25% of total) Physiology or Medicine : 60 (26% of total) Adolf von Baeyer , recipient of the 1905 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, was Jewish on his mother's side and is considered the first Jewish awardee.

[ 6 ] Jewish laureates Elie Wiesel and Imre Kertész survived the extermination camps during the Holocaust .

[ 7 ] François Englert survived by being hidden in orphanages and children's homes.

[ 8 ] Others, such as Hans Bethe , Walter Kohn , Otto Stern , Albert Einstein , Hans Krebs and Martin Karplus fled Nazi Germany to avoid persecution.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Still others, including Rita Levi-Montalcini , Herbert Hauptman , Robert Furchgott , Arthur Kornberg , and Jerome Karle , experienced significant antisemitism in their careers.

[ 10 ] [ 12 ] Arthur Ashkin , a 96-year-old American Jew, was, at the time of his award, the oldest person to receive a Nobel Prize.

Jews are a famously accomplished group. They make up 0.2 percent of the world population, but 54 percent of the world chess champions, 27 percent of the Nobel physics laureates and 31 percent of the medicine laureates. Jews make up 2 percent of the U.S. population, but 21 percent of the Ivy League student bodies, 26 percent of the Kennedy Center honorees, 37 percent of the Academy Award-winning directors, 38 percent of those on a recent Business Week list of leading philanthropists, 51 percent of the Pulitzer Prize winners for nonfiction.

Dobbs, Stephen Mark (October 12, 2001).

"As the Nobel Prize marks centennial, Jews constitute 1/5 of laureates" .

J. The Jewish News of Northern California . Retrieved January 23, 2009 .

Throughout the 20th century, Jews, more so than any other minority, ethnic or cultural group, have been recipients of the Nobel Prize – perhaps the most distinguished award for human endeavor in the six fields for which it is given. Remarkably, Jews constitute almost one-fifth of all Nobel laureates. This, in a world in which Jews number just a fraction of 1 percent of the population.

Ted Falcon; David Blatner (2001). "28".

Similarly, because Jews make up less than a quarter of one percent of the world's population, it's surprising that over 20 percent of Nobel prizes have been awarded to Jews or people of Jewish descent.

Lawrence E. Harrison (2008).

Oxford University Press . p. 102.

That achievement is symbolized by the fact that 15 to 20 percent of Nobel Prizes have been won by Jews, who represent two tenths of one percent of the world's population.

Jonathan B. Krasner; Jonathan D. Sarna (2006).

The History of the Jewish People: Ancient Israel to 1880s America . Behrman House, Inc. p. 1.

These accomplishments account for 20 percent of the Nobel Prizes awarded since 1901. What a feat for a people who make up only .2 percent of the world's population!

"Jews rank high among winners of Nobel, but why not Israelis" , J. The Jewish News of Northern California , October 25, 2002. "There are three central theories given for Jewish academic achievement, according to Shulamit Volkov , professor of history at Tel Aviv University and author of "The Magic Circle: Germans, Jews and Anti-Semites." The first theory says that Jews are cleverer than others, a theory dismissed by Volkov and other serious academics. The second theory, proposed first by an American sociologist in 1919, holds that because Jews were on the margins of society they were forced to excel. The third and more common explanation, says Volkov, states that generations of Jewish Orthodox learning later translated brilliantly into secular learning."

"Winning Nobel Prizes seems to run in one family's chemistry—and biology" Archived 2016-05-29 at the Wayback Machine .

The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles . October 12, 2006. "Arthur Kornberg – who still has his own lab at Stanford Medical School at age 88 – grew up in an Orthodox Brooklyn household, where Yiddish was the first language. His future wife, Sylvy Levy, also grew up Orthodox, but the couple raised their children in a fairly secular environment. Still, the family had a strong Jewish and pro-Israel identity, and Roger Kornberg is a consistent donor to the San Francisco-based Jewish Community Federation. Roger married an Israeli scientist, Yahli Lorch, a Stanford professor of structural biology, and they live almost half the year in their Jerusalem flat, where he leads his research team remotely via the Internet.

Jewish women's writing likewise employs satirical and grotesque elements when depicting non-Jews... Some do so pointedly, such as Ilse Aichinger, Elfriede Gerstl, and Elifriede Jelinek... Jelinek resumed the techniques of the Jewish interwar satirists... Jelinek stresses her affinity to Karl Krauss and the Jewish Cabaret of the interwar era... She claims her own Jewish identity as the daughter of a Holocaust victim, her father, thereby suggesting that there is a continuity of Vienna's Jewish tradition (Berka 1993, 137f.; Gilman 1995, 3).

"A native of New York, Maskin grew up in New Jersey, in a nonreligious Jewish home in the town of Alpine... But is he culturally Jewish? "Sure," he said. "It's a very rich culture, and I'm attracted to that side of it. I listen to klezmer — I'm actually a clarinetist myself. And there are certain Jewish foods I'm especially fond of — latkes, chopped liver, chicken soup with matza balls. I like to cook, and a lot of the things I cook have been handed down — a stuffed cabbage recipe I'm fond of, a meat pie recipe. I saw my grandmother do them." ^ Paul Krugman (2003-10-28).
