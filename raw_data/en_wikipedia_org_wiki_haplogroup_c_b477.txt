It is one of two primary branches of Haplogroup C1b , one of the descendants of Haplogroup C1 . Previously, this haplogroup was called C4 (C-M347).

It is distributed in high frequency in Indigenous Australians , Papuan people , Melanesian people , and Polynesian people .

^ Haplogroup A1 is also known as A1'2'3'4.

^ F-Y27277, sometimes known as F2'4, is both the parent clade of F2 and F4 and a child of F-M89.

^ Haplogroup LT (L298/P326) is also known as Haplogroup K1.

^ Between 2002 and 2008, Haplogroup T-M184 was known as "Haplogroup K2". That name has since been re-assigned to K-M526 , the sibling of Haplogroup LT.

^ Haplogroup K2b (M1221/P331/PF5911) is also known as Haplogroup MPS.

^ Haplogroup K2b1 (P397/P399) is also known as Haplogroup MS, but has a broader and more complex internal structure.

^ Haplogroup P (P295) is also klnown as K2b2.

^ K-M2313*, which as yet has no phylogenetic name, has been documented in two living individuals, who have ethnic ties to India and South East Asia.  In addition, K-Y28299, which appears to be a primary branch of K-M2313, has been found in three living individuals from India. See: Poznik op. cit.
