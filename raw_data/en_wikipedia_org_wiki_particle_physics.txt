**Particle physics** or **high-energy physics** is the study of [fundamental particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") and [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction "Fundamental interaction") that constitute [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") and [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"). The field also studies combinations of elementary particles up to the scale of [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protons "Protons") and [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrons "Neutrons"), while the study of combinations of protons and neutrons is called [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics").

The fundamental particles in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") are classified in the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") as [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion") (matter particles) and [bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson "Boson") (force-carrying particles). There are three [generations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_(particle_physics) "Generation (particle physics)") of fermions, although ordinary matter is made only from the first fermion generation. The first generation consists of [up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_quark "Up quark") and [down quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_quark "Down quark") which form [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron"), and [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and [electron neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_neutrino "Electron neutrino"). The three fundamental interactions known to be mediated by bosons are [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), the [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction"), and the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction").

[Quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark") cannot exist on their own but form [hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron "Hadron"). Hadrons that contain an odd number of quarks are called [baryons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon "Baryon") and those that contain an even number are called [mesons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson "Meson"). Two baryons, the [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and the [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron"), make up most of the mass of ordinary matter. Mesons are unstable and the longest-lived last for only a few hundredths of a [microsecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsecond "Microsecond"). They occur after collisions between particles made of quarks, such as fast-moving protons and neutrons in [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray"). Mesons are also produced in [cyclotrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron "Cyclotron") or other [particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator "Particle accelerator").

Particles have corresponding [antiparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle "Antiparticle") with the same [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") but with opposite [electric charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge"). For example, the antiparticle of the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") is the [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron"). The electron has a negative electric charge, the positron has a positive charge. These antiparticles can theoretically form a corresponding form of matter called [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter "Antimatter"). Some particles, such as the [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), are their own antiparticle.

These [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") are excitations of the [quantum fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#Quantum_fields "Field (physics)") that also govern their interactions. The dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model"). The [reconciliation of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity") to the current particle physics theory is not solved; many theories have addressed this problem, such as [loop quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity "Loop quantum gravity"), [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory") and [supersymmetry theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry").

Experimental particle physics is the study of these particles in [radioactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay") processes and in particle accelerators such as the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider "Large Hadron Collider"). Theoretical particle physics is the study of these particles in the context of [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") and [quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). The two are closely interrelated: the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson "Higgs boson") was postulated theoretically before being confirmed by experiments.

[![Image 1: see caption](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Rutherford_Scattering.svg/250px-Rutherford_Scattering.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rutherford_Scattering.svg)

The [Geiger–Marsden experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiments "Geiger–Marsden experiments") observed that a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced strong deflection when being struck by the gold foil.

The idea that all [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") is fundamentally composed of [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") dates from at least the 6th century BC.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-1) In the 19th century, [John Dalton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton "John Dalton"), through his work on [stoichiometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry "Stoichiometry"), concluded that each element of nature was composed of a single, unique type of particle.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-MARK_I._GROSSMAN-2) The word _[atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom")_, after the Greek word _[atomos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%84%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%82 "wikt:ἄτομος")_ meaning "indivisible", has since then denoted the smallest particle of a [chemical element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element"), but physicists later discovered that atoms are not, in fact, the fundamental particles of nature, but are conglomerates of even smaller particles, such as the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"). The early 20th century explorations of [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics") and [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics") led to proofs of [nuclear fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission "Nuclear fission") in 1939 by [Lise Meitner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lise_Meitner "Lise Meitner") (based on experiments by [Otto Hahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Hahn "Otto Hahn")), and [nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion "Nuclear fusion") by [Hans Bethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe "Hans Bethe") in that same year; both discoveries also led to the development of [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon"). Bethe's 1947 calculation of the [Lamb shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_shift "Lamb shift") is credited with having "opened the way to the modern era of particle physics".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-3)

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a bewildering variety of particles was found in collisions of particles from beams of increasingly high energy. It was referred to informally as the "[particle zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_zoo "Particle zoo")". Important discoveries such as the [CP violation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation "CP violation") by [James Cronin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cronin "James Cronin") and [Val Fitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Fitch "Val Fitch") brought new questions to [matter-antimatter imbalance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry "Baryon asymmetry").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-4) After the formulation of the Standard Model during the 1970s, physicists clarified the origin of the particle zoo. The large number of particles was explained as combinations of a (relatively) small number of more fundamental particles and framed in the context of [quantum field theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). This reclassification marked the beginning of modern particle physics.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-6)

The current state of the classification of all elementary particles is explained by the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model"), which gained widespread acceptance in the mid-1970s after [experimental confirmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_confirmation "Experimental confirmation") of the existence of [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark"). It describes the [strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction"), [weak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction"), and [electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism")[fundamental interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction "Fundamental interaction"), using mediating [gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson "Gauge boson"). The species of gauge bosons are eight [gluons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon"), [W− , W+ and Z bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons "W and Z bosons"), and the [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-Baker_p_120-7) The Standard Model also contains 24 [fundamental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_particle "Fundamental particle")[fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion") (12 particles and their associated anti-particles), which are the constituents of all [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-pdg-8) Finally, the Standard Model also predicted the existence of a type of [boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson "Boson") known as the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson "Higgs boson"). On 4 July 2012, physicists with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN announced they had found a new particle that behaves similarly to what is expected from the Higgs boson.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-9)

The Standard Model, as currently formulated, has 61 elementary particles.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-braibant-10) Those elementary particles can combine to form composite particles, accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960s. The Standard Model has been found to agree with almost all the [experimental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment "Experiment") tests conducted to date. However, most particle physicists believe that it is an incomplete description of nature and that a more fundamental theory awaits discovery (See [Theory of Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Everything "Theory of Everything")). In recent years, measurements of [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino")[mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_mass "Rest mass") have provided the first experimental deviations from the Standard Model, since neutrinos do not have mass in the Standard Model.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-11)

Modern particle physics research is focused on [subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle "Subatomic particle"), including atomic constituents, such as [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton"), and [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") (protons and neutrons are composite particles called [baryons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon "Baryon"), made of [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark")), that are produced by [radioactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay") and [scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering "Scattering") processes; such particles are [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino"), and [muons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon "Muon"), as well as a wide range of [exotic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_particle "Exotic particle").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-12) All particles and their interactions observed to date can be described almost entirely by the Standard Model.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-Baker_p_120-7)

Dynamics of particles are also governed by [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"); they exhibit [wave–particle duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality "Wave–particle duality"), displaying particle-like behaviour under certain experimental conditions and [wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave")-like behaviour in others. In more technical terms, they are described by [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state") vectors in a [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space"), which is also treated in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). Following the convention of particle physicists, the term _[elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary\_particle "Elementary particle")_ is applied to those particles that are, according to current understanding, presumed to be indivisible and not composed of other particles.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-braibant-10)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Beta_Negative_Decay.svg/250px-Beta_Negative_Decay.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beta_Negative_Decay.svg)

A [Feynman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram "Feynman diagram") of the [β− decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay "Beta decay"), showing a neutron (n, udd) converted into a proton (p, udu). "u" and "d" are the [up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_quark "Up quark") and [down quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_quark "Down quark"), "e−

" is the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), and "ν

e" is the [electron antineutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_Antineutrino "Electron Antineutrino").

Ordinary [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") is made from first-[generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_(particle_physics) "Generation (particle physics)") quarks ([up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_quark "Up quark"), [down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_quark "Down quark")) and leptons ([electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), [electron neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_neutrino "Electron neutrino")).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-Povh02-13) Collectively, quarks and leptons are called [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"), because they have a [quantum spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_spin "Quantum spin") of [half-integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-integer "Half-integer") (−1/2, 1/2, 3/2, etc.). This causes the fermions to obey the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle "Pauli exclusion principle"), where no two particles may occupy the same [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-14) Quarks have fractional [elementary electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge "Elementary charge") (−1/3 or 2/3)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-15) and leptons have whole-numbered electric charge (0 or -1).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-16) Quarks also have [color charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge "Color charge"), which is labeled arbitrarily with no correlation to actual light [color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color "Color") as red, green and blue.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-R._Nave-17) Because the interactions between the quarks store energy which can convert to other particles when the quarks are far apart enough, quarks cannot be observed independently. This is called [color confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement "Color confinement").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-R._Nave-17)

There are three known generations of quarks (up and down, [strange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_quark "Strange quark") and [charm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charm_quark "Charm quark"), [top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark "Top quark") and [bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_quark "Bottom quark")) and leptons (electron and its neutrino, [muon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon "Muon") and [its neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon_neutrino "Muon neutrino"), [tau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_(particle) "Tau (particle)") and [its neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_neutrino "Tau neutrino")), with strong indirect evidence that a fourth generation of fermions does not exist.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-18)

Bosons are the [mediators or carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_carrier "Force carrier") of fundamental interactions, such as [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), the [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction"), and the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-DarkMatter-19) Electromagnetism is mediated by the [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), the [quanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum") of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-20): 29–30  The weak interaction is mediated by the [W and Z bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons "W and Z bosons").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-21) The strong interaction is mediated by the [gluon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon"), which can link quarks together to form composite particles.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-HyperPhysics-22) Due to the aforementioned color confinement, gluons are never observed independently.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-:0-23) The [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson "Higgs boson") gives mass to the W and Z bosons via the [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism "Higgs mechanism")[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-PDG-24) – the gluon and photon are expected to be [massless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massless_particle "Massless particle").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-:0-23) All bosons have an integer quantum spin (0 and 1) and can have the same [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-DarkMatter-19)

### Antiparticles and color charge

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Particle_physics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Antiparticles and color charge")]

Most aforementioned particles have corresponding [antiparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle "Antiparticle"), which compose [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter "Antimatter"). Normal particles have positive [lepton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton_number "Lepton number") or [baryon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_number "Baryon number"), and antiparticles have these numbers negative.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-25) Most properties of corresponding antiparticles and particles are the same, with a few gets reversed; the electron's antiparticle, positron, has an opposite charge. To differentiate between antiparticles and particles, a plus or negative sign is added in [superscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscript "Superscript"). For example, the electron and the positron are denoted e−

 and e+

.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-raith-26) However, in the case that the particle has a charge of 0 (equal to that of the antiparticle), the antiparticle is denoted with a line above the symbol. As such, an electron neutrino is ν

e, whereas its antineutrino is ν

e. When a particle and an antiparticle interact with each other, they are [annihilated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation "Annihilation") and convert to other particles.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-27) Some particles, such as the photon or gluon, have no antiparticles.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Quarks and gluons additionally have color charges, which influences the strong interaction. Quark's color charges are called red, green and blue (though the particle itself have no physical color), and in antiquarks are called antired, antigreen and antiblue.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-R._Nave-17) The gluon can have [eight color charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon"), which are the result of quarks' interactions to form composite particles (gauge symmetry [SU(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU(3) "SU(3)")).[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-PeskinSchroeder-28)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Quark_structure_proton.svg/250px-Quark_structure_proton.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Quark_structure_proton.svg)

A [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") consists of two up quarks and one down quark, linked together by [gluons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon"). The quarks' color charge are also visible.

The [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") and [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") in the [atomic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") are [baryons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon "Baryon") – the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark, and the proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-Knowing2-29) A baryon is composed of three quarks, and a [meson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson "Meson") is composed of two quarks (one normal, one anti). Baryons and mesons are collectively called [hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron "Hadron"). Quarks inside hadrons are governed by the strong interaction, thus are subjected to [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics") (color charges). The [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state "Bound state") quarks must have their color charge to be neutral, or "white" for analogy with [mixing the primary colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color "Additive color").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-30) More [exotic hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_hadron "Exotic hadron") can have other types, arrangement or number of quarks ([tetraquark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraquark "Tetraquark"), [pentaquark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentaquark "Pentaquark")).[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-31)

An atom is made from protons, neutrons and electrons.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-32) By modifying the particles inside a normal atom, [exotic atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_atom "Exotic atom") can be formed.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-33) A simple example would be the [hydrogen-4.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-4.1 "Hydrogen-4.1"), which has one of its electrons replaced with a muon.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-34)

The [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton "Graviton") is a hypothetical particle that can mediate the gravitational interaction, but it has not been detected or completely reconciled with current theories.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-35) Many other hypothetical particles have been proposed to address the limitations of the Standard Model. Notably, [supersymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry") particles aim to solve the [hierarchy problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_problem "Hierarchy problem"), [axions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion "Axion") address the [strong CP problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_CP_problem "Strong CP problem"), and various other particles are proposed to explain the origins of [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter") and [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy").

Its 2-mile-long linear particle accelerator began operating in 1962 and was the basis for numerous [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron") collision experiments until 2008. Since then the linear accelerator is being used for the [Linac Coherent Light Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linac_Coherent_Light_Source "Linac Coherent Light Source")[X-ray laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_laser "X-ray laser") as well as advanced accelerator design research. SLAC staff continue to participate in developing and building many [particle detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_detector "Particle detector") around the world.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-47)

Theoretical particle physics attempts to develop the models, theoretical framework, and mathematical tools to understand current experiments and make predictions for future experiments (see also [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics")). There are several major interrelated efforts being made in theoretical particle physics today.

One important branch attempts to better understand the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") and its tests. Theorists make quantitative predictions of observables at [collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider "Collider") and [astronomical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroparticle_physics "Astroparticle physics") experiments, which along with experimental measurements is used to extract the parameters of the Standard Model with less uncertainty. This work probes the limits of the Standard Model and therefore expands scientific understanding of nature's building blocks. Those efforts are made challenging by the difficulty of calculating high precision quantities in [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics"). Some theorists working in this area use the tools of perturbative [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") and [effective field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_theory "Effective field theory"), referring to themselves as [phenomenologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(physics) "Phenomenology (physics)"). Others make use of [lattice field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_field_theory "Lattice field theory") and call themselves _lattice theorists_.

Another major effort is in model building where model builders develop ideas for what physics may lie [beyond the Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Standard_Model "Beyond the Standard Model") (at higher energies or smaller distances). This work is often motivated by the [hierarchy problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_problem "Hierarchy problem") and is constrained by existing experimental data.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-49) It may involve work on [supersymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry"), alternatives to the [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism "Higgs mechanism"), extra spatial dimensions (such as the [Randall–Sundrum models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall%E2%80%93Sundrum_model "Randall–Sundrum model")), [Preon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preon "Preon") theory, combinations of these, or other ideas. [Vanishing-dimensions theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_dimensions_theory "Vanishing dimensions theory") is a particle physics theory suggesting that systems with higher energy have a smaller number of dimensions.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-50)

A third major effort in theoretical particle physics is [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"). _String theorists_ attempt to construct a unified description of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") and [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") by building a theory based on small strings, and [branes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane "Brane") rather than particles. If the theory is successful, it may be considered a "[Theory of Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Everything "Theory of Everything")", or "TOE".[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-51)

There are other areas of work in theoretical particle physics ranging from [particle cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics_in_cosmology "Particle physics in cosmology") to [loop quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity "Loop quantum gravity").

Practical applications
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Particle_physics&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Practical applications")]

In principle, all physics (and practical applications developed therefrom) can be derived from the study of fundamental particles. In practice, even if "particle physics" is taken to mean only "high-energy atom smashers", many technologies have been developed during these pioneering investigations that later find wide uses in society. Particle accelerators are used to produce [medical isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_in_medicine "Isotopes in medicine") for research and treatment (for example, isotopes used in [PET imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PET_imaging "PET imaging")), or used directly in [external beam radiotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy "External beam radiotherapy"). The development of [superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductor "Superconductor") has been pushed forward by their use in particle physics. The [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web") and [touchscreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen "Touchscreen") technology were initially developed at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN "CERN"). Additional applications are found in medicine, national security, industry, computing, science, and workforce development, illustrating a long and growing list of beneficial practical applications with contributions from particle physics.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-52)

Major efforts to look for [physics beyond the Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_beyond_the_Standard_Model "Physics beyond the Standard Model") include the [Future Circular Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Circular_Collider "Future Circular Collider") proposed for CERN[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics#cite_note-53) and the [Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_Physics_Project_Prioritization_Panel "Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel") (P5) in the US that will update the 2014 P5 study that recommended the [Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Underground_Neutrino_Experiment "Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment"), among other experiments.
