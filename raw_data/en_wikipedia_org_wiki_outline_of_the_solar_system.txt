Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets (including Earth), with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.

Regions and celestial objects of the Solar System [ edit ] Planets and declared dwarf planets of the Solar System. Sizes are to scale. Distances from the Sun are not to scale.
