It is approximately 0.66274 34193 49181 58097 47420 97109 25290.

Kepler's equation M = E − ε sin E relates the mean anomaly M with the eccentric anomaly E for a body moving in an ellipse with eccentricity ε. This equation cannot be solved for E in terms of elementary functions , but the Lagrange reversion theorem gives the solution as a power series in ε: E = M + sin ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) ε ε + 1 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 M ) ε ε 2 + ( 3 8 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( 3 M ) − − 1 8 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) ) ε ε 3 + ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle E=M+\sin(M)\,\varepsilon +{\tfrac {1}{2}}\sin(2M)\,\varepsilon ^{2}+\left({\tfrac {3}{8}}\sin(3M)-{\tfrac {1}{8}}\sin(M)\right)\,\varepsilon ^{3}+\cdots } or in general [ 1 ] [ 2 ] E = M + ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ ε ε n 2 n − − 1 n !

∑ ∑ k = 0 ⌊ ⌊ n / 2 ⌋ ⌋ ( − − 1 ) k ( n k ) ( n − − 2 k ) n − − 1 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( ( n − − 2 k ) M ) {\displaystyle E=M\;+\;\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {\varepsilon ^{n}}{2^{n-1}\,n!}}\sum _{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor }(-1)^{k}\,{\binom {n}{k}}\,(n-2k)^{n-1}\,\sin((n-2k)\,M)} Laplace realized that this series converges for small values of the eccentricity, but diverges for any value of M other than a multiple of π if the eccentricity exceeds a certain value that does not depend on M . The Laplace limit is this value. It is the radius of convergence of the power series.

It is also the maximum of the function x cosh ( x ) {\displaystyle {\frac {x}{{\text{cosh}}(x)}}} [ 3 ] It is the unique real solution of the transcendental equation [ 4 ] x exp ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 + x 2 ) 1 + 1 + x 2 = 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {x\exp({\sqrt {1+x^{2}}})}{1+{\sqrt {1+x^{2}}}}}=1} A closed-form expression in terms of r-Lambert special function and an infinite series representation were given by István Mező.

[ 5 ] History [ edit ] Laplace calculated the value 0.66195 in 1827. The Italian astronomer Francesco Carlini found the limit 0.66 five years before Laplace.

Cauchy in 1829 gave the precise value 0.66274.
