[ 1 ] The term usually refers to real analytic manifolds, although complex manifolds are also analytic.

[ 2 ] In algebraic geometry, analytic spaces are a generalization of analytic manifolds such that singularities are permitted.

For U ⊆ ⊆ R n {\displaystyle U\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , the space of analytic functions, C ω ω ( U ) {\displaystyle C^{\omega }(U)} , consists of infinitely differentiable functions f : U → → R {\displaystyle f:U\to \mathbb {R} } , such that the Taylor series T f ( x ) = ∑ ∑ | α α | ≥ ≥ 0 D α α f ( x 0 ) α α !

( x − − x 0 ) α α {\displaystyle T_{f}(\mathbf {x} )=\sum _{|\alpha |\geq 0}{\frac {D^{\alpha }f(\mathbf {x_{0}} )}{\alpha !}}(\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {x_{0}} )^{\alpha }} converges to f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {x} )} in a neighborhood of x 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {x_{0}} } , for all x 0 ∈ ∈ U {\displaystyle \mathbf {x_{0}} \in U} . The requirement that the transition maps be analytic is significantly more restrictive than that they be infinitely differentiable; the analytic manifolds are a proper subset of the smooth , i.e.

C ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle C^{\infty }} , manifolds.

[ 1 ] There are many similarities between the theory of analytic and smooth manifolds, but a critical difference is that analytic manifolds do not admit analytic partitions of unity, whereas smooth partitions of unity are an essential tool in the study of smooth manifolds.

[ 3 ] A fuller description of the definitions and general theory can be found at differentiable manifolds , for the real case, and at complex manifolds , for the complex case.
