For Catholic condemnation, see Americanism (heresy) .

Ideals considered to be Americanism vary widely from assimilation , monoculturalism , or centrality of a right to property to more classical liberal conceptions believed to be represented in the American Revolution , human rights , and republicanism .

Americanism , also referred to as American patriotism , is a set of national values which aim to create a shared American identity for the United States that can be defined as "an articulation of the nation's rightful place in the world, a set of traditions, a political language, and a cultural style imbued with political meaning".

[ 1 ] : 6 The concept is "famously contested" [ 1 ] : 1 and there is no consensus on "which is the true or authentic... exposition of Americanism... because each of these texts ... is informed by different interpretations of the nature, purpose, and goals of Americanism." [ 2 ] Americanism is not merely nationalism and can cover two different meanings: the defining characteristics of the United States, or loyalty to the United States and defense of American political ideals. These ideals include but are not limited to independence , equality before the law , freedom of speech , democracy , and progress .

[ 1 ] : 172 [ 3 ] For example, according to the American Legion , a U.S. veterans' organization, Americanism is an ideology, or a belief in devotion, loyalty, or allegiance to the United States , or respect for its flag , its traditions, its customs, its culture , symbols , its institutions, or its form of government .

[ 4 ] Theodore Roosevelt wrote that "Americanism is a question of spirit, conviction, and purpose, not of creed or birthplace." [ 5 ] The concept has been appropriated by a variety of movements: the Ku Klux Klan, [ 6 ] , American Nazis , [ 7 ] and the American Communist Party with its slogan "Communism is Twentieth Century Americanism".

[ 8 ] Ideology [ edit ] According to Wendy L. Wall in her 2008 book Inventing the "American Way": The Politics of Consensus from the New Deal to the Civil Rights Movement , Americanism was presented by a national propaganda campaign to contrast with Communism , and Fascism , during the Cold War, with the benefits of Americanism being promoted through the ideals of freedom and democracy.

Professor of political science at Clemson University C. Bradley Thompson stated that The meaning of Americanism today, however, is very different. To the extent that the term is even still used, its meaning has been hijacked by both the Left and the Right. The Left most often identifies Americanism with multiculturalism, relativism, environmentalism, regulation, and welfarism — in other words, with progressivism. The Right typically identifies Americanism with Christianity, school prayer, tradition, family values, and community standards—in other words, with social conservatism. None of these values are, however, uniquely American. In fact, in one form or another, they all have a distinctly European provenance that is set in direct opposition to the native meaning of Americanism.

[ 9 ] Some organizations have claimed to embrace Americanism but also taken positions that contrast with founding documents and the cultural spirit original to the American tradition: [ editorializing ] For example, the Ku Klux Klan believes that Americanism includes aspects of race (purity of white American ) and of American Protestantism .

[ 6 ] In a 1916 essay devoted to Americanism, Agnes Repplier emphasized that, "Of all the countries in the world, we and we only have any need to create artificially the patriotism which is the birthright of other nations." [ 10 ] History [ edit ] The concept of Americanism has been in use since the first European settlers moved to North America inspired by a vision of a shining " City upon a Hill ".

John Adams wrote that the new settlements in America were "the opening of a grand scene and design in Providence for the illumination of the ignorant, and the emancipation of the slavish part of mankind all over the earth".

[ 11 ] During the antebellum period, throughout the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, Americanism acquired a restrictive political meaning due to nativist moral panics after increased Irish and German immigration led to the growth of American Catholicism .

[ 12 ] Journalist Matthew Continetti describes U.S. presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge as "spokesmen for Americanism" based on their policies.

[ 13 ] The John Birch Society and its founder, Robert Welch , promoted Americanism as "the philosophical antithesis of communism." [ 14 ] Conversely, during the Great Depression and afterwards, the Communist Party campaigned that "Communism is the Americanism of the 20th Century." [ 15 ] The years from the end of the Civil War to the end of World War II brought new meaning to the term "Americanism" to millions of immigrants coming from Europe and Asia . Those were times of great economic growth and industrialization, and thus brought forth the American scene consisting of " industrial democracy " and the thinking that the people are the government in America. Since then, the success of the American nation has brought tremendous power to the notion of Americanism .

[ 1 ] : 67 Ideas [ edit ] Government [ edit ] Rather than collectivism, Americanism stresses unity based on the shared individualist liberal principles outlined in the Constitution of the United States by the Founding Fathers . Such ideology includes republicanism , freedom , liberty , individualism , constitutionalism , human rights , and the rule of law .

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] Culture [ edit ] Main article: Americana (culture) Cultural icons for the USA: the American flag, baseball, apples and apple pie Proponents of Americanism espouse an identity based on aspects of traditional culture of the United States . Common cultural artifacts include the flag of the United States , apple pie , baseball , rock and roll , blue jeans , Coca-Cola , and small towns.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Americanism tends to support monoculturalism and cultural assimilation , believing them to be integral to a unified American cultural identity .

[ 21 ] Symbols [ edit ] Main article: National symbols of the United States Americanism attempts to collect a set of common icons to symbolize the American identity. Well known national symbols of the United States include the U.S. flag , the Great Seal , the bald eagle , The Star-Spangled Banner , In God We Trust , and the Pledge of Allegiance .
