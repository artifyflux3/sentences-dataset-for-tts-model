Proxenus educated Aristotle for a couple of years before sending him to Athens to Plato's Academy.

He lived in Atarneus , a city in Asia Minor.

Proxenus had married Aristotle's older sister Arimneste , whereby they had a daughter Hero and a son Nicanor.  Hero's own son, Callisthenes , would later become a student and collaborator with his great-uncle Aristotle.  Nicanor eventually married Aristotle's daughter, Pythias .
