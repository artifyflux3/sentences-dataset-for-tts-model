It has several subdisciplines, including aerodynamics (the study of air and other gases in motion) and hydrodynamics (the study of water and other liquids in motion). Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and moments on aircraft , determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines , predicting weather patterns , understanding nebulae in interstellar space , understanding large scale geophysical flows involving oceans/atmosphere and modelling fission weapon detonation .

What type of thing is fluid dynamics?

[ edit ] Fluid dynamics can be described as all of the following: An academic discipline – one with academic departments, curricula and degrees; national and international societies; and specialized journals.

A scientific field (a branch of science ) – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer-reviewed research is published.

A natural science – one that seeks to elucidate the rules that govern the natural world using empirical and scientific methods.

A physical science – one that studies non-living systems.

A branch of physics – study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force.

A branch of mechanics – area of mathematics and physics concerned with the relationships between force, matter, and motion among physical objects.

A branch of continuum mechanics – subject that models matter without using the information that it is made out of atoms; that is, it models matter from a macroscopic viewpoint rather than from microscopic.

A subdiscipline of fluid mechanics – branch of physics concerned with the mechanics of fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) and the forces on them, which also includes hydrostatics as a subdiscipline A subdiscipline of fluid mechanics – branch of physics concerned with the mechanics of fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) and the forces on them.
