[ 2 ] He wrote his master's thesis with Amelia Hambuger on interpretations of quantum physics , in particular the interpretation by Vladimir Fock , and subsequently wrote his Ph.D. thesis with Michel Paty and Shozo Montoyama on David Bohm 's approach to quantum mechanics .

[ 3 ] He worked as post-doctoral researcher at the Université Paris VII , at Harvard University , and subsequently at the MIT .

[ 2 ] Freire Jr. is Associate Professor and Researcher II UFBA in the History of Science. He is also president of the Brazilian Society for the History of Science and vice-president of the Commission for the History of Modern Physics, International Union of History and Philosophy of Science .
