[ 1 ] It is at the Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare , near Padova .

[ 2 ] It is being used for research into gravitational waves and quantum gravity .

When the oscillator gets hit with a burst of gravitational waves, it will excite the oscillator and it will vibrate for a time span longer than the duration of the gravitational wave burst. This allows for the extraction of the signal from the detector.
