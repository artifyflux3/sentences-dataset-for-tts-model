The cheiroscope was presented in an article published in 1929.

[ 1 ] The author E. E. Maddox writes that compared to the earlier amblyoscope , "[t]he cheiroscope approaches the problem from a different and complementary angle, on the simple principle of pressing the hand into service to educate the eye." [ 1 ] A cheiroscope can be operated in different manners. For example, using a cheiroscope, a line image can be presented to one eye and the image of a blank sheet to the other eye, and the subject is intended to make a drawing that reproduces the line image.

The cheiroscope is used for diagnostic purposes to test binocular vision , to assess certain conditions of strabism in particular related to binocular stability and alignment, [ 2 ] cyclotropia , [ 3 ] and the presence and extent of suppression .

[ 2 ] It can also be used in vision therapy to train amblyopic subjects in desuppression and eye–hand coordination .

[ 2 ] A stereoscope can be modified to function as a cheiroscope.
