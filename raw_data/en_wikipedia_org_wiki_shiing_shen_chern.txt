**Shiing-Shen Chern** (; [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 陳省身; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): _Chén Xǐngshēn_, Mandarin:[[tʂʰə́n.ɕǐŋ.ʂə̄n]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Mandarin "Help:IPA/Mandarin"); October 26, 1911[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-frs-1) – December 3, 2004) was a Chinese American [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") and poet. He made fundamental contributions to [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"). He has been called the "father of modern differential geometry" and is widely regarded as a leader in [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") and one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century, winning numerous awards and recognition including the [Wolf Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Prize_in_Mathematics "Wolf Prize in Mathematics") and the inaugural [Shaw Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaw_Prize "Shaw Prize").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-frs-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:4-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:8-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:3-7) In memory of Shiing-Shen Chern, the [International Mathematical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Union "International Mathematical Union") established the [Chern Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_Medal "Chern Medal") in 2010 to recognize "an individual whose accomplishments warrant the highest level of recognition for outstanding achievements in the field of mathematics."[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-8)

Chern worked at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study "Institute for Advanced Study") (1943–45), spent about a decade at the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago "University of Chicago") (1949-1960), and then moved to [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley"), where he cofounded the [Mathematical Sciences Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Sciences_Research_Institute "Mathematical Sciences Research Institute") in 1982 and was the institute's founding director.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-10) Renowned coauthors with Chern include [Jim Simons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Simons "Jim Simons"), an American mathematician and billionaire hedge fund manager.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-11) Chern's work, most notably the [Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern%E2%80%93Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem "Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem"), [Chern–Simons theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern%E2%80%93Simons_theory "Chern–Simons theory"), and [Chern classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_class "Chern class"), are still highly influential in current research in mathematics, including geometry, topology, and [knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory "Knot theory"), as well as many branches of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), including [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"), [condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics "Condensed matter physics"), [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), and [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:6-12)

Chern's surname (陳/陈, pinyin: Chén) is a common Chinese surname which is now usually romanized as [Chen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_(surname) "Chen (surname)"). The spelling "Chern" is from the [Gwoyeu Romatzyh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwoyeu_Romatzyh "Gwoyeu Romatzyh") (GR) [romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization "Romanization") system. In English, Chern pronounced his own name as "Churn" ().

### Early years in China

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiing-Shen_Chern&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Early years in China")]

Chern was born in Xiushui, Jiaxing, China in 1911. He graduated from Xiushui Middle School (秀水中學) and subsequently moved to [Tianjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin "Tianjin") in 1922 to accompany his father. In 1926, after spending four years in Tianjin, Chern graduated from [Fulun High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fulun_High_School&action=edit&redlink=1 "Fulun High School (page does not exist)")[[zh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%89%B6%E8%BC%AA%E4%B8%AD%E5%AD%B8 "zh:扶輪中學")].[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-Chern_Tianjin-13)

At age 15, Chern entered the Faculty of Sciences of the [Nankai University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nankai_University "Nankai University") in Tianjin and was interested in physics, but not so much the laboratory, so he studied mathematics instead.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:0-14) Chern graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1930.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:0-14) At Nankai, Chern's mentor was mathematician [Jiang Lifu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Lifu "Jiang Lifu"), and Chern was also heavily influenced by Chinese physicist [Rao Yutai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao_Yutai "Rao Yutai"), considered to be one of the founding fathers of modern Chinese [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics_(academic_field) "Informatics (academic field)").

Chern went to [Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing "Beijing") to work at the [Tsinghua University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University "Tsinghua University") Department of Mathematics as a teaching assistant. At the same time he also registered at Tsinghua Graduate School as a student. He studied [projective differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_differential_geometry "Projective differential geometry") under [Sun Guangyuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Guangyuan "Sun Guangyuan"), a [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago "University of Chicago")-trained geometer and [logician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logician "Logician") who was also from Zhejiang. Sun is another mentor of Chern who is considered a founder of modern Chinese mathematics. In 1932, Chern published his first research article in the Tsinghua University Journal. In the summer of 1934, Chern graduated from Tsinghua with a master's degree, the first ever master's degree in mathematics issued in China.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-Chern_Tianjin-13)

[Yang Chen-Ning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Chen-Ning "Yang Chen-Ning")'s father, [Yang Ko-Chuen](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yang_Ko-Chuen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Yang Ko-Chuen (page does not exist)")[[zh](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%A8%E6%AD%A6%E4%B9%8B "zh:杨武之")], another Chicago-trained professor at Tsinghua, but specializing in [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"), also taught Chern. At the same time, Chern was Chen-Ning Yang's teacher of undergraduate maths at Tsinghua. At Tsinghua, [Hua Luogeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Luogeng "Hua Luogeng"), also a mathematician, was Chern's colleague and roommate.

In 1932, [Wilhelm Blaschke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Blaschke "Wilhelm Blaschke") from the University of Hamburg visited Tsinghua and was impressed by Chern and his research.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-15)

### 1934–1937 in Europe

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiing-Shen_Chern&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 1934–1937 in Europe")]

In 1934, Chern received a scholarship to study in the United States at [Princeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University") and [Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University"), but at the time he wanted to study geometry and Europe was the center for the maths and sciences.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)

He studied with the well-known Austrian geometer [Wilhelm Blaschke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Blaschke "Wilhelm Blaschke").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:0-14) Co-funded by Tsinghua and the Chinese Foundation of Culture and Education, Chern went to continue his study in mathematics in Germany with a scholarship.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:0-14)

Chern studied at the [University of Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hamburg "University of Hamburg") and worked under Blaschke's guidance first on the geometry of [webs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_(differential_geometry) "Web (differential geometry)") then on the [Cartan-Kähler theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan%E2%80%93K%C3%A4hler_theorem "Cartan–Kähler theorem") and [invariant theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_theory "Invariant theory"). He would often eat lunch and chat in German with fellow colleague [Erich Kähler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_K%C3%A4hler "Erich Kähler").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)

He had a three-year scholarship but finished his degree very quickly in two years.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5) He obtained his _Dr. rer.nat._ (_[Doctor of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor\_of\_Science "Doctor of Science")_, which is equivalent to PhD) degree in February, 1936.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:0-14) He wrote his thesis in German, and it was titled _Eine Invariantentheorie der Dreigewebe aus ![Image 3: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538)-dimensionalen Mannigfaltigkeiten im ![Image 4: {\displaystyle R\_{2r}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/c2cff6fedc7414c4da73e408ceb3c95a4fb1e05c)_ (English: _An [invariant theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant\_theory "Invariant theory") of 3-webs of ![Image 5: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538)-dimensional manifolds in ![Image 6: {\displaystyle R\_{2r}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/c2cff6fedc7414c4da73e408ceb3c95a4fb1e05c)_).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-16)

For his third year, Blaschke recommended Chern to study at the [University of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris "University of Paris").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)

It was at this time that he had to choose between the career of algebra in Germany under [Emil Artin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Artin "Emil Artin") and the career of geometry in France under [Élie-Joseph Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan"). Chern was tempted by what he called the "organizational beauty" of Artin's algebra, but in the end, he decided to go to France in September 1936.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:1-17)

He spent one year at the [Sorbonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris "University of Paris") in Paris. There he met Cartan once a fortnight. Chern said:[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)

> Usually the day after [meeting with Cartan] I would get a letter from him. He would say, “After you left, I thought more about your questions...”—he had some results, and some more questions, and so on. He knew all these papers on simple [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group"), [Lie algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra"), all by heart. When you saw him on the street, when a certain issue would come up, he would pull out some old envelope and write something and give you the answer. And sometimes it took me hours or even days to get the same answer... I had to work very hard.

In August 1936, Chern watched the [Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics "1936 Summer Olympics") in Berlin together with Chinese mathematician [Hua Luogeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Luogeng "Hua Luogeng") who paid Chern a brief visit. During that time, Hua was studying at the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge") in Britain.

### 1937–1943: World War II

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiing-Shen_Chern&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 1937–1943: World War II")]

In the summer of 1937, Chern accepted the invitation of [Tsinghua University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University "Tsinghua University") and returned to China.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:1-17) He was promoted to professor of mathematics at Tsinghua.

In late 1937, however, the start of [World War 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_2 "World War 2") forced Tsinghua and other academic institutions to move away from Beijing to west China.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:2-18) Three universities including Peking University, Tsinghua, and Nankai formed the temporary [National Southwestern Associated University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Southwestern_Associated_University "National Southwestern Associated University") (NSAU), and relocated to [Kunming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunming "Kunming"), [Yunnan province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan_province "Yunnan province"). Chern never reached Beijing.

In 1939, Chern married Shih-Ning Cheng, and the couple had two children, Paul and May.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:2-18)

The war prevented Chern from having regular contacts with the outside mathematical community. He wrote to Cartan about his situation, to which Cartan sent him a box of his reprints. Chern spent a considerable amount of time pondering over Cartan's papers and published despite relative isolation. In 1943, his papers gained international recognition, and [Oswald Veblen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Veblen "Oswald Veblen") invited him to the IAS. Because of the war, it took him a week to reach Princeton via US military aircraft.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)

### 1943–1945: visit to the IAS, the Chern theorem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiing-Shen_Chern&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: 1943–1945: visit to the IAS, the Chern theorem")]

In July 1943, Chern went to the United States, and worked at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study "Institute for Advanced Study") (IAS) in [Princeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton,_New_Jersey "Princeton, New Jersey") on [characteristic classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_class "Characteristic class") in differential geometry. There he worked with [André Weil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil "André Weil") on the [Chern–Weil homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern%E2%80%93Weil_homomorphism "Chern–Weil homomorphism") and theory of [characteristic classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_class "Characteristic class"), later to be foundational to the [Atiyah–Singer index theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiyah%E2%80%93Singer_index_theorem "Atiyah–Singer index theorem"). Shortly afterwards, he was invited by [Solomon Lefschetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Lefschetz "Solomon Lefschetz") to be an editor of _[Annals of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals\_of\_Mathematics "Annals of Mathematics")_.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:2-18)

Between 1943 and 1964 he was invited back to the IAS on several occasions.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:6-12) On Chern, Weil wrote:[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-19)

> ... we seemed to share a common attitude towards such subjects, or towards mathematics in general; we were both striving to strike at the root of each question while freeing our minds from preconceived notions about what others might have regarded as the right or the wrong way of dealing with it.

It was at the IAS that his work culminated in his publication of the generalization of the famous [Gauss–Bonnet theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem "Gauss–Bonnet theorem") to higher dimensional [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), now known today as the [Chern theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern%E2%80%93Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem "Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem"). It is widely considered to be his _[magnum opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum\_opus "Magnum opus")_.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:6-12)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:4-2) This period at the IAS was a turning point in his career, having a major impact on mathematics, while fundamentally altering the course of differential geometry and [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:8-3)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:6-12) In a letter to the then director [Frank Aydelotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Aydelotte "Frank Aydelotte"), Chern wrote:[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:6-12)

> “The years 1943–45 will undoubtedly be decisive in my career, and I have profited not only in the mathematical side. I am inclined to think that among the people who have stayed at the Institute, I was one who has profited the most, but the other people may think the same way.”

### 1945–1948: first return to China

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiing-Shen_Chern&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: 1945–1948: first return to China")]

Chern returned to Shanghai in 1945 to help found the Institute of Mathematics of the [Academia Sinica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia_Sinica "Academia Sinica").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:2-18) Chern was the acting president of the institute. [Wu Wenjun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Wenjun "Wu Wenjun") was Chern's graduate student at the institute.

In 1948, Chern was elected one of the first academicians of the Academia Sinica. He was the youngest academician elected (at age 37).

In 1948, he accepted an invitation by Weyl and Veblen to return to [Princeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University") as a professor.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:4-2)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:2-18)

### 1948–1960: return to USA, University of Chicago

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiing-Shen_Chern&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: 1948–1960: return to USA, University of Chicago")]

By the end of 1948, Chern returned to the United States and IAS.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:2-18) He brought his family with him.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:4-2) In 1949, he was invited by Weil to become professor of mathematics at the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago "University of Chicago") and accepted the position as chair of geometry.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:2-18)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:4-2) Coincidentally, [Ernest Preston Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Preston_Lane "Ernest Preston Lane"), former Chair at UChicago Department of Mathematics, was the doctoral advisor of Chern's undergraduate mentor at Tsinghua—[Sun Guangyuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Guangyuan "Sun Guangyuan").

In 1950 he was invited by the [International Congress of Mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians "International Congress of Mathematicians") in [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts "Cambridge, Massachusetts"), Massachusetts. He delivered his address on the _Differential Geometry of Fiber Bundles._ According to [Hans Samelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Samelson "Hans Samelson"), in the lecture Chern introduced the notion of a [connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics) "Connection (mathematics)") on a [principal fiber bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_bundle "Principal bundle"), a generalization of the [Levi-Civita connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_connection "Levi-Civita connection").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:4-2)

In 1960 Chern moved to the [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:2-18) He worked and stayed there until he became an emeritus professor in 1979.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-20) In 1961, Chern became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:4-2) In the same year, he was elected member of the [United States National Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences "United States National Academy of Sciences").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-Chern_Berkeley-21)

> _My election to the US National Academy of Sciences was a prime factor for my US citizenship. In_ 1960 _I was tipped about the possibility of an academy membership. Realizing that a citizenship was necessary, I applied for it. The process was slowed because of my association to [Oppenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer\_security\_hearing "Oppenheimer security hearing"). As a consequence I became a US citizen about a month before my election to academy membership._

In 1964, Chern was a vice president of [American Mathematical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mathematical_Society "American Mathematical Society") (AMS).

Chern retired from UC Berkeley in 1979.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-23) In 1981, together with colleagues [Calvin C. Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_C._Moore "Calvin C. Moore") and [Isadore Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isadore_Singer "Isadore Singer"), he founded the [Mathematical Sciences Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Sciences_Research_Institute "Mathematical Sciences Research Institute") (MSRI) at Berkeley, serving as the director until 1984. Afterward he became the honorary director of the institute. MSRI now is one of the largest and most prominent mathematical institutes in the world.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-Chern_Berkeley-21)[Shing-Tung Yau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau "Shing-Tung Yau") was one of his PhD students during this period, and he later won the [Fields Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal "Fields Medal") in 1982.

During WW2, the US did not have much of a scene in geometry (which is why he chose to study in Germany). Chern was largely responsible in making the US a leading research hub in the field, but he remained modest about his achievements, preferring to say that he is a man of 'small problems' rather than 'big views.'[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)

### Visits to China and bridging East and West

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiing-Shen_Chern&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Visits to China and bridging East and West")]

The [Shanghai Communiqué](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Communiqu%C3%A9 "Shanghai Communiqué") was issued by the United States and the People's Republic of China on February 27, 1972. The relationship between these two nations started to normalize, and American citizens were allowed to visit China. In September 1972, Chern visited Beijing with his wife. During this period of time, Chern visited China 25 times, of which 14 were to his home province Zhejiang.

He was admired and respected by Chinese leaders [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong"), [Deng Xiaoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping "Deng Xiaoping"), and [Jiang Zemin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Zemin "Jiang Zemin"). Because of foreign prestigious scientific support, Chern was able to revive mathematical research in China, producing a generation of influential Chinese mathematicians.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:3-7)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)

Chern founded the Nankai Institute for Mathematics (NKIM) at his alma mater Nankai in Tianjin. The institute was formally established in 1984 and fully opened on October 17, 1985. NKIM was renamed the [Chern Institute of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_Institute_of_Mathematics "Chern Institute of Mathematics") in 2004 after Chern's death. He was treated as a rock star and cultural icon in China.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:3-7) Regarding his influence in China and help raising a generation of new mathematicians, ZALA films says:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:3-7)

> Several world-renowned figures, such as [Gang Tian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Gang "Tian Gang") and [Shing-Tung Yau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau "Shing-Tung Yau"), consider Chern the mentor who helped them study in western countries following the bleak years of the Cultural Revolution, when Chinese universities were closed and academic pursuits suppressed. By the time Chern started returning to China regularly during the 1980s, he had become a celebrity; every school child knew his name, and TV cameras documented his every move whenever he ventured forth from the institute he established at Nankai University.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:3-7)

He has said that back then the main barrier to the growth of math in China was the low pay, which was important considering that after the cultural revolution many families were impoverished. But he has said that given China's size, it naturally has a large talent pool of budding mathematicians.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5) Nobel Prize winner and former student [CN Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Chen-Ning "Yang Chen-Ning") has said[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:9-24)

> Chern and I and many others felt that we have the responsibility to try to create more understanding between the American people and the Chinese people, and... all of us shared the desire to promote more exchanges.

### Final years and death

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiing-Shen_Chern&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Final years and death")]

In 1999, Chern moved from Berkeley back to Tianjin, China permanently until his death.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:3-7)

Based on Chern's advice, a mathematical research center was established in [Taipei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei "Taipei"), Taiwan, whose co-operational partners are [National Taiwan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Taiwan_University "National Taiwan University"), [National Tsing Hua University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Tsing_Hua_University "National Tsing Hua University") and the Academia Sinica Institute of Mathematics.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-Chern_TW-25)

In 2002, he convinced the Chinese government (the PRC) for the first time to host the [International Congress of Mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians "International Congress of Mathematicians") in Beijing.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:9-24) In the speech at the opening ceremony he said:[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:10-26)

> The great Confucius guided China spiritually for over 2,000 years. The main doctrine is “仁” pronounced “ren”, meaning two people, i.e., human relationship. Modern science has been highly competitive. I think an injection of the human element will make our subject more healthy and enjoyable. Let us wish that this congress will open a new era in the future development of math.

Chern was also a director and advisor of the [Center of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_Mathematical_Sciences,_Zhejiang_University "Center of Mathematical Sciences, Zhejiang University") in [Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou "Hangzhou"), Zhejiang.

Chern died of heart failure at [Tianjin Medical University General Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin_Medical_University_General_Hospital "Tianjin Medical University General Hospital") in 2004 at age 93.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-27)

In 2010 [George Csicsery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Csicsery "George Csicsery") featured him in the documentary short _Taking the Long View: The Life of [Shiing-shen Chern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-shen\_Chern "Shiing-shen Chern")_.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-28)

His former residence, Ningyuan (寧園), is still on the campus of Nankai University, maintained as when he was living there. Every year on December 3, Ningyuan is open for visitors in memory of Chern.

Physics Nobel Prize winner (and former student) [C. N. Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Chen-Ning "Yang Chen-Ning") has said that Chern is on par with [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid"), [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss"), [Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann"), [Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan"). Two of Chern's most important contributions that have reshaped the fields of geometry and topology include

*   [Chern-Gauss-Bonnet Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern-Gauss-Bonnet_Theorem "Chern-Gauss-Bonnet Theorem"), the generalization of the famous [Gauss–Bonnet theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem "Gauss–Bonnet theorem") (100 years earlier) to higher dimensional manifolds. Chern considers this his greatest work.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:6-12) Chern proved it by developing his geometric theory of [fiber bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle "Fiber bundle").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)
*   [Chern classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_class "Chern class"), the [complexification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexification "Complexification") of [Pontryagin classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontryagin_class "Pontryagin class"), which have found wide-reaching applications in modern physics, especially [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"), [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), [condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics "Condensed matter physics"), in things like the [magnetic monopole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole "Magnetic monopole"). His main idea was that one should do geometry and topology in the complex case.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)

In 2007, Chern's disciple and IAS director [Phillip Griffiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Griffiths "Phillip Griffiths") edited _Inspired by S. S. Chern: A Memorial Volume in Honor of A Great Mathematician_ (World Scientific Press). Griffiths wrote:[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:6-12)

> “More than any other mathematician, Shiing-Shen Chern defined the subject of [global differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_differential_geometry "Global differential geometry"), a central area in contemporary mathematics. In work that spanned almost seven decades, he helped to shape large areas of modern mathematics... I think that he, more than anyone, was the founder of one of the central areas of modern mathematics.”

His work extended over all the classic fields of [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") as well as more modern ones including [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), [invariant theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_theory "Invariant theory"), [characteristic classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_class "Characteristic class"), [cohomology theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology_theory "Cohomology theory"), [Morse theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_theory "Morse theory"), [Fiber bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle "Fiber bundle"), [Sheaf theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics) "Sheaf (mathematics)"), Cartan's theory of [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form"), etc. His work included areas currently-fashionable, perennial, foundational, and nascent:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:4-2)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:7-29)

*   [Exterior Differential Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_differential_system "Exterior differential system") and [Partial Differential Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation")

He was a follower of [Élie Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan"), working on the '[theory of equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_equivalence "Theory of equivalence")' in his time in China from 1937 to 1943, in relative isolation. In 1954 he published his own treatment of the [pseudogroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudogroup "Pseudogroup") problem that is in effect the touchstone of Cartan's geometric theory. He used the [moving frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_frame "Moving frame") method with success only matched by its inventor; he preferred in [complex manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold") theory to stay with the geometry, rather than follow the [potential theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_theory "Potential theory"). Indeed, one of his books is entitled "Complex Manifolds without Potential Theory".

Along with Cartan, Chern is one of the mathematicians known for popularizing the use of [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form") in math and physics. In his biography, Richard Palais and Chuu-Lian Terng have written[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:7-29)

> _... we would like to point out a unifying theme that runs through all of it: his absolute mastery of the techniques of differential forms and his artful application of these techniques in solving geometric problems. This was a magic mantle, handed down to him by his great teacher, Élie Cartan. It permitted him to explore in depth new mathematical territory where others could not enter. What makes differential forms such an ideal tool for studying local and global geometric properties_ (_and for relating them to each other_) _is their two complementary aspects. They admit, on the one hand, the local operation of exterior differentiation, and on the other the global operation of integration over cochains, and these are related via [Stokes's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27\_theorem "Stokes' theorem")._

While at the IAS, there were two competing methods of geometry: the [tensor calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus "Tensor calculus") and the newer [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form"). Chern wrote:[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)

> I usually like to say that vector fields is like a man, and differential forms is like a woman. Society must have two sexes. If you only have one, it’s not enough.

In the last years of his life, he advocated the study of [Finsler geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finsler_geometry "Finsler geometry"), writing several books and articles on the subject.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-34) His research on Finsler geometry is continued through [Tian Gang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Gang "Tian Gang"), [Paul C. Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_C._Yang "Paul C. Yang"), and [Sun-Yung Alice Chang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-Yung_Alice_Chang "Sun-Yung Alice Chang") of [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University").

He was known for unifying geometric and topological methods to prove stunning new results.

Chern received numerous honors and awards in his life, including:

*   The [asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid")[29552 Chern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/29552_Chern "29552 Chern") is named after him;
*   The [Chern Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_Medal "Chern Medal"), of the [International Mathematical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Union "International Mathematical Union") (IMU);[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-Chern_Medal-41)
*   The Shiing-Shen Chern Prize (陳省身獎), of the Association of Chinese Mathematicians;
*   The [Chern Institute of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_Institute_of_Mathematics "Chern Institute of Mathematics") at [Nankai University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nankai_University "Nankai University"), Tianjin, renamed in 2005 in honor of Chern;
*   The Chern Lectures, and the _Shiing-Shen Chern Chair in Mathematics_, both at the Department of Mathematics, [UC Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Berkeley "UC Berkeley").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-Chern_Lectures-42)

Chern liked to play [contract bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge "Contract bridge"), [Go (game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game) "Go (game)"), read [Wuxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia "Wuxia")-literature of [Jin Yong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong "Jin Yong") and had an interest in [Chinese philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_philosophy "Chinese philosophy") and history.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:9-24)

In 1975, [Chen Ning Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Ning_Yang "Chen Ning Yang") and Chern found out that their research in non-abelian gauge theory and [Fiber bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle "Fiber bundle") describe the same theoretical structure, which showed a surprising connection between physics and mathematics. Therefore, Chern asked Fan Zeng to finish a Chinese painting named Shiing-Shen Chern and Chen Ning Yang for that. The painting was later donated to Nankai University.

A [polyglot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot "Polyglot"), he spoke German, French, English, [Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Chinese "Wu Chinese") and Mandarin Chinese.

> “Whenever we had to go to the chancellor to make some special request, we always took Chern along, and it always worked,” says Berkeley mathematician Rob Kirby. “Somehow he had a presence, a gravitas. There was something about him that people just listened to him, and usually did things his way.”[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:3-7)

In 1979 a Chern Symposium offered him a honorary song in tribute:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:4-2)

> _Hail to Chern! Mathematics Greatest!_
>

### Chern professorships

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiing-Shen_Chern&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Chern professorships")]

[Allyn Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Jackson "Allan Jackson") writes[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:5-5)

> S. S. Chern is the recipient of many international honors, including six honorary doctorates, the U.S. National Medal of Science, Israel’s Wolf Prize, and membership in learned academies around the world. He has also received a more homegrown honor, the dream-turned-reality of an appreciative student of 30 years ago, who grew up in the Bay Area.
> 
> 
> When Robert Uomini would buy his 10 tickets for the California State Lottery, he had an unusual “what if I win?” fantasy: He wanted to endow a professorship to honor S. S. Chern. While an undergraduate at U.C. Berkeley in the 1960s, Uomini was greatly inspired by a differential geometry course he took from Chern. With Chern’s support and encouragement, Uomini entered graduate school at Berkeley and received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1976. Twenty years later, while working as a consultant to Sun Microsystems in Palo Alto, Uomini won $22 million in the state lottery. He could then realize his dream of expressing his gratitude in a concrete way.
> 
> 
> Uomini and his wife set up the [Robert G. Uomini and Louise B. Bidwell Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_G._Uomini_and_Louise_B._Bidwell_Foundation&action=edit&redlink=1 "Robert G. Uomini and Louise B. Bidwell Foundation (page does not exist)") to support an extended visit of an outstanding mathematician to the U.C. Berkeley campus. There have been three [Chern Visiting Professors](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chern_Visiting_Professors&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chern Visiting Professors (page does not exist)") so far: Sir [Michael Atiyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atiyah "Michael Atiyah") of the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge") (1996), [Richard Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_P._Stanley "Richard P. Stanley") of the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") (1997), and [Friedrich Hirzebruch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hirzebruch "Friedrich Hirzebruch") of the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Mathematics "Max Planck Institute for Mathematics") in Bonn (1998). [Jean-Pierre Serre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre "Jean-Pierre Serre") of the Collège de France was the Chern Visiting Professor for 1999. [sic]
> 
> 
> The foundation also helps to support the [Chern Symposium](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chern_Symposium&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chern Symposium (page does not exist)"), a yearly one-day event held in Berkeley during the period when the Chern Visiting Professor is in residence. The March 1998 Symposium was co-sponsored by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and was expanded to run for three days, featuring a dozen speakers.

The MSRI also set up a Chern Professorship, funded by Chern's children May and Paul as well as [James Simons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harris_Simons "James Harris Simons").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-43)

### Biographies on Chern and other memorabilia

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiing-Shen_Chern&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Biographies on Chern and other memorabilia")]

[Abraham Pais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Pais "Abraham Pais") wrote about Chern in his book _Subtle is the Lord._ To paraphrase one passage: the outstanding mathematician Chern has two things to say, 1) I feel very mysterious that in the fields I'm working on ([general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") and [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry")) there is so much more that can be explored; and 2) when talking with [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") (his colleague at the IAS) about his problem of a [Grand Unified Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory "Grand Unified Theory"), I realized the difference between mathematics and physics is at the heart of the journey towards a [theory of everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything "Theory of everything").

[Manfredo Do Carmo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfredo_do_Carmo "Manfredo do Carmo") dedicated his book on _Riemannian Geometry_ to Chern, his PhD advisor.

In Yau's autobiography, he talks a lot about his advisor Chern. In 1982, while on sabbatical at the [New York University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University "New York University")[Courant Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant_Institute_of_Mathematical_Sciences "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences"), he visited Stony Brook to see his friends and former students CN Yang and Simons.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-44)

In 2011 ZALA films published a documentary titled _Taking the Long View: the Life of Shiing-shen Chern_ (山長水遠)_._ In 2013 it was broadcast on US public television.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:3-7) It was compiled with the help of his friends including [Alan Weinstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Weinstein "Alan Weinstein"), [Chuu-Lian Terng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuu-Lian_Terng "Chuu-Lian Terng"), [Calvin C. Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_C._Moore "Calvin C. Moore"), [Marty Shen](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marty_Shen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Marty Shen (page does not exist)"), [Robert Bryant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bryant_(mathematician) "Robert Bryant (mathematician)"), [Robert Uomini](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Uomini&action=edit&redlink=1 "Robert Uomini (page does not exist)"), [Robert Osserman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Osserman "Robert Osserman"), [Hung-Hsi Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hung-Hsi_Wu&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hung-Hsi Wu (page does not exist)"), Rob Kirby, [CN Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Chen-Ning "Yang Chen-Ning"), Paul Chu, [Udo Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Udo_Simon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Udo Simon (page does not exist)"), [Phillip Griffiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Griffiths "Phillip Griffiths"), etc.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:9-24)

Dozens of other biographies have been written on Chern. See the citations for more info.

Chern was an expressive poet as well. On his 60th birthday he wrote a love letter re-affirming his gratitude towards his wife and celebrating their 'beautiful, long, happy, marriage':[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-45)

> Thirty-six years together
> 
> 
> Through times of happiness
> 
> 
> And times of worry too.
> 
> 
> Time’s passage has no mercy.
> 
> 
> We fly the Skies and cross the Oceans
> 
> 
> To fulfill my destiny;
> 
> 
> Raising the children fell
> 
> 
> Entirely on your shoulders.
> 
> 
> How fortunate I am
> 
> 
> To have my works to look back upon,
> 
> 
> I feel regrets you still have chores.
> 
> 
> Growing old together in El Cerrito is a blessing.
> 
> 
> Time passes by,
> 
> 
> And we hardly notice.

Chern has 43 students, including Fields medalist [Shing-Tung Yau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau "Shing-Tung Yau"), Nobel Prize winner [Chen-Ning Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Chen-Ning "Yang Chen-Ning"); and over 1000 descendants.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-46)

His student [James Harris Simons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harris_Simons "James Harris Simons") at [Stony Brook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_University "Stony Brook University") (co-author of the [Chern–Simons theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern%E2%80%93Simons_theory "Chern–Simons theory")) later founded the hedge fund [Renaissance Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies "Renaissance Technologies") and became a billionaire. Simons talks about Chern in his TED talk.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-47)

Two of his students [Manfredo do Carmo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfredo_do_Carmo "Manfredo do Carmo") and [Katsumi Nomizu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsumi_Nomizu "Katsumi Nomizu") have written influential textbooks in geometry.

Former director of the IAS [Phillip Griffiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Griffiths "Phillip Griffiths") wrote[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:6-12)

> [Chern] took great pleasure in getting to know and working with and helping to guide young mathematicians. I was one of them.

His wife, Shih-ning Cheng ([Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 鄭士寧; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): _Zhèng Shìníng_), whom he married in 1939, died in 2000. He also had a daughter, May Chu (陳璞; _Chén Pú_), wife of the physicist [Chu Ching-wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_Ching-wu "Chu Ching-wu"), and a son named Paul (陳伯龍; _Chén Bólóng_). On his wife he writes (also see _Selected Papers)_:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:4-2)

> _I would not conclude this account without mentioning my wife's role in my life and work. Through war and peace and through bad and good times we have shared a life for forty years, which is both simple and rich. If there is credit for my mathematical works, it will be hers as well as mine._

May Chu described her father as an easygoing parent. Paul added that he often saw what was best for you before you realized it.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern#cite_note-:9-24)
