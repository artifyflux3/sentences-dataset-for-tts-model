[ 1 ] Prior to 2013, NERFU had been a local area union ("LAU"), and part of the Northeast Rugby Union (NRU), which is the governing body for three LAU's (New York State Rugby Football Conference (NYSRFC) and Metropolitan New York Rugby Union being the others).

There are currently over 80 active teams and over 3,000 registered players in the New England area.

Mission [ edit ] The mission of the New England Rugby Football Union is to manage, serve, and promote the game of rugby in the New England area, at all levels of play; to assist member teams and participants in their various forms of involvement with the game; to adhere to all the laws of the game; and to encourage and facilitate the involvement of as many people as possible in rugby activities.  NERFU focuses the majority of its attention on serving rugby at the club level, and less on the collegiate and HS levels.

In New England, there are nascent SRBOs in VT, CT and MA.
