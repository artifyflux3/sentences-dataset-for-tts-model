For the astrosphere of the Sun, see Heliosphere .

The Bubble Nebula (NGC 7635), imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope , is seven light years across A stellar-wind bubble is a cavity light-years across filled with hot gas blown into the interstellar medium by the high-velocity (several thousand km/s) stellar wind from a single massive star of type O or B . Weaker stellar winds also blow bubble structures, which are also called astrospheres . The heliosphere blown by the solar wind , within which all the major planets of the Solar System are embedded, is a small example of a stellar-wind bubble.

Stellar-wind bubbles have a two-shock structure.

[ 1 ] The freely-expanding stellar wind hits an inner termination shock, where its kinetic energy is thermalized, producing 10 6 K , X-ray -emitting plasma .  The hot, high-pressure, shocked wind expands, driving a shock into the surrounding interstellar gas. If the surrounding gas is dense enough (number densities n > 0.1 cm − − 3 {\displaystyle n>0.1{\mbox{ cm}}^{-3}} or so), the swept-up gas radiatively cools far faster than the hot interior, forming a thin, relatively dense shell around the hot, shocked wind.
