Canonical coordinates are used in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics . A closely related concept also appears in quantum mechanics ; see the Stone–von Neumann theorem and canonical commutation relations for details.

As Hamiltonian mechanics are generalized by symplectic geometry and canonical transformations are generalized by contact transformations , so the 19th century definition of canonical coordinates in classical mechanics may be generalized to a more abstract 20th century definition of coordinates on the cotangent bundle of a manifold (the mathematical notion of phase space).

Definition in classical mechanics [ edit ] In classical mechanics , canonical coordinates are coordinates q i {\displaystyle q^{i}} and p i {\displaystyle p_{i}} in phase space that are used in the Hamiltonian formalism. The canonical coordinates satisfy the fundamental Poisson bracket relations: { q i , q j } = 0 { p i , p j } = 0 { q i , p j } = δ δ i j {\displaystyle \left\{q^{i},q^{j}\right\}=0\qquad \left\{p_{i},p_{j}\right\}=0\qquad \left\{q^{i},p_{j}\right\}=\delta _{ij}} A typical example of canonical coordinates is for q i {\displaystyle q^{i}} to be the usual Cartesian coordinates , and p i {\displaystyle p_{i}} to be the components of momentum . Hence in general, the p i {\displaystyle p_{i}} coordinates are referred to as "conjugate momenta".

Canonical coordinates can be obtained from the generalized coordinates of the Lagrangian formalism by a Legendre transformation , or from another set of canonical coordinates by a canonical transformation .

Definition on cotangent bundles [ edit ] Canonical coordinates are defined as a special set of coordinates on the cotangent bundle of a manifold . They are usually written as a set of ( q i , p j ) {\displaystyle \left(q^{i},p_{j}\right)} or ( x i , p j ) {\displaystyle \left(x^{i},p_{j}\right)} with the x ' s or q ' s denoting the coordinates on the underlying manifold and the p ' s denoting the conjugate momentum , which are 1-forms in the cotangent bundle at point q in the manifold.

A common definition of canonical coordinates is any set of coordinates on the cotangent bundle that allow the canonical one-form to be written in the form ∑ ∑ i p i d q i {\displaystyle \sum _{i}p_{i}\,\mathrm {d} q^{i}} up to a total differential. A change of coordinates that preserves this form is a canonical transformation ; these are a special case of a symplectomorphism , which are essentially a change of coordinates on a symplectic manifold .

In the following exposition, we assume that the manifolds are real manifolds, so that cotangent vectors acting on tangent vectors produce real numbers.

Formal development [ edit ] Given a manifold Q , a vector field X on Q (a section of the tangent bundle TQ ) can be thought of as a function acting on the cotangent bundle , by the duality between the tangent and cotangent spaces.  That is, define a function P X : T ∗ ∗ Q → → R {\displaystyle P_{X}:T^{*}Q\to \mathbb {R} } such that P X ( q , p ) = p ( X q ) {\displaystyle P_{X}(q,p)=p(X_{q})} holds for all cotangent vectors p in T q ∗ ∗ Q {\displaystyle T_{q}^{*}Q} . Here, X q {\displaystyle X_{q}} is a vector in T q Q {\displaystyle T_{q}Q} , the tangent space to the manifold Q at point q .  The function P X {\displaystyle P_{X}} is called the momentum function corresponding to X .

In local coordinates , the vector field X at point q may be written as X q = ∑ ∑ i X i ( q ) ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ q i {\displaystyle X_{q}=\sum _{i}X^{i}(q){\frac {\partial }{\partial q^{i}}}} where the ∂ ∂ / ∂ ∂ q i {\displaystyle \partial /\partial q^{i}} are the coordinate frame on TQ . The conjugate momentum then has the expression P X ( q , p ) = ∑ ∑ i X i ( q ) p i {\displaystyle P_{X}(q,p)=\sum _{i}X^{i}(q)\;p_{i}} where the p i {\displaystyle p_{i}} are defined as the momentum functions corresponding to the vectors ∂ ∂ / ∂ ∂ q i {\displaystyle \partial /\partial q^{i}} : p i = P ∂ ∂ / ∂ ∂ q i {\displaystyle p_{i}=P_{\partial /\partial q^{i}}} The q i {\displaystyle q^{i}} together with the p j {\displaystyle p_{j}} together form a coordinate system on the cotangent bundle T ∗ ∗ Q {\displaystyle T^{*}Q} ; these coordinates are called the canonical coordinates .

Generalized coordinates [ edit ] In Lagrangian mechanics , a different set of coordinates are used, called the generalized coordinates .  These are commonly denoted as ( q i , q ˙ ˙ i ) {\displaystyle \left(q^{i},{\dot {q}}^{i}\right)} with q i {\displaystyle q^{i}} called the generalized position and q ˙ ˙ i {\displaystyle {\dot {q}}^{i}} the generalized velocity .  When a Hamiltonian is defined  on the cotangent bundle, then the generalized coordinates are related to the canonical coordinates by means of the Hamilton–Jacobi equations .
