Bra–ket notation The bra–ket notation is a way to represent the states and operators of a system by angle brackets and vertical bars, for example, | α α ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\alpha \rangle } and | α α ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ β β | {\displaystyle |\alpha \rangle \langle \beta |} .

Density matrix Physically, the density matrix is a way to represent pure states and mixed states. The density matrix of pure state whose ket is | α α ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\alpha \rangle } is | α α ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ α α | {\displaystyle |\alpha \rangle \langle \alpha |} .

Normalized wave function A wave function | a ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |a\rangle } is said to be normalized if ⟨ ⟨ a | a ⟩ ⟩ = 1 {\displaystyle \langle a|a\rangle =1} .

Pure state A state which can be represented as a wave function / ket in Hilbert space / solution of Schrödinger equation is called pure state. See "mixed state".

Quantum numbers a way of representing a state by several numbers, which corresponds to a complete set of commuting observables .

A common example of quantum numbers is the possible state of an electron in a central potential: ( n , ℓ ℓ , m , s ) {\displaystyle (n,\ell ,m,s)} , which corresponds to the eigenstate of observables H {\displaystyle H} (in terms of r {\displaystyle r} ), L {\displaystyle L} (magnitude of angular momentum), L z {\displaystyle L_{z}} (angular momentum in z {\displaystyle z} -direction), and S z {\displaystyle S_{z}} .

Tensor product of Hilbert space When we are considering the total system as a composite system of two subsystems A and B, the wave functions of the composite system are in a Hilbert space H A ⊗ ⊗ H B {\displaystyle H_{A}\otimes H_{B}} , if the Hilbert space of the wave functions for A and B are H A {\displaystyle H_{A}} and H B {\displaystyle H_{B}} respectively.

Total wave function of a particle For single-particle system, the total wave function Ψ Ψ {\displaystyle \Psi } of a particle can be expressed as a product of spatial wave function and the spinor. The total wave functions are in the tensor product space of the Hilbert space of the spatial part (which is spanned by the position eigenstates) and the Hilbert space for the spin.

Wave function The word "wave function" could mean one of following: A vector in Hilbert space which can represent a state; synonymous to "ket" or "state vector".

Dynamics [ edit ] Main article: Schrödinger equation Degeneracy See "degenerate energy level".

Degenerate energy level If the energy of different state (wave functions which are not scalar multiple of each other) is the same, the energy level is called degenerate.

There is no degeneracy in a 1D system.

Energy spectrum The energy spectrum refers to the possible energy of a system.

For bound system (bound states), the energy spectrum is discrete; for unbound system (scattering states), the energy spectrum is continuous.

related mathematical topics: Sturm–Liouville equation Hamiltonian H ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} The operator represents the total energy of the system.

Schrödinger equation The Schrödinger equation relates the Hamiltonian operator acting on a wave function to its time evolution (Equation 1 ): i ℏ ℏ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ t | α α ⟩ ⟩ = H ^ ^ | α α ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}|\alpha \rangle ={\hat {H}}|\alpha \rangle } Equation (1) is sometimes called "Time-Dependent Schrödinger equation" (TDSE).

Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE) A modification of the Time-Dependent Schrödinger equation as an eigenvalue problem. The solutions are energy eigenstates of the system (Equation 2 ): E | α α ⟩ ⟩ = H ^ ^ | α α ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle E|\alpha \rangle ={\hat {H}}|\alpha \rangle } Dynamics related to single particle in a potential / other spatial properties [ edit ] In this situation, the SE is given by the form i ℏ ℏ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ t Ψ Ψ α α ( r , t ) = H ^ ^ Ψ Ψ α α ( r , t ) = ( − − ℏ ℏ 2 2 m ∇ ∇ 2 + V ( r ) ) Ψ Ψ α α ( r , t ) = − − ℏ ℏ 2 2 m ∇ ∇ 2 Ψ Ψ α α ( r , t ) + V ( r ) Ψ Ψ α α ( r , t ) {\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\Psi _{\alpha }(\mathbf {r} ,\,t)={\hat {H}}\Psi _{\alpha }(\mathbf {r} ,\,t)=\left(-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\nabla ^{2}+V(\mathbf {r} )\right)\Psi _{\alpha }(\mathbf {r} ,\,t)=-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\nabla ^{2}\Psi _{\alpha }(\mathbf {r} ,\,t)+V(\mathbf {r} )\Psi _{\alpha }(\mathbf {r} ,\,t)} It can be derived from (1) by considering Ψ Ψ α α ( x , t ) := ⟨ ⟨ x | α α ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \Psi _{\alpha }(x,t):=\langle x|\alpha \rangle } and H ^ ^ := − − ℏ ℏ 2 2 m ∇ ∇ 2 + V ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {H}}:=-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\nabla ^{2}+{\hat {V}}} Bound state A state is called bound state if its position probability density at infinite tends to zero for all the time. Roughly speaking, we can expect to find the particle(s) in a finite size region with certain probability. More precisely, | ψ ψ ( r , t ) | 2 → → 0 {\displaystyle |\psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)|^{2}\to 0} when | r | → → + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle |\mathbf {r} |\to +\infty } , for all t > 0 {\displaystyle t>0} .

There is a criterion in terms of energy: Let E {\displaystyle E} be the expectation energy of the state. It is a bound state if and only if E < min ⁡ ⁡ { V ( r → → − − ∞ ∞ ) , V ( r → → + ∞ ∞ ) } {\displaystyle E<\operatorname {min} \{V(r\to -\infty ),V(r\to +\infty )\}} .

Position representation and momentum representation Position representation of a wave function Ψ Ψ α α ( x , t ) := ⟨ ⟨ x | α α ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \Psi _{\alpha }(x,t):=\langle x|\alpha \rangle } , momentum representation of a wave function Ψ Ψ ~ ~ α α ( p , t ) := ⟨ ⟨ p | α α ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle {\tilde {\Psi }}_{\alpha }(p,t):=\langle p|\alpha \rangle } ; where | x ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |x\rangle } is the position eigenstate and | p ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |p\rangle } the momentum eigenstate respectively.

The two representations are linked by Fourier transform .

Probability amplitude A probability amplitude is of the form ⟨ ⟨ α α | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle \alpha |\psi \rangle } .

Probability current Having the metaphor of probability density as mass density, then probability current J {\displaystyle J} is the current: J ( x , t ) = i ℏ ℏ 2 m ( ψ ψ ∂ ∂ ψ ψ ∗ ∗ ∂ ∂ x − − ∂ ∂ ψ ψ ∂ ∂ x ψ ψ ) {\displaystyle J(x,t)={\frac {i\hbar }{2m}}\left(\psi {\frac {\partial \psi ^{*}}{\partial x}}-{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial x}}\psi \right)} The probability current and probability density together satisfy the continuity equation : ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ t | ψ ψ ( x , t ) | 2 + ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ J ( x , t ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}|\psi (x,t)|^{2}+\nabla \cdot \mathbf {J} (x,t)=0} Probability density Given the wave function of a particle, | ψ ψ ( x , t ) | 2 {\displaystyle |\psi (x,t)|^{2}} is the probability density at position x {\displaystyle x} and time t {\displaystyle t} .

| ψ ψ ( x 0 , t ) | 2 d x {\displaystyle |\psi (x_{0},t)|^{2}\,dx} means the probability of finding the particle near x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} .

Scattering state The wave function of scattering state can be understood as a propagating wave. See also "bound state".

There is a criterion in terms of energy: Let E {\displaystyle E} be the expectation energy of the state. It is a scattering state if and only if E > min ⁡ ⁡ { V ( r → → − − ∞ ∞ ) , V ( r → → + ∞ ∞ ) } {\displaystyle E>\operatorname {min} \{V(r\to -\infty ),V(r\to +\infty )\}} .

Square-integrable Square-integrable is a necessary condition for a function being the position/momentum representation of a wave function of a bound state of the system.

Given the position representation Ψ Ψ ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \Psi (x,t)} of a state vector of a wave function, square-integrable means: 1D case: ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ + ∞ ∞ | Ψ Ψ ( x , t ) | 2 d x < + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }|\Psi (x,t)|^{2}\,dx<+\infty } .

3D case: ∫ ∫ V | Ψ Ψ ( r , t ) | 2 d V < + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \int _{V}|\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)|^{2}\,dV<+\infty } .

Stationary state A stationary state of a bound system is an eigenstate of Hamiltonian operator. Classically, it corresponds to standing wave. It is equivalent to the following things: [ nb 2 ] an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian operator an eigenfunction of Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation a state of definite energy a state which "every expectation value is constant in time" a state whose probability density ( | ψ ψ ( x , t ) | 2 {\displaystyle |\psi (x,t)|^{2}} ) does not change with respect to time, i.e.

d d t | Ψ Ψ ( x , t ) | 2 = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}|\Psi (x,t)|^{2}=0} Measurement postulates [ edit ] Main article: Measurement in quantum mechanics Born's rule The probability of the state | α α ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\alpha \rangle } collapse to an eigenstate | k ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |k\rangle } of an observable is given by | ⟨ ⟨ k | α α ⟩ ⟩ | 2 {\displaystyle |\langle k|\alpha \rangle |^{2}} .

Collapse "Collapse" means the sudden process which the state of the system will "suddenly" change to an eigenstate of the observable during measurement.

Eigenstates An eigenstate of an operator A {\displaystyle A} is a vector satisfied the eigenvalue equation: A | α α ⟩ ⟩ = c | α α ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle A|\alpha \rangle =c|\alpha \rangle } , where c {\displaystyle c} is a scalar.

Usually, in bra–ket notation, the eigenstate will be represented by its corresponding eigenvalue if the corresponding observable is understood.

Expectation value The expectation value ⟨ ⟨ M ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle M\rangle } of the observable M with respect to a state | α α {\displaystyle |\alpha } is the average outcome of measuring M {\displaystyle M} with respect to an ensemble of state | α α {\displaystyle |\alpha } .

⟨ ⟨ M ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle M\rangle } can be calculated by: ⟨ ⟨ M ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ α α | M | α α ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle \langle M\rangle =\langle \alpha |M|\alpha \rangle .} If the state is given by a density matrix ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } , ⟨ ⟨ M ⟩ ⟩ = Tr ⁡ ⁡ ( M ρ ρ ) {\displaystyle \langle M\rangle =\operatorname {Tr} (M\rho )} .

Hermitian operator An operator satisfying A = A † † {\displaystyle A=A^{\dagger }} .

Equivalently, ⟨ ⟨ α α | A | α α ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ α α | A † † | α α ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle \alpha |A|\alpha \rangle =\langle \alpha |A^{\dagger }|\alpha \rangle } for all allowable wave function | α α ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\alpha \rangle } .

Observable Mathematically, it is represented by a Hermitian operator.

Indistinguishable particles [ edit ] Exchange Intrinsically identical particles If the intrinsic properties (properties that can be measured but are independent of the quantum state, e.g. charge, total spin, mass) of two particles are the same, they are said to be (intrinsically) identical.

Indistinguishable particles If a system shows measurable differences when one of its particles is replaced by another particle, these two particles are called distinguishable.

Bosons Bosons are particles with integer spin ( s = 0, 1, 2, ... ). They can either be elementary (like photons ) or composite (such as mesons , nuclei or even atoms). There are five known elementary bosons: the four force carrying gauge bosons γ (photon), g ( gluon ), Z ( Z boson ) and W ( W boson ), as well as the Higgs boson .

Fermions Fermions are particles with half-integer spin ( s = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ... ). Like bosons, they can be elementary or composite particles. There are two types of elementary fermions: quarks and leptons , which are the main constituents of ordinary matter.
