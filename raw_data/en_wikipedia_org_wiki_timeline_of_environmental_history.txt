Pre-Holocene (1.5 Ma) [ edit ] The time from roughly 15,000 to 5,000 BCE was a time of transition, and swift and extensive environmental change, as the planet was moving from an Ice age , towards an interstadial (warm period).

Sea levels rose dramatically (and are continuing to do so ), land that was depressed by glaciers began lifting up again , forests and deserts expanded, and the climate gradually became more modern. In the process of warming up, the planet saw several "cold snaps" and "warm snaps", such as the Older Dryas and the Holocene climatic optimum , as well as heavier precipitation. In addition, the Pleistocene megafauna became extinct due to environmental and evolutionary pressures from the changing climate. This marked the end of the Quaternary extinction event , which was continued into the modern era by humans . The time around 11,700 years ago (9,700 BC) is widely considered to be the end of the old age ( Pleistocene , Paleolithic , Stone Age , Wisconsin Ice Age ), and the beginning of the modern world as we know it.

Pleistocene ends and Holocene begins. Large amounts of previously glaciated land become habitable again. Some sources place the Younger Dryas as stretching from 10,800 BC to 9500 BC. This cool period was possibly caused by a shutdown of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation ( Gulf Stream / Jet Stream ), due to flooding from Lake Agassiz as it reformed.

6th millennium BC [ edit ] Year(s) Event(s) Start End c. 5600 BC According to the Black Sea deluge theory , the Black Sea floods with salt water. Some 3000 cubic miles (12,500 km 3 ) of salt water is added, significantly expanding it and transforming it from a fresh-water landlocked lake into a salt water sea.

c. 5500 BC Beginning of the desertification of north Africa, which ultimately leads to the formation of the Sahara desert from land that was previously savannah , though it remains wetter than today. It's possible this process pushed people in the area into migrating to the region of the Nile in the east, thereby laying the groundwork for the rise of Egyptian civilization .

The hallmarks of Ancient Egypt ( art , architecture , religion ) all formed during this period.  This is widely assumed to be the time and place of the first writing system, the Egyptian hieroglyphs (date is disputed, some claim they were used as far back as 3200 BC, while others believe they weren't invented until the 28th century BC).

between 3000 BC and 2800 BC 30 km/19 mi-wide Burckle Crater is formed in Indian Ocean from a possible meteor or comet impact.

3rd millennium BC [ edit ] Year(s) Event(s) Start End c. 30th century BC c. 3000 BC: Stonehenge begins to be built.  In its first version, it consists of a circular ditch and bank, with 56 wooden posts. ( National Geographic , June 2008).

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] 2650 BC Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh describes vast tracts of cedar forests in what is now southern Iraq . Gilgamesh defies the gods and cuts down the forest, and in return the gods say they will curse Sumer with fire (or possibly drought ). By 2100 BC, soil erosion and salt buildup have devastated agriculture. One Sumerian wrote that the "earth turned white." Civilization moved north to Babylonia and Assyria . Again, deforestation becomes a factor in the rise and subsequent fall of these civilizations.

2500 BC Sahara becomes fully desiccated, and conditions become largely identical to those of today.

Desiccation had been proceeding from 7500 to 6000 BC, as a result of the shift in the West African tropical monsoon belt southwards from the Sahel , and intensified by the 5.9 kiloyear event . Subsequent rates of evaporation in the region led to a drying of the Sahara, as shown by the drop in water levels in Lake Chad .

Tehenu of the Sahara attempt to enter into Egypt, and there is evidence of a Nile drought in the pyramid of Unas .

2300 BC Neolithic period ends in China.

2200 BC Beginning of a severe centennial-scale drought in northern Africa, southwestern Asia and midcontinental North America, which very likely caused the collapse of the Old Kingdom in Egypt as well as the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia .  This coincides with the transition from the Subboreal period to the subatlantic period .

2nd millennium BC [ edit ] Year(s) Event(s) Start End c. 2000 BC c. 1000 BC Continued mountain formation in the Himalayas contributes to the drying up of the Sarasvati River and the desertification of the Thar Region .  This contributes to the decline of the Harappan civilization .

1900 BC The Atra-Hasis Epic describes Babylonian flood, with warnings of the consequences of human overpopulation .

Around 1600 BC Minoan eruption destroys much of Santorini island, but does not destroy (contrary to what was previously believed) the Minoan civilization on Crete .

[ 9 ] This may have inspired the legend of Atlantis.

1450 BC Minoan civilization in the Mediterranean declines, but scholars are divided on the cause.  Possibly a volcanic eruption was the source of the catastrophe (see Minoan eruption ). On the other hand, gradual deforestation may have led to materials shortages in manufacturing and shipping.  Loss of timber and subsequent deterioration of its land was probably a factor in the decline of Minoan power in the late Bronze Age , according to John Perlin in A Forest Journey .

1206 BC 1187 BC Evidence of major droughts in the Eastern Mediterranean.  Hittite and Ugarit records show requests for grain were sent to Egypt, probably during the reign of Pharaoh Merenptah .  Carpenter has suggested that droughts of equal severity to those of the 1950s in Greece, would have been sufficient to cause the Late Bronze Age collapse .  The cause may have been a temporary diversion of winter storms north of the Pyrenees and Alps.  Central Europe experienced generally wetter conditions, while those in the Eastern Mediterranean were substantially drier.  There seems to have been a general abandonment of peasant subsistence agriculture in favour of nomadic pastoralism in Central Anatolia, Syria and northern Mesopotamia, Palestine, the Sinai and NW Arabia.

Qin established some of the world's first environmental protection laws.

[ 11 ] c. 225 BC The Sub-Atlantic period began about 225 BC (estimated on the basis of radiocarbon dating) and has been characterized by increased rainfall, cooler and more humid climates, and the dominance of beech forests.  The fauna of the Sub-Atlantic is essentially modern although severely depleted by human activities.  The Sub-Atlantic is correlated with pollen zone IX; sea levels have been generally regressive during this time interval, though North America is an exception.
