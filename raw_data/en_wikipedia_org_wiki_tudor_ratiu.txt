Education [ edit ] Rațiu was born in Timișoara .

[ 1 ] His father, Mircea Ratiu, an engineer, was the younger brother of Ion Rațiu , a well-known Romanian politician, while his mother, Rodica Bucur, was a piano professor at the Conservatory of Music in Timișoara.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Ratiu did his undergraduate studies at the Politehnica University of Timișoara , completing his B.Sc.

in 1973 and his M.S.

in 1974.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] After moving to the United States, he completed his Ph.D.

degree at the University of California, Berkeley in 1980; his dissertation, written under the supervision of Jerrold E. Marsden , was titled Euler-Poisson Equations on Lie Algebras .

[ 5 ] Career [ edit ] From 1980 to 1983 Ratiu was a T. H. Hildebrandt Research Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan , after which he became an Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of Arizona . In 1987 he moved to the University of California, Santa Cruz , where he became a Professor of Mathematics in 1988.

[ 6 ] In 1998 Ratiu moved to the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne , where he was a professor until 2015.

[ 4 ] In 2014–15, he was a Professor of Mathematics at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Russia. Since 2016 he is a professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China .

[ 4 ] [ 7 ] Ratiu received a Sloan Research Fellowship in 1980, [ 4 ] and he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012.

[ 8 ] In 2003, he was awarded the Order of the Star of Romania , Commander rank.
