Established in 1575 by William, Prince of Orange as a Protestant institution, [ 10 ] it holds the distinction of being the oldest university in the Netherlands of today.

[ a ] During the Dutch Golden Age scholars from around Europe were attracted to the Dutch Republic for its climate of intellectual tolerance. Individuals such as René Descartes , Rembrandt , Christiaan Huygens , Hugo Grotius , Benedictus Spinoza , and later Baron d'Holbach were active in Leiden and environs.

The university has seven academic faculties and over fifty subject departments, housing more than forty national and international research institutes. Its historical primary campus consists of several buildings spread over Leiden, while a second campus located in The Hague houses a liberal arts college ( Leiden University College The Hague ) and several of its faculties. It is a member of the Coimbra Group , the Europaeum , and a founding member of the League of European Research Universities .

The university has produced twenty-six Spinoza Prize Laureates and sixteen Nobel Laureates . Members of the Dutch royal family such as Queen Juliana , Queen Beatrix , and King Willem-Alexander are alumni, and ten prime ministers of the Netherlands including Mark Rutte . US president John Quincy Adams also studied at the university.

[ 11 ] History [ edit ] Foundation and early history [ edit ] William the Silent , founder of the university, in the 16th century.

The academy building of Leiden University in 1614.

Leiden anatomical theatre In 1575, the emerging Dutch Republic did not have universities in its northern heartland. The only other university in the Habsburg Netherlands was the University of Leuven located in an area under firm Spanish control.

Prince William founded Leiden University to give the Northern Netherlands an institution that could educate its citizens in religion and provide the government with educated men in all fields.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] It is said the choice fell on Leiden as a reward for the heroic defence of Leiden against Spanish attacks in 1574. The name of Philip II of Spain , William's adversary, appears on the official foundation certificate as he was still the de jure count of Holland .

[ 14 ] Philip II forbade all his subjects to study in Leiden.

The new institution was initially located in the Convent of Saint Barbara, then moved to the Faliede Bagijn Church in 1577 (now the location of the university museum) and in 1581 to a former convent of Cistercian nuns , a site which it still occupies, though the original building was destroyed by a fire in 1616.

[ 12 ] Leiden University's reputation was created in part by the presence of scholars such as Justus Lipsius , Joseph Scaliger , Franciscus Gomarus , Hugo Grotius , Jacobus Arminius , Daniel Heinsius , and Gerhard Johann Vossius within fifty years of its founding. By the 1640s, over five hundred students were enrolled from all across Europe, making it the largest Protestant university.

[ 15 ] [ 13 ] Baruch Spinoza discovered Descartes's work partly at Leiden University, [ 16 ] which he visited for periods of study multiple times.

[ 17 ] In the 18th century, Jacobus Gronovius , Herman Boerhaave , Tiberius Hemsterhuis , and David Ruhnken were among the renowned academics of the university.

In 1896, the Zeeman effect was discovered at the institution by Pieter Zeeman and shortly afterward explained by Hendrik Antoon Lorentz .

[ 18 ] In the world's first university low-temperature laboratory, Professor Heike Kamerlingh Onnes achieved a temperature only one degree above absolute zero . In 1908, he was also the first to succeed in liquifying helium and has played a role in the discovery of superconductivity in metals.

[ 19 ] Modern day [ edit ] Leiden University Library in 1610 The University Library has more than 5.2 million books and fifty thousand journals. It also has collections of Western and Oriental manuscripts , printed books, archives, prints, drawings, photographs, maps, and atlases . It houses the world's largest collections on Indonesia and the Caribbean , collected by the Scaliger Institute which studies various aspects of knowledge transmissions and ideas through texts and images from antiquity to the present day. In 2005, the manuscript of Einstein on the quantum theory of the monatomic ideal gas (the Einstein-Bose condensation ) was discovered in one of Leiden's libraries.

[ 20 ] Partnerships [ edit ] In 2012 Leiden entered into a strategic alliance with Delft University of Technology and Erasmus University Rotterdam for the universities to increase the quality of their research and teaching. The university is also the unofficial home of the Bilderberg Group , a meeting of high-level political and economic figures from North America and Europe. Leiden University partnered with Duke University School of Law starting in 2017 to run a joint summer program on global and transnational law from its Hague campus.

Location and buildings [ edit ] The academy building of Leiden University in modern days The university has no central campus; its buildings are spread over the city. Some buildings, like the Gravensteen, are very old, while Van Steenis, Lipsius and Gorlaeus are much more modern.

[ 21 ] Among the institutions affiliated with the university are The KITLV or Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (founded in 1851), the Leiden Observatory 1633; the Natural History Museum, with a very complete anatomical cabinet; the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden (National Museum of Antiquities), with especially valuable Egyptian and Indian departments; a museum of Dutch antiquities from the earliest times; and three ethnographical museums, of which the nucleus was Philipp Franz von Siebold 's Japanese collections. The anatomical and pathological laboratories of the university are modern, and the museums of geology and mineralogy have been restored.

[ citation needed ] The Hortus Botanicus (botanical garden) is the oldest botanical garden in the Netherlands and one of the oldest in the world. Plants from all over the world have been carefully cultivated here by experts for more than four centuries. The Clusius garden (a reconstruction), the 18th-century Orangery with its monumental tub plants, the rare collection of historical trees hundreds of years old, the Japanese Siebold Memorial Museum symbolising the historical link between East and West, the tropical greenhouses with their world-class plant collections, and the central square and Conservatory exhibiting exotic plants from South Africa and southern Europe.

[ citation needed ] Zweetkamertje [ edit ] The "Sweat Room" ( Dutch : Zweetkamertje ) is a small chamber in the university's Academy Building, traditionally used by doctoral candidates awaiting the results of their PhD defenses. The room is renowned for its walls covered with the signatures of graduates, including notable figures such as Winston Churchill , Nelson Mandela , and members of the Dutch royal family.

[ 22 ] Originally serving as a meeting room for university curators, the Zweetkamertje became associated with doctoral examinations in the 18th century. Candidates would wait in this room before defending their dissertations, often experiencing considerable anxiety, hence the name. Over time, it became customary for successful candidates to inscribe their names on the walls as a rite of passage.

[ 23 ] The tradition of signing the Zweetkamertje walls is a cherished aspect of Leiden University's heritage. The room features thousands of signatures, including those of honorary doctorate recipients. In 2014, a crowdfunding campaign successfully raised funds to restore the room's deteriorating plaster, ensuring the preservation of this unique historical record.

[ 24 ] Campus The Hague [ edit ] A lecture hall in the Leiden University campus in the Hague.

In 1998, the university has expanded to The Hague which has become home to Campus The Hague , with six of the seven faculties represented and exclusive home to the Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs, International Studies and Leiden University College The Hague , a liberal arts and sciences college. Here, the university offers academic courses in the fields of law, political science, public administration and medicine. It occupied a number of buildings in the centre of the city, including a college building at Lange Voorhout , before moving into the new 'Wijnhaven' building on Turfmarkt in 2016.

The Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs was established in 2011, together with the University College, and one of the largest programmes of the Faculty of Humanities, International Studies.

Since 2017 Leiden University Medical Center also has a branch at Campus The Hague.

Organisation [ edit ] The Leiden University Medical Centre Entrance of Gorlaeus building of the Faculty of Science Huygens and Oort Buildings of the Faculty of Science Faculty of Law, in the building that once housed Heike Kamerlingh Onnes' laboratory The university is divided into seven major faculties which offer approximately 50 undergraduate degree programmes and over 100 graduate programmes.

Archaeology Governance and Global Affairs Humanities Law Medicine / LUMC Science Social and Behavioural sciences Academic profile [ edit ] Undergraduate studies [ edit ] Most of the university's departments offer their degree programme(s). Undergraduate programmes lead to either a B.A., B.Sc., or LL.B.

degree. Other degrees, such as the B.Eng.

or B.F.A.

, are not awarded at Leiden University.

Graduate studies [ edit ] Students can choose from a range of graduate programmes. Most of the above-mentioned undergraduate programmes can be continued with either a general or a specialised graduate program. Leiden University offers more than 100 graduate programs leading to either MA , MSc , MPhil , or LLM degrees . The MPhil is the most advanced graduate degree and is awarded by select university departments (mostly in the fields of Arts, Social Sciences, Archeology, Philosophy, and Theology). Admission to these programmes is highly selective and primarily aimed at those students opting for an academic career or before going into law or medicine. Traditionally, the MPhil degree enabled its holder to teach at the university levels as an associate professor.

In addition, most departments, affiliated (research) institutes, or faculties offer doctorate programmes or positions, leading to the Ph.D. degree. Most of the Ph.D. programmes offered by the university are concentrated in several research schools or institutes.

Research schools and affiliated institutes [ edit ] Research building of the Leiden University Medical Centre Leiden University has more than 50 research and graduate schools and institutes. Some of them are fully affiliated with one faculty of the university, while others are interfaculty institutes or interuniversity institutes.
