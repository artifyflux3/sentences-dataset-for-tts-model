Left to right: Peregrine by Astrobotic Technology , Nova-C by Intuitive Machines , and Z-01 by OrbitBeyond .

Type of project Aerospace Products Proposed: Artemis-7 , McCandless Lunar Lander , XL-1 , MX-1, MX-2, MX-5, MX-9, SERIES-2 Current: Peregrine , Griffin , Nova-C , Blue Ghost , APEX 1.0 Owner NASA Country United States Established 2018 ; 7 years ago ( 2018 ) Status Active Website NASA.gov/commercial-lunar-payload-services Commercial Lunar Payload Services ( CLPS ) is a NASA program to hire companies to send small robotic landers and rovers to the Moon . Most landing sites are near the lunar south pole [ 1 ] [ 2 ] where they will scout for lunar resources , test in situ resource utilization (ISRU) concepts, and perform lunar science to support the Artemis lunar program . CLPS is intended to buy end-to-end payload services between Earth and the lunar surface using fixed-price contracts .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The program achieved the first landing on the Moon by a commercial company in history with the IM-1 mission in 2024. The program was extended to add support for large payloads starting after 2025.

The CLPS program is run by NASA's Science Mission Directorate along with the Human Exploration and Operations and Space Technology Mission directorates. NASA expects the contractors to provide all activities necessary to safely integrate, accommodate, transport, and operate NASA payloads, including launch vehicles, lunar lander spacecraft, lunar surface systems, Earth re-entry vehicles and associated resources.

[ 4 ] Eight missions have been contracted under the program (not counting one mission contract that was revoked after awarding and another mission contract that was cancelled after the contracted company went bankrupt).

History [ edit ] NASA has been planning the exploration and use of natural lunar resources for many years. A variety of exploration, science, and technology objectives that could be addressed by regularly sending instruments, experiments and other small payloads to the Moon have been identified by NASA.

[ 3 ] When the concept study on the Resource Prospector rover was cancelled in April 2018, NASA officials explained that lunar surface exploration would continue in the future, but using commercial lander services under a new CLPS program.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Later that April, NASA announced the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program as the first step in the solicitation for flights to the Moon.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 7 ] In April 2018, CLPS issued a Draft Request for Proposal, [ 4 ] and in September 2018 the CLPS Request for Proposal was issued as a formal solicitation.

[ 8 ] On November 29, 2018, NASA announced the first nine companies that would be allowed to bid on contracts, [ 9 ] which were indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts with a combined maximum contract value of $2.6 billion over ten years.

[ 9 ] In February 2018, NASA issued a solicitation for Lunar Surface Instrument and Technology Payloads that may become CLPS customers. Proposals were due by November 2018 and January 17, 2019. NASA makes annual calls for proposals.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] On May 31, 2019, NASA announced a list of awards, to Astrobotic , of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, $79.5 million; Intuitive Machines , of Houston, Texas, $77 million; and OrbitBeyond , $97 million; to launch their Moon landers.

[ 12 ] However, Orbit Beyond dropped out in July 2019 (with NASA acknowledging termination of contract on July 29, 2019), but remained able to bid on future missions.

[ 13 ] In January 2024, NASA reported the initial award to Astrobotic had grown to $108 million, to carry five NASA science payloads instead of the initial number of 14, and that the contract value for Intuitive Machines had increased to $118 million.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] On July 1, 2019, a $5.6 million contract was awarded to Astrobotic and its partner Carnegie Mellon University to develop MoonRanger , a 13 kg (29 lb) rover to carry payloads on the Moon for NASA's CLPS.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] Launch was envisioned for either 2021 or 2022.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] The rover would carry science payloads yet to be determined and developed by other providers, that would focus on scouting and creating 3D maps of a polar region for signs of water ice or lunar pits for entrances to Moon caves.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] The rover would operate mostly autonomously for up to one week.

[ 19 ] On November 18, 2019, NASA added five contractors to the group of companies eligible to bid to deliver large payloads to the lunar surface under the CLPS program: Blue Origin , Ceres Robotics , Sierra Nevada Corporation , SpaceX , and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems .

[ 20 ] On April 8, 2020, NASA announced it had awarded the fourth (after Astrobotic's, Intuitive Machines' and OrbitBeyond's awards) CLPS contract for Masten Space Systems . The contract, worth $75.9 million, was for Masten's XL-1 lunar lander to deliver payloads from NASA and other customers to the south pole of the Moon in late 2022.

[ 21 ] On June 11, 2020, NASA awarded Astrobotic Technology its second CLPS contract. The mission would be the first flight of Astrobotic's larger Griffin lander.

[ 22 ] Griffin weighs 450 kg. The award was for $199.5 million [ 22 ] which covers Griffin lander and launch costs. The mission was scheduled for November 2024.

[ 23 ] On October 16, 2020, [ 24 ] NASA awarded Intuitive Machines their second CLPS contract for Intuitive Machines Mission 2 (IM-2). The contract was worth approximately $47 million. Using a Nova-C lander, the mission would land a drill ( PRIME-1 ) combined with a mass spectrometer near the Lunar south pole , to attempt harvesting ice from below the surface. The mission was scheduled for December 2022, using a Falcon 9 rocket.

On February 4, 2021, NASA awarded a CLPS contract to Firefly Aerospace , of Cedar Park, Texas , for approximately $93.3 million, to deliver a suite of 10 science investigations and technology demonstrations to the Moon in 2023 (later delayed to 2024). This was the sixth award (seventh counting the OrbitBeyond award that was later cancelled) for lunar surface delivery (a lunar lander) under the CLPS initiative. This was the first delivery awarded to Firefly Aerospace, which would provide the lunar delivery service using its Blue Ghost lander, designed and developed at the company Cedar Park facility.

[ 25 ] Nova-C lander model, on display in May 2019 at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland The next (seventh, not counting the OrbitBeyond contract) CLPS contract was awarded by NASA on November 17, 2021 to Intuitive Machines, their 3rd award. Their Nova-C lander was contracted to land four NASA payloads (about 92 kg in total) to study a lunar feature called Reiner Gamma . The mission was known as IM-3 mission and was planned to land on the Moon in 2024. The contract value was $77.5 million and under the contract, Intuitive Machines was responsible for end-to-end delivery services, including payload integration, delivery from Earth to the surface of the Moon, and payload operations.

[ 26 ] On July 21, 2022, NASA announced that it had awarded a CLPS contract (8th, not counting OrbitBeyond) worth $73 million to a team led by the company Draper. The mission targeted Schrödinger Basin on the farside of the Moon, planned for 2025. The mission lander, called SERIES-2 by Draper, would deliver to Schrödinger Basin three experiments to collect seismic data, measure the heat flow and electrical conductivity of the lunar subsurface and measure electromagnetic phenomena created by the interaction of the solar wind and plasma with the lunar surface. This mission would be the first CLPS mission to target the lunar far side, and aims to be the second landing (after China's Chang'e-4 ) to the Moon's far side. The mission would also develop and deploy two data relay satellites, a must for missions in the lunar far side. Many companies are involved in the mission with Draper being the prime contractor, including ispace .

[ 27 ] On September 29, 2023, ispace announced that the SERIES-2 lander had been comprehensively redesigned and renamed as APEX 1.0, causing the mission to be delayed to 2026.

[ 28 ] Masten Space Systems filed for bankruptcy in July 2022, [ 29 ] with nearly all their assets sold to Astrobotic Technology .

[ 30 ] This led to the cancellation of Masten's CLPS mission.

On March 14, 2023, NASA awarded Firefly a $112 million task order (8th CLPS contract, not counting OrbitBeyond or Masten Space Systems) for a mission to the far side of the Moon using the second Blue Ghost lander, expected to launch in 2026.

[ 31 ] On March 2, 2025, the Blue Ghost lander touched down on the moon around 3:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The spacecraft, built by Firefly Aerospace of Cedar Park, Texas, carried ten instruments for NASA as part of CLPS. Many will focus on lunar dust, which can be angular, sticky and sharp and is difficult for machinery to handle and can be challenging for the health of future astronauts.

[ 32 ] Overview [ edit ] The lunar south pole region is of special interest because of the occurrence of water ice in permanently shadowed areas inside craters, near constant solar power at the crater rims, and abundant metals and oxygen in the regolith.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] Landing sites of the CLPS missions The competitive nature of the CLPS program is expected to reduce the cost of lunar exploration, accelerate a robotic return to the Moon, sample return , resource prospecting in the south polar region , and promote innovation and growth of related commercial industries.

[ 35 ] The payload development program is called Development and Advancement of Lunar Instrumentation (DALI), and the payload goals are exploration, in situ resource utilization ( ISRU ), and lunar science. The first instruments were expected to be selected by summer 2019, [ 4 ] and the flight opportunities were expected to start in 2021.

[ 35 ] [ 4 ] Multiple contracts will be issued, and the early payloads will likely be small because of the limited capacity of the initial commercial landers.

[ 7 ] The first landers and rovers will be technology demonstrators on hardware such as precision landing/hazard avoidance, power generation ( solar and RTGs ), in situ resource utilization ( ISRU ), cryogenic fluid management, autonomous operations and sensing , and advanced avionics , mobility, mechanisms, and materials .

[ 4 ] This program requires that only US launch vehicles can launch the spacecraft.

[ 4 ] The mass of the landers and rovers can range from miniature to 1,000 kg (2,200 lb), [ 36 ] with a 500 kg (1,100 lb) lander targeted to launch in 2022.

[ 35 ] The Draft Request for Proposal's covering letter states that the contracts will last up to 10 years. As NASA's need to send payloads to the lunar surface (and other cislunar destinations) arises, it will issue Firm-Fixed Price 'task orders' on which the approved prime contractors can bid. A Scope Of Work will be issued with each task order. The CLPS proposals are being evaluated against five Technical Accessibility Standards.

[ 4 ] NASA is assuming a cost of one million dollars per kilogram delivered to the lunar surface. (This figure may be revised after a lunar landing when the actual costs are available.) [ 37 ] Contractors [ edit ] Astrobotic Peregrine The companies selected are considered "main contractors" that can sub-contract projects to other companies of their choice. The first companies granted the right to bid on CLPS contracts were chosen in 2018.

[ 9 ] [ 38 ] [ 8 ] On May 21, 2019, three companies were awarded lander contracts: Astrobotic Technology , Intuitive Machines , OrbitBeyond .

[ 12 ] On July 29, 2019, NASA announced that it had granted OrbitBeyond's request to be released from this specific contract, citing "internal corporate challenges." [ 39 ] On November 18, 2019, NASA added five new contractors to the group of companies who are eligible to bid to send large payloads to the surface of the Moon with the CLPS program.

[ 20 ] On April 8, 2020, NASA selected Masten Space Systems for a mission to deliver and operate eight payloads – with nine science and technology instruments – to the Moon's South Pole in 2022.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Masten Space Systems filed for bankruptcy in July 2022; [ 29 ] [ 30 ] this led to the cancellation of Masten's CLPS mission.

On February 4, 2021, NASA awarded a CLPS contract to Firefly Aerospace for a mission to deliver a suite of 10 science investigations and technology demonstrations to the Moon in 2023.

[ 25 ] On July 21, 2022, NASA announced that it had awarded a CLPS contract to Draper Laboratories.

[ 27 ] On August 29, 2024 NASA announced that it awarded another CLPS task order to Intuitive Machines. The six payloads include four from NASA, one from the European Space Agency and one from the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.

The payloads are developed under separate contracts either at NASA facilities or in commercial facilities. The CLPS landers provide landing, support services, and sample return as specified in each individual contract.

The first batch of science payloads are being developed in NASA facilities, due to the short time available before the first planned flights. Subsequent selections include payloads provided by universities and industry. Calls for payloads are planned to be released each year for additional opportunities.

Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program [ edit ] The Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program (LDEP) within the NASA Science Mission Directorate establishes contracts for the CLPS program and selects lunar science instruments that will use CLPS services.

[ 46 ] The CLPS Lunar Instrument Development process includes NASA Provided Lunar Payloads (NPLP), Lunar Surface Instrument and Technology Payloads (LSITP), Payloads and Research Investigations on the Surface of the Moon (PRISM), Development and Advancement of Lunar Instrumentation (DALI), Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) Instruments and Artemis Surface Instruments.

[ 47 ] LDEP aspires to conduct at least two CLPS missions per year.

[ 48 ] Delivery missions for these payloads were solicited in batches.

First batch [ edit ] The first twelve NASA payloads and experiments were announced on February 21, 2019, [ 49 ] [ 50 ] and will fly on separate missions. As of February 2021 [update] NASA has awarded contracts for four CLPS lander missions to support these payloads.
