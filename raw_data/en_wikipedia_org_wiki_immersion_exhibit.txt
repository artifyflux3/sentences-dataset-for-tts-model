Buildings and barriers are hidden. By recreating sights and other sensorial input from natural environments, immersion exhibits provide an indication about how animals live in the wild.

[ 1 ] The landscape immersion term and approach were developed in 1975 through the efforts of David Hancocks at Seattle 's Woodland Park Zoo .

[ 2 ] This led to the zoo's ground-breaking gorilla exhibit, which opened in 1978.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The concept became the industry standard by the 1980s, and has since gained widespread acceptance as the best practice for zoological exhibits.
