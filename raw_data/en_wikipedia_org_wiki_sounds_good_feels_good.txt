" Released: 14 September 2015 " Jet Black Heart " Released: 13 December 2015 Sounds Good Feels Good is the second studio album by Australian pop rock band 5 Seconds of Summer . It was released on 23 October 2015 through the labels Hi or Hey and Capitol Records.

[ 4 ] In support of the album, the band embarked on the Sounds Live Feels Live World Tour .

Recording sessions took place from 2014 to 2015, in the United States. Record production of the album was handled by John Feldmann , The Monsters and the Strangerz , David Hodges and Mike Green. Recording and writing started after the band became popular worldwide with the release of their debut album, 5 Seconds of Summer , and two of its singles in particular, " She Looks So Perfect " and " Amnesia ". At 52 minutes and 57 seconds in length, it is the band’s longest studio album to date. Along with being the band’s longest album, it contains their longest song to date, “Outer Space/Carry On”.

Background and recording [ edit ] Following the release of their live album LiveSOS in 2014, 5 Seconds of Summer took a break for the holidays. Aside from the track "Invisible", penned in August 2014 at Ocean Way recording studio in Nashville, Tennessee, the majority of Sounds Good Feels Good was written in 2015 in Los Angeles. The band flew to Los Angeles in early 2015 to start writing and recording what was to become their second album.

[ 5 ] On their headline tour beginning in early May, they began performing "Permanent Vacation" which was a new song off their album.

[ 6 ] On 12 August 2015 they announced the title and cover art for the record, with pre-orders starting on 14 August in each time zone. Each pre-order got an instant download of the new tracks "She's Kinda Hot", "Fly Away", [ 7 ] "Jet Black Heart", "Money", and "Hey Everybody".

Many songs touch on severe topics like depression and mental health. The band stated that the album was written as a way for them to work through personal issues, and from there they worked to make it an album for their fans, as well. In an interview with Notion magazine, they stated: With the first album we were 16 years old when we wrote it. But now we’ve been on tour for four and a half years, we’ve experienced stuff. We’ve written about a lot of different things on this album because we’re older and we’ve experienced more of life, so we’ve got more to talk about.

[ 8 ] Artwork [ edit ] The album cover was designed by Richard Andrews, who created the album cover for 5 Seconds of Summer's last two projects – 5 Seconds of Summer and LiveSOS .

Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club described Sounds Good Feels Good ' s cover as " a clear precedent of the early-’00s pop-punk boom".

[ 18 ] Awarding the album four stars at Alternative Press , Maria Sherman states, "the band have a real responsibility to the consumer, and Sounds Good Feels Good delivers...It's 5SOS' attempt to find community in their new sound and those who support it, a concept that lives both on the record and well outside of it. It's a strong sentiment: follow them and you might find something to relate to. That's a powerful thing." [ 20 ] The staff from Rock Sound published a review of the album in their October 2015 issue giving the album an eight out of ten rating, where they write, "album number two finds the four man phenomenon firming up their identity and becoming their own band" and closing with the remarks "this is the New Broken Scene, it sounds good and it feels even better".

[ 3 ] Kerrang!

awarded it a 4/5 rating, commenting " Sounds Good Feels Good won't change the world, but it might just change your mind".
