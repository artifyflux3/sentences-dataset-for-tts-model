[ 1 ] Morris–Lecar neurons exhibit both class I and class II neuron excitability.

History [ edit ] Catherine Morris (b. 1949) is a Canadian biologist. She won a Commonwealth scholarship to study at Cambridge University , where she earned her PhD in 1977. She became a professor at the University of Ottawa in the early 1980s. As of 2015, she is an emeritus professor at the University of Ottawa. Harold Lecar (18 October 1935 – 4 February 2014) was an American professor of biophysics and neurobiology at the University of California Berkeley . He graduated with his PhD in physics from Columbia University in 1963.

Experimental method [ edit ] The Morris–Lecar experiments relied on the voltage clamp method established by Keynes et al.

(1973).

[ 2 ] Large specimens of the barnacle Balanus nubilus (Pacific Bio-Marine Laboratories Inc., Venice, California) were used. The barnacle was sawed into lateral halves, and the depressor scutorum rostralis muscles were carefully exposed. Individual fibers were dissected, the incision starting from the tendon. The other end of the muscle was cut close to its attachment on the shell and ligatured. Isolated fibers were either used immediately or kept for up to 30 min in standard artificial seawater (ASW; see below) before use. Experiments were carried out at room temperature of 22 C .

[ 1 ] Principal assumptions [ edit ] Among the principal assumptions are these: Equations apply to a spatially iso-potential patch of membrane. There are two persistent (non-inactivating) voltage-gated currents with oppositively biased reversal potentials. The depolarizing current is carried by Na+ or Ca2+ ions (or both), depending on the system to be modeled, and the hyperpolarizing current is carried by K+.

Activation gates follow changes in membrane potential sufficiently rapidly that the activating conductance can instantaneously relax to its steady-state value at any voltage.

The dynamics of the recovery variable can be approximated by a first-order linear differential equation for the probability of channel opening.

[ 3 ] Physiological description [ edit ] The Morris–Lecar model is a two-dimensional system of nonlinear differential equations .  It is considered a simplified model compared to the four-dimensional Hodgkin–Huxley model .

Qualitatively, this system of equations describes the complex relationship between membrane potential and the activation of ion channels within the membrane: the potential depends on the activity of the ion channels, and the activity of the ion channels depends on the voltage. As bifurcation parameters are altered, different classes of neuron behavior are exhibited.

τ N is associated with the relative time scales of the firing dynamics, which varies broadly from cell to cell and exhibits significant temperature dependency.

Despite missing delays in the onset of recovery, the model appears to be adequate for phase-plane considerations for many excitable systems.
