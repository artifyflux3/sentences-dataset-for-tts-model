Modern ophthalmic lens making machine

**[Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics")** began with the development of [lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics) "Lens (optics)") by the [ancient Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") and [Mesopotamians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia"), followed by theories on light and [vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception "Visual perception") developed by [ancient Greek philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy "Ancient Greek philosophy"), and the development of [geometrical optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_optics "Geometrical optics") in the [Greco-Roman world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_world "Greco-Roman world"). The word _[optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics")_ is derived from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") term τα ὀπτικά meaning 'appearance, look'.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-1) Optics was significantly reformed by the developments in the [medieval Islamic world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age"), such as the beginnings of physical and physiological optics, and then significantly advanced in [early modern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_Europe "Early modern Europe"), where [diffractive optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction "Diffraction") began. These earlier studies on optics are now known as "classical optics". The term "modern optics" refers to areas of optical research that largely developed in the 20th century, such as [wave optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_optics "Physical optics") and [quantum optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optics "Quantum optics").

In the fifth century BCE, [Empedocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empedocles "Empedocles") postulated that everything was composed of [four elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element"); fire, air, earth and water. He believed that [Aphrodite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite "Aphrodite") made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun. He stated that light has a finite speed.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-2)

In the 4th century BC Chinese text, credited to the philosopher Mozi, it is described how light passing through a pinhole creates an inverted image in a "collecting-point" or "treasure house".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-3)

In his _[Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Optics "Euclid's Optics")_[Greek mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics")[Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") observed that "things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal". In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. [Pappus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria "Pappus of Alexandria") believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's _Optics_, along with his _Phaenomena_, in the _[Little Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little\_Astronomy "Little Astronomy")_, a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the _Syntaxis_ (_Almagest_) of [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy").

In 55 BC, [Lucretius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius "Lucretius"), a [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome")[atomist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism"), wrote:

> For from whatsoever distances fires can throw us their light and breathe their warm heat upon our limbs, they lose nothing of the body of their flames because of the interspaces, their fire is no whit shrunken to the sight.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-4)

In his _Catoptrica_, [Hero of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria") showed by a geometrical method that the actual path taken by a ray of light reflected from a plane mirror is shorter than any other reflected path that might be drawn between the source and point of observation.

The Indian [Buddhists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist "Buddhist"), such as [Dignāga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dign%C4%81ga "Dignāga") in the 5th century and [Dharmakirti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmakirti "Dharmakirti") in the 7th century, developed a type of [atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism") which defined the atoms which make up the world as momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy, though they also viewed all matter as being composed of these light/energy particles.

The early writers discussed here treated vision more as a geometrical than as a physical, physiological, or psychological problem. The first known author of a treatise on geometrical optics was the geometer [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") (c. 325 BC–265 BC). Euclid began his study of optics as he began his study of geometry, with a set of self-evident axioms.

1.   Lines (or visual rays) can be drawn in a straight line to the object.
2.   Those lines falling upon an object form a cone.
3.   Those things upon which the lines fall are seen.
4.   Those things seen under a larger angle appear larger.
5.   Those things seen by a higher ray, appear higher.
6.   Right and left rays appear right and left.
7.   Things seen within several angles appear clearer.

Euclid did not define the physical nature of these visual rays but, using the principles of geometry, he discussed the effects of perspective and the rounding of things seen at a distance.

Where Euclid had limited his analysis to simple direct vision, [Hero of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria") (c. AD 10–70) extended the principles of geometrical optics to consider problems of reflection (catoptrics). Unlike Euclid, Hero occasionally commented on the physical nature of visual rays, indicating that they proceeded at great speed from the eye to the object seen and were reflected from smooth surfaces but could become trapped in the porosities of unpolished surfaces.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-5) This has come to be known as [_emission theory_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_theory_(vision) "Emission theory (vision)").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-guarnieri_7-1-6)

Hero demonstrated the equality of the angle of incidence and reflection on the grounds that this is the shortest path from the object to the observer. On this basis, he was able to define the fixed relation between an object and its image in a plane mirror. Specifically, the image appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object really is in front of the mirror.

Like Hero, [Claudius Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius_Ptolemy "Claudius Ptolemy") in his second-century _[Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics\_(Ptolemy) "Optics (Ptolemy)")_ considered the visual rays as proceeding from the eye to the object seen, but, unlike Hero, considered that the visual rays were not discrete lines, but formed a continuous cone.

_Optics_ documents Ptolemy's studies of [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)") and [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-7) He measured the angles of refraction between air, water, and glass, but his published results indicate that he adjusted his measurements to fit his (incorrect) assumption that the [angle of refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_refraction "Angle of refraction") is proportional to the [angle of incidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence_(optics) "Angle of incidence (optics)").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-9)

In the Islamic world

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_optics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: In the Islamic world")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Ibn_Sahl_manuscript.jpg/250px-Ibn_Sahl_manuscript.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ibn_Sahl_manuscript.jpg)

Reproduction of a page of [Ibn Sahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Sahl_(mathematician) "Ibn Sahl (mathematician)")'s manuscript showing his discovery of the law of refraction, now known as [Snell's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law "Snell's law")

[Al-Kindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Kindi "Al-Kindi") (c. 801–873) was one of the earliest important optical writers in the [Islamic world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world "Muslim world"). In a work known in the west as _De radiis stellarum_, al-Kindi developed a theory "that everything in the world ... emits rays in every direction, which fill the whole world."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-10)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Theorem_of_al-Haitham.JPG/250px-Theorem_of_al-Haitham.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Theorem_of_al-Haitham.JPG)

The [theorem of Ibn Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#Theorems "Circle")

This theory of the active power of rays had an influence on later scholars such as [Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham"), [Robert Grosseteste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Grosseteste "Robert Grosseteste") and [Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon "Roger Bacon").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-11)

[Ibn Sahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Sahl_(mathematician) "Ibn Sahl (mathematician)"), a mathematician active in Baghdad during the 980s, is the first Islamic scholar known to have compiled a commentary on [Ptolemy's _Optics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics_(Ptolemy) "Optics (Ptolemy)"). His treatise _Fī al-'āla al-muḥriqa_ "On the burning instruments" was reconstructed from fragmentary manuscripts by Rashed (1993).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-12) The work is concerned with how [curved mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_mirror "Curved mirror") and [lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics) "Lens (optics)") bend and focus light. Ibn Sahl also describes a law of [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction") mathematically equivalent to [Snell's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law "Snell's law").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-13) He used his law of refraction to compute the shapes of lenses and mirrors that focus light at a single point on the axis.

[Alhazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen "Alhazen") (Ibn al-Haytham), "the father of Optics"[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-14)

[Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham") (known in as _Alhacen_ or _Alhazen_ in Western Europe), writing in the 1010s, received both Ibn Sahl's treatise and a partial Arabic translation of Ptolemy's _Optics_. He produced a comprehensive and systematic analysis of Greek optical theories.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-15) Ibn al-Haytham's key achievement was twofold: first, to insist, against the opinion of Ptolemy, that vision occurred because of rays entering the eye; the second was to define the physical nature of the rays discussed by earlier geometrical optical writers, considering them as the forms of light and color.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-Alhazen-16) He then analyzed these physical rays according to the principles of geometrical optics. He wrote many books on optics, most significantly the _[Book of Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")_ (_Kitab al Manazir_ in [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language")), translated into [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") as the _De aspectibus_ or _Perspectiva_, which disseminated his ideas to Western Europe and had great influence on the later developments of optics.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-17)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-guarnieri_7-1-6)[Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham") was called "the father of modern optics".[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-19)

[Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna") (980–1037) agreed with Alhazen that the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") is finite, as he "observed that if the perception of light is due to the emission of some sort of particles by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite."[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-20)[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab%C5%AB_Rayh%C4%81n_al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB "Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī") (973-1048) also agreed that light has a finite speed, and stated that the speed of light is much faster than the [speed of sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound "Speed of sound").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-Biruni-21)

[Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ma'udh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Mu%CA%BF%C4%81dh_al-Jayy%C4%81n%C4%AB "Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī"), who lived in [Al-Andalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus") during the second half of the 11th century, wrote a work on optics later translated into Latin as _Liber de crepisculis_, which was mistakenly attributed to [Alhazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen "Alhazen"). This was a "short work containing an estimation of the angle of depression of the sun at the beginning of the morning [twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight "Twilight") and at the end of the evening twilight, and an attempt to calculate on the basis of this and other data the height of the atmospheric moisture responsible for the refraction of the sun's rays." Through his experiments, he obtained the value of 18°, which comes close to the modern value.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-22)

In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, [Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_al-Din_al-Shirazi "Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi") (1236–1311) and his student [Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kam%C4%81l_al-D%C4%ABn_al-F%C4%81ris%C4%AB "Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī") (1260–1320) continued the work of Ibn al-Haytham, and they were among the first to give the correct explanations for the [rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow "Rainbow") phenomenon. Al-Fārisī published his findings in his _Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir_ (_The Revision of_ [Ibn al-Haytham's] _Optics_).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-23)

The English bishop [Robert Grosseteste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Grosseteste "Robert Grosseteste") (c. 1175–1253) wrote on a wide range of scientific topics at the time of the origin of the medieval [university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University "University") and the recovery of the works of Aristotle. Grosseteste reflected a period of transition between the Platonism of early medieval learning and the new [Aristotelianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism "Aristotelianism"), hence he tended to apply mathematics and the Platonic metaphor of light in many of his writings. He has been credited with discussing light from four different perspectives: an [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") of light, a [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") or [cosmogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony "Cosmogony") of light, an [etiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology "Etiology") or [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") of light, and a [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology") of light.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-24)

Setting aside the issues of epistemology and theology, Grosseteste's cosmogony of light describes the origin of the universe in what may loosely be described as a medieval "big bang" theory. Both his biblical commentary, the _Hexaemeron_ (1230 x 35), and his scientific _On Light_ (1235 x 40), took their inspiration from [Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis "Book of Genesis") 1:3, "God said, let there be light", and described the subsequent process of creation as a natural physical process arising from the generative power of an expanding (and contracting) sphere of light.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-25)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Optics_from_Roger_Bacon%27s_De_multiplicatone_specierum.jpg/330px-Optics_from_Roger_Bacon%27s_De_multiplicatone_specierum.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Optics_from_Roger_Bacon%27s_De_multiplicatone_specierum.jpg)

Optical diagram showing light being refracted by a spherical glass container full of water. (from Roger Bacon, _De multiplicatione specierum_)

His more general consideration of light as a primary agent of physical causation appears in his _On Lines, Angles, and Figures_ where he asserts that "a natural agent propagates its power from itself to the recipient" and in _On the Nature of Places_ where he notes that "every natural action is varied in strength and weakness through variation of lines, angles and figures."[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-26)

The English [Franciscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan "Franciscan"), [Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon "Roger Bacon") (c. 1214–1294) was strongly influenced by Grosseteste's writings on the importance of light. In his optical writings (the _Perspectiva_, the _De multiplicatione specierum_, and the _De speculis comburentibus_) he cited a wide range of recently translated optical and philosophical works, including those of [Alhacen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham"), [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), [Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna"), [Averroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes "Averroes"), [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid"), [al-Kindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Kindi "Al-Kindi"), [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy"), Tideus, and [Constantine the African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_African "Constantine the African"). Although he was not a slavish imitator, he drew his mathematical analysis of light and vision from the writings of the Arabic writer, Alhacen. But he added to this the Neoplatonic concept, perhaps drawn from Grosseteste, that every object radiates a power (_species_) by which it acts upon nearby objects suited to receive those _species_.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-27) Note that Bacon's optical use of the term _species_ differs significantly from the [genus/species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species#History "Species") categories found in Aristotelian philosophy.

Several later works, including the influential _A Moral Treatise on the Eye_ (Latin: _Tractatus Moralis de Oculo_) by [Peter of Limoges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_of_Limoges "Peter of Limoges") (1240–1306), helped popularize and spread the ideas found in Bacon's writings.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-28)

Another English Franciscan, [John Pecham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pecham "John Pecham") (died 1292) built on the work of Bacon, Grosseteste, and a diverse range of earlier writers to produce what became the most widely used textbook on optics of the Middle Ages, the _Perspectiva communis_. His book centered on the question of vision, on how we see, rather than on the nature of light and color. Pecham followed the model set forth by Alhacen, but interpreted Alhacen's ideas in the manner of Roger Bacon.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-29)

Like his predecessors, [Witelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witelo "Witelo") (born circa 1230, died between 1280 and 1314) drew on the extensive body of optical works recently translated from Greek and Arabic to produce a massive presentation of the subject entitled the _Perspectiva_. His theory of vision follows Alhacen and he does not consider Bacon's concept of _species_, although passages in his work demonstrate that he was influenced by Bacon's ideas. Judging from the number of surviving manuscripts, his work was not as influential as those of Pecham and Bacon, yet his importance, and that of Pecham, grew with the invention of printing.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-30)

[Theodoric of Freiberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoric_of_Freiberg "Theodoric of Freiberg") (ca. 1250–ca. 1310) was among the first in Europe to provide the correct scientific explanation for the [rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow "Rainbow") phenomenon,[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-31) as well as Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236–1311) and his student Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī (1260–1320) mentioned above.

Renaissance and early modern period
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_optics&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Renaissance and early modern period")]

[Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") (1571–1630) picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-guarnieri_7-1-6) Both lunar and [solar eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse "Solar eclipse") presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of [atmospheric refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction "Atmospheric refraction") applied to all astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on January 1, 1604, was published as _Astronomiae Pars Optica_ (_The Optical Part of Astronomy_). In it, Kepler described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of [pinhole cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera "Pinhole camera"), as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax "Parallax") and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. _Astronomiae Pars Optica_ is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the [law of refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_refraction "Law of refraction") is conspicuously absent).[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-32)

[Willebrord Snellius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willebrord_Snellius "Willebrord Snellius") (1580–1626) found the mathematical law of [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction"), now known as [Snell's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law "Snell's law"), in 1621. Subsequently, [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") (1596–1650) showed, by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes' law), that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42° (i.e. the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the rainbow's centre is 42°).[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-33) He also independently discovered the [law of reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_reflection "Law of reflection"), and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-34)

[Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") (1629–1695) wrote several works in the area of optics. These included the _Opera reliqua_ (also known as _Christiani Hugenii Zuilichemii, dum viveret Zelhemii toparchae, opuscula posthuma_) and the _[Traité de la lumière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait%C3%A9\_de\_la\_lumi%C3%A8re "Traité de la lumière")_.

[Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") (1643–1727) investigated the [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction") of light, demonstrating that a [prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_prism_(optics) "Triangular prism (optics)") could decompose white light into a [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum "Visible spectrum") of colours, and that a [lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics) "Lens (optics)") and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as [Newton's theory of colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_early_life_and_achievements#Newton's_theory_of_colour "Isaac Newton's early life and achievements"). From this work he concluded that any refracting [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") would suffer from the [dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics) "Dispersion (optics)") of light into colours. He went on to invent a reflecting telescope (today known as a [Newtonian telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope "Newtonian telescope")), which showed that using a mirror to form an image bypassed the problem. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes _On Colour_, which he later expanded into his _Opticks_. He argued that light is composed of particles or _corpuscles_ and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave") to explain the [diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction "Diffraction") of light (_Opticks_ Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction.

In his _Hypothesis of Light_ of 1675, Newton [posited](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/posit "wikt:posit") the existence of the [ether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether "Luminiferous aether") to transmit forces between particles. In 1704, Newton published _[Opticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opticks "Opticks")_, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation "Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?"[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-35) Newton was also the first to describe the use of prisms as [beam expanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_expander "Beam expander") and [multiple-prism arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-prism_dispersion_theory "Multiple-prism dispersion theory"), which would later become integral to the development of early [tunable lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunable_laser "Tunable laser").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-36)

Thomas Young's sketch of two-slit diffraction, which he presented to the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society") in 1803

The effects of [diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction "Diffraction") of light were carefully observed and characterized by [Francesco Maria Grimaldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Maria_Grimaldi "Francesco Maria Grimaldi"), who also coined the term _diffraction_, from the Latin _diffringere_, 'to break into pieces', referring to light breaking up into different directions. The results of Grimaldi's observations were published posthumously in 1665.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-38)[Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") studied these effects and attributed them to _inflexion_ of light rays. [James Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gregory_(astronomer_and_mathematician) "James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)") (1638–1675) observed the diffraction patterns caused by a bird feather, which was effectively the first [diffraction grating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_grating "Diffraction grating"). In 1803 [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)") did his famous experiment observing interference from two closely spaced slits in his [double slit interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_Double_Slit_Interferometer "Young's Double Slit Interferometer"). Explaining his results by interference of the waves emanating from the two different slits, he deduced that light must propagate as waves. [Augustin-Jean Fresnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Jean_Fresnel "Augustin-Jean Fresnel") did more definitive studies and calculations of diffraction, published in 1815 and 1818, and thereby gave great support to the wave theory of light that had been advanced by [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") and reinvigorated by Young, against Newton's particle theory.

Lenses and lensmaking
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_optics&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Lenses and lensmaking")]

Although disputed, archeological evidence has been suggested of the use of lenses in ancient times over a period of several millennia.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-39) It has been proposed that glass eye covers in [hieroglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs "Egyptian hieroglyphs") from the [Old Kingdom of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kingdom_of_Egypt "Old Kingdom of Egypt") (c. 2686–2181 BCE) were functional simple glass meniscus lenses.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-40) The so-called [Nimrud lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrud_lens "Nimrud lens"), a rock crystal artifact dated to the [7th century BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_century_BC "7th century BC"), might have been used as a magnifying glass, although it could have simply been a decoration.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-Nimrud_lens-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-42)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-Bardell2004-45)

The earliest written record of magnification dates back to the [1st century CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_century "1st century"), when [Seneca the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger "Seneca the Younger"), a tutor of Emperor [Nero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero "Nero"), wrote: "Letters, however small and indistinct, are seen enlarged and more clearly through a globe or glass filled with water."[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-Kriss-46) Emperor Nero is also said to have watched the [gladiatorial games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator "Gladiator") using an [emerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald "Emerald") as a corrective lens.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-47)

[Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham") (Alhacen) wrote about the effects of [pinhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera "Pinhole camera"), [concave lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics) "Lens (optics)"), and [magnifying glasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnifying_glass "Magnifying glass") in his [11th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_century "11th century")_[Book of Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")_ (1021 CE).[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-Kriss-46)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-Wade-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-Elliott-49) The English friar [Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon "Roger Bacon"), during the 1260s or 1270s, wrote works on optics, partly based on the works of Arab writers, that described the function of corrective lenses for vision and burning glasses. These volumes were outlines for a larger publication that was never produced, so his ideas never saw mass dissemination.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-50)

Between the [11th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_century "11th century") and [13th centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_century "13th century"), so-called "[reading stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_stone "Reading stone")" were invented. Often used by [monks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk "Monk") to assist in [illuminating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript "Illuminated manuscript") manuscripts, these were primitive [plano-convex lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)#Types_of_simple_lenses "Lens (optics)"), initially made by cutting a glass sphere in half. As the stones were experimented with, it was slowly understood that shallower lenses [magnified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification "Magnification") more effectively. Around 1286, possibly in Pisa, Italy, the first pair of eyeglasses was made, although it is unclear who the inventor was.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-51)

The earliest known working telescopes were the [refracting telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refracting_telescope "Refracting telescope") that appeared in the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") in 1608. Their inventor is unknown: [Hans Lippershey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Lippershey "Hans Lippershey") applied for the first patent that year followed by a patent application by [Jacob Metius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Metius "Jacob Metius") of [Alkmaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkmaar "Alkmaar") two weeks later (neither was granted since examples of the device seemed to be numerous at the time). [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") greatly improved upon these designs the following year. [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") is credited with constructing the first functional [reflecting telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_telescope "Reflecting telescope") in 1668, his [Newtonian reflector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope "Newtonian telescope").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-books.google.com-52)

The earliest known examples of compound microscopes, which combine an [objective lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_(optics) "Objective (optics)") near the specimen with an [eyepiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyepiece "Eyepiece") to view a [real image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_image "Real image"), appeared in Europe around 1620.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-Murphy-53) The design is very similar to the telescope and, like that device, its inventor is unknown. Again claims revolve around the spectacle making centers in the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") including claims it was invented in 1590 by [Zacharias Janssen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacharias_Janssen "Zacharias Janssen") and/or his father, Hans Martens,[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-55)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-56) claims it was invented by rival spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey,[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-57) and claims it was invented by [expatriate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expatriate "Expatriate")[Cornelis Drebbel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelis_Drebbel "Cornelis Drebbel") who was noted to have a version in London in 1619.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-58)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-59)

[Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") (also sometimes cited as a compound microscope inventor) seems to have found after 1609 that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects and, after seeing a compound microscope built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, built his own improved version.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-61)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-62) The name _microscope_ was coined by [Giovanni Faber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Faber "Giovanni Faber"), who gave that name to [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei")'s compound microscope in 1625.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-63)

Light is made up of particles called [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photons "Photons") and hence inherently is quantized. Quantum optics is the study of the nature and effects of light as quantized photons. The first indication that light might be quantized came from [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck") in 1899 when he correctly modelled [blackbody radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody_radiation "Blackbody radiation") by assuming that the exchange of energy between light and matter only occurred in discrete amounts he called quanta. It was unknown whether the source of this discreteness was the matter or the light.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics#cite_note-Cropper2004-64): 231–236  In 1905, [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") published the theory of the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect"). It appeared that the only possible explanation for the effect was the quantization of light itself. Later, [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr") showed that atoms could only emit discrete amounts of energy. The understanding of the interaction between light and [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") following from these developments not only formed the basis of quantum optics but also were crucial for the development of quantum mechanics as a whole. However, the subfields of quantum mechanics dealing with matter-light interaction were principally regarded as research into matter rather than into light and hence, one rather spoke of [atom physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_physics "Atom physics") and [quantum electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electronics "Quantum electronics").

This changed with the invention of the [maser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maser "Maser") in 1953 and the [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser") in 1960. [Laser science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_science "Laser science")—research into principles, design and application of these devices—became an important field, and the quantum mechanics underlying the laser's principles was studied now with more emphasis on the properties of light, and the name _quantum optics_ became customary.

As laser science needed good theoretical foundations, and also because research into these soon proved very fruitful, interest in quantum optics rose. Following the work of [Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac") in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), [George Sudarshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sudarshan "George Sudarshan"), [Roy J. Glauber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_J._Glauber "Roy J. Glauber"), and [Leonard Mandel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Mandel "Leonard Mandel") applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") of light (see [degree of coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_coherence "Degree of coherence")). This led to the introduction of the [coherent state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_state "Coherent state") as a quantum description of laser light and the realization that some states of light could not be described with classical waves. In 1977, [Kimble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Jeff_Kimble "H. Jeff Kimble") et al. demonstrated the first source of light which required a quantum description: a single atom that emitted one photon at a time. Another quantum state of light with certain advantages over any classical state, [squeezed light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezed_coherent_state "Squeezed coherent state"), was soon proposed. At the same time, development of short and [ultrashort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrashort_pulse "Ultrashort pulse") laser pulses—created by [Q-switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-switching "Q-switching") and [mode-locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking "Mode-locking") techniques—opened the way to the study of unimaginably fast ("[ultrafast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafast "Ultrafast")") processes. Applications for solid state research (e.g. [Raman spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy "Raman spectroscopy")) were found, and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an [optical trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_trap "Optical trap") or [optical tweezers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_tweezers "Optical tweezers") by laser beam. This, along with [Doppler cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_cooling "Doppler cooling") was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated [Bose–Einstein condensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensation "Bose–Einstein condensation").

Other remarkable results are the [demonstration of quantum entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test_experiments "Bell test experiments"), [quantum teleportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation "Quantum teleportation"), and (recently, in 1995) [quantum logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate "Quantum logic gate"). The latter are of much interest in [quantum information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information_theory "Quantum information theory"), a subject which partly emerged from quantum optics, partly from theoretical [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science").

Today's fields of interest among quantum optics researchers include [parametric down-conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_down-conversion "Parametric down-conversion"), [parametric oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_parametric_oscillator "Optical parametric oscillator"), even shorter (attosecond) light pulses, use of quantum optics for [quantum information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information "Quantum information"), manipulation of single atoms and [Bose–Einstein condensates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate "Bose–Einstein condensate"), their application, and how to manipulate them (a sub-field often called [atom optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_optics "Atom optics")).
