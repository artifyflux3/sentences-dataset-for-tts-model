Born Mildred Cooper December 10, 1887 Buenos Aires, Argentina Died August 9, 1974 Santa Barbara, California Nationality British, American Occupation(s) Musician, composer Mildred Couper (December 10, 1887 in Buenos Aires , Argentina – August 9, 1974 [ 1 ] in Santa Barbara , United States ) was a prominent composer and pianist , and one of the first American musicians to experiment with quarter-tone music. She was based in Santa Barbara, California .

Early life [ edit ] Mildred Cooper was born in Buenos Aires, the daughter of Reginald Cooper and Harriet Hathaway Jacobs (1849-1931). Her father was born in England; her mother was born in Argentina to Wilson Jacobs III and Harriet Hathaway Moores, both American-born.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] She began her serious musical studies at the Williams Conservatory in Argentina, and pursued further training in Italy , Germany and France , where she studied piano with Moritz Moszkowski and composition with Nadia Boulanger .

[ 4 ] Career [ edit ] Couper taught piano for nine years at the David Mannes Music School in New York. She moved with her children to California in 1927 and established a studio in Santa Barbara, where she started her experiments with two pianos by tuning the first a quarter tone higher than the second. This increased the normal 88 pitch levels to 176, expanding so the gamut by a quarter step to emphasize the character of the harmony.

[ 5 ] Her first work in this medium was the ballet Xanadu (1930), [ 6 ] which was performed in the production of Eugene O'Neill 's Marco Millions in the Lobero Theatre . Mildred Couper also wrote incidental music for plays at the Lobero and also a dance-opera, And on Earth Peace , with libretto by Scottish-Argentine artist Malcolm Thurburn.

[ 7 ] Personal life [ edit ] Mildred Cooper married American expatriate artist Richard Hamilton Couper in 1910, and they had two children, Clive (1913-2004) and Rosalind (1915-2016), both born in Rome. At the outbreak of World War I the Coupers moved to New York City . She was widowed soon after, when her husband died during the 1918 influenza pandemic . She died in Santa Barbara, California, in 1974, aged 86 years. Her papers are archived in the Department of Special Collections at the University of California, Santa Barbara .

[ 8 ] Trivia [ edit ] Mildred Cooper's first cousin Harry Norman Jacobs (1877-1951) was the grandfather of Argentine-born composer Carlos Micháns(-Jacobs) (1950-), who resides in the Netherlands since 1982.
