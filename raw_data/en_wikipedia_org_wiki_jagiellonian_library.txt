History [ edit ] The beginning of the Jagiellonian Library is traditionally considered the same as that of the entire university (then known as Cracow Academy ) - in the year 1364; [ 4 ] however instead of having one central library it had several smaller branches at buildings of various departments (the largest collection was in Collegium Maius , where works related to theology and liberal arts were kept).

“In 1399 a generous endowment to the Academy made by King Wladislaw Jagiello and his consort Jadwiga made possible the reorganization of the Academy into a centralized institution of learning with a library.” (p 95) [ 6 ] Queen Jadwiga championed the library and bequeathed much of her wealth to help the university flourish in 1400.

[ 7 ] The library was growing at a rapid pace without the funds for more space until in 1492, a major part of the Collegium Maius (the academy's library) was destroyed in a fire. This prompted a need to rebuild the library, but the academy did not want to finance it. Instead, the poor faculty members decided to fund the project themselves. A contract was struck with a building crew, but financial issues still presented an obstacle, until chests of money were excavated during construction. A total of five chests were found, one in 1494, and the other four between 1515 and 1518. This helped not only rebuild the library, but purchase more acquisitions as well.

[ 6 ] After 1775, during the reforms of Komisja Edukacji Narodowej , which established the first Ministry of Education in the world, various small libraries of the university were formally centralized into one public collection in Collegium Maius. During the partitions of Poland , the library continued to grow thanks to the support of such people as Jerzy Samuel Bandtkie , Karol Józef Teofil Estreicher and Karol Estreicher . Its collections were made public in 1812. Since 1932, it has had the right to receive a copy of any book issued by Polish publishers within Poland. In 1940, the library finally obtained a new building of its own. During the Second World War , library workers cooperated with underground universities .

It wasn't until the 19th century that the university and therefore library was dubbed, “Jagiellonian” after the Jagiellonian dynasty .

[ 8 ] Since the 1990s, the library's collection is increasingly digital .

Building [ edit ] The current building of the library located at Al. Mickiewicza 22 was constructed in the years 1931-1939 and expanded twice, in the years 1961-1963 and 1995–2001.

Thefts from the collections [ edit ] In the 1990s, a number of priceless books were stolen from the library, presumably in order to be sold in the West . One of the worst such outbreaks in Poland was made public in April 1999. It included the theft of works by Galileo Galilei , Johannes Kepler and Bessarion . Some were recovered from an auction in the German auction house Reiss&Sohn.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] It remains unclear who was behind the operation.
