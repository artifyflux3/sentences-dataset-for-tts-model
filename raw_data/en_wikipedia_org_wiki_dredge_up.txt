By definition, during a dredge-up , a convection zone extends all the way from the star's surface down to the layers of material that have undergone fusion . Consequently, the fusion products are mixed into the outer layers of the star's atmosphere, where they can be seen in stellar spectra .

Multiple stages [ edit ] The first dredge-up The first dredge-up occurs when a main-sequence star enters the red-giant branch . As a result of the convective mixing, the outer atmosphere will display the spectral signature of hydrogen fusion: The 12 C / 13 C and C / N ratios are lowered, and the surface abundances of lithium and beryllium may be reduced. The counter-intuitive existence of lithium-rich red giant stars that have gone through first dredge-up may be explained by scenarios such as mass transfer .

[ 1 ] The second dredge-up The second dredge-up occurs in stars with 4–8 solar masses . When helium fusion comes to an end at the core, convection mixes the products of the CNO cycle .

[ 2 ] This second dredge-up causes an increase in the surface abundance of 4 He and 14 N, whereas the amount of 12 C and 16 O decreases.

[ 3 ] The third dredge-up The third dredge-up occurs after a star enters the asymptotic giant branch , after a flash occurs in a helium-burning shell. The third dredge-up brings helium, carbon , and the s -process products to the surface, increasing the abundance of carbon relative to oxygen; in some larger stars this is the process that turns the star into a carbon star .

[ 3 ] Note: The names of the dredge-ups are set by the evolutionary and structural state of the star in which each occurs, not by the sequence in which they occur in any one star. Some lower-mass stars experience the first and third dredge-ups in their evolution without ever having gone through the second.
