Find sources: "Diversity" mathematics – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) This article is about a generalization of a metric space. For the measure frequently used in ecology, see Diversity index . For other uses of diversity, see Diversity .

In mathematics , a diversity is a generalization of the concept of metric space .  The concept was introduced in 2012 by Bryant and Tupper, [ 1 ] who call diversities "a form of multi-way metric".

[ 2 ] The concept finds application in nonlinear analysis.

[ 3 ] Given a set X {\displaystyle X} , let ℘ ℘ fin ( X ) {\displaystyle \wp _{\mbox{fin}}(X)} be the set of finite subsets of X {\displaystyle X} .
A diversity is a pair ( X , δ δ ) {\displaystyle (X,\delta )} consisting of a set X {\displaystyle X} and a function δ δ : : ℘ ℘ fin ( X ) → → R {\displaystyle \delta \colon \wp _{\mbox{fin}}(X)\to \mathbb {R} } satisfying (D1) δ δ ( A ) ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle \delta (A)\geq 0} , with δ δ ( A ) = 0 {\displaystyle \delta (A)=0} if and only if | A | ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle \left|A\right|\leq 1} and (D2) if B ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle B\neq \emptyset } then δ δ ( A ∪ ∪ C ) ≤ ≤ δ δ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) + δ δ ( B ∪ ∪ C ) {\displaystyle \delta (A\cup C)\leq \delta (A\cup B)+\delta (B\cup C)} .

Bryant and Tupper observe that these axioms imply monotonicity; that is, if A ⊆ ⊆ B {\displaystyle A\subseteq B} , then δ δ ( A ) ≤ ≤ δ δ ( B ) {\displaystyle \delta (A)\leq \delta (B)} .  They state that the term "diversity" comes from the appearance of a special case of their definition in work on phylogenetic and ecological diversities.  They give the following examples: Diameter diversity [ edit ] Let ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} be a metric space.  Setting δ δ ( A ) = max a , b ∈ ∈ A d ( a , b ) = diam ⁡ ⁡ ( A ) {\displaystyle \delta (A)=\max _{a,b\in A}d(a,b)=\operatorname {diam} (A)} for all A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ fin ( X ) {\displaystyle A\in \wp _{\mbox{fin}}(X)} defines a diversity.

L 1 diversity [ edit ] For all finite A ⊆ ⊆ R n {\displaystyle A\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} if we define δ δ ( A ) = ∑ ∑ i max a , b { | a i − − b i | : : a , b ∈ ∈ A } {\displaystyle \delta (A)=\sum _{i}\max _{a,b}\left\{\left|a_{i}-b_{i}\right|\colon a,b\in A\right\}} then ( R n , δ δ ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ^{n},\delta )} is a diversity.

Phylogenetic diversity [ edit ] If T is a phylogenetic tree with taxon set X . For each finite A ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A\subseteq X} , define δ δ ( A ) {\displaystyle \delta (A)} as the length of the smallest subtree of T connecting taxa in A .  Then ( X , δ δ ) {\displaystyle (X,\delta )} is a (phylogenetic) diversity.

Steiner diversity [ edit ] Let ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} be a metric space.  For each finite A ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A\subseteq X} , let δ δ ( A ) {\displaystyle \delta (A)} denote
the minimum length of a Steiner tree within X connecting elements in A .  Then ( X , δ δ ) {\displaystyle (X,\delta )} is a
diversity.

Truncated diversity [ edit ] Let ( X , δ δ ) {\displaystyle (X,\delta )} be a diversity.  For all A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ fin ( X ) {\displaystyle A\in \wp _{\mbox{fin}}(X)} define δ δ ( k ) ( A ) = max { δ δ ( B ) : : | B | ≤ ≤ k , B ⊆ ⊆ A } {\displaystyle \delta ^{(k)}(A)=\max \left\{\delta (B)\colon |B|\leq k,B\subseteq A\right\}} .  Then if k ≥ ≥ 2 {\displaystyle k\geq 2} , ( X , δ δ ( k ) ) {\displaystyle (X,\delta ^{(k)})} is a diversity.

Clique diversity [ edit ] If ( X , E ) {\displaystyle (X,E)} is a graph , and δ δ ( A ) {\displaystyle \delta (A)} is defined for any finite A as the largest clique of A , then ( X , δ δ ) {\displaystyle (X,\delta )} is a diversity.
