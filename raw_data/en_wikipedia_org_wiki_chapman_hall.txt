Chapman & Hall is an imprint owned by CRC Press , originally founded as a British publishing house in London in the first half of the 19th century by Edward Chapman and William Hall . Chapman & Hall were publishers for Charles Dickens (from 1840 until 1844 and again from 1858 until 1870), Thomas Carlyle , William Thackeray , Elizabeth Barrett Browning , Anthony Trollope , Eadweard Muybridge and Evelyn Waugh .

History [ edit ] Upon Hall's death in 1847, Chapman's cousin Frederic Chapman began his progress through the ranks of the company and eventually becoming a partner in 1858 and sole proprietor on Edward Chapman's retirement from Chapman & Hall in 1866. In 1868 author Anthony Trollope bought a third of the company for his son, Henry Merivale Trollope. From 1902 to 1930 the company's managing director was Arthur Waugh .  In the 1930s the company merged with Methuen , a merger which, in 1955, participated in forming the Associated Book Publishers .  The latter was acquired by The Thomson Corporation in  1987.

Chapman & Hall was sold again in 1998 as part of Thomson Scientific and Professional to Wolters Kluwer , who sold on its well-regarded mathematics and statistics list to CRC Press .  Today the name of Chapman & Hall/CRC is used as an imprint for science and technology books by Taylor and Francis , part of the Informa group since 2004.

Most notably, the company were publishers for Charles Dickens (from 1840 until 1844 and again from 1858 until 1870), Thomas Carlyle , William Thackeray , Elizabeth Barrett Browning , Anthony Trollope , Eadweard Muybridge and Evelyn Waugh .  They continued to publish previously unpublished Dickens material well into the 20th century. Another popular author on the books in the 1880s was Henry Hawley Smart .

The firm kept an office at 186 Strand and later at 193 Piccadilly [ 1 ] , as well as 11 Henrietta Street in Covent Garden .
