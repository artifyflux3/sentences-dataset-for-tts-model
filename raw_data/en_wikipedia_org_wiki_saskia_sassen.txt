1987) ​ Scientific career Fields Sociology , economics Institutions Columbia University , London School of Economics Thesis Non-dominant ethnic populations as a possible component of the U.S. political economy: the case of Blacks and Chicanos (1974) Website www .saskiasassen .com Saskia Sassen (born January 5, 1947) is a Dutch-American sociologist noted for her analyses of globalization and international human migration . She is a professor of sociology at Columbia University in New York City , and the London School of Economics . The term global city was coined and popularized by Sassen in her 1991 work The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo .

[ 1 ] Education [ edit ] From 1966, Sassen spent a year each at the Université de Poitiers , France, the Università degli Studi di Roma , and the University of Buenos Aires , for studies in philosophy and political science . From 1969, Sassen studied sociology and economics at the University of Notre Dame , Indiana , where she obtained a M.A.

in 1971 and a Ph.D.

degree in 1974, under the direction of Fabio Dasilva. She also received a master's degree in philosophy from the University of Poitiers in 1974.

Academic posts [ edit ] After being a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University , Sassen held various academic positions in and outside the US, such as the Ralph Lewis Professor of Sociology at the University of Chicago . She is currently Robert S. Lynd Professor of Sociology at Columbia University and Centennial Visiting professor of Political Economy in the Department of Sociology at the London School of Economics .

[ citation needed ] During the 1980s and 1990s, Sassen emerged as a prolific author in urban sociology . She studied the impacts of globalisation such as economic restructuring , and how the movements of labour and capital influence urban life. She also studied the influence of communication technology on governance. Sassen observed how nation states begin to lose power to control these developments, and she studied increasing general transnationalism , including transnational human migration . She identified and described the phenomenon of the global city . Her 1991 book bearing this title made her a widely quoted author on globalisation. An updated edition of her book was published in 2001. In the early 2000s, Sassen focused on immigration and globalization, with her "denationalization" and "transnationalism" projects (see Bibliography and External Links, below). Her books have been translated into 21 languages.
