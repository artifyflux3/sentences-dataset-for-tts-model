**Synthetic geometry** (sometimes referred to as **axiomatic geometry** or even **pure geometry**) is [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") without the use of [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinates "Coordinates"). It relies on the [axiomatic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_method "Axiomatic method") for proving all results from a few basic properties initially called [postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulate "Postulate"), and at present called [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom").

After the 17th-century introduction by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") of the coordinate method, which was called [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), the term "synthetic geometry" was coined to refer to the older methods that were, before Descartes, the only known ones.

According to [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein")

> Synthetic geometry is that which studies [figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape "Shape") as such, without recourse to formulae, whereas analytic geometry consistently makes use of such formulae as can be written down after the adoption of an appropriate system of coordinates.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry#cite_note-1)

The first systematic approach for synthetic geometry is [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements"). However, it appeared at the end of the 19th century that [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s postulates were not sufficient for characterizing geometry. The first complete [axiom system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_system "Axiom system") for geometry was given only at the end of the 19th century by [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert"). At the same time, it appeared that both synthetic methods and analytic methods can be used to build geometry. The fact that the two approaches are equivalent has been proved by [Emil Artin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Artin "Emil Artin") in his book _[Geometric Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric\_Algebra\_(book) "Geometric Algebra (book)")_.

Because of this equivalence, the distinction between synthetic and analytic geometry is no more in use, except at elementary level, or for geometries that are not related to any sort of numbers, such as some [finite geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry "Finite geometry") and [non-Desarguesian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Desarguesian_geometry "Non-Desarguesian geometry").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The process of logical synthesis begins with some arbitrary but definite starting point. This starting point is the introduction of primitive notions or primitives and axioms about these primitives:

*   **[Primitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion "Primitive notion")** are the most basic ideas. Typically they include both objects and relationships. In geometry, the objects are things such as _points_, _lines_ and _planes_, while a fundamental relationship is that of _incidence_ – of one object meeting or joining with another. The terms themselves are undefined. [Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") once remarked that instead of points, lines and planes one might just as well talk of tables, chairs and beer mugs,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry#cite_note-2) the point being that the primitive terms are just empty [placeholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_variables_and_bound_variables "Free variables and bound variables") and have no intrinsic properties.
*   **[Axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom")** are statements about these primitives; for example, _any two points are together incident with just one line_ (i.e. that for any two points, there is just one line which passes through both of them). Axioms are assumed true, and not proven. They are the _building blocks_ of geometric concepts, since they specify the properties that the primitives have.

From a given set of axioms, synthesis proceeds as a carefully constructed logical argument. When a significant result is proved rigorously, it becomes a **[theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem")**.

### Properties of axiom sets

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_geometry&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Properties of axiom sets")]

There is no fixed axiom set for geometry, as more than one [consistent set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency "Consistency") can be chosen. Each such set may lead to a different geometry, while there are also examples of different sets giving the same geometry. With this plethora of possibilities, it is no longer appropriate to speak of "geometry" in the singular.

Historically, Euclid's [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate") has turned out to be [independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(mathematical_logic) "Independence (mathematical logic)") of the other axioms. Simply discarding it gives [absolute geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_geometry "Absolute geometry"), while negating it yields [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"). Other [consistent axiom sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency "Consistency") can yield other geometries, such as [projective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"), [elliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry"), [spherical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry") or [affine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry") geometry.

Axioms of continuity and "betweenness" are also optional, for example, [discrete geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry "Discrete geometry") may be created by discarding or modifying them.

Following the [Erlangen program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program "Erlangen program") of [Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein"), the nature of any given geometry can be seen as the connection between [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") and the content of the propositions, rather than the style of development.

Euclid's original treatment remained unchallenged for over two thousand years, until the simultaneous discoveries of the non-Euclidean geometries by [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss"), [Bolyai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai "János Bolyai"), [Lobachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Lobachevsky "Nikolai Lobachevsky") and [Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann") in the 19th century led mathematicians to question Euclid's underlying assumptions.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry#cite_note-3)

One of the early French analysts summarized synthetic geometry this way:

_The Elements_ of Euclid are treated by the synthetic method. This author, after having posed the _axioms_, and formed the requisites, established the propositions which he proves successively being supported by that which preceded, proceeding always from the _simple to compound_, which is the essential character of synthesis.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry#cite_note-4)
The heyday of synthetic geometry can be considered to have been the 19th century, when analytic methods based on [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") and [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") were ignored by some [geometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geometers "List of geometers") such as [Jakob Steiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Steiner "Jakob Steiner"), in favor of a purely synthetic development of [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"). For example, the treatment of the [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane") starting from axioms of incidence is actually a broader theory (with more [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory "Model theory")) than is found by starting with a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") of dimension three. Projective geometry has in fact the simplest and most elegant synthetic expression of any geometry.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry#cite_note-HBPK-5)

In his [Erlangen program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program "Erlangen program"), [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein") played down the tension between synthetic and analytic methods:

On the Antithesis between the Synthetic and the Analytic Method in Modern Geometry:The distinction between modern synthesis and modern analytic geometry must no longer be regarded as essential, inasmuch as both subject-matter and methods of reasoning have gradually taken a similar form in both. We choose therefore in the text as common designation of them both the term projective geometry. Although the synthetic method has more to do with space-perception and thereby imparts a rare charm to its first simple developments, the realm of space-perception is nevertheless not closed to the analytic method, and the formulae of analytic geometry can be looked upon as a precise and perspicuous statement of geometrical relations. On the other hand, the advantage to original research of a well formulated analysis should not be underestimated, - an advantage due to its moving, so to speak, in advance of the thought. But it should always be insisted that a mathematical subject is not to be considered exhausted until it has become intuitively evident, and the progress made by the aid of analysis is only a first, though a very important, step.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry#cite_note-6)
The close axiomatic study of [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") led to the construction of the [Lambert quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_quadrilateral "Lambert quadrilateral") and the [Saccheri quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccheri_quadrilateral "Saccheri quadrilateral"). These structures introduced the field of [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry") where Euclid's parallel axiom is denied. [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss "Gauss"), [Bolyai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolyai "Bolyai") and [Lobachevski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobachevski "Lobachevski") independently constructed [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"), where parallel lines have an [angle of parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_parallelism "Angle of parallelism") that depends on their separation. This study became widely accessible through the [Poincaré disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disc "Poincaré disc") model where [motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(geometry) "Motion (geometry)") are given by [Möbius transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation "Möbius transformation"). Similarly, [Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann"), a student of Gauss's, constructed [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry"), of which [elliptic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry") is a particular case.

Another example concerns [inversive geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversive_geometry "Inversive geometry") as advanced by [Ludwig Immanuel Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Immanuel_Magnus "Ludwig Immanuel Magnus"), which can be considered synthetic in spirit. The closely related operation of [reciprocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") expresses analysis of the plane.

[Karl von Staudt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Staudt "Karl von Staudt") showed that algebraic axioms, such as [commutativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutativity "Commutativity") and [associativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associativity "Associativity") of addition and multiplication, were in fact consequences of [incidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(geometry) "Incidence (geometry)") of lines in [geometric configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_configuration "Geometric configuration"). [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") showed[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry#cite_note-7) that the [Desargues configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues_configuration "Desargues configuration") played a special role. Further work was done by [Ruth Moufang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Moufang "Ruth Moufang") and her students. The concepts have been one of the motivators of [incidence geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry "Incidence geometry").

When [parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines "Parallel lines") are taken as primary, synthesis produces [affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry"). Though Euclidean geometry is both an affine and [metric geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_geometry "Metric geometry"), in general [affine spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") may be missing a metric. The extra flexibility thus afforded makes affine geometry appropriate for the study of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), as discussed in the [history of affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#History "Affine geometry").

In 1955 [Herbert Busemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Busemann "Herbert Busemann") and Paul J. Kelley sounded a nostalgic note for synthetic geometry:

Although reluctantly, geometers must admit that the beauty of synthetic geometry has lost its appeal for the new generation. The reasons are clear: not so long ago synthetic geometry was the only field in which the reasoning proceeded strictly from axioms, whereas this appeal — so fundamental to many mathematically interested people — is now made by many other fields.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry#cite_note-HBPK-5)
For example, college studies now include [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"), and [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory") where the subject is developed from first principles, and propositions are deduced by [elementary proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_proof "Elementary proof"). Expecting to replace synthetic with [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry") leads to loss of geometric content.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry#cite_note-8)

Today's student of geometry has axioms other than Euclid's available: see [Hilbert's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms "Hilbert's axioms") and [Tarski's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_axioms "Tarski's axioms").

[Ernst Kötter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_K%C3%B6tter "Ernst Kötter") published a (German) report in 1901 on _"The development of synthetic geometry from [Monge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monge "Monge") to Staudt (1847)"_;[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry#cite_note-9)

Proofs using synthetic geometry
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_geometry&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Proofs using synthetic geometry")]

Synthetic proofs of geometric theorems make use of auxiliary constructs (such as [helping lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_line "Auxiliary line")) and concepts such as equality of sides or angles and [similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry) "Similarity (geometry)") and [congruence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)") of triangles. Examples of such proofs can be found in the articles [Butterfly theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_theorem "Butterfly theorem"), [Angle bisector theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_bisector_theorem "Angle bisector theorem"), [Apollonius' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius%27_theorem "Apollonius' theorem"), [British flag theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_flag_theorem "British flag theorem"), [Ceva's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceva%27s_theorem "Ceva's theorem"), [Equal incircles theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_incircles_theorem "Equal incircles theorem"), [Geometric mean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean_theorem "Geometric mean theorem"), [Heron's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula "Heron's formula"), [Isosceles triangle theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_triangle_theorem "Isosceles triangle theorem"), [Law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines "Law of cosines"), and others that are linked to [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Theorems_in_plane_geometry "Category:Theorems in plane geometry").

Computational synthetic geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_geometry&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Computational synthetic geometry")]

In conjunction with [computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry "Computational geometry"), a **computational synthetic geometry** has been founded, having close connection, for example, with [matroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid "Matroid") theory. [Synthetic differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_differential_geometry "Synthetic differential geometry") is an application of [topos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topos "Topos") theory to the foundations of [differentiable manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold") theory.
