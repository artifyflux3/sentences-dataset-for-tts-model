"The Principles of the Art of Weighing") is a book about statics written by the Flemish physicist Simon Stevin in Dutch . It was published in 1586 in a single volume with De Weeghdaet ( lit.

"The Act of Weighing"), De Beghinselen des Waterwichts ("The Principles of Hydrostatics") and an Anhang (an appendix ).

[ 1 ] In 1605, there was another edition.

Importance [ edit ] The importance of the book was summarized by the Encyclopædia Britannica : [ 2 ] In De Beghinselen der Weeghconst (1586; “Statics and Hydrostatics”) Stevin published the theorem of the triangle of forces . The knowledge of this triangle of forces, equivalent to the parallelogram diagram of forces, gave a new impetus to the study of statics, which had previously been founded on the theory of the lever . He also discovered that the downward pressure of a liquid is independent of the shape of its vessel and depends only on its height and base.

Contents [ edit ] The first part consists of two books, together account for 95 pages, here divided into 10 pieces.
