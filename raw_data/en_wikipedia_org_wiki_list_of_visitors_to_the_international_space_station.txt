This is a list of all of the visitors to the International Space Station (ISS), including long-term crew, short-term visitors, and space tourists, in alphabetical order. ISS crew names are in bold . The suffix (twice, three times, ...) refers to the individual's number of spaceflights to the ISS, not the total number of spaceflights . Entries without a flag symbol indicate that the individual was an American citizen at launch. Entries without a female symbol ( ) are men.

Statistics [ edit ] As of April 8, 2024 [update] , 250 individuals [ 1 ] have made 411 spaceflights to the ISS, including the seven people currently at the ISS ( Expedition 65 ). Two people have made five spaceflights to the ISS, while five people have made four, 36 people made three and 84 people made two. Note that this list assigns individuals with dual citizenship to their country of primary residence at time of launch (for example, the Iranian - American space tourist Anousheh Ansari is only listed under the United States ).

Initially all private space travel was aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft . When only two crew members are required in the three-seat Soyuz, and additional cargo is not sent, the additional seat is sold to the general public through Space Adventures . Private travelers would remain on the ISS during handover from one expedition crew to the next, generally a week or two. The NASA Space Shuttle carried seven crew members, and the longest docking with the ISS was 11 days. Many visitors to the ISS were accommodated for short periods during NASA shuttle dockings.

NASA stated it was "not interested" in private spaceflight during construction of the ISS, but eventually began allowing up to two flights per year in 2019, with the first private visitors arriving at the US Orbital Segment in 2022 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon .

While Russia allowed private astronaut endeavours to visit the 23-year-old station as far back as 2001, NASA resisted the practice - until announcing a change in policy in 2019 designed to boost commercial opportunities.
