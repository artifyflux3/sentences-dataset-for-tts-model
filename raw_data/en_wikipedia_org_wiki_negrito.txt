Set of ethnic groups in Southeast Asia and Andaman islands This article is about the ethnic groups. For the shrub, see Citharexylum berlandieri . For the municipality, see El Negrito . For the bird genus, see Lessonia (bird) .

Not to be confused with Pygmy peoples .

Ethnic group Negrito A Luzon Negrito with spear Regions with significant populations Isolated geographic regions in India and Maritime Southeast Asia Languages Andamanese languages , Aslian languages , Philippine Negrito languages Religion Animism , folk religion , Anito , Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Hinduism The term Negrito ( / n ɪ ˈ ɡ r iː t oʊ / ; lit.

' little black people ' ) refers to several diverse ethnic groups who inhabit isolated parts of Southeast Asia and the Andaman Islands . Populations often described as Negrito include: the Andamanese peoples (including the Great Andamanese , the Onge , the Jarawa , and the Sentinelese ) of the Andaman Islands, the Semang peoples (among them, the Batek people ) of Peninsular Malaysia , the Maniq people of Southern Thailand , as well as the Aeta of Luzon , the Ati and Tumandok of Panay , the Mamanwa of Mindanao , and about 30 other officially recognized ethnic groups in the Philippines .

Etymology [ edit ] The word Negrito, the Spanish diminutive of negro , is used to mean "little black person." This usage was coined by 16th-century Spanish missionaries operating in the Philippines, and was borrowed by other European travellers and colonialists across Austronesia to label various peoples perceived as sharing relatively small physical stature and dark skin.

[ 1 ] Contemporary usage of an alternative Spanish epithet, Negrillos , also tended to bundle these peoples with the pygmy peoples of Central Africa on the basis of perceived similarities in stature and complexion.

[ 1 ] (Historically, the label Negrito has also been used to refer to African pygmies.) [ 2 ] The appropriateness of bundling peoples of different ethnicities by similarities in stature and complexion has been called into question.

[ 1 ] Population [ edit ] There are over 100,000 Negritos in the Philippines. In 2010, there were 50,236 Aeta people in the Philippines.

[ 3 ] There were 55,473 Ati people (2020 census).

[ 4 ] Officially, Malaysia had approximately 4,800 Negrito (Semangs).

[ 5 ] This number increases if we include some of the populations or individual groups among Orang Asli who have either assimilated Negrito population or have admixed origins. According to the 2006 census, the number of Orang Asli was 141,230 [ 6 ] Andamanese of India with just c. over 500. Thailand Negrito Maniq is estimated 300,  divided into several clans.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Other puts it at 382 [ 9 ] or less than 500.

[ 10 ] Culture [ edit ] Batek family in Malaysia.

Most groups designated as "Negrito" lived as hunter-gatherers , while some also used agriculture , such as plant harvesting. Today most live assimilated to the majority population of their respective homeland. Discrimination and poverty are often problems, caused either by their lower social position, their hunter-gatherer lifestyles, or both.

[ 11 ] Origins [ edit ] See also: Genetic history of East Asians and Peopling of Southeast Asia Position of various ethnic groups considered "Negrito". Negritos and Oceanians are most closely related to East Asians followed by Native Americans.

A young Onge mother with her baby ( Andaman Islands , India , 1905) Based on perceived physical similarities, Negritos were once considered a single population of closely related people. However, genetic studies suggest that they consist of several separate groups descended from the same ancient East Eurasian meta-population that gave rise to modern East Asian peoples and Oceanian peoples , as well as displaying genetic heterogeneity. The Negritos form the indigenous population of Southeast Asia, but were largely absorbed by Austroasiatic- and Austronesian-speaking groups who migrated from southern East Asia into Mainland and Insular Southeast Asia with the Neolithic expansion. The remainders form minority groups in geographically isolated regions.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Genetic studies provided mixed evidence of modern Negrito populations, with populations considered Negrito showing diverse admixtures. Although a genetic affinity between Andaman Islanders, Malaysian and Filipino Negritos was detected by some authors, several studies indicate that Negrito populations are closer to their neighboring non-Negrito communities in their paternal heritage and autosomal DNA on average.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Most modern groups considered Negrito possess significant admixture from Austronesian or Austroasiatic sources, with Negrito groups in the Philippines  found to have between 30 and 50% Austronesian ancestry.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] The Semang and Maniq in the interior of the Malay Peninsula share genetic affinities with ancient Hoabinhian hunter-gatherers, while also posessing ~35% East Asian related ancestry, likely brought about by recent admixture with surrounding agriculturalist communities in the region, according to the authors of a 2022 genetic study.

[ 25 ] It has been found that the physical and morphological phenotypes of Negritos, such as short stature, a wide and snub nose, curly hair and dark skin, " are shaped by novel mechanisms for adaptation to tropical rainforests " through convergent evolution and positive selection , rather than a remnant of a shared common ancestor, as suggested previously by some researchers.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] A Negrito-like population was most likely also present in Taiwan before the Neolithic expansion and must have persisted into historical times, as suggested by evidence from morphological features of human skeletal remains dating from around 6,000 years ago resembling Negritos (especially Aetas in northern Luzon), and further corroborated by Chinese reports from the Qing period rule of Taiwan (1684 to 1895) and from tales of Taiwanese indigenous peoples about people with "dark skin, short-and-small body stature, frizzy hair, and occupation in forested mountains or remote caves".

Although general similarities in size and proportions remain between the Andamanese and Aeta, differences in humero-femoral indices and arm length between these groups and the Efé demonstrate that there is not a generic 'pygmy' phenotype. Our interpretations of negrito origins and adaptation must account for this phenotypic variation.

We hypothesize that phenotypic convergence of the dark pigmentation in TIAs could have resulted from parallel (e.g., DDB1/DAK) or genetic convergence driven by admixture (e.g., MTHFD1 and RAD18), new mutations (e.g., STK11), or notably purifying selection (e.g., MC1R).
