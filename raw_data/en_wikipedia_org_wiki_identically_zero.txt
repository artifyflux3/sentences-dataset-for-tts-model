Basic properties [ edit ] An example of a constant function is y ( x ) = 4 , because the value of y ( x ) is 4 regardless of the input value x .

As a real-valued function of a real-valued argument, a constant function has the general form y ( x ) = c or just y = c .

For example, the function y ( x ) = 4 is the specific constant function where the output value is c = 4 . The domain of this function is the set of all real numbers . The image of this function is the singleton set {4} . The independent variable x does not appear on the right side of the function expression and so its value is "vacuously substituted"; namely y (0) = 4 , y (−2.7) = 4 , y (π) = 4 , and so on. No matter what value of x is input, the output is 4 .

[ 1 ] The graph of the constant function y = c is a horizontal line in the plane that passes through the point (0, c ) .

[ 2 ] In the context of a polynomial in one variable x , the constant function is called non-zero constant function because it is a polynomial of degree 0, and its general form is f ( x ) = c , where c is nonzero. This function has no intersection point with the x - axis, meaning it has no root (zero) . On the other hand, the polynomial f ( x ) = 0 is the identically zero function . It is the (trivial) constant function and every x is a root. Its graph is the x - axis in the plane.

[ 3 ] Its graph is symmetric with respect to the y - axis, and therefore a constant function is an even function .

[ 4 ] In the context where it is defined, the derivative of a function is a measure of the rate of change of function values with respect to change in input values. Because a constant function does not change, its derivative is 0.

[ 5 ] This is often written: ( x ↦ ↦ c ) ′ = 0 {\displaystyle (x\mapsto c)'=0} . The converse is also true. Namely, if y ′( x ) = 0 for all real numbers x , then y is a constant function.

[ 6 ] For example, given the constant function y ( x ) = − − 2 {\displaystyle y(x)=-{\sqrt {2}}} .

The derivative of y is the identically zero function y ′ ( x ) = ( x ↦ ↦ − − 2 ) ′ = 0 {\displaystyle y'(x)=\left(x\mapsto -{\sqrt {2}}\right)'=0} .

Other properties [ edit ] For functions between preordered sets , constant functions are both order-preserving and order-reversing ; conversely, if f is both order-preserving and order-reversing, and if the domain of f is a lattice , then f must be constant.

Every constant function whose domain and codomain are the same set X is a left zero of the full transformation monoid on X , which implies that it is also idempotent .

It has zero slope or gradient .

Every constant function between topological spaces is continuous .

A constant function factors through the one-point set , the terminal object in the category of sets . This observation is instrumental for F. William Lawvere 's axiomatization of set theory, the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets (ETCS).

[ 7 ] For any non-empty X , every set Y is isomorphic to the set of constant functions in X → → Y {\displaystyle X\to Y} . For any X and each element y in Y , there is a unique function y ~ ~ : X → → Y {\displaystyle {\tilde {y}}:X\to Y} such that y ~ ~ ( x ) = y {\displaystyle {\tilde {y}}(x)=y} for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} . Conversely, if a function f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} satisfies f ( x ) = f ( x ′ ) {\displaystyle f(x)=f(x')} for all x , x ′ ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x,x'\in X} , f {\displaystyle f} is by definition a constant function.

As a corollary, the one-point set is a generator in the category of sets.

Every set X {\displaystyle X} is canonically isomorphic to the function set X 1 {\displaystyle X^{1}} , or hom set hom ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 , X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {hom} (1,X)} in the category of sets, where 1 is the one-point set. Because of this, and the adjunction between Cartesian products and hom in the category of sets (so there is a canonical isomorphism between functions of two variables and functions of one variable valued in functions of another (single) variable, hom ⁡ ⁡ ( X × × Y , Z ) ≅ ≅ hom ⁡ ⁡ ( X ( hom ⁡ ⁡ ( Y , Z ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {hom} (X\times Y,Z)\cong \operatorname {hom} (X(\operatorname {hom} (Y,Z))} ) the category of sets is a closed monoidal category with the Cartesian product of sets as tensor product and the one-point set as tensor unit. In the isomorphisms λ λ : 1 × × X ≅ ≅ X ≅ ≅ X × × 1 : ρ ρ {\displaystyle \lambda :1\times X\cong X\cong X\times 1:\rho } natural in X , the left and right unitors are the projections p 1 {\displaystyle p_{1}} and p 2 {\displaystyle p_{2}} the ordered pairs ( ∗ ∗ , x ) {\displaystyle (*,x)} and ( x , ∗ ∗ ) {\displaystyle (x,*)} respectively to the element x {\displaystyle x} , where ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle *} is the unique point in the one-point set.

A function on a connected set is locally constant if and only if it is constant.
