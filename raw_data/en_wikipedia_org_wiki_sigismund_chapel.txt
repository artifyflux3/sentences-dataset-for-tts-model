Sigismund's Chapel (1519–1533) Sigismund's Chapel (right) and the later-period Vasa Chapel (left) Sigismund's Chapel ( Polish : kaplica Zygmuntowska ) is a royal chapel of the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków , Poland . Built as a funerary chapel for the last members of the Jagiellonian Dynasty , it has been hailed by many art historians as "the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps".

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Financed by King Sigismund I the Old , it was built in 1519–33 by Italian architect Bartolomeo Berrecci .

A square-based chapel with a golden dome houses the tombs of its founder King Sigismund, as well as King Sigismund II Augustus and Anna Jagiellon . The inner sculptures, stuccos and paintings were designed by some of the most renowned artists of the age, including the architect Berrecci himself, Georg Pencz , Santi Gucci and Hermann Vischer .
