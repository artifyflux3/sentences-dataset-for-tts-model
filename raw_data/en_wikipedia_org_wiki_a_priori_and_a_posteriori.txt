**_A priori_** ('from the earlier') and **_a posteriori_** ('from the later') are [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") phrases used in [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") to distinguish types of [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge"), [justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_(epistemology) "Justification (epistemology)"), or [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Argument") by their reliance on experience. _A priori_ knowledge is independent from any [experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience "Experience"). Examples include [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"),[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-1)[tautologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic) "Tautology (logic)") and [deduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning") from [pure reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_reason "Pure reason").[[ii]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-2)_A posteriori_ knowledge depends on [empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence "Empirical evidence"). Examples include most fields of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and aspects of [personal knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence "Anecdotal evidence").

The terms originate from the analytic methods found in _[Organon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organon "Organon")_, a collection of works by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"). _[Prior analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior\_analytics "Prior analytics")_ (_a priori_) is about [deductive logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning"), which comes from definitions and first principles. _[Posterior analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior\_analytics "Posterior analytics")_ (_a posteriori_) is about [inductive logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning"), which comes from observational evidence.

Both terms appear in [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s _[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_ and were popularized by [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant")'s _[Critique of Pure Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique\_of\_Pure\_Reason "Critique of Pure Reason")_, an influential work in the [history of philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_philosophy "History of philosophy").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBird1995[httpsarchiveorgdetailsoxfordcompaniont00hondpage439_439]-3) Both terms are primarily used as [modifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_modifier "Grammatical modifier") to the [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun") "knowledge" (e.g., "_a priori_ knowledge"). _A priori_ can be used to modify other nouns such as "truth". Philosophers may use _apriority_, _apriorist_ and _aprioricity_ as nouns referring to the quality of being _a priori_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-4)

Consider the [proposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_(philosophy) "Proposition (philosophy)"): "If [George V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V "George V") reigned at least four days, then he reigned more than three days." This is something that one knows _a priori_ because it expresses a statement that one can derive by reason alone.

Consider the proposition: "George V reigned from 1910 to 1936." This is something that (if true) one must come to know _a posteriori_ because it expresses an empirical fact unknowable by reason alone.

Aprioricity, analyticity and necessity

### Relation to the analytic–synthetic distinction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_priori_and_a_posteriori&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Relation to the analytic–synthetic distinction")]

Several philosophers, in reaction to [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant"), sought to explain _a priori_ knowledge without appealing to what [Paul Boghossian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Boghossian "Paul Boghossian") describes as "a special faculty [intuition]... that has never been described in satisfactory terms."[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-Boghossianj_1996-5) One theory, popular among the [logical positivists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism "Logical positivism") of the early 20th century, is what Boghossian calls the "analytic explanation of the a priori".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-Boghossianj_1996-5) The distinction between [analytic and synthetic propositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic%E2%80%93synthetic_distinction "Analytic–synthetic distinction") was first introduced by Kant. While his original distinction was primarily drawn in terms of conceptual containment, the contemporary version of such distinction primarily involves, as American philosopher [Willard Van Orman Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine "Willard Van Orman Quine") put it, the notions of "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-Q21-6)

**Analytic propositions** are considered true by virtue of their meaning alone, while _a posteriori_ propositions by virtue of their meaning and of certain facts about the world. According to the analytic explanation of the _a priori_, all _a priori_ knowledge is analytic; so _a priori_ knowledge need not require a special faculty of pure [intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition "Intuition"), since it can be accounted for simply by one's ability to understand the meaning of the proposition in question. More simply, proponents of this explanation claimed to have reduced a dubious [metaphysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") faculty of pure reason to a legitimate linguistic notion of analyticity.

The analytic explanation of _a priori_ knowledge has undergone several criticisms. Most notably, Quine argues that the analytic–synthetic distinction is illegitimate:[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-7)

> But for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith.

Although the soundness of Quine's proposition remains uncertain, it had a powerful effect on the project of explaining the _a priori_ in terms of the analytic.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-8)

### Relation to the necessary truths and contingent truths

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_priori_and_a_posteriori&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Relation to the necessary truths and contingent truths")]

The metaphysical distinction between _necessary_ and _contingent_ truths has also been related to _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ knowledge.

A proposition that is [necessarily true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic "Modal logic") is one in which its negation is self-contradictory; it is true in every [possible world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world "Possible world"). For example, considering the proposition "all bachelors are unmarried:" its negation (i.e. the proposition that some bachelors are married) is incoherent due to the concept of being unmarried (or the meaning of the word "unmarried") being tied to part of the concept of being a bachelor (or part of the definition of the word "bachelor"). To the extent that contradictions are impossible, self-contradictory propositions are necessarily false as it is impossible for them to be true. The negation of a self-contradictory proposition is, therefore, supposed to be necessarily true.

By contrast, a proposition that is **contingently true** is one in which its negation is not self-contradictory. Thus, it is said _not_ to be true in every possible world. As Jason Baehr suggests, it seems plausible that all necessary propositions are known _a priori_, because "[s]ense experience can tell us only about the actual world and hence about what is the case; it can say nothing about what must or must not be the case."[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-9)

Following Kant, some philosophers have considered the relationship between _aprioricity_, _analyticity_ and _necessity_ to be extremely close. According to [Jerry Fodor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Fodor "Jerry Fodor"), "[positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism "Logical positivism"), in particular, took it for granted that _a priori_ truths must be necessary."[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-10) Since Kant, the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions has slightly changed. [Analytic propositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic-synthetic_distinction "Analytic-synthetic distinction") were largely taken to be "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact",[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-Q21-6) while synthetic propositions were not—one must conduct some sort of empirical investigation, looking to the world, to determine the [truth-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth-value "Truth-value") of synthetic propositions.

Aprioricity, analyticity and necessity have since been more clearly separated from each other. American philosopher [Saul Kripke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke "Saul Kripke") (1972), for example, provides strong arguments against this position, whereby he contends that there are necessary _a posteriori_ truths. For example, the proposition that water is H 2 O (if it is true): According to Kripke, this statement is both _necessarily true_, because water and H 2 O are the same thing, they are identical in every possible world, and truths of identity are logically necessary; and _a posteriori_, because it is known only through empirical investigation. Following such considerations of Kripke and others (see [Hilary Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Putnam "Hilary Putnam")), philosophers tend to distinguish the notion of aprioricity more clearly from that of necessity and analyticity.

Kripke's definitions of these terms diverge in subtle ways from Kant's. Taking these differences into account, Kripke's controversial analysis of naming as contingent and _a priori_ would, according to [Stephen Palmquist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Palmquist "Stephen Palmquist"), best fit into Kant's epistemological framework by calling it "analytic a posteriori."[[iii]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-11)[Aaron Sloman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Sloman "Aaron Sloman") presented a brief defence of Kant's three distinctions (analytic/synthetic, apriori/empirical and necessary/contingent), in that it did not assume "possible world semantics" for the third distinction, merely that some part of _this_ world might have been different.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-FOOTNOTESloman1965-12)

The relationship between aprioricity, necessity and analyticity is not easy to discern. Most philosophers at least seem to agree that while the various distinctions may overlap, the notions are clearly not identical: the _a priori_/_a posteriori_ distinction is [epistemological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"); the analytic/synthetic distinction is [linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"); and the necessary/contingent distinction is [metaphysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-13)

The term _a priori_ is [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") for 'from what comes before' (or, less literally, 'from first principles, before experience'). In contrast, the term _a posteriori_ is [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") for 'from what comes later' (or 'after experience').

They appear in Latin translations of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s _[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_, a work widely considered during the [early European modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_Europe "Early modern Europe") period as the model for precise thinking.

An early philosophical use of what might be considered a notion of _a priori_ knowledge (though not called by that name) is [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")'s [_theory of recollection_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innatism "Innatism"), related in the dialogue _[Meno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meno "Meno")_, according to which something like _a priori_ knowledge is knowledge inherent, [intrinsic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_properties_(philosophy) "Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)") in the human mind.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Albert of Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_of_Saxony_(philosopher) "Albert of Saxony (philosopher)"), a 14th-century logician, wrote on both _a priori_ and _a posteriori_.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-EB-14)

The early modern [Thomistic philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomism "Thomism")[John Sergeant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sergeant_(priest) "John Sergeant (priest)") differentiates the terms by the direction of inference regarding proper causes and effects. To demonstrate something _a priori_ is to "Demonstrate Proper Effects from Proper Efficient Causes" and likewise to demonstrate _a posteriori_ is to demonstrate "Proper Efficient Causes from Proper Effects", according to his 1696 work _[The Method to Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The\_Method\_to\_Science&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Method to Science (page does not exist)")_ Book III, Lesson IV, Section 7.

[G. W. Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._W._Leibniz "G. W. Leibniz") introduced a distinction between _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ criteria for the possibility of a notion in his short treatise "Meditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas" (1684). _A priori_ and _a posteriori_ arguments for the existence of God appear in his _[Monadology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology "Monadology")_ (1714).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-FOOTNOTELook2007-15)

[George Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley "George Berkeley") outlined the distinction in his 1710 work _[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Treatise\_Concerning\_the\_Principles\_of\_Human\_Knowledge "A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge")_ (para. XXI).

The 18th-century German philosopher [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") (1781) advocated a blend of [rationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism") and [empiricist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism") theories. Kant says, "Although all our cognition begins with experience, it does not follow that it arises from [is caused by] experience."[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-kant_1781-16) According to Kant, _a priori_ cognition is [transcendental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_(philosophy) "Transcendence (philosophy)"), or based on the _form_ of all possible experience, while _a posteriori_ cognition is empirical, based on the _content_ of experience:[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori#cite_note-kant_1781-16)

> It is quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognition supplies from itself sensuous impressions [sense data] giving merely the _occasion_ [opportunity for a cause to produce its effect].

Contrary to contemporary usages of the term, Kant believes that _a priori_ knowledge is not entirely independent of the content of experience. Unlike the [rationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism"), Kant thinks that _a priori_ cognition, in its pure form, that is without the admixture of any empirical content, is limited to the deduction of the [conditions of possible experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_of_possibility "Condition of possibility"). These _a priori_, or transcendental, conditions are seated in one's cognitive faculties, and are not provided by experience in general or any experience in particular (although an argument exists that _a priori_ intuitions can be "triggered" by experience).

Kant nominated and explored the possibility of a [transcendental logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_logic "Transcendental logic") with which to consider the deduction of the _a priori_ in its pure form. [Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space"), [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") and [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality") are considered pure _a priori_ intuitions. Kant reasoned that the pure _a priori_ intuitions are established via his [transcendental aesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_aesthetic "Transcendental aesthetic") and transcendental logic. He claimed that the human subject would not have the kind of experience that it has were these _a priori_ forms not in some way constitutive of him as a human subject. For instance, a person would not experience the world as an orderly, rule-governed place unless time, space and causality were determinant functions in the form of perceptual faculties, i.e., there can be no experience in general without space, time or causality as particular determinants thereon. The claim is more formally known as Kant's [transcendental deduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_idealism "Transcendental idealism") and it is the central argument of his major work, the _[Critique of Pure Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique\_of\_Pure\_Reason "Critique of Pure Reason")_. The transcendental deduction argues that time, space and causality are ideal as much as real. In consideration of a possible logic of the _a priori_, this most famous of Kant's deductions has made the successful attempt in the case for the fact of [subjectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity "Subjectivity"), what constitutes subjectivity and what relation it holds with objectivity and the empirical.

After Kant's death, a number of philosophers saw themselves as correcting and expanding his philosophy, leading to the various forms of [German Idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Idealism "German Idealism"). One of these philosophers was [Johann Fichte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Fichte "Johann Fichte"). His student (and critic), [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer "Arthur Schopenhauer"), accused him of rejecting the distinction between _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ knowledge:

> ... Fichte who, because the [thing-in-itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself "Thing-in-itself") had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(psychology) "Representation (psychology)"), and therefore let the knowing [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(philosophy) "Subject (philosophy)") be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the [Kantian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") doctrine, the distinction between _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ and thus that between the [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon "Phenomenon") and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be _a priori_, naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to [intellectual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual "Intellectual")[intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge) "Intuition (knowledge)"), that is, really to [inspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention "Invention").
