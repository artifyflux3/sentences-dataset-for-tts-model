In geometry , the director circle of an ellipse or hyperbola (also called the orthoptic circle or Fermat–Apollonius circle ) is a circle consisting of all points where two perpendicular tangent lines to the ellipse or hyperbola cross each other.

Properties [ edit ] The director circle of an ellipse circumscribes the minimum bounding box of the ellipse.  It has the same center as the ellipse, with radius a 2 + b 2 {\textstyle {\sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}} , where a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are the semi-major axis and semi-minor axis of the ellipse. Additionally, it has the property that, when viewed from any point on the circle, the ellipse spans a right angle .

[ 1 ] The director circle of a hyperbola has radius a 2 − − b 2 {\textstyle {\sqrt {a^{2}-b^{2}}}} , and so, may not exist in the Euclidean plane , but could be a circle with imaginary radius in the complex plane .

The director circle of a circle is a concentric circle having radius 2 {\textstyle {\sqrt {2}}} times the radius of the original circle.

Generalization [ edit ] More generally, for any collection of points P i , weights w i , and constant C , one can define a circle as the locus of points X such that ∑ ∑ i w i d ( X , P i ) 2 = C .

{\displaystyle \sum _{i}w_{i}\,d(X,P_{i})^{2}=C.} The director circle of an ellipse is a special case of this more general construction with two points P 1 and P 2 at the foci of the ellipse, weights w 1 = w 2 = 1 , and C equal to the square of the major axis of the ellipse. The Apollonius circle , the locus of points X such that the ratio of distances of X to two foci P 1 and P 2 is a fixed constant r , is another special case, with w 1 = 1 , w 2 = – r 2 , and C = 0 .

Related constructions [ edit ] In the case of a parabola the director circle degenerates to a straight line, the directrix of the parabola.
