The Dirac Medal of the ICTP is given each year by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in honour of physicist Paul Dirac . The award, announced each year on 8 August (Dirac's birthday), was first awarded in 1985.

[ 1 ] An international committee of distinguished scientists selects the winners from a list of nominated candidates. The Committee invites nominations from scientists working in the fields of theoretical physics or mathematics.

The Dirac Medal of the ICTP is not awarded to Nobel Laureates , Fields Medalists , or Wolf Prize winners.

[ 1 ] However, several Dirac Medallists have subsequently won one of these awards.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The medallists receive a prize of US$5,000.

Recipients [ edit ] Year Laureates For 1985 Edward Witten "path-opening contributions to the physics of elementary particles and gravity, to the search for unification , and to the imaginative pursuit of the implications for cosmology ." [ 1 ] Yakov Zel'dovich "far-ranging contributions to relativistic astrophysics , particularly in theories of compact objects and cosmic evolution." [ 1 ] 1986 Alexander Polyakov "being among the first to emphasize the importance of scale invariance in quantum field theory , particularly in connection with the theory of critical phenomena ." [ 1 ] Yoichiro Nambu "being one of the first physicists to formulate the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking and in particular, chiral symmetry breaking in relativistic particle physics. His contributions to the quark model in the 1960s and, later, his geometrical formulation of the dual resonance models as the dynamics of a relativistic string theory are of fundamental importance." [ 1 ] 1987 Bruno Zumino "fundamental contributions to the study of chiral anomalies in gauge theories with fermions. Also in collaboration with Prof.

[Julius] Wess , he proposed the first renormalizable Lagrangian field theories to realize supersymmetry in 4-dimensional space-time. With Prof.

Stanley Deser he constructed one of the first supergravity theories in four dimensions. In addition to this important early work, he has been a leader in the application of modern geometrical ideas in field theory." [ 6 ] Bryce DeWitt "his fundamental contributions to the study of classical and quantum gravity and non-Abelian gauge theory. His pioneering work with quantum, effective action underlies much of the modern formalism. Particularly important are the background field method which he invented, and the methodology of ghost loops in gauge theory, which he did much to develop." [ 6 ] 1988 David J. Gross "his fundamental contributions to the understanding of nuclear forces at short distances and to the theory of superstrings . Together with F. Wilczek and, independently, H. D. Politzer and G. H. 't Hooft , he discovered the mechanism of asymptotic freedom in non-Abelian gauge theories. This discovery, which accounts for the phenomenon of scaling in deep inelastic interactions , was central to the development of quantum chromodynamics as a viable model for the nuclear force. His invention, together with [Jeffrey A.] Harvey , [Emil] Martinec and [Ryan] Rohm , of the heterotic superstring model enlarges the theoretical understanding of string theory and has provided a great stimulus to research in this subject." [ 7 ] Efim S. Fradkin "his many fruitful contributions to the development of quantum field theory and statistics. Among these are his early work on functional methods including his formal solution to the Schwinger-Dyson equations for the Green's functions of interacting systems. This result has become a standard part of modern quantum field theory. Independently of [Yasushi] Takahashi he discovered the generalized Ward identities for electrodynamics . These identities and their generalizations for non-Abelian gauge theories are basic to the understanding of local symmetries." [ 7 ] 1989 John H. Schwarz "their basic contributions to the development of superstring theory. Most significant was their discovery that chiral gauge anomalies are absent for a class of ten dimensional superstring theories. This provided a strong indication that superstring theory with a specific gauge symmetry may provide a consistent unified quantum theory of the fundamental forces including gravity. It led to an explosion of interest in string theory which has already spurred remarkable advances both in mathematical physics and in pure mathematics." [ 8 ] Michael Green 1990 Ludwig Faddeev "researches in the area of quantum field theory and mathematical physics. His name is well known in theoretical physics in connection with the Three Body System ( Faddeev's equation ). He made decisive contributions to the quantization of the Yang-Mills and gravitational field. The Faddeev-Popov covariant prescription of quantization of non-Abelian gauge theories discovered in 1966-67 has many essential applications including quantum effects in the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg model of electroweak interactions and in quantum chromodynamics." [ 9 ] Sidney R. Coleman "his contributions to quantum field theory and particle physics. His work on quantum field theories has greatly clarified their structure. This includes the classification of all possible bosonic symmetries of S-matrix (with J. Mandula ) and the study of some fundamental properties of two-dimensional quantum field theories including, in particular, the absence of symmetry breaking and aspects of boson-fermion equivalence." [ 9 ] 1991 Jeffrey Goldstone "his fundamental clarification of spontaneous symmetry violation in relativistic quantum field theory." [ 10 ] Stanley Mandelstam "his contributions to the development of theoretical physics." [ 10 ] 1992 Nikolai Bogoliubov "many outstanding contributions in physics and mathematics." [ 10 ] Yakov G. Sinai 1993 Daniel Z. Freedman "for their discovery of supergravity theory in 1976 and their major contributions in the subsequent developments of the theory. Their discovery led to an explosion of interest in quantum gravity and it transformed the subject, playing a significant role in very important developments in string theory as well as Kaluza-Klein theory ." [ 11 ] Peter van Nieuwenhuizen Sergio Ferrara 1994 Frank Wilczek "his contributions to the development of theoretical physics. In 1973 he was one of the discoverers of the phenomenon of "asymptotic freedom" in non-Abelian gauge theories. This fundamental observation - that the effective interaction at short distances becomes weak, even in strongly interacting systems - led to the development of a realistic model for hadron physics." [ 12 ] 1995 Michael Berry "for his discovery of the non-integrable phase that arises in adiabatic processes in quantum theory. This effect was first detected in 1986 in an optics experiment by [Akira] Tomita and [Raymond] Chiao in which the rotation of the polarization plane of a wave propagating in a twisted optical fibre was interpreted as a Berry phase ." [ 13 ] 1996 Martinus J.G. Veltman "his pioneering investigations on the renormalizability of gauge theories and consequently, his analysis of the sensitivity of radiative corrections to both the mass differences in fermion doublets and the Higgs particle mass. These calculations provided the basic prediction in the search for the top quark mass." [ 14 ] Tullio Regge "crucial contributions in theoretical and mathematical physics starting with his seminal investigation of the asymptotic behavior of potential scattering processes through the analytic continuation of the angular momentum to the complex plane. The so-called Regge trajectories have helped in the classification of particles and resonances by grouping together entities with different spin. The so-called Regge behavior was, and still is, an important ingredient in the construction of string theories." [ 14 ] 1997 David Olive "their farsighted and highly influential contributions to theoretical physics, over an extended period. Goddard and Olive have contributed many crucial insights that shaped our emerging understanding of string theory and have also had a far-reaching impact on our understanding of four-dimensional field theory." [ 15 ] Peter Goddard 1998 Roman Jackiw "use of quantum field theory to illuminate physical problems. The derivation by Adler (and, independently, Weisberger) of a sum rule for pion -nucleon scattering marked a breakthrough in our understanding of the currents and broken symmetries of the strong interactions. Jackiw made a major contribution to field theories relevant to condensed matter physics in his discovery (with [Claudio] Rebbi) of fractional charge and spin in these theories. The paths of Adler and Jackiw (with [John Stewart] Bell ) crossed in what may be their most important discovery: the celebrated triangle anomaly , one of the most profound examples of the relevance of quantum field theory to the real world." [ 16 ] Stephen L. Adler 1999 Giorgio Parisi "his original and deep contributions to many areas of physics ranging from the study of scaling violations in deep inelastic processes ( Altarelli-Parisi equations ), the proposal of the superconductor 's flux confinement model as a mechanism for quark confinement , the use of supersymmetry in statistical classical systems, the introduction of multifractals in turbulence , the stochastic differential equation for growth models for random aggregation (the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang model ) and his groundbreaking analysis of the replica method that has permitted an important breakthrough in our understanding of glassy systems and has proved to be instrumental in the whole subject of Disordered Systems ." [ 17 ] 2000 Helen Quinn "pioneering contributions to the quest for a unified theory of quarks and leptons and of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions." [ 18 ] Howard Georgi Jogesh Pati 2001 John Hopfield “important contributions in an impressively broad spectrum of scientific subjects. His special and rare gift is his ability to cross the inter-disciplinary boundary to discover new questions and propose answers that uncover the conceptual structure behind the experimental facts" [ 19 ] [ 20 ] 2002 Alan Guth "the development of the concept of inflation in cosmology. Although the history of the very early universe has not been firmly established, the idea of inflation has already had notable observational successes, and it has become the paradigm for fundamental studies in cosmology." [ 21 ] Andrei Linde Paul Steinhardt 2003 Robert Kraichnan "their distinct contributions to the theory of turbulence, particularly the exact results and the prediction of inverse cascades, and for identifying classes of turbulence problems for which in-depth understanding has been achieved." [ 22 ] Vladimir E. Zakharov 2004 Curtis Callan "theoretical developments of the late 60's and early 70's that led to the use of deep inelastic scattering for the elucidation of the nature of the strong interactions." [ 23 ] James Bjorken 2005 Patrick A. Lee "his work on weak localization and interaction effects, is being recognized for his pioneering contributions to our understanding of disordered and strongly interacting many-body systems." [ 24 ] Sam Edwards "his fundamental contributions to polymer physics , spin glass theory and the physics of granular matter ." [ 24 ] 2006 Peter Zoller "innovative and prolific work in atomic physics, including seminal work proposing methods to use trapped ions for quantum computing and describing how to realize the Bose-Hubbard model and associated phase transitions in ultracold gases." [ 25 ] 2007 John Iliopoulos "their work on the physics of the charm quark , a major contribution to the birth of the Standard Model, the modern theory of Elementary Particles." [ 26 ] Luciano Maiani 2008 Joe Polchinski "for their fundamental contributions to superstring theory. Their studies range from early work on orbifold compactifications, physics and mathematics of mirror symmetry, D-branes and black hole physics, as well as gauge theory-gravity correspondence . Their contributions in uncovering the strong-weak dualities between seemingly different string theories have enabled us to learn about regimes of quantum field theory which are not accessible to perturbative analysis." [ 27 ] Juan Maldacena Cumrun Vafa 2009 Roberto Car "developing the ab initio simulation method in which they combined, elegantly and imaginatively, the quantum mechanical density functional method for the calculation of the electronic properties of matter with molecular dynamics methods for the Newtonian simulation of atomic motions." [ 28 ] Michele Parrinello 2010 Nicola Cabibbo "their fundamental contributions to the understanding of weak interactions and other aspects of theoretical physics." [ 29 ] George Sudarshan 2011 Édouard Brézin "their independent pioneering work on field theoretical methods to the study of critical phenomena and phase transitions; in particular for their significant contributions to conformal field theories and integrable systems." [ 30 ] John Cardy Alexander Zamolodchikov 2012 Duncan Haldane "their many important contributions to condensed matter physics, including their independent work preparing and opening the field of two and three dimensional topological insulators ."
