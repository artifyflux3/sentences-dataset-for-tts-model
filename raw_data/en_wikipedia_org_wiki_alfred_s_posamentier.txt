Posamentier Alfred S. Posamentier (born October 18, 1942) is an American educator and a lead commentator on American math and science education , regularly contributing to The New York Times and other news publications.

[ 1 ] He has created original math and science curricula, emphasized the need for increased math and science funding, promulgated criteria by which to select math and science educators, advocated the importance of involving parents in K-12 math and science education, and provided myriad curricular solutions for teaching critical thinking in math.

Dr. Posamentier was a member of the New York State Education Commissioner's Blue Ribbon Panel on the Math-A Regents Exams. He served on the Commissioner's Mathematics Standards Committee, which redefined the Standards for New York State. And he served on the New York City schools’ Chancellor's Math Advisory Panel.

[ 2 ] Posamentier earned a Ph.D. in mathematics education from Fordham University (1973), a master's degree in mathematics education from the City College of the City University of New York (1966) and an A.B. degree in mathematics from Hunter College of the City University of New York.

[ 3 ] Life [ edit ] Posamentier was born in Manhattan in New York City, the son of Austrian immigrants. He has one daughter (Lisa Joan Perlman, born in 1970), and one son (David Richard Posamentier, born in 1978). He resides in River Vale , New Jersey. He is professor emeritus of mathematics education and former dean of the School of Education at The City College of the City University of New York, where he spent over 40 years. For the next five years he was Dean of the School of Education and professor of mathematics education at Mercy University, New York. Dr. Posamentier then was invited to take on the position of Executive Director for Internationalization and Funded Programs at Long Island University, New York. After three years at LIU, he took on his current position as Distinguished Lecturer at The New York City College of Technology/City University of New York. He began his career as a mathematics teacher for six years at Theodore Roosevelt High School (Bronx, New York).

Awards and honors [ edit ] In 1989, Posamentier was made an Honorary Fellow at the London South Bank University (London, England). In recognition of his outstanding teaching, the City College Alumni Association named him Educator of the Year in 1994, and in 2009 New York City had the day, May 1, 1994, named in his honor by the President of the New York City Council. In 1994, he was also awarded the Grand Medal of Honor from the Republic of Austria , [ citation needed ] and in 1999, upon approval of Parliament, the President of the Republic of Austria awarded him the title of University Professor of Austria. In 2003 he was awarded the title of Ehrenbürger fellowship of the Vienna University of Technology , and in 2004 was awarded the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art, 1st class [ 4 ] from the President of the Republic of Austria. In 2005 he was inducted into the Hunter College Alumni Hall of Fame, and in 2006 he was awarded the prestigious Townsend Harris Medal by the City College Alumni Association. In 2009 he was inducted into the New York State Mathematics Educators Hall of Fame, and also that year he was Awarded the Christian Peter Beuth Prize in Berlin, Germany.

[ 2 ] In 2017 he was awarded Summa Cum Laude nemine discrepante from the Fundacion Sebastian, A. C. in Mexico City.

Publications [ edit ] Dr. Posamentier is the editor of the book series, Problem Solving in Mathematics and Beyond , which demonstrates the power and beauty of mathematics through clever problem-solving experiences. He has also authored or co-authored over 80 books, [ 5 ] including: Books' Mathematik: Arbeitsmaterialien (Klett, 1994) The Art of Problem Solving: A Resource for the Mathematics Teacher (Corwin, 1995) Challenging Problems in Algebra (Dover, 1996) Challenging Problems in Geometry (Dover, 1996) Tips for the Mathematics Teacher: Research-Based Strategies to Help Students Learn (Corwin, 1998) Advanced Euclidean Geometry (Wiley, 2002) Math Wonders: To Inspire Teachers and Students (ASCD, 2003) Math Charmers: Tantalizing Tidbits for the Mind (Prometheus Books, 2003) Pi: A Biography of the World's Most Mysterious Number (Prometheus Books, 2004) Progress in Mathematics: K-9 textbook series of 11 books (Sadlier-Oxford, 2006-2009) 101+ Great Ideas to Introduce Key Concepts in Mathematics (Corwin, 2006) What successful Math Teacher Do: Grades 6-12 (Corwin 2006, 2013) What successful Math Teacher Do: Grades K-5 (Corwin 2007) Exemplary Practices for Secondary Math Teachers (ASCD, 2007) The Fabulous Fibonacci Numbers (Prometheus Books, 2007, 2011) Problem-Solving Strategies for Efficient and Elegant Solutions, Grades 6-12 (Corwin, 2008) Problem Solving in Mathematics: Grades 3-6: Powerful Strategies to Deepen Understanding (Corwin, 2009) Mathematical Amazements and Surprises: Fascinating Figures and Noteworthy Numbers (Prometheus, 2009) The Pythagorean Theorem: Its Power and Glory (Prometheus, 2010) The Glorious Golden Ratio (Prometheus, 2012) The Art of Motivating Students for Mathematics Instructions (McGraw-Hill, 2012) The Secrets of Triangles (with Ingmar Lehmann, Prometheus, 2012) 100 commonly Asked Questions in Math Class (Corwin, 2013) Magnificent Mistakes in Mathematics (Prometheus, 2013) Geometry: Its Elements and Structure (Dover. 2014) Mathematisches Woerterbuch - English-Deutsch (Veritas, 2014) Mathematical Curiosities: A Treasure Trove of Unexpected Entertainments (Prometheus, 2014) Teaching Secondary School Mathematics: Techniques and Enrichment Units (Ninth Edition, Pearson, 2015 Problem-Solving Strategies in Mathematics (World Scientific, 2015) Numbers: Their Tales, Types and Treasures (Prometheus Books, 2015) Effective Techniques to Motivate Mathematics instruction (Routledge, 2016 The Circle: A Mathematical Exploration Beyond the Line (Prometheus Books, 2016) Strategy Games to Enhance Problem-solving Ability in Mathematics (World Scientific, 2017) The Joy of Mathematics: Marvels, Novelties, and Neglected Gems That Are Rarely Taught in Math Class (Prometheus Books, 2017) The Mathematics of Everyday Life, (Prometheus Books, 2018) The Mathematics Coach Handbook (World Scientific, 2019) Tools to Help Your Children Learn Math: Strategies, Curiosities, and Stories to make Math Fun for parents and Children (World Scientific, 2019) Solving Problems in Our Spatial World (World Scientific, 2019) The Psychology of Problem Solving: The Background to Successful Mathematics Thinking (World Scientific, 2020) Math Makers: The Lives and Works of 50 Famous Mathematicians (Prometheus Books, 2020) Understanding Mathematics Through Problem-Solving (World Scientific, 2020) The Joy of Geometry (Prometheus Books, 2021) Teaching Secondary School Mathematics: Techniques and Enrichment -10th Edition (World Scientific, 2021) Mathematics Entertainment for the Millions (World Scientific, 2020) Innovative Teaching: Best Practices from Business and Beyond for Mathematics Teachers (World Scientific, 2021) Math Tricks: the surprising wonders of shapes and numbers (Prometheus Books, 2021) Creative Secondary School Mathematics: 125 enrichment units for grades 7 to 12 (World Scientific, 2021) Geometry in Our Three-Dimensional World (World Scientific, 2022) Mathematics: Its Historical Aspects, Wonders, and Beyond (World Scientific, 2022) The Secrets Lives of Numbers: Numerals and Their Peculiarities in Mathematics and Beyond (Prometheus Books, 2022) Sharpening Everyday Mental/Thinking Skills Through Mathematics Problem Solving and Beyond (World Scientific, 2024) Geometric Gems: An Appreciation for Geometric Curiosities-- Volume 1: The Wonders of Triangles(World Scientific, 2024) Geometric Gems: An Appreciation for Geometric Curiosities-- Volume 2: The Wonders of Quadrilaterals (World Scientific, 2025) Geometric Gems: An Appreciation for Geometric Curiosities-- Volume 3: The Wonders of Circles (World Scientific, 2025) Articles: (after 1975) Refereed Journals: “Nine Strategies for Motivating Students in Mathematics” Edutopia, June 2017.
