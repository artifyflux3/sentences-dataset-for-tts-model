It uses colours and principles set out in ISO 3864 for these symbols, and is intended to provide "safety information that relies as little as possible on the use of words to achieve understanding." [ 1 ] The standard was published in October 2003, splitting off from ISO 3864:1984 , which set out design standards and colors of safety signage and merging ISO 6309:1987, Fire protection - Safety signs to create a unique and distinct standard for safety symbols.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] As of September 2022 [update] , the latest version is ISO 7010:2019, with 9 published amendments.

[ 4 ] This revision canceled and replaced ISO 20712-1:2008, incorporating the water safety signs and beach safety flags specified in it.

[ 5 ] Shape and colour [ edit ] ISO 7010 specifies five combinations of shape and colour to distinguish between the type of information presented.

[ 6 ] Shape and colour of sign types Sign type [ 1 ] Meaning Colour (per ISO 3864 -4) [ 7 ] Shape [ 7 ] Example Prohibition sign Must not do Red Circle with diagonal line No open flame Mandatory sign Must do Blue Circle Use hearing protection Warning sign Warn of hazard Yellow Equilateral triangle with rounded corners Explosive materials Safe condition sign Identifying of safety equipment and exits Green Square or rectangular Emergency assembly point Fire safety sign Identifying of firefighting equipment Red Square Fire extinguisher List [ edit ] ISO registers and lists recommended pictograms, which it calls "safety signs", on its website, ISO.org.  The ISO standard provides a registered number for pictograms that have officially been made part of the ISO 7010 standard.  Corresponding with the categories above, in ISO parlance, "E" numbers refer to E mergency (signs showing a safe condition), "F" numbers refer to F ire protection, "P" numbers refer to P rohibited actions, "M" numbers refer to M andatory actions, and "W" numbers refer to W arnings of hazards.

[ 8 ] According to the related ISO 3864-1 standard, if a symbol does not exist for a situation, the recommended solution is to use the relevant 'general' symbol (M001, P001, W001), along with a supplemental text message.

[ 9 ] Safe condition [ edit ] E001 – Emergency exit (left hand) E002 – Emergency exit (right hand) E003 – First aid E004 – Emergency telephone E007 – Evacuation assembly point E008 – Break to obtain access E009 – Doctor E010 – Automated external heart defibrillator E011 – Eyewash station E012 – Safety shower E013 – Stretcher E014 – Child seat presence and orientation detection system (CPOD) E015 – Drinking water E016 – Emergency window with escape ladder E017 – Rescue window E018 – Turn anticlockwise to open E019 – Turn clockwise to open E020 – Emergency stop button E021 – Protection shelter E022 – Door opens by pushing on the left-hand side E023 – Door opens by pushing on the right-hand side E024 – Evacuation temporary refuge E025 – Emergency hammer E026 – Emergency exit for people unable to walk or with walking impairment (left) E027 – Medical grab bag E028 – Oxygen resuscitator E029 – Emergency escape breathing device E030 – Emergency exit for people unable to walk or with walking impairment (right) E031 – Shipboard general alarm E032 – Shipboard assembly station E033 – Door slides right to open E034 – Door slides left to open E035 – Liferaft knife E036 – Lifeboat E037 – Rescue boat E038 – Liferaft E039 – Davit -launched liferaft E040 – Lifebuoy E041 – Lifebuoy with line E042 – Lifebuoy with light E043 – Lifebuoy with line and light E044 – Lifejacket E045 – Child's lifejacket E046 – Infant's lifejacket E047 – Search and rescue transponder E048 – Survival craft distress signals E049 – Rocket parachute flare E050 – Line-throwing appliance E051 – Two-way VHF radiotelephone apparatus E052 – Emergency position indicating radio beacon E053 – Embarkment ladder E054 – Marine evacuation slide E055 – Marine evacuation chute E056 – Survival clothing E057 – Door opens by pulling on the left-hand side E058 – Door opens by pulling on the right-hand side E059 – Embarkation ladder E060 – Evacuation chair E061 – Water life-saving equipment E062 – Tsunami evacuation area E063 – Tsunami evacuation building E064 – First aid responder E065 – Natural disaster outdoor refuge area E067 – Evacuation mattress E068 – Lifebuoy with light and smoke E069 – Person overboard call point E070 – Evacuation lift for people unable to use stairs Crescent variant [ edit ] ISO 7010 states on all symbols with a first aid cross , that it "may be replaced with another element appropriate to cultural requirements". In countries with a Muslim -majority population, an appropriate symbol is the crescent .
