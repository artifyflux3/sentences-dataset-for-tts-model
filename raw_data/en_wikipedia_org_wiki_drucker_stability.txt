[ 1 ] The postulates are named after Daniel C. Drucker . A material that does not satisfy these criteria is often found to be unstable in the sense that application of a load to a material point can lead to arbitrary deformations at that material point unless an additional length or time scale is specified in the constitutive relations .

The Drucker stability postulates are often invoked in nonlinear finite element analysis .  Materials that satisfy these criteria are generally well-suited for numerical analysis, while materials that fail to satisfy this criterion are likely to present difficulties (i.e. non-uniqueness or singularity) during the solution process.

Drucker's first stability criterion [ edit ] Drucker's first stability criterion (first proposed by Rodney Hill and also called Hill's stability criterion [ 2 ] ) is a strong condition on the incremental internal energy of a material which states that the incremental internal energy can only increase.  The criterion may be written as follows: d σ σ : d ε ε ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle {\text{d}}{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}:{\text{d}}{\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}\geq 0} , where d σ is the stress increment tensor associated with the strain increment tensor d ε through the constitutive relation.

Drucker's stability postulate [ edit ] Drucker's postulate is applicable to elastic-plastic materials and states that in a cycle of plastic deformation the second degree plastic work is always positive.  This postulate can be expressed in incremental form as d σ σ : d ε ε p ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle {\text{d}}{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}:{\text{d}}{\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}_{p}\geq 0} , where d ε p is the incremental plastic strain tensor.
