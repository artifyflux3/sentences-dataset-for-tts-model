287 BC – c.

212 BC). Consisting of 32 propositions , the work explores properties of and theorems related to the solids generated by revolution of conic sections about their axes, including paraboloids , hyperboloids , and spheroids .

[ 1 ] The principal result of the work is comparing the volume of any segment cut off by a plane with the volume of a cone with equal base and axis.

[ 2 ] The work is addressed to Dositheus of Pelusium.
