Employees 70 Annual budget $313.58 million for 2023 Agency executive Keith Sonderling [ 1 ] , Acting Director Website www.imls.gov The Institute of Museum and Library Services ( IMLS ) is an independent agency of the United States federal government established in 1996.  It is the main source of federal support for libraries and museums within the United States, having the mission to "advance, support, and empower America's museums, libraries, and related organizations through grantmaking, research, and policy development." [ 2 ] It has provided much of the funding for interlibrary loan programs in the United States.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In March 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order , titled "Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy", that directed that the IMLS be eliminated "to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law", along with several other agencies.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] On May 1, 2025 a lawsuit brought by the American Library Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees resulted in  the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia  granting a temporary restraining order to block the Trump Administration’s dismantling of IMLS.

[ 9 ] History and purpose [ edit ] IMLS was established by the Museum and Library Services Act (MLSA) on September 30, 1996, which includes the Library Services and Technology Act and the Museum Services Act.  It consolidated the activities of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science .

[ 10 ] The MLSA was reauthorized in 2003 and again in 2010.

[ 11 ] The law combined the Institute of Museum Services, [ 12 ] [ 13 ] which had been in existence since 1976 as part of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, and the Library Programs Office of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement [ 14 ] [ 15 ] which had been part of the Office of Education under various names since 1937.

[ 16 ] Lawmakers saw "great potential in an Institute that is focused on the combined roles that libraries and museums play in our community life." [ 17 ] [ 18 ] As amended, MLSA authorizes IMLS to promote improvements in library services; to facilitate access to resources in libraries; to encourage resource sharing among libraries; to support museums in fulfilling their public service and educational roles; to encourage leadership and innovation to enhance museum services; to assist museums in the conservation of America's heritage; to support museums in achieving the highest standards of management and service to the public; and to support resource sharing among museums, libraries and other organizations. MLSA also authorizes IMLS to carry out and publish analyses of the impact of museum and library services.

[ 19 ] Following a proposal by President George W. Bush , the activities of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science was consolidated under IMLS, along with some of the activities of the National Center for Education Statistics , in order to create a unified body for federal support of library and information policy.

[ 20 ] The consolidation took effect in early 2008.

The agency is a member of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities , along with the National Endowment for the Arts , the National Endowment for the Humanities , and the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities .

[ 21 ] In creating IMLS, Congress observed that the federal library and museum programs are far reaching, spanning cultural, educational, scientific, and information policy matters. Congress declared in the institute’s authorizing legislation, “Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens,” and an important role of the federal government is to promote education and access to information for people of all backgrounds, wherever located.

[ 22 ] By supporting museums and libraries throughout the nation, IMLS enables these organizations to carry out their public service role of connecting the whole of society with the cultural, artistic, historical, natural, and scientific understandings that constitute our heritage.

The Agency helps to ensure that all Americans have access to museum, library, and information services, and invests in new and exploratory approaches, as well as proven and tested methods. IMLS reports that it funds work that advances collective knowledge, lifelong learning, and cultural and civic engagement, as well as projects that support broadband access and advancing digital literacy, learning and education, civic engagement, climate change, and services that address historic and growing inequities. The Agency also builds capacity within the museum and library fields to enable better service to communities through workforce development grants and to enhance community decision making by sharing trends and data.

[ 23 ] IMLS supports a vast range of museums, including art, history, natural history, and children’s museums, zoos, science and technology centers, historic houses, nature centers, and botanical gardens. Similarly, IMLS invests in libraries across America, including public, academic, tribal, research, and special libraries, as well as other eligible institutions like archives, nonprofit cultural organizations, and universities.

[ 24 ] IMLS is the largest source of federal funding for libraries in the nation, directing population-based funding to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the US territories, and Freely Associated States through its Grants to States program.

[ 25 ] In FY2022, IMLS awarded $257.2M to institutions across the country, of which $168.8M was through its Grants to States program.

In addition to its other responsibilities, IMLS annually awards the National Medal for Museum and Library Service , which is the nation’s highest honor for institutions that make significant and exceptional contributions to their communities. Since 1994, IMLS has presented the award to outstanding libraries and museums of all types and sizes that deeply impact their communities.

[ 26 ] In fiscal year 2023, IMLS had a budget of $313.58 million.

[ 27 ] As of 2023, IMLS currently has 70 full-time employees, many of whom still work remotely. In 2022, the employees voted to unionize, joining hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have joined the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) to “build power and have a voice at work.” [ 28 ] The act comes up for reauthorization every five years. It was most recently reauthorized on December 31, 2018 by President Donald J. Trump (PL 115-410).

Executive order issued by President Trump in 2025 [ edit ] On March 14, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order that directed eliminating the IMLS "to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law", along with several other agencies.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The entire 70 person staff was put on leave on March 31, 2025.

[ 32 ] The American Library Association (ALA) released the statement that the elimination of the IMLS would harm American libraries and museums, especially impacting rural communities. It urged to continue the support for libraries and called people to join the "Show Up for Our Libraries" campaign.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] The American Alliance of Museums also released the statement that the Trump action "threatens the critical roles museums and museum workers play in American society, and puts jobs, education, conservation, and vital community programs at risk", and called for action.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The ALA also has stated that through this executive order that the administration is effectively "cutting off at the knees the most beloved and trusted of American institutions and the staff and services they offer.” [ 38 ] On May 1, 2025, a lawsuit brought by the American Library Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees resulted in  the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia  granting a limited temporary restraining order to block any further actions to dissolve IMLS.

[ 39 ] Leadership [ edit ] When Congress passed the Library Services and Technology Act in 1996, it moved library responsibilities out of the Department of Education and created the IMLS as a new agency. The act stipulated that the agency maintain a rotating directorship starting with the former director of the Institute of Museum Services for a four-year term. In the fifth year, the directorship would pass to a representative from the field of library and information science. Each new director is appointed by the current president and confirmed by the Senate for a four-year term.

[ 40 ] Directors [ edit ] Diane Frankel (1996) [ 41 ] Robert S. Martin (2001) [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Anne-Imelda Radice (2006) [ 44 ] Radice returned to IMLS in 2018 and currently serves as a senior advisor in the Office of the Director.

[ 52 ] Grants [ edit ] The Institute of Museum and Library Services offers numerous grants for museums, libraries, and other cultural heritage institutions.

[ 53 ] The grants support the IMLS's strategic goals of advancing "innovation, lifelong learning, and cultural and civic engagement." [ 54 ] The Agency’s discretionary grants are selected through a highly respected and competitive peer review process, drawing on professionals located across the nation.

[ 55 ] This work enables museums and libraries located in geographically and economically diverse areas to deliver essential services that make it possible for individuals and communities to flourish.

Office of Library Services [ edit ] The Office of Library Services (OLS) supports the recruitment, training, and development of library staff, boards, and volunteers, helping to grow a skilled, professional workforce. OLS enhances library resources that foster early, digital, information, health, financial, media, civic, and other types of literacies, and encourages library and museum professionals and institutions to share and adopt best practices and innovations. IMLS is the largest source of federal funding for libraries in the nation.

[ 56 ] Grants To States [ edit ] The Grants to States program is the largest source of federal funding support for library services in the United States. IMLS funds enable State Library Administrative Agencies (SLAAs) to advance library services throughout all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the US territories, and Freely Associated States. The program cuts across all geographies and all community types with population-based formula grants administered through the SLAAs. The program also addresses a variety of different types of agency priorities, including broadband access and advancing digital literacy, workforce development, learning and education, civic engagement, climate change, and services that address historic and growing inequities.

Each year, approximately 1,500 Grants to States projects support the purposes and priorities outlined in the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA). SLAAs may distribute the funds through competitive subawards to, or through cooperative agreements with, public, academic, research, school, or special libraries or consortia (for-profit and federal libraries are not eligible).

[ 57 ] Discretionary Library Grants [ edit ] The Office of Library Services offers five funding opportunities: National Leadership Grants for Libraries, Native American Library Services: Basic Grants, Native American Library Services: Enhancement Grants, Native Hawaiian Library Services Grants, and Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program.

OMS enhances museum resources that foster early, digital, information, health, financial, media, civic, and other types of literacies.

Museums cover varying disciplines, and come in many sizes, including zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, and arboretums; nature and science centers; history museums and historic sites; art museums; children’s museums; natural history museums; and specialized museums.

Museum Discretionary Grants [ edit ] The Office of Museum Services offers seven competitive funding opportunities: Museums for America; Inspire! Grants for Small Museums and Museums Empowered (two special initiatives of the Museums for America program); 21st Century Museum Professional; National Leadership Grants for Museums; Native American/Native Hawaiian Museum Services; and Museum Grants for African American History and Culture, as well as the new Museum Grants for American Latino History and Culture.

The initiative will nurture students carrying out studies relating to American Latino life, art, history, and culture.

[ 60 ] Collections Assessment For Preservation Program (CAP) [ edit ] CAP is administered by the Foundation for Advancement in Conservation (FAIC). Program provides small and mid-sized museums with partial funding toward an assessment of their policies and procedures relating to collections care and a study of their collections, buildings, and building systems.

[ 61 ] Museum Assessment Program (MAP) [ edit ] MAP is supported through a cooperative agreement between IMLS and the American Alliance of Museums. MAP offers museums an opportunity to strengthen operations and plan for the future through a low-cost, year-long process of self-assessment and consultative peer review.

[ 82 ] Legislative history [ edit ] Museum and Library Services Act of 1996 [ edit ] The Museum and Library Services Act (MLSA) of 1996 established the Institute of Museum and Library Services within the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities. The new Agency combined the former Institute of Museum Services and federal museum programs, which had been in existence since 1976, with the Library Programs Office and federal library program that had been part of the Department of Education since 1956.

[ 83 ] Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 [ edit ] On September 25, 2003, the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 (PL 108-81) was signed into law. Recognizing the effectiveness of the new Agency, this legislation reauthorized federal appropriations for IMLS. But the framers of the 2003 law also sought to capitalize on lessons learned since 1996 by amending the initial MLSA in several ways, including the establishment of the National Museum and Library Services Board and incorporating new authority for research and evaluation.

[ 84 ] National Museum of African American History and Culture Act of 2003 [ edit ] On December 16, 2003, the National Museum of African American History and Culture Act was signed into law. In addition to providing authority to create a new Smithsonian museum for African American History and Culture, the Act authorizes $15M per year for IMLS to carry out its statutory purpose of enhancing the vitality and sustainability of museums of African American History and Culture and encouraging scholarship and careers in African American history and culture.

[ 85 ] 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 [ edit ] Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 providing IMLS with the authority to carry out the functions of the former National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, to streamline the Agency, and strengthen library services and policy in the Federal government. In addition, the Act provided funding to enable the Institute to assume responsibility for two library statistics programs formerly housed at the National Center for Educational Statistics at the United States Department of Education.

[ 86 ] 2010 Museum and Library Services Act of 2010 [ edit ] On December 22, 2010, the Museum and Library Services Act of 2010 (PL 111-340) was signed into law. The legislation reauthorized the existing programs of the Institute of Museum and Library Services with some important changes. The updated language calls on IMLS to take an active role in research and data collection and to advise the President and Congress on museum, library, and information services. This Act also expressly recognizes how libraries and museums contribute to a competitive workforce and engaged citizenry. New language focuses on the development of essential 21st century skills.

[ 87 ] 2018 Museum and Library Services Act of 2018 [ edit ] On December 31, 2018, the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018 (PL 115-410) was signed into law. It reauthorized the existing programs and functions of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and provided new authority, including to develop and support new museum, library, and information professionals.

[ 88 ] 2020 National Museum of The American Latino Act [ edit ] On December 27, 2020, the National Museum of the American Latino Act (“American Latino Act”) (PL116-260) was enacted into law. The legislation establishes grants and fellowship programs at IMLS to support American Latino Museums and related scholarship. It authorizes $15 million per year for IMLS to carry out its statutory purpose of recognizing, celebrating, and enhancing understanding of the important history and contributions of American Latinos.
