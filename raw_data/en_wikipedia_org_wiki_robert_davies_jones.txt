Nationality British Citizenship British American (1983) Alma mater University of Birmingham (B.Sc., 1964) University of Colorado Boulder (Ph.D. 1969) Known for Tornadic supercell dynamics and tornadogenesis Awards NOAA Distinguished Career Award; [ 1 ] Nikolai Dotzek Award [ 2 ] Scientific career Fields Meteorology Institutions National Severe Storms Laboratory Thesis The Linear Theory of Thermal Convection in Horizontal Plane Couette Flow (1969) Robert Peter Davies-Jones is a British atmospheric scientist who substantially advanced understanding of supercell and tornado dynamics and of tornadogenesis . A theoretician, he utilized numerical simulations as well as storm chasing field investigations in his work as a longtime research meteorologist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) in Norman, Oklahoma.

[ 3 ] Davies-Jones received a B.Sc. in physics from the University of Birmingham in 1964 and a Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Colorado Boulder in 1969. From 1969 to 1970 Davies-Jones did a post-doc at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) before embarking on a long career at NSSL in 1970. He retired from NSSL in 2009 where he remains an emeritus researcher and continues to publish some papers. Davies-Jones is a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS).
