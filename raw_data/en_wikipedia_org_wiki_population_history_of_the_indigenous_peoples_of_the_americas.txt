Contemporary illustration of the 1868 Washita massacre by the 7th Cavalry against Black Kettle 's band of Cheyenne , during the American Indian Wars . Violence and conflict with colonists were also important causes of the decline of certain Indigenous American populations since the 16th century.

Population figures for the Indigenous peoples of the Americas before European colonization have been difficult to establish. Estimates have varied widely from as low as 8 million to as many as 100 million, though by the end of the 20th Century, many scholars gravitated toward an estimate of around 50 million people.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The monarchs of the nascent Spanish Empire decided to fund Christopher Columbus' voyage in 1492 , leading to the establishment of colonies and marking the beginning of the migration of millions of Europeans and Africans to the Americas. While the population of European settlers, primarily from Spain , Portugal , France , England , and the Netherlands , along with African slaves, grew steadily, the Indigenous population plummeted. There are numerous reasons for the population decline, including exposure to Eurasian diseases such as influenza , pneumonic plagues , and smallpox ; direct violence by settlers and their allies through war and forced removal ; and the general disruption of societies.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Scholarly disputes remain over the degree to which each factor contributed or should be emphasized; some modern scholars have categorized it as a genocide , claiming that deliberate, systematic actions by Europeans were the primary cause.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Traditional interpretation of the decline by scholars have disputed this characterization, maintaining that incidental disease exposure was the primary cause.

[ 6 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] This is supported by evidence where 50-80 percent of the population died from waves of diseases caused by Europeans in places such as Mexico in the 16th century.

[ 10 ] Population overview [ edit ] Illustration of Indigenous people of North America Illustration of Indigenous people of South America Pre-Columbian population figures are difficult to estimate because of the fragmentary nature of the evidence. Estimates range from 8–112 million.

[ 11 ] Scholars have varied widely on the estimated size of the Indigenous populations prior to colonization and on the effects of European contact .

[ 12 ] Estimates are made by extrapolations from small bits of data. In 1976, geographer William Denevan used the existing estimates to derive a "consensus count" of about 54 million people. Nonetheless, more recent estimates still range widely.

[ 13 ] In 1992, Denevan suggested that the total population was approximately 53.9 million and the populations by region were, approximately, 3.8 million for the United States and Canada, 17.2 million for Mexico, 5.6 million for Central America, 3 million for the Caribbean, 15.7 million for the Andes and 8.6 million for lowland South America.

[ 14 ] A 2020 genetic study suggests that prior estimates for the pre-Columbian Caribbean population may have been at least tenfold too large.

[ 15 ] Historian David Stannard estimates that the extermination of Indigenous peoples took the lives of 100 million people: "...the total extermination of many American Indian peoples and the near-extermination of others, in numbers that eventually totaled close to 100,000,000." [ 16 ] A 2019 study estimates the pre-Columbian Indigenous population contained more than 60 million people, but dropped to 6 million by 1600, based on a drop in atmospheric CO 2 during that period.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Other studies have disputed this conclusion.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] The Indigenous population of the Americas in 1492 was not necessarily at a high point and may actually have already been in decline in some areas. Indigenous populations in most areas of the Americas reached a low point by the early 20th century.

[ 21 ] Using an estimate of approximately 37 million people in Mexico, Central and South America in 1492 (including 6 million in the Aztec Empire , 5–10 million in the Mayan States, 11 million in what is now Brazil, and 12 million in the Inca Empire ), the lowest estimates give a population decrease from all causes of 80% by the end of the 17th century (nine million people in 1650).

[ 22 ] Latin America would match its 15th-century population early in the 19th century; it numbered 17 million in 1800, 30 million in 1850, 61 million in 1900, 105 million in 1930, 218 million in 1960, 361 million in 1980, and 563 million in 2005.

[ 22 ] In the last three decades of the 16th century, the population of present-day Mexico dropped to about one million people.

[ 22 ] The Maya population is today estimated at six million, which is about the same as at the end of the 15th century, according to some estimates.

[ 22 ] In what is now Brazil, the Indigenous population declined from a pre-Cabraline high of an estimated four million to some 300,000. Over 60 million Brazilians possess at least one Native South American ancestor, according to a DNA study.

[ 23 ] While it is difficult to determine exactly how many Natives lived in Northern America (modern day US and Canada) before Columbus, [ 24 ] most estimates range from 2.5 million to 7 million [ 25 ] [ 26 ] people, with one study estimating up to 18 million.

[ 27 ] Scholars vary on the estimated size of the Indigenous population in what is now Canada prior to colonization and on the effects of European contact .

[ 28 ] During the late 15th century is estimated to have been between 200,000 [ 29 ] and two million, [ 30 ] with a figure of 500,000 currently accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Health.

[ 31 ] Although not without conflict, European Canadians ' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.

[ 32 ] However repeated outbreaks of European infectious diseases such as influenza, measles, and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), [ 33 ] combined with other effects of European contact, resulted in a twenty-five percent to eighty percent Indigenous population decrease post-contact.

[ 29 ] Roland G Robertson suggests that during the late 1630s, smallpox killed over half of the Wyandot (Huron) , who controlled most of the early North American fur trade in the area of New France .

[ 34 ] In 1871 there was an enumeration of the Indigenous population within the limits of Canada at the time, showing a total of only 102,358 individuals.

[ 35 ] From 2006 to 2016, the Indigenous population has grown by 42.5 percent, four times the national rate.

[ 36 ] According to the 2011 Canadian census , Indigenous peoples ( First Nations – 851,560, Inuit – 59,445 and Métis – 451,795) numbered at 1,400,685, or 4.3% of the country's total population.

[ 37 ] The population debate has often had ideological underpinnings.

[ 38 ] Low estimates, such as those from Kroeber in 1939, claiming only 8.4 million inhabitants in the entire western hemisphere, [ 39 ] were often reflective of European notions of cultural and racial superiority , especially in the early 20th century when white supremacist ideology still had a strong influence on fields such as anthropology. Historian Francis Jennings argued, "Scholarly wisdom long held that Indians were so inferior in mind and works that they could not possibly have created or sustained large populations." [ 40 ] Most scholars held these lower estimates as factual until the 1960s, when anthropologist Henry Dobyns published research applying historical and archaelogical data to assert a far higher pre-Columbian population of possibly over 100 million, including up to 9-12 million in what is now the US and Canada, setting off significant academic debate over the question.

[ 41 ] Despite widespread acceptance that the early estimates were too low, multiple researchers have also called very high estimates such as Dobyns into question as well.

[ 42 ] In 1998, Africanist Historian David Henige claimed that many population estimates are the result of "arbitrary formulas" applied from unreliable sources.

[ 43 ] Most newer estimates of the pre-Columbian population in the Americas fall between 45 and 60 million people, including those from Denevan (1992) [ 44 ] and Alchon (2003), [ 45 ] while a 2018 study estimates a population of just over 60 million, based on carbon records.

[ 54 ] Many of these estimates are based on observations by contemporary European explorers or settlers passing through Native American territories. Typical proportions were 5 people per one warrior and at least 1 up to 5 warriors (therefore at least 5–25 people) per lodge, cabin or house.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 53 ] Pre-Columbian Americas [ edit ] Main article: Genetic history of Indigenous peoples of the Americas See also: Y-DNA haplogroups in Indigenous peoples of the Americas Bust of Cuauhtémoc in el Zócalo, Mexico City Genetic diversity and population structure in the American land mass using DNA micro-satellite markers ( genotype ) sampled from North, Central, and South America have been analyzed against similar data available from other Indigenous populations worldwide.

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] The Amerindian populations show a lower genetic diversity than populations from other continental regions.

[ 124 ] Decreasing genetic diversity with increasing geographic distance from the Bering Strait can be seen, as well as a decreasing genetic similarity to Siberian populations from Alaska (genetic entry point).

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] A higher level of diversity and lower level of population structure in western South America compared to eastern South America is observed.

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] A relative lack of differentiation between Mesoamerican and Andean populations is a scenario that implies coastal routes were easier than inland routes for migrating peoples ( Paleo-Indians ) to traverse.

[ 123 ] The overall pattern that is emerging suggests that the Americas were recently colonized by a small number of individuals (effective size of about 70–250), and then they grew by a factor of 10 over 800–1,000 years.

[ 125 ] [ 126 ] The data also show that there have been genetic exchanges between Asia, the Arctic and Greenland since the initial peopling of the Americas .

[ 126 ] [ 127 ] A new study in early 2018 suggests that the effective population size of the original founding population of Native Americans was about 250 people.

[ 128 ] [ 129 ] Depopulation by Old World diseases [ edit ] See also: Influx of disease in the Caribbean , Native American disease and epidemics , and History of smallpox § Epidemics in the Americas One estimate of  population collapse in Central Mexico brought on by successive epidemics in the early colonial period. Note: Other scholars' estimates vary widely.

Early explanations for the population decline of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas include the brutal practices of the Spanish conquistadores , as recorded by the Spaniards themselves, such as the encomienda system, which was ostensibly set up to protect people from warring tribes as well as to teach them the Spanish language and the Catholic religion , but in practice was tantamount to serfdom and slavery .

[ 130 ] The most notable account was that of the Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas , whose writings vividly depict Spanish atrocities committed in particular against the Taínos .

[ 131 ] The second European explanation was a perceived divine approval, in which God removed the Indigenous peoples as part of His "divine plan" to make way for a new Christian civilization. Many Native Americans viewed their troubles in a religious framework within their own belief systems.

[ 132 ] According to later academics such as Noble David Cook , a community of scholars began "quietly accumulating piece by piece data on early epidemics in the Americas and their relation to the subjugation of native peoples." Scholars like Cook believe that widespread epidemic disease, to which the Indigenous peoples had no prior exposure or resistance, was the primary cause of the massive population decline of the Native Americans.

[ 133 ] One of the most devastating diseases was smallpox, but other deadly diseases included typhus , measles , influenza, bubonic plague , cholera , malaria , tuberculosis , mumps , yellow fever , and pertussis , which were chronic in Eurasia.

[ 134 ] However, recently scholars have studied the link between physical colonial violence such as warfare, displacement, and enslavement, and the proliferation of disease among Native populations.

[ 4 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ] For example, according to Coquille scholar Dina Gilio-Whitaker , "In recent decades, however, researchers challenge the idea that disease is solely responsible for the rapid Indigenous population decline. The research identifies other aspects of European contact that had profoundly negative impacts on Native peoples' ability to survive foreign invasion: war, massacres, enslavement, overwork, deportation, the loss of will to live or reproduce, malnutrition and starvation from the breakdown of trade networks, and the loss of subsistence food production due to land loss." [ 137 ] Further, Andrés Reséndez of the University of California, Davis points out that, even though the Spanish were aware of deadly diseases such as smallpox, there is no mention of them in the New World until 1519, implying that, until that date, epidemic disease played no significant part in the depopulation of the Antilles . The practices of forced labor, brutal punishment, and inadequate necessities of life, were the initial and major reasons for depopulation.

[ 138 ] Jason Hickel estimates that a third of Arawak workers died every six months from forced labor in these mines.

[ 139 ] In this way, "slavery has emerged as a major killer" of the Indigenous populations of the Caribbean between 1492 and 1550, as it set the conditions for diseases such as smallpox, influenza, and malaria to flourish.

[ 138 ] Unlike the populations of Europe who rebounded following the Black Death , no such rebound occurred for the Indigenous populations.

[ 138 ] Similarly, historian Jeffrey Ostler at the University of Oregon has argued that population collapses in North America throughout colonization were not due mainly to lack of Native immunity to European disease. Instead, he claims that "When severe epidemics did hit, it was often less because Native bodies lacked immunity than because European colonialism disrupted Native communities and damaged their resources, making them more vulnerable to pathogens." In specific regard to Spanish colonization of northern Florida and southeastern Georgia, Native peoples there "were subject to forced labor and, because of poor living conditions and malnutrition, succumbed to wave after wave of unidentifiable diseases." Further, in relation to British colonization in the Northeast, Algonquian speaking tribes in Virginia and Maryland "suffered from a variety of diseases, including malaria, typhus, and possibly smallpox." These diseases were not solely a case of Native susceptibility, however, because "as colonists took their resources, Native communities were subject to malnutrition, starvation, and social stress, all making people more vulnerable to pathogens. Repeated epidemics created additional trauma and population loss, which in turn disrupted the provision of healthcare." Such conditions would continue, alongside rampant disease in Native communities, throughout colonization, the formation of the United States, and multiple forced removals, as Ostler explains that many scholars "have yet to come to grips with how U.S. expansion created conditions that made Native communities acutely vulnerable to pathogens and how severely disease impacted them. ... Historians continue to ignore the catastrophic impact of disease and its relationship to U.S. policy and action even when it is right before their eyes." [ 6 ] Historian David Stannard says that by "focusing almost entirely on disease ... contemporary authors increasingly have created the impression that the eradication of those tens of millions of people was inadvertent—a sad, but both inevitable and "unintended consequence" of human migration and progress," and asserts that their destruction "was neither inadvertent nor inevitable," but the result of microbial pestilence and purposeful genocide working in tandem.

[ 140 ] He also wrote: [ 141 ] ...Despite frequent undocumented assertions that disease was responsible for the great majority of indigenous deaths in the Americas, there does not exist a single scholarly work that even pretends to demonstrate this claim on the basis of solid evidence. And that is because there is no such evidence, anywhere. The supposed truism that more native people died from disease than from direct face-to-face killing or from gross mistreatment or other concomitant derivatives of that brutality such as starvation,
exposure, exhaustion, or despair is nothing more than a scholarly article of faith...

Chief Sitting Bull In contrast, historian Russel Thornton has pointed out that there were disastrous epidemics and population losses during the first half of the sixteenth century "resulting from incidental contact, or even without direct contact, as disease spread from one American Indian tribe to another." [ 142 ] Thornton has also challenged higher Indigenous population estimates, which are based on the Malthusian assumption that "populations tend to increase to, and beyond, the limits of the food available to them at any particular level of technology." [ 143 ] The European colonization of the Americas resulted in the deaths of so many people it contributed to climatic change and temporary global cooling , according to scientists from University College London .

[ 144 ] [ 145 ] A century after the arrival of Christopher Columbus , some 90% of Indigenous Americans had perished from "wave after wave of disease", along with mass slavery and war, in what researchers have described as the "great dying".

[ 146 ] According to one of the researchers, UCL Geography Professor Mark Maslin , the large death toll also boosted the economies of Europe: "the depopulation of the Americas may have inadvertently allowed the Europeans to dominate the world. It also allowed for the Industrial Revolution and for Europeans to continue that domination." [ 147 ] Biological warfare [ edit ] When Old World diseases were first carried to the Americas at the end of the fifteenth century, they spread throughout the southern and northern hemispheres, leaving the Indigenous populations in near ruins.

[ 134 ] [ 148 ] No evidence has been discovered that the earliest Spanish colonists and missionaries deliberately attempted to infect the American Natives, and some efforts were made to limit the devastating effects of disease before it killed off what remained of their labor force (compelled to work under the encomienda system).

[ 134 ] [ 148 ] The cattle introduced by the Spanish contaminated various water reserves which Native Americans dug in the fields to accumulate rainwater. In response, the Franciscans and Dominicans created public fountains and aqueducts to guarantee access to drinking water .

[ 22 ] But when the Franciscans lost their privileges in 1572, many of these fountains were no longer guarded and so deliberate well poisoning may have happened.

[ 22 ] Although no proof of such poisoning has been found, some historians believe the decrease of the population correlates with the end of religious orders' control of the water.

[ 22 ] In following centuries, accusations and discussions of biological warfare were common. Well-documented accounts of incidents involving both threats and acts of deliberate infection are very rare, but may have occurred more frequently than scholars have previously acknowledged.

[ 149 ] [ 150 ] Many of the instances likely went unreported, and it is possible that documents relating to such acts were deliberately destroyed, [ 150 ] or sanitized.

[ 151 ] [ 152 ] By the middle of the 18th century, colonists had the knowledge and technology to attempt biological warfare with the smallpox virus. They well understood the concept of quarantine, and that contact with the sick could infect the healthy with smallpox, and those who survived the illness would not be infected again. Whether the threats were carried out, or how effective individual attempts were, is uncertain.

[ 134 ] [ 150 ] [ 151 ] One such threat was delivered by fur trader James McDougall , who is quoted as saying to a gathering of local chiefs, "You know the smallpox. Listen: I am the smallpox chief. In this bottle I have it confined. All I have to do is to pull the cork, send it forth among you, and you are dead men. But this is for my enemies and not my friends." [ 153 ] Likewise, another fur trader threatened Pawnee Indians that if they didn't agree to certain conditions, "he would let the smallpox out of a bottle and destroy them." The Reverend Isaac McCoy was quoted in his History of Baptist Indian Missions as saying that the white men had deliberately spread smallpox among the Indians of the southwest, including the Pawnee tribe, and the havoc it made was reported to General Clark and the Secretary of War.

[ 153 ] [ 154 ] Artist and writer George Catlin observed that Native Americans were also suspicious of vaccination, "They see white men urging the operation so earnestly they decide that it must be some new mode or trick of the pale face by which they hope to gain some new advantage over them." [ 155 ] So great was the distrust of the settlers that the Mandan chief Four Bears denounced the white man, whom he had previously treated as brothers, for deliberately bringing the disease to his people.

[ 156 ] [ 157 ] [ 158 ] During the siege of British-held Fort Pitt in the Seven Years' War , Colonel Henry Bouquet ordered his men to take smallpox-infested blankets from their hospital and gave them as gifts to two neutral Lenape Indian dignitaries during a peace settlement negotiation, according to the entry in the Captain's ledger, "To convey the Smallpox to the Indians".

[ 151 ] [ 159 ] [ 160 ] In the following weeks, Sir Jeffrey Amherst conspired with Bouquet to "Extirpate this Execreble Race" of Native Americans, writing, "Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them." His Colonel agreed to try.

[ 150 ] [ 159 ] Most scholars have asserted that the 1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic was "started among the tribes of the upper Missouri River by failure to quarantine steamboats on the river", [ 153 ] and Captain Pratt of the St. Peter "was guilty of contributing to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The law calls his offense criminal negligence. Yet in light of all the deaths, the almost complete annihilation of the Mandans, and the terrible suffering the region endured, the label criminal negligence is benign, hardly befitting an action that had such horrendous consequences." [ 157 ] However, some sources attribute the 1836–40 epidemic to the deliberate communication of smallpox to Native Americans, with historian Ann F. Ramenofsky writing, " Variola Major can be transmitted through contaminated articles such as clothing or blankets. In the nineteenth century, the U. S. Army sent contaminated blankets to Native Americans, especially Plains groups, to control the Indian problem." [ 161 ] In Brazil, well into the 20th century, deliberate infection attacks continued as Brazilian settlers and miners transported infections intentionally to the Native groups whose lands they coveted.

[ 148 ] Vaccination [ edit ] After Edward Jenner 's 1796 demonstration that the smallpox vaccination worked, the technique became better known and smallpox became less deadly in the United States and elsewhere. Many colonists and Natives were vaccinated, although, in some cases, officials tried to vaccinate Natives only to discover that the disease was too widespread to stop. At other times, trade demands led to broken quarantines. In other cases, Natives refused vaccination because of suspicion of whites. The first international healthcare expedition in history was the Balmis Expedition which had the aim of vaccinating Indigenous peoples against smallpox all along the Spanish Empire in 1803. In 1831, government officials vaccinated the Yankton Dakota at Sioux Agency . The Santee Sioux refused vaccination and many died.

[ 38 ] Depopulation by European conquest [ edit ] War and violence [ edit ] Main article: American Indian Wars Further information: Spanish colonization of the Americas , Arauco War , Chichimeca War , and Conquest of the Desert An 1899 chromolithograph of U.S. cavalry pursuing American Indians, artist unknown An 1899 chromolithograph from the Werner Company of Akron, Ohio, titled Custer Massacre at Big Horn, Montana – 25 June 1876 While epidemic disease was a leading factor of the population decline of the American Indigenous peoples after 1492, there were other contributing factors, all of them related to European contact and colonization. One of these factors was warfare. According to demographer Russell Thornton, although many people died in wars over the centuries, and war sometimes contributed to the near extinction of certain tribes, warfare and death by other violent means was a comparatively minor cause of overall Native population decline.

[ 162 ] From the U.S. Bureau of the Census in 1894, wars between the government and the Indigenous peoples ranged over 40 in number over the previous 100 years. These wars cost the lives of approximately 19,000 white people, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians, including men, women, and children. They safely estimated that the number of Native people who were killed or wounded was actually around fifty percent more than what was recorded.

[ 163 ] There is some disagreement among scholars about how widespread warfare was in pre-Columbian America, [ 164 ] but there is general agreement that war became deadlier after the arrival of the Europeans and their firearms.

[ citation needed ] The South or Central American infrastructure allowed for thousands of European conquistadors and tens of thousands of their Indian auxiliaries to attack the dominant Indigenous civilization. Empires such as the Incas depended on a highly centralized administration for the distribution of resources. Disruption caused by the war and the colonization hampered the traditional economy, and possibly led to shortages of food and materials.

[ 165 ] Across the western hemisphere, war with various Native American civilizations constituted alliances based out of both necessity or economic prosperity and, resulted in mass-scale intertribal warfare.

[ 166 ] European colonization in the North American continent also contributed to a number of wars between Native Americans, who fought over which of them should have first access to new technology and weaponry—like in the Beaver Wars .

[ 167 ] Genocides [ edit ] Main article: Genocide of indigenous peoples § Indigenous peoples of the Americas (pre-1948) According to the Cambridge World History , the Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies, and the Cambridge World History of Genocide, colonial policies in some cases included the deliberate genocide of indigenous peoples in North America.

[ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ] According to the Cambridge World History of Genocide, Spanish colonization of the Americas also included genocidal massacres.

[ 171 ] According to Adam Jones , genocidal methods included the following: Genocidal massacres Biological warfare, using pathogens (especially smallpox and plague) to which the indigenous peoples had no resistance Spreading of disease via the 'reduction' of Indians to densely crowded and unhygienic settlements Slavery and forced/indentured labor, especially, though not exclusively, in Latin America, in conditions often rivaling those of Nazi concentration camps Mass population removals to barren 'reservations,' sometimes involving death marches en route , and generally leading to widespread mortality and population collapse upon arrival Deliberate starvation and famine, exacerbated by destruction and occupation of the native land base and food resources Forced education of indigenous children in White-run schools ...

[ 172 ] Exploitation [ edit ] Main article: European enslavement of Indigenous Americans D'Albertis Castle , Genoa, Museum of World Cultures Some Spaniards objected to the encomienda system of labor, notably Bartolomé de las Casas , who insisted that the Indigenous people were humans with souls and rights. Because of many revolts and military encounters, Emperor Charles V helped relieve the strain on both the Native laborers and the Spanish vanguards probing the Caribana for military and diplomatic purposes.

[ 173 ] Later on New Laws were promulgated in Spain in 1542 to protect isolated Native, but the abuses in the Americas were never entirely or permanently abolished. The Spanish also employed the pre-Columbian draft system called the mita , [ 174 ] and treated their subjects as something between slaves and serfs . Serfs stayed to work the land; slaves were exported to the mines, where large numbers of them died. In other areas the Spaniards replaced the ruling Aztecs and Incas and divided the conquered lands among themselves ruling as the new feudal lords with often, but unsuccessful lobbying to the viceroys of the Spanish crown to pay Tlaxcalan war indemnities. The infamous Bandeirantes from São Paulo , adventurers mostly of mixed Portuguese and Native ancestry, penetrated steadily westward in their search for Indian slaves . Serfdom existed as such in parts of Latin America well into the 19th century, past independence.

[ 175 ] Historian Andrés Reséndez argues that even though the Spanish were aware of the spread of smallpox, they made no mention of it until 1519, a quarter century after Columbus arrived in Hispaniola.

[ 176 ] Instead he contends that enslavement in gold and silver mines was the primary reason why the Native American population of Hispaniola dropped so significantly [ 175 ] [ 176 ] and that even though disease was a factor, the Native population would have rebounded the same way Europeans did following the Black Death if it were not for the constant enslavement they were subject to.

[ 176 ] He further contends that enslavement of Native Americans was in fact the primary cause of their depopulation in Spanish territories; [ 176 ] that the majority of Indians enslaved were women and children compared to the enslavement of Africans which mostly targeted adult males and in turn they were sold at a 50% to 60% higher price, [ 177 ] and that 2,462,000 to 4,985,000 Amerindians were enslaved between Columbus's arrival and 1900.

[ 178 ] [ 177 ] Massacres [ edit ] Main article: List of Indian massacres in North America See also: Taíno genocide , Native American genocide in the United States , California genocide , and Round Valley Settler Massacres of 1856–1859 Mass grave of Lakota dead after the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre Conquest of Mexico [ citation needed ] The Pequot War in early New England.

In mid-19th century Argentina , post-independence leaders Juan Manuel de Rosas and Julio Argentino Roca engaged in what they presented as a " Conquest of the Desert " against the Natives of the Argentinian interior, leaving over 1,300 Indigenous dead.

[ 179 ] [ 180 ] While some California tribes were settled on reservations, others were hunted down and massacred by 19th century American settlers. It is estimated that at least 9,400 to 16,000 California Indians were killed by non-Indians, mostly occurring in more than 370 massacres (defined as the "intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants, including women, children, and prisoners, whether in the context of a battle or otherwise").

[ 181 ] [ 182 ] Displacement and disruption [ edit ] Main articles: Indian removal and Trail of Tears Throughout history, Indigenous people have been subjected to the repeated and forced removal from their land. Beginning in the 1830s, there was the relocation of an estimated 100,000 Indigenous people in the United States called the " Trail of Tears ".

[ 183 ] The tribes affected by this specific removal were the Five Civilized Tribes : The Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole. The treaty of New Echota, [ 184 ] was enacted, which stated that the United States "would give Cherokee land west of the Mississippi in exchange for $5,000,000".

[ 183 ] According to Jeffrey Ostler, "Of the 80,000 Native people who were forced west from 1830 into the 1850s, between 12,000 and 17,000 perished." Ostler states that "the large majority died of interrelated factors of starvation, exposure and disease".

[ 185 ] In addition to the removal of the Southern Tribes, there were multiple other removals of Northern Tribes also known as "Trails of Tears." For example, "In the free labor states of the North, federal and state officials, supported by farmers, speculators and business interests, evicted Shawnees, Delawares, Senecas, Potawatomis, Miamis, Wyandots, Ho-Chunks, Ojibwes, Sauks and Meskwakis." These Nations were moved West of the Mississippi into what is now known as Eastern Kansas, and numbered 17,000 on arrival. According to Ostler, "by 1860, their numbers had been cut in half" because of low fertility, high infant mortality, and increased disease caused by conditions such as polluted drinking water, few resources, and social stress.

[ 185 ] Ostler also writes that the areas that Northern tribes were removed to were already inhabited: "The areas west of the Mississippi River were home to other Indigenous nations—Osages, Kanzas, Omahas, Ioways, Otoes and Missourias. To make room for thousands of people from the East, the government dispossessed these nations of much their lands." Ostler writes that when Northern Nations were moved onto their landing 1840, "The combined population of these western nations was 9,000 ... 20 years later, it had fallen to 6,000." [ 185 ] Later apologies by government officials [ edit ] See also: Bureau of Indian Affairs and Canadian Indian residential school system § Canadian government On 8 September 2000, the head of the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) formally apologized for the agency's participation in the ethnic cleansing of Western tribes.

[ 186 ] [ 187 ] [ 188 ] In a speech before representatives of Native American peoples in June 2019, California governor Gavin Newsom apologized for the " California Genocide ." Newsom said, "That's what it was, a genocide. No other way to describe it. And that's the way it needs to be described in the history books."

Such high population appears to be confirmed by French Jesuits who visited forty Sioux villages in 1660 and found 5,000 men only in five of them (on average 1,000 men per village). Almost a century after Gorrell's estimate, in 1841, George Catlin estimated the Sioux as up to 50,000 people, and mentioned that they had just lost approx. 8,000 dead to smallpox a few years prior.

^ Extrapolated from 25,000 warriors (x5) in year 1718, according to Le Page du Pratz.

^ They had 60 towns and 20,000 warriors. One of their towns – Cahokia – contained 400 lodges and was inhabited by 1,800 warriors.

^ "The epidemic of 1837–38 was disastrous, approx. 15,000 Blackfeet people fell victim to the disease." ^ Five Nations, on average 14,000 people per nation around year 1690 according to L. A. de Lahontan. And in 1609 the Iroquois population was estimated by Marc Lescarbot at 8,000 warriors (that is around 40,000 people). On the contrary Lewis H. Morgan in his 1851 book estimated the Iroquois population in year 1650 at only 25,000 people – including 10,000 Seneca, 5,000 Mohawk, 4,000 Onondaga, 3,000 Oneida and 3,000 Cayuga. The Seneca were also estimated at 13,000 people in year 1672 and 15,000 in year 1687.

Not all of Iroquois 226 villages were occupied at the same time as the Iroquois moved villages every five to twenty years.

^ They had approx. 7 pueblos (towns), one of which – Oraibi (possibly the largest of all) – had 14,000 inhabitants before an epidemic.

^ It was also reported they had 25–32 towns or villages.

^ Extrapolated from 8,000 warriors × 5.

^ 38 villages (on average 130–150 lodges/cabins per village) with 7,600 warriors x 5 = 38,000 total population, not including the Arikara .

^ They had 6,000 warriors in 1730–35 (according to J. Adair) and also 6,000 warriors in 1738, but just 5,000 in 1740 (according to Ga. Hist. Coll., II). Colonel James Oglethorpe confirms that they had 5,000 warriors in 1739 (Ga. Coll. Rec., V). Also according to Ga. Coll. Rec., V an epidemic reduced them "by almost one-half" in 1738, but this source doesn't specify how numerous they were before the epidemic. Perhaps this source exaggerates the casualties caused by that epidemic, and in fact it killed just around 1,000 warriors.

^ They had approx. 6,000 warriors and 24 towns.

^ They inhabited up to 11 pueblos (towns).

^ They had approx. 4,000 warriors and ca. 40 villages.

^ Later an epidemic ravaged them in 1618.

^ They inhabited up to 7 pueblos (towns).

^ Extrapolated from 3,000 warriors × 5.

Since 1992, the argument for a total, relentless, and pervasive genocide in the Americas has become accepted in some areas of Indigenous studies and genocide studies. For the most part, however, this argument has had little impact on mainstream scholarship in U.S. history or American Indian history. Scholars are more inclined than they once were to gesture to particular actions, events, impulses, and effects as genocidal, but genocide has not become a key concept in scholarship in these fields.

For the most part, however, the diseases that decimated the Natives were caused by natural contact. These Native peoples were greatly weakened, and as a result, they were less able to resist the Europeans. However, diseases themselves were rarely the sources of the genocides nor were they the sources of the deaths which were caused by genocidal means. The genocides were caused by the aggressive actions of one group towards another.

Some of the worst examples of escalating death by sickness and disease occurred on the Spanish Christian missions in Florida, Texas, California, Arizona, and New Mexico in the period 1690–1845. After the military delivered captive Indians to the missions, they were expected to perform arduous agricultural labour while being provided with no more than 1400 calories per day in low-nutrient foods, with some missions supplying as little as 715 calories per day.

^ McNeill & Pomeranz 2015 , p. 430: "That said, and ever since the initial Eastern seaboard settler wars against the Tsenacommacahs and Pequots in the 1620s and early 1630s, systematic genocidal massacre was a core component of native destruction throughout three centuries of largely 'Anglo' expansion across continental North America. The culmination of this process from the mid-1860s to mid-1880s ... native Araucanian resistance by the Argentinian and Chilean military in the Southern Cone pampas, primarily in the agribusiness interest. In Australia, too, 'Anglo' attrition or outright liquidation of Aborigines from the time of 'first contact' in 1788 reached its zenith in Queensland in these same decades, as a dedicated Native Mounted Police strove to cleanse the territory of indigenous tribes in favour of further millions of cattle stock. Undoubtedly, in all these instances, Western racism and contempt for natives as 'savages' played a critical role in psychocultural justifications for genocide" ^ Bloxham & Moses 2010 , p. 339: "The genocidal intent of California settlers and government officials was acted out in numerous battles and massacres (and aided by technological advances in weaponry, especially after the Civil War), in the abduction and sexual abuse of Indian women, and in the economic exploitation of Indian child labourers." ^ Blackhawk 2023 , pp. 27, 38: "More than any other work, Wolfe’s seminal 2006 essay, 'Settler colonialism and the elimination of the Native' established the 'centrality of dispossession' to our understandings of Indigenous genocide in the context of settler colonialism. His definition of 'settler colonialism' spoke directly to Genocide Studies scholars"; "With these works, a near consensus emerged. By most scholarly definitions and consistent with the UN Convention, these scholars all asserted that genocide against at least some Indigenous peoples had occurred in North America following colonisation, perpetuated first by colonial empires and then by independent nation-states" ^ Braun 2023 , p. 622: "These mass killings represent turning points in the history of the Spanish Atlantic conquest and share important characteristics. Each targeted Amerindian communities. Each was entirely or partially planned and executed by European actors, namely Spanish military entrepreneurs under the leadership of friar Nicolás de Ovando, Hernán Cortés and Pedro de Alvarado respectively. Each event can be described as a 'genocidal massacre' targeting a specific community because of its membership of a larger group" ^ Jones 2023 , p. 138.
