Herbert Faulkner Copeland (May 21, 1902 – October 15, 1968) was an American biologist who contributed to the theory of biological kingdoms .  He grouped unicellular organisms into two large kingdoms: the Monera kingdom and the Protista kingdom. In 1966, he included bacteria and one of the most primitive algae , called blue green algae , under Monera kingdom.

His father was Edwin Copeland who was also the founder of the College of Agriculture at the University of the Philippines Los Banos and a leading pteridologist .
