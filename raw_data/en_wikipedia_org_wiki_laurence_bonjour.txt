[ 2 ] Education and career [ edit ] He received his bachelor's degrees in Philosophy and Political Science from Macalester College and his doctorate in 1969 from Princeton University with a dissertation directed by Richard Rorty .  Before moving to UW he taught at the University of Texas at Austin .

[ 3 ] Philosophical work [ edit ] BonJour specializes in epistemology , Kant , and British empiricism , but is best known for his contributions to epistemology.  Initially defending coherentism in his anti-foundationalist critique The Structure of Empirical Knowledge (1985), BonJour subsequently moved to defend Cartesian foundationalism in later work such as 1998's In Defense of Pure Reason . The latter book is a sustained defense of a priori justification, strongly criticizing empiricists and pragmatists who dismiss it (such as W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty ).

In 1980, in his essay Externalist Theories of Empirical Knowledge , BonJour criticized the reliabilism of Armstrong and Goldman , proposing internalist approach to epistemic truth and knowledge justification.

[ 4 ] He formulated the examples of a clairvoyant and her reliable forecasts about the presence of the U.S. president in New York City .

[ 4 ] To set the problematic of this essay, BonJour said that foundationalism, the most common form of internalism, requires the concept of a basic  belief to solve the regress problem in epistemology: he wrote that this central concept is itself by no means unproblematic.
