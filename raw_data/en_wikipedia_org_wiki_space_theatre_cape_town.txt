Theatre in South Africa

The **Space Theatre** (also called **the Space**, _**Die Ruimte**_ in [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans "Afrikaans"), **The Peoples' Space** and reincarnated as the **New Space Theatre** in 2008) was a [fringe theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_theatre "Fringe theatre") in [Cape Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town "Cape Town"), [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa") which was active in the 1970s. It re-opened in late 2008.

History
-------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_Theatre_(Cape_Town)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

The original Space was founded in Cape Town in May 1972 by theatre photographer [Brian Astbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Astbury "Brian Astbury") and his actress wife [Yvonne Bryceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_Bryceland "Yvonne Bryceland")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Theatre_(Cape_Town)#cite_note-1) and relocated in 1976 to the [YMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA "YMCA") building 44 [Long Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Street_(Cape_Town) "Long Street (Cape Town)"). The Space established itself as a defiantly non-racial venue in a racially divided country. Taken over by Moyra Fine and Rob Amato after Astbury and Bryceland left, it survived as The People's Space for some two years before succumbing to overwhelming financial pressures.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Theatre_(Cape_Town)#cite_note-2)

Productions
-----------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_Theatre_(Cape_Town)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Productions")]

The first pioneering [fringe theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_theatre "Fringe theatre") in the country (before [Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Theatre_(Johannesburg) "Market Theatre (Johannesburg)") and [Baxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baxter_Theatre_Centre "Baxter Theatre Centre") Theatres), it mounted almost 300 productions, starting with the premier of [Athol Fugard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athol_Fugard "Athol Fugard")'s _Statements After an Arrest under the Immorality Act_. It hosted the first productions of the Kani/Ntshona/Fugard collaborations _The Island_ and _[Sizwe Bansi is Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizwe\_Bansi\_is\_Dead "Sizwe Bansi is Dead")_, and gave a voice to [Donald Howarth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Howarth "Donald Howarth")'s _Othello Slegs Blankes_, [Fatima Dike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_Dike "Fatima Dike") and [Pieter Dirk Uys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Dirk_Uys "Pieter Dirk Uys")' early plays, and many others.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

It became the home of [Yvonne Bryceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_Bryceland "Yvonne Bryceland"), [Athol Fugard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athol_Fugard "Athol Fugard"), [Pieter Dirk Uys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Dirk_Uys "Pieter Dirk Uys"), [David Kramer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kramer_(singer) "David Kramer (singer)"), [Barney Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Simon "Barney Simon"), [Winston Ntshona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Ntshona "Winston Ntshona"), [John Kani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kani "John Kani"), [Bill Flynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Flynn "Bill Flynn"), [Richard E Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E_Grant "Richard E Grant"), [Paul Slabolepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Slabolepsy "Paul Slabolepsy"), [Marius Weyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marius_Weyers "Marius Weyers"), [Marthinus Basson](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marthinus_Basson&action=edit&redlink=1 "Marthinus Basson (page does not exist)")[[af](https://af.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marthinus_Basson "af:Marthinus Basson")], [Fiona Ramsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Ramsay "Fiona Ramsay"), Percy Sieff, Fatima Dike, Blaise Koch, [Ian Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Roberts_(South_African_actor) "Ian Roberts (South African actor)"), [Leslee Udwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslee_Udwin "Leslee Udwin"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Theatre_(Cape_Town)#cite_note-Sassy_HK-3)[Henry Goodman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Goodman "Henry Goodman"), [Ben Dekker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Dekker "Ben Dekker"), Trix Pienaar, Grethe Fox, Bill Curry, Neil McCarthy, [Denise Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Newman_(actress) "Denise Newman (actress)"), Christine Basson, Mavis Taylor, Maralin van Reenen, Thoko Ntshinga, Timmy Kwebalana, Joko Scott, Lynne Maree, Dawie Malan, Kieth Grenville, Jacqui Singer, Roger Dwyer, Ron Fenton and a host of many more young actors, directors and writers who would become stars and stalwarts of the South African stage.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

New Space Theatre
-----------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_Theatre_(Cape_Town)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: New Space Theatre")]

In 2008, 36 years after the Space was initially founded, with the encouragement of its founding members and in line with [Cape Town City Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town_City_Council "Cape Town City Council")'s Inner City Development programme, the theatre re-opened its doors to theatre goers.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Theatre_(Cape_Town)#cite_note-4) There were many individuals who contributed to the success of the theatre. One of these, newcomer Leon Adams, a 21-year-old Ruth Prowse art student,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Theatre_(Cape_Town)#cite_note-5) introduced to the Space Theatre by Fatima Dike, was appointed resident Set Builder and Designer by Brian Astbury and worked on several productions including _Miss South Africa (6)_, _[Sizwe Banzi Is Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizwe\_Banzi\_Is\_Dead "Sizwe Banzi Is Dead")_ and _[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Resistible\_Rise\_of\_Arturo\_Ui "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui")_.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
