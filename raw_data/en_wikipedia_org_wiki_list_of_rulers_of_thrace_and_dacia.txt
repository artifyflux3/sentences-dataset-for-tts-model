Cosingas, according to the tradition of the country, was elected to be their priest and general; but the army took some objection to him, and refused to obey him. To suppress the rebelliousness that had taken hold of the troops, Cosingas built a number of long ladders, and fastened them one to another. He then put out a report, that he had decided to climb up to heaven, in order to inform Hera of the disobedience of the Thracians. The Thracians, who are notoriously stupid and ridiculous, were terrified by the idea of their general's intended journey, and the resulting wrath of heaven. They implored him not to carry out his plan, and they promised with an oath to obey all of his future commands.

Compare Werner 1961: 114-115, 239 ^ Manov 2015 dates the coins and inscription naming "Rhescuporis son of Cotys" to the beginning of the First Century AD and argues that they are the Sapaean Cotys III and his uncle Rhescuporis II/III. While a later date for this Rhescuporis and his father Cotys may be advisable (and therefore this Cotys would be distinct from Cotys son of Rhaezdus), Manov's hypothesis contradicts the father-son relationship between Cotys and Rhescuporis in the sources.

^ Mladjov, Thracian Kings, University of Michigan , who also gives an alternative sequence should Rhoegus be placed in the early Third Century BC: "But if Roigos is dated to the early 3rd century and was a son of Seuthēs III (e.g., Kojčev 2008), the pedigree and succession could be restored as follows: Seuthēs III–Roigos–Seuthēs IV–Tērēs IV–Seuthēs V; our Tērēs VI would become Tērēs V."

^ Tačeva 1997: 83-95, 246-247, develops an alternative to the long-dominant reconstruction of the political, chronological, and genealogical relationships reflected in this list (established by Dessau in 1913 and widely accepted, e.g., Sullivan 1990), having the Odrysian-Astaean line end with Sadalas II in 42 BC, making Cotys VII the brother (not brother-in-law) of the Sapaean Rhoemetalces I, and identifying Cotys VII's son Rhescuporis II (not Rhoemetalces I's brother, the Sapaean Rhescuporis II) as the father of Rhoemetalces II. Despite some improbabilities, this reconstruction has gained some acceptance at least as a viable alternative. A variation on this reconstruction by Delev 2016b accepts ending the Odrysian-Astaean line with Sadalas II (whom he combines with Sadalas III to end c. 31 BC), followed by Cotys VII, older brother (not brother-in-law) of the Sapaean Rhoemetalces I, and father of Rhescuporis II, but not grandfather of Rhoemetalces II (who would remain son of the Sapaean Rhescuporis II/III, the younger brother of Rhoemetalces I). In Delev 2016a, the same author posits that Cotys VII need not have reigned.

^ Mladjov, Thracian Kings, University of Michigan , "On the death of the last Astaean king in 11 BC, the Roman emperor Augustus conferred all of Thrace on the dead king’s Sapaean uncle Roimētalkēs I. In AD 46, on the murder of Roimētalkēs III by his wife, the kingdom of Thrace was annexed as a province by the Roman emperor Claudius I." ^ Tačeva 1997: 83-95, 246-247, develops an alternative to the long-dominant reconstruction of the political, chronological, and genealogical relationships reflected in this list (established by Dessau in 1913 and widely accepted, e.g., Sullivan 1990), having the Odrysian-Astaean line end with Sadalas II in 42 BC, making Cotys VII the brother (not brother-in-law) of the Sapaean Rhoemetalces I, and identifying Cotys VII's son Rhescuporis II (not Rhoemetalces I's brother, the Sapaean Rhescuporis II) as the father of Rhoemetalces II.

In Delev 2016a, the same author posits that Cotys VII need not have reigned. If Delev's reconstruction is correct, the Sapaean unification of Thrace would be under Cotys II in 31 BC, and he would be followed by his grandson Rhescuporis II, then the latter's uncle and guardian (Cotys II's son) Rhoemetalces I, the remaining relationships remaining unchanged from the ones indicated in this list, except perhaps for the numeration of rulers named Cotys and Rhescuporis.
