It is also a useful step toward the construction of the metric envelope , or tight span , which are basic (injective) objects of the category of metric spaces .

Following ( Holsztyński 1966 ), a notion of a metric space Y aimed at its subspace X is defined.

Informal introduction [ edit ] Informally, imagine terrain Y , and its part X , such that wherever in Y you place a sharpshooter, and an apple at another place in Y , and then let the sharpshooter fire, the bullet will go through the apple and will always hit a point of X , or at least it will fly arbitrarily close to points of X – then we say that Y is aimed at X .

A priori, it may seem plausible that for a given X the superspaces Y that aim at X can be arbitrarily large or at least huge.  We will see that this is not the case. Among the spaces which aim at a subspace isometric to X , there is a unique ( up to isometry ) universal one, Aim( X ), which in a sense of canonical isometric embeddings contains any other space aimed at (an isometric image of) X . And in the special case of an arbitrary compact metric space X every bounded subspace of an arbitrary metric space Y aimed at X is totally bounded (i.e. its metric completion is compact).

Definitions [ edit ] Let ( Y , d ) {\displaystyle (Y,d)} be a metric space. Let X {\displaystyle X} be a subset of Y {\displaystyle Y} , so that ( X , d | X ) {\displaystyle (X,d|_{X})} (the set X {\displaystyle X} with the metric from Y {\displaystyle Y} restricted to X {\displaystyle X} ) is a metric subspace of ( Y , d ) {\displaystyle (Y,d)} .  Then Definition .  Space Y {\displaystyle Y} aims at X {\displaystyle X} if and only if, for all points y , z {\displaystyle y,z} of Y {\displaystyle Y} , and for every real ϵ ϵ > 0 {\displaystyle \epsilon >0} , there exists a point p {\displaystyle p} of X {\displaystyle X} such that | d ( p , y ) − − d ( p , z ) | > d ( y , z ) − − ϵ ϵ .

{\displaystyle |d(p,y)-d(p,z)|>d(y,z)-\epsilon .} Let Met ( X ) {\displaystyle {\text{Met}}(X)} be the space of all real valued metric maps (non- contractive ) of X {\displaystyle X} . Define Aim ( X ) := { f ∈ ∈ Met ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) : f ( p ) + f ( q ) ≥ ≥ d ( p , q ) for all p , q ∈ ∈ X } .

{\displaystyle {\text{Aim}}(X):=\{f\in \operatorname {Met} (X):f(p)+f(q)\geq d(p,q){\text{ for all }}p,q\in X\}.} Then d ( f , g ) := sup x ∈ ∈ X | f ( x ) − − g ( x ) | < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle d(f,g):=\sup _{x\in X}|f(x)-g(x)|<\infty } for every f , g ∈ ∈ Aim ( X ) {\displaystyle f,g\in {\text{Aim}}(X)} is a metric on Aim ( X ) {\displaystyle {\text{Aim}}(X)} . Furthermore, δ δ X : : x ↦ ↦ d x {\displaystyle \delta _{X}\colon x\mapsto d_{x}} , where d x ( p ) := d ( x , p ) {\displaystyle d_{x}(p):=d(x,p)\,} , is an isometric embedding of X {\displaystyle X} into Aim ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aim} (X)} ; this is essentially a generalisation of the Kuratowski-Wojdysławski embedding of bounded metric spaces X {\displaystyle X} into C ( X ) {\displaystyle C(X)} , where we here consider arbitrary metric spaces (bounded or unbounded). It is clear that the space Aim ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aim} (X)} is aimed at δ δ X ( X ) {\displaystyle \delta _{X}(X)} .

Properties [ edit ] Let i : : X → → Y {\displaystyle i\colon X\to Y} be an isometric embedding. Then there exists a natural metric map j : : Y → → Aim ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle j\colon Y\to \operatorname {Aim} (X)} such that j ∘ ∘ i = δ δ X {\displaystyle j\circ i=\delta _{X}} : ( j ( y ) ) ( x ) := d ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (j(y))(x):=d(x,y)\,} for every x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X\,} and y ∈ ∈ Y {\displaystyle y\in Y\,} .

Theorem The space Y above is aimed at subspace X if and only if the natural mapping j : : Y → → Aim ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle j\colon Y\to \operatorname {Aim} (X)} is an isometric embedding.

Thus it follows that every space aimed at X can be isometrically mapped into Aim( X ), with some additional (essential) categorical requirements satisfied.

The space Aim( X ) is injective (hyperconvex in the sense of Aronszajn -Panitchpakdi) – given a metric space M, which contains Aim( X ) as a metric subspace, there is a canonical (and explicit) metric retraction of M onto Aim( X ) ( Holsztyński 1966 ).
