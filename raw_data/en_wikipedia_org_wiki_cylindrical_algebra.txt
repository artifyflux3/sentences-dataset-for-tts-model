For a product space, the cylinder σ-algebra is the one that is generated by cylinder sets .

In the context of a Banach space X {\displaystyle X} and its dual space of continuous linear functionals X ′ , {\displaystyle X',} the cylindrical σ-algebra A ( X , X ′ ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}(X,X')} is defined to be the coarsest σ-algebra (that is, the one with the fewest measurable sets) such that every continuous linear function on X {\displaystyle X} is a measurable function .  In general, A ( X , X ′ ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}(X,X')} is not the same as the Borel σ-algebra on X , {\displaystyle X,} which is the coarsest σ-algebra that contains all open subsets of X .

{\displaystyle X.} Definition [ edit ] Consider two topological vector spaces N {\displaystyle N} and M {\displaystyle M} with dual pairing ⟨ ⟨ , ⟩ ⟩ := ⟨ ⟨ , ⟩ ⟩ N , M {\displaystyle \langle ,\rangle :=\langle ,\rangle _{N,M}} , then we can define the so called Borel cylinder sets C f 1 , … … , f m , B = { x ∈ ∈ N : : ( ⟨ ⟨ x , f 1 ⟩ ⟩ , … … , ⟨ ⟨ x , f m ⟩ ⟩ ) ∈ ∈ B } {\displaystyle C_{f_{1},\dots ,f_{m},B}=\{x\in N\colon (\langle x,f_{1}\rangle ,\dots ,\langle x,f_{m}\rangle )\in B\}} for some f 1 , … … , f m ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle f_{1},\dots ,f_{m}\in M} and B ∈ ∈ B ( R m ) {\displaystyle B\in {\mathcal {B}}(\mathbb {R} ^{m})} . The family of all these sets is denoted as A f 1 , … … , f n {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}_{f_{1},\dots ,f_{n}}} .
Then Cyl ⁡ ⁡ ( N , M ) = ⨂ ⨂ n A f 1 , … … , f n {\displaystyle \operatorname {Cyl} (N,M)=\bigotimes _{n}{\mathfrak {A}}_{f_{1},\dots ,f_{n}}} is called the cylindrical algebra . Equivalently one can also look at the open cylinder sets and get the same algebra.

The cylindrical σ-algebra A ( N , M ) = σ σ ( Cyl ⁡ ⁡ ( N , M ) ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}(N,M)=\sigma (\operatorname {Cyl} (N,M))} is the σ-algebra generated by the cylinderical algebra.

[ 4 ] Properties [ edit ] Let X {\displaystyle X} a Hausdorff locally convex space which is also a hereditarily Lindelöf space , then A ( X , X ′ ) = B ( X ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}(X,X')={\mathcal {B}}(X).} [ 5 ] See also [ edit ] Cylinder set Cylinder set measure Measure theory in topological vector spaces References [ edit ] ^ Gine, Evarist; Nickl, Richard (2016).
