That is, Z 0 = | E | | H | , {\displaystyle Z_{0}={\frac {|\mathbf {E} |}{|\mathbf {H} |}},} where | E | is the electric field strength , and | H | is the magnetic field strength . Its presently accepted value is [ 1 ] Z 0 = 376.730 313 412 (59) Ω , where Ω is the ohm , the SI unit of electrical resistance . The impedance of free space (that is, the wave impedance of a plane wave in free space) is equal to the product of the vacuum permeability μ 0 and the speed of light in vacuum c 0 . Before 2019, the values of both these constants were taken to be exact (they were given in the definitions of the ampere and the metre respectively), and the value of the impedance of free space was therefore likewise taken to be exact. However, with the revision of the SI that came into force on 20 May 2019, the impedance of free space as expressed with an SI unit is subject to experimental measurement because only the speed of light in vacuum c 0 retains an exactly defined value.

Terminology [ edit ] The analogous quantity for a plane wave travelling through a dielectric medium is called the intrinsic impedance of the medium and designated η ( eta ). Hence Z 0 is sometimes referred to as the intrinsic impedance of free space , [ 2 ] and given the symbol η 0 .

[ 3 ] It has numerous other synonyms, including: wave impedance of free space , [ 4 ] the vacuum impedance , [ 5 ] intrinsic impedance of vacuum , [ 6 ] characteristic impedance of vacuum , [ 7 ] wave resistance of free space .

[ 8 ] Relation to other constants [ edit ] From the above definition, and the plane wave solution to Maxwell's equations , Z 0 = | E | | H | = μ μ 0 c = μ μ 0 ε ε 0 = 1 ε ε 0 c , {\displaystyle Z_{0}={\frac {|\mathbf {E} |}{|\mathbf {H} |}}=\mu _{0}c={\sqrt {\frac {\mu _{0}}{\varepsilon _{0}}}}={\frac {1}{\varepsilon _{0}c}},} where μ 0 ≈ 12.566 × 10 −7 H / m is the magnetic constant , also known as the permeability of free space, ε 0 ≈ 8.854 × 10 −12 F /m is the electric constant , also known as the permittivity of free space, c is the speed of light in free space, [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The reciprocal of Z 0 is sometimes referred to as the admittance of free space and represented by the symbol Y 0 .

Historical exact value [ edit ] Between 1948 and 2019, the SI unit the ampere was defined by choosing the numerical value of μ 0 to be exactly 4 π × 10 −7 H /m . Similarly, since 1983 the SI metre has been defined relative to the second  by choosing the value of c 0 to be 299 792 458 m/s . Consequently, until the 2019 revision, Z 0 = μ μ 0 c = 4 π π × × 29.979 2458 Ω Ω {\displaystyle Z_{0}=\mu _{0}c=4\pi \times 29.979\,2458~\Omega } exactly , or Z 0 = μ μ 0 c = π π × × 119.916 9832 Ω Ω {\displaystyle Z_{0}=\mu _{0}c=\pi \times 119.916\,9832~\Omega } exactly , or Z 0 = 376.730 313 461 77 … … Ω Ω .

{\displaystyle Z_{0}=376.730\,313\,461\,77\ldots ~\Omega .} This chain of dependencies changed when the ampere was redefined on 20 May 2019.

Approximation as 120π ohms [ edit ] It is very common in textbooks and papers written before about 1990 to substitute the approximate value 120 π ohms for Z 0 . This is equivalent to taking the speed of light c to be precisely 3 × 10 8 m/s in conjunction with the then-current definition of μ 0 as 4 π × 10 −7 H /m . For example, Cheng 1989 states [ 3 ] that the radiation resistance of a Hertzian dipole is R r ≈ ≈ 80 π π 2 ( l λ λ ) 2 {\displaystyle R_{r}\approx 80\pi ^{2}\left({\frac {l}{\lambda }}\right)^{2}} ( result in ohms; not exact ).

This practice may be recognized from the resulting discrepancy in the units of the given formula. Consideration of the units, or more formally dimensional analysis , may be used to restore the formula to a more exact form, in this case to R r = 2 π π 3 Z 0 ( l λ λ ) 2 .

{\displaystyle R_{r}={\frac {2\pi }{3}}Z_{0}\left({\frac {l}{\lambda }}\right)^{2}.} See also [ edit ] Electromagnetic wave equation Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field Near and far field Sinusoidal plane-wave solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation Space cloth Vacuum Wave impedance References and notes [ edit ] ^ "2022 CODATA Value: characteristic impedance of vacuum" .
