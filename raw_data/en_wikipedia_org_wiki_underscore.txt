Underlining was developed for mechanical machines like this [Underwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwood_Typewriter_Company "Underwood Typewriter Company") typewriter which had no **bold** or _[italic type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic\_type "Italic type")_. The only way to [emphasize text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphasis_(typography) "Emphasis (typography)") that was typewritten was to back up the carriage and type underscores beneath the text. Underlining was a workaround for shortcomings in typewriter technology.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-butterick-1)

Underscored or underlined text.

An **underscore** or **underline**[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-3) is a line drawn under a segment of text. In [proofreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading "Proofreading"), underscoring is a convention that says "set this text in [italic type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type "Italic type")", traditionally used on [manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript_(publishing) "Manuscript (publishing)") or [typescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript#Modern_variations "Manuscript") as an [instruction to the printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proofreader%27s_marks "List of proofreader's marks"). Its use to add emphasis in modern finished documents is generally avoided.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-butterick-1)

The (freestanding) **underscore character**, _, also called a **low line**, or **low dash**, originally appeared on the [typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter") so that underscores could be typed. To produce an underscored word, the word was typed, the [typewriter carriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter_carriage "Typewriter carriage") was moved back to the beginning of the word, and the word was [overtyped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overstrike "Overstrike") with the underscore character.

In modern usage, underscoring is achieved with a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language"), with the Unicode [combining low line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character "Combining character") or as a standard facility of [word processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processing "Word processing") software. The free-standing underscore character is used to indicate word boundaries in situations where spaces are not allowed, such as in computer [filenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename "Filename"), [email addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address "Email address"), and in Internet [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator "Uniform Resource Locator"), for example `Mr_John_Smith`. It is also used as [a proofreader's mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proofreader%27s_marks "List of proofreader's marks"), to indicate that text should be italicised when [typeset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting "Typesetting"), for instance `_thus_` is to be rendered as _thus_.

The combining diacritic, U+0331◌̱[COMBINING MACRON BELOW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CC%B1 "̱"), is similar to the combining low line but is shorter. The difference between "macron below" and "low line" is that the latter results in an unbroken underline when it is run together: compare a̱ḇc̱ and a̲b̲c̲ (only the latter should look like abc).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-The_Unicode_Standard-4)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-5)

In a [manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript "Manuscript") (or typescript) to be [typeset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeset "Typeset"), various forms of underlining (see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#Manuscripts)) were therefore conventionally used to indicate that text should be set in special type such as [italics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type "Italic type"), part of a procedure known as [markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language#History "Markup language"). In printed documents underlining is generally avoided, with [italics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type "Italic type") or [small caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_caps "Small caps") often used instead, or (especially in headings) using [capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization "Capitalization"), [bold type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold_type "Bold type") or greater [body height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_height_(typography) "Body height (typography)") (font size).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-butterick-1) Underlining may still be seen in display work.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-6)

A series of underscores (like __________) may be used to reserve a blank space in text that is later to be filled in by hand, such as on a paper form. It is also sometimes used to create a horizontal line; other symbols with similar [glyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph"), such as hyphens and dashes, are also used for this purpose.

In [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"), [Slovene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_language "Slovene language") and some other [Slavic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages "Slavic languages"), the underscore has recently gained prominence as the punctuation to form [gender-neutral suffixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language "Gender-neutral language") in gendered nouns and other parts of the speech.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-7)

The underscore is also used in modern editions of Spanish vocal sheet music to indicate [elision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision#Spanish "Elision"), instead of the [breve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breve "Breve") below (U+032E◌̮[COMBINING BREVE BELOW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breve#Combining_breve_below "Breve")), which is less convenient to input on a computer.

In mathematical notations, underscores are sometimes used in the following contexts:

In [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser"), default settings typically distinguish [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink "Hyperlink") by underlining them (and usually changing their color), but both users and websites can change the settings to make some or all hyperlinks appear differently (or even without distinction from normal text).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-butterick-1)

As early output devices ([Teleprinters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter "Teleprinter"), [CRTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube "Cathode-ray tube") and [line printers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_printer "Line printer")) could not produce more than one character at a location, it was not possible to underscore text, so early encodings such as [ITA2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code#ITA2 "Baudot code") and the first versions of [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII-1963 "ASCII-1963") had no underscore. IBM's [EBCDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC "EBCDIC") character-coding system, introduced in 1964, added the underscore, which IBM referred to as the "break character". IBM's report on NPL (the early name of what is now called [PL/I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I "PL/I")) leaves the character set undefined, but specifically mentions the break character, and gives `RATE_OF_PAY` as an example identifier.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-10) By 1967 the underscore had spread to [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII-1967 "ASCII-1967"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-11) replacing the similarly shaped left-arrow character, ← (see also: [PIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Interchange_Program "Peripheral Interchange Program")). [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)"), developed at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, allowed the underscore in identifiers.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-12)

Underscore predates the existence of lower-case letters in many systems, so often it had to be used to make multi-word identifiers, since [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase "CamelCase") (see below) was not available.

### Programming conventions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Underscore&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Programming conventions")]

Underscores inserted between letters are very common to make a "multi-word" identifier in languages that cannot handle [spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character "Whitespace character") in identifiers. This convention is known as "[snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case "Snake case")" (the other popular method is called [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase "CamelCase"), where capital letters are used to show where the words start).

An underscore as the first character in an [ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier "Identifier") is often used to indicate an internal implementation that is not considered part of the [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface") and should not be called by code outside that implementation. In [Dart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language) "Dart (programming language)"), all private properties of classes must start with an underscore; this usage is also common in other languages such as [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") even though those provide keywords to indicate that members are private. It is extensively used to hide variables and functions used for implementations in [header files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_file "Header file"). In fact, the use of a single underscore for this became so common that C compilers had to standardize on a _double_ leading underscore (for instance `__DATE__`) for actual built-in variables to avoid conflicts with the ones in header files. [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "PHP") "reserves all function names starting with __ [double underscore] as magical."[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-13)

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)") uses names that both start and end with double underscores (so called "dunder methods", as in **d**ouble **under**score) for magic members used for purposes such as operator overloading and reflection, and names starting but not ending with a double underscore to denote private [member variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_variable "Member variable") of classes which should be [mangled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling "Name mangling") in a manner which prevents them from colliding with members of derived classes unless the classes have the same name (`__bar` in class `Foo` will be mangled to `_Foo__bar`). By convention, members starting with a single underscore are considered private or protected, although this behavior only has inherent effect for modules, where `import *` statements by default import all names that do not start with an underscore, unless an export list is explicitly defined by the module.

A variable named with just an underscore often has special meaning. `$_` or `_` is the previous command or result in many [interactive shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop "Read–eval–print loop"), such as those of [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"), [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language) "Ruby (programming language)"), and [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl"). In [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl"), `@_` is a special [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type "Array data type") variable that holds the [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming) "Parameter (computer programming)") to a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(programming) "Function (programming)"). In [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure "Clojure"), it indicates an argument whose value will be ignored.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-14)

In some languages with [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching "Pattern matching"), such as [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell "Haskell") and other [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML "Standard ML")-family languages, [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language) "Rust (programming language)"), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)"), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"), [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog "Prolog"), and the [Wolfram Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Language "Wolfram Language"), the pattern `_` matches any value, but does not perform [binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binding "Data binding"), hence it can be reused multiple times in a single pattern and does not require declaration.

The ASCII underscore character can be inserted with the [entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML_entity "SGML entity")`&lowbar;` or `&UnderBar;` (or `&#95;` or `&#x5F;`).

HTML has a [presentational element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Presentational_markup "HTML element")`<u>` that was originally used to underline text; this usage was [deprecated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecated "Deprecated") in HTML4 in favor of the [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS "CSS") style `{text-decoration: underline}`.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-mozilla-15) In HTML5, the tag reappeared but its meaning was changed significantly: it now "represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-mozilla-15) This facility is intended for example to provide a red wavy line (or wiggly line) underline to flag spelling errors at input time but which are not to be embedded in any stored file (unlike an emphasis mark, which would be). Other styles are also available: doubled, dotted, and dashed.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-W3Schools_Online_Web_Tutorials_g824-16)

The elements may also exist in other [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language"), such as [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki "MediaWiki"). The [Text Encoding Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative "Text Encoding Initiative") (TEI) provides an extensive selection of related elements for marking editorial activity (insertion, deletion, correction, addition, etc.).

[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") has a free-standing underscore _ at U+005F, inherited from ASCII, which is a legacy of the typewriter practice of underlining using backspace and overtype. Modern practice uses the [combining diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_diacritic "Combining diacritic")U+0332◌̲COMBINING LOW LINE that results in an underline when run together: u̲n̲d̲e̲r̲l̲i̲n̲e̲. Unicode also has U+0333◌̳COMBINING DOUBLE LOW LINE. In addition, there are single line and double line versions of the [combining macron below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_macron_below "Combining macron below"), a diacritic that applies to single letters only.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-The_Unicode_Standard-4)

### "Simulated" underlines in plain-text

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Underscore&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: \"Simulated\" underlines in plain-text")]

In [plain-text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain-text "Plain-text") applications, including plain-text [e-mails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail "E-mail") where emphasis markup is not possible, the desired emphasis is often indicated by surrounding words with underscore characters. For example, "You must use _emulsion_ paint on the ceiling".

Some applications will automatically add [emphasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphasis_(typography) "Emphasis (typography)") to text manually bracketed by underscores, either by underlining or by italicizing it (e.g. `_string_` may render as either string or _string_).

### As a marker for incorrectness

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Underscore&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: As a marker for incorrectness")]

Underline (typically red or wavy or both) is often used by [spell checkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spell_checker "Spell checker") (and [grammar checkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar_checker "Grammar checker")) to denote misspelled or otherwise incorrect text.

Depending on local conventions, the following kinds of underlines may be used inline on manuscripts to indicate the special [typefaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface "Typeface") to be used:[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-17)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-18)

*   single dashed underline for _stet_, 'let it stand', proof-reading mark cancelled.
*   single straight underline for _italic type_
*   single wavy underline for **bold type**
*   double straight underline for SMALL CAPS
*   double underline of one straight line and one wavy line for _**bold italic**_
*   triple underline for FULL CAPITAL LETTERS (used among small caps or to change text already typed as lower case).

Underlines in Chinese
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Underscore&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Underlines in Chinese")]

In [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"), the underline is a little-used punctuation mark for proper names ([simplified Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters "Simplified Chinese characters"): 专名号; [traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 專名號; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): zhuānmínghào; literally "[proper name mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_name_mark "Proper name mark")", used for personal and geographic names). Its meaning is somewhat akin to capitalization in English and should never be used for emphasis even if the influence of English computing makes the latter sometimes occur. A wavy underline ([simplified Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters "Simplified Chinese characters"): 书名号; [traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 書名號; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): shūmínghào; literally, "book title mark") serves a similar function, but marks names of literary works instead of proper names.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore#cite_note-19)

In the case of two or more adjacent proper names, each individual proper name is separately underlined so there should be a slight gap between the underlining of each proper name.

*   [Overline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overline "Overline")
*   [Space Character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation) "Space (punctuation)")
*   [Strikethrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikethrough "Strikethrough")
*   [Undertie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertie "Undertie")
