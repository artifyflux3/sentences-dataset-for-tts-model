1570315 Links Journal homepage Online archive Fundamenta Mathematicae is a peer-reviewed scientific journal of mathematics with a special focus on the foundations of mathematics , concentrating on set theory , mathematical logic , topology and its interactions with algebra , and dynamical systems .

The first specialized journal in the field of mathematics, originally it covered only topology , set theory , and foundations of mathematics .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] It is published by the Mathematics Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences .

History [ edit ] The journal was conceived by Zygmunt Janiszewski as a means to foster mathematical research in Poland.

[ 5 ] Janiszewski posited that, to achieve its goal, the journal should not compel Polish mathematicians to submit articles written exclusively in Polish, and should be devoted only to a specialized topic in mathematics; [ 6 ] Fundamenta Mathematicae thus became the first specialized journal in the field of mathematics.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Despite Janiszewski having, in a 1918 article, given the initial impetus for the creation of the journal, [ 7 ] he did not live long enough to see the first issue published, in Warsaw , as he died on 3 January 1920.

Wacław Sierpiński and Stefan Mazurkiewicz took over as editors-in-chief . Soon after its launch, the founding editors were joined by Kazimierz Kuratowski and, later, by Karol Borsuk .

Abstracting and indexing [ edit ] The journal is abstracted and indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded , [ 8 ] Scopus , [ 9 ] and Zentralblatt MATH .

[ 10 ] According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal has a 2016 impact factor of 0.609.

^ According to Kuratowski (1980 , pp. 31–32) and to the introduction to the 100th volume of the journal (1978 , pp=1–2). These two sources cite an article written by Janiszewski himself in 1918 and titled " On the needs of Mathematics in Poland ".

^ Kuratowski (1980 , pp. 31–32) and One Hundred Volumes (1978 , pp. 1–2) stress the fact that these two requirements represented revolutionary decisions at that time.
