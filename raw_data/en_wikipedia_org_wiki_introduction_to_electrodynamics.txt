Griffiths For the introductory article, see Introduction to electromagnetism .

Introduction to Electrodynamics Front cover of fourth edition Author David Jeffrey Griffiths Language English Subject Electromagnetism Genre Non-fiction Publisher Cambridge University Publication date 1981, 1989, 1999, 2013, 2023 Publication place United States Pages xix + 602 + 4 ISBN 978-1-009-39775-9 Introduction to Electrodynamics is a textbook by physicist David J. Griffiths . Generally regarded as a standard undergraduate text on the subject, [ 1 ] it began as lecture notes that have been perfected over time.

[ 2 ] Its most recent edition, the fifth, was published in 2023 by Cambridge University Press .

[ 3 ] This book uses SI units (what it calls the mks convention) exclusively. A table for converting between SI and Gaussian units is given in Appendix C.

[ 4 ] Griffiths said he was able to reduce the price of his textbook on quantum mechanics simply by changing the publisher, from Pearson to Cambridge University Press.

[ 2 ] He has done the same with this one. (See the ISBN in the box to the right.) Table of contents (5th edition) [ edit ] Preface Advertisement Chapter 1: Vector Analysis Chapter 2: Electrostatics Chapter 3: Potentials Chapter 4: Electric Fields in Matter Chapter 5: Magnetostatics Chapter 6: Magnetic Fields in Matter Chapter 7: Electrodynamics Intermission Chapter 8: Conservation Laws Chapter 9: Electromagnetic Waves Chapter 10: Potentials and Fields Chapter 11: Radiation Chapter 12: Electrodynamics and Relativity Appendix A: Vector Calculus in Curvilinear Coordinates Appendix B: The Helmholtz Theorem Appendix C: Units Index Reception [ edit ] Paul D. Scholten, a professor at Miami University (Ohio) , opined that the first edition of this book offers a streamlined, though not always in-depth, coverage of the fundamental physics of electrodynamics. Special topics such as superconductivity or plasma physics are not mentioned. Breaking with tradition, Griffiths did not give solutions to all the odd-numbered questions in the book. Another unique feature of the first edition is the informal, even emotional, tone. The author sometimes referred to the reader directly. Physics received the primary focus. Equations are derived and explained, and common misconceptions are addressed.

[ 5 ] According to Robert W. Scharstein from the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Alabama , the mathematics used in the third edition is just enough to convey the subject and the problems are valuable teaching tools that do not involve the "plug and chug disease." Although students of electrical engineering are not expected to encounter complicated boundary-value problems in their career, [ note 1 ] this book is useful to them as well, because of its emphasis on conceptual rather than mathematical issues. He argued that with this book, it is possible to skip the more mathematically involved sections to the more conceptually interesting topics, such as antennas. Moreover, the tone is clear and entertaining. Using this book "rejuvenated" his enthusiasm for teaching the subject.

[ 6 ] The script-r used in the book.

Colin Inglefield, an associate professor of physics at Weber State University (Utah) , commented that the third edition is notable for its informal and conversational style that may appeal to a large class of students. The ordering of its chapters and its contents are fairly standard and are similar to texts at the same level. The first chapter offers a valuable review of vector calculus, which is essential for understanding this subject. While most other authors, including those aimed at a more advanced audience, denote the distance from the source point to the field point by | x − − x ′ | {\displaystyle |\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {x} '|} , Griffiths uses a script r {\displaystyle r} (see figure).

[ note 2 ] Unlike some comparable books, the level of mathematical sophistication is not particularly high. For example, Green's functions are not anywhere mentioned. Instead, physical intuition and conceptual understanding are emphasized. In fact, care is taken to address common misconceptions and pitfalls. It contains no computer exercises. Nevertheless, it is perfectly adequate for undergraduate instruction in physics. As of June 2005, Inglefield has taught three semesters using this book.

[ 7 ] Physicists Yoni Kahn of Princeton University and Adam Anderson of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory indicated that Griffiths' Electrodynamics offers a dependable treatment of all materials in the electromagnetism section of the Physics Graduate Record Examinations (Physics GRE) except circuit analysis.
