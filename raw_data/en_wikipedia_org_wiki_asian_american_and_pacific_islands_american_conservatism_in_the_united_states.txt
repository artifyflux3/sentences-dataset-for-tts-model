Many Republican Party members with these origins have obtained posts as elected representatives and political appointments as office holders.

Voting trends [ edit ] From the 1940s to the 1990s most Asian Americans were refugees who had fled mainland China, North Korea or Vietnam, and were strongly anti–Communist.

[ citation needed ] Many had ties to conservative organizations.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In recent years, more liberal Asian–American groups such as newer Chinese and Indian immigrants have greatly changed the Asian–American political demographics, as well as a larger proportion of younger Asian Americans, many of whom have completed college degrees.

[ 3 ] During the 1990s and 2000s, Asian American voting behavior shifted from moderate support for the Republican Party to stronger support for the Democratic Party .

[ 4 ] In the 1992 presidential election Republican George H. W. Bush received 55% of the Asian–American vote compared to 31% for Democrat Bill Clinton . Asian Americans voted Republican and were the only racial group more conservative than whites in the 1990s, according to surveys.

[ 1 ] By the 2004 election , Democrat John Kerry won 56% of the Asian American vote, with Chinese and Indian Americans tending to support Kerry, and Vietnamese and Filipino Americans tending to support George Bush .

[ 5 ] Japanese–Americans leaned towards Kerry, while Korean–Americans leaned towards Bush.

[ 5 ] Democrat Barack Obama won 62% of the Asian American vote in the 2008 presidential election , [ 6 ] with the margin increasing during the 2012 presidential election , where Asian Americans voted to re-elect Obama by 73%.

[ 7 ] In the 2014 midterm elections , based on exit polls, 50% of Asian Americans voted Republican, while 49% voted Democrat; this swing towards voting for Republicans was a shift from the strong Democratic vote in 2012, and had not reached 50% since 1996.

[ 8 ] The 2016 National Asian American Survey , conducted before the 2016 presidential election , found that 55% of Asian American registered voters supported Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and only 14% supported Republican candidate Donald Trump .

[ 9 ] Despite their growing trend of voting for Democrats in national elections, Asian Americans have tended to identify as independents and have not developed strong ties to political parties as a group.

[ 10 ] Due to the smaller size of the groups population, in comparison to the population as a whole, it has been difficult to get an adequate sampling to forecast voter outcomes for Asian Americans.

[ 11 ] In 2008, polls indicated that 35% considered themselves non-partisan , 32% Democrats, 19% independents , and 14% Republicans.

[ 12 ] The 2012 National Asian American Survey found that 51% considered themselves non–partisan, 33% Democrats, 14% Republicans, and 2% Other ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Hmong , Indian, and Korean Americans strongly identified as Democrats, and Filipino and Vietnamese Americans most strongly identified as Republicans.

[ 14 ] In 2013, according to the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund , Chinese Americans were the least likely Asian American ethnicity to have a party affiliation, with only one third belonging to a party.

[ 15 ] The 2016 National Asian American Survey found that 41% of Asian Americans identified as non-partisan, 41% as Democrats (a modest increase from 2008 and 2012), and 16% as Republicans.

[ 9 ] Neither the Republican nor Democratic parties have financed significant efforts to the registration of Asian Americans, however much more attention has been focused on contributions from Asian Americans, [ 16 ] having once been referred to as "the second most generous political donors after Jewish Americans." [ 17 ] As recently as 2006, the outreach efforts of America's two major political parties have been unbalanced, with the Democratic Party devoting more resources in attracting Asian Americans.

[ 18 ] In 2016, a majority of Asian-Americans possessed the same political views on racial profiling, education, social security, and immigration reform as the Democratic Party; the efforts to attract Asian-Americans has produced a proportionally significant growth in Democratic affiliation by Asian-Americans from 2012 to 2016 by 12 percent.

[ 19 ] Political affiliation aside, Asian-Americans have trended to become more politically active as a whole, with 2008 seeing an increase of voter participation by 4% to a 49% voting rate.

[ 20 ] Such efforts by the Democratic Party in attracting Asian Americans came to an apex in 2020, with only Vietnamese Americans leaning mostly to the Republicans.
