Plant psammophiles are also known as psammophytes . They thrive in places such as the Arabian Peninsula and the Sahara [ 2 ] and also the dunes of coastal regions.

Because of the unique ecological selective pressures of sand, often times animals on opposite sides of the planet can convergently evolve similar features, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as ecomorphological convergence.

[ 3 ] The Crotalus cerastes native to American deserts and the Bitis peringueyi native to Namibian deserts have independently evolved sidewinding behavior to traverse across sand.

[ 4 ] In addition, the African jerboa and the American kangaroo rat have separately evolved a bipedal form with large hind legs that allow them to hop.

Etymology [ edit ] Psammo is from Ancient Greek ψάμμος (psámmos, “sand”); -philo is from Ancient Greek φίλος (phílos, “dear, beloved”) via Latin -phila .

[ 5 ] Popular culture [ edit ] With the correct spelling of the word psammophile , Florida eighth-grader Dev Shah, one of 231 contestants, won the 95th Scripps National Spelling Bee in June 2023 and was awarded $50,000 in prize money.
