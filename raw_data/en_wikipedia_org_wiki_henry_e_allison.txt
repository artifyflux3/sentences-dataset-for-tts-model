**Henry Edward Allison** (April 25, 1937 – June 5, 2023) was an American scholar of [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant"), widely considered to be one of the most eminent English-language Kant scholars of the postwar era.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-2) He was a professor and chair of the Philosophy Department at the [University of California, San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego "University of California, San Diego")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-3) and a professor at [Boston University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University "Boston University").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-bu.edu-4)

Allison graduated from [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University") with a B.A. in Philosophy in 1959.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-Harvard_Review_of_Philosophy-5) He wanted to work on philosophy of religion, and so he enrolled at [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University"); it had a joint master's program with [Union Theological Seminary (New York)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Theological_Seminary_(New_York) "Union Theological Seminary (New York)").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-Harvard_Review_of_Philosophy-5) He received his M.A. in 1961. He then entered the Ph.D. program in philosophy at Columbia. However, he signed up for a course on the [Critique of Pure Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_Pure_Reason "Critique of Pure Reason") taught by [Aron Gurwitsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_Gurwitsch "Aron Gurwitsch") at the [New School for Social Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_School_for_Social_Research "New School for Social Research"). As a result, "I did decide to transfer to the New School and work with Gurwitsch."[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-Harvard_Review_of_Philosophy-5) He earned his Ph.D. in philosophy at the New School for Social research in 1964 with a dissertation on [Lessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing "Gotthold Ephraim Lessing") written under the direction of Gurwitsch.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-:0-6) After teaching at the [State University of New York at Potsdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_University_of_New_York_at_Potsdam "State University of New York at Potsdam"), the [Pennsylvania State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University "Pennsylvania State University"), and the [University of Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida "University of Florida"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-Harvard_Review_of_Philosophy-5) he taught from 1973 until 1996 at the [University of California, San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego "University of California, San Diego"), where an endowed chair was named in his honor.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-7) After a visiting appointment as the John Findlay Visiting Professor in 1995, he joined the faculty at [Boston University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University "Boston University") in 1996, remaining until 2004.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-:0-6) His final appointment was at the [University of California, Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis "University of California, Davis").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-Leiter_Reports-8) He was a fellow of the [Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Academy_of_Science_and_Letters "Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters") from 1996[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-9) and a Fellow of the [American Academy of Arts & Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_%26_Sciences "American Academy of Arts & Sciences") in 2023.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-10) He died before he could be inducted, on June 5, 2023, at the age of 86.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-11)

His areas of interest were [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant"), [Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza "Baruch Spinoza"), [German idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_idealism "German idealism"), [18th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18th-century_philosophy "18th-century philosophy") and [19th century philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th-century_philosophy "19th-century philosophy").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-bu.edu-4) Allison was perhaps best known for his 1983 book, _Kant's Transcendental Idealism: An Interpretation and Defense_, which proposed a new "epistemological" reading of the _[Critique of Pure Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique\_of\_Pure\_Reason "Critique of Pure Reason")_ that was both radically different from standard interpretations and offered responses to many of the objections advanced by philosophers like [Paul Guyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Guyer "Paul Guyer"). The "two aspects' reading "interprets [transcendental idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_idealism "Transcendental idealism") as a fundamentally epistemological theory that distinguishes between two standpoints on the objects of experience: the human standpoint, from which objects are viewed relative to epistemic conditions that are peculiar to human cognitive faculties (namely, the a priori forms of our sensible intuition); and the standpoint of an intuitive intellect, from which the same objects could be known in themselves and independently of any epistemic conditions."[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Allison#cite_note-12)
