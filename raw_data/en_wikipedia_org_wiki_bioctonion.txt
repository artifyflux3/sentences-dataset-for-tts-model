The product of two bioctonions is defined using biquaternion multiplication and the biconjugate p → p*: ( p , q ) ( r , s ) = ( p r − − s ∗ ∗ q , s p + q r ∗ ∗ ) .

{\displaystyle (p,q)(r,s)=(pr-s^{*}q,\ sp+qr^{*}).} The bioctonion z = ( p,q ) has conjugate z * = ( p *, – q ).

Then norm N ( z ) of bioctonion z is z z * = p p * + q q *, which is a complex quadratic form with eight terms.

The bioctonion algebra is sometimes introduced as simply the complexification of real octonions , but in abstract algebra it is the result of the Cayley–Dickson construction that begins with the field of complex numbers , the trivial involution, and quadratic form z 2 . The algebra of bioctonions is an example of an octonion algebra .

For any pair of bioctonions y and z , N ( y z ) = N ( y ) N ( z ) , {\displaystyle N(yz)=N(y)N(z),} showing that N is a quadratic form admitting composition, and hence the bioctonions form a composition algebra .

Guy Roos explained how bioctonions are used to present the exceptional symmetric domains: [ 1 ] The explicit description of the exceptional domains ... involves 3x3 matrices with entries in the Cayley-Graves algebra O C of complex octonions ... The space H 3 ( O C ) {\displaystyle H_{3}(O_{C})} of such matrices which are Hermitian with respect to the Cayley conjugation can be endowed with the structure of a Jordan algebra using a product that generalizes in a natural way the symmetrized product x ∘ ∘ y = 1 2 ( x y + y x ) {\displaystyle x\circ y={\tfrac {1}{2}}(xy+yx)} of ordinary square matrices . This algebra is known as the Albert algebra or exceptional Jordan algebra . It is the natural place to describe the exceptional symmetric domain of dimension 27. The second exceptional symmetric domain (of complex dimension 16) lives in the space M 2 , 1 ( O C ) {\displaystyle M_{2,1}(O_{C})} of 2x1 matrices with octonion entries.

Complex octonions have been used to describe the generations of quarks and leptons .
