[1] Landmark of Darmstadt: Hochzeitsturm [ de ] ("Wedding Tower"), built in 1908 in Jugendstil architecture Darmstadt ( German: [ˈdaʁmʃtat] ⓘ ) is a city in the state of Hesse in Germany, located in the southern part of the Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt Metropolitan Region) . Darmstadt has around 160,000 inhabitants, making it the fourth largest city in the state of Hesse after Frankfurt am Main , Wiesbaden , and Kassel .

Darmstadt holds the official title "City of Science" (German: Wissenschaftsstadt ) as it is a major centre of scientific institutions, universities, and high-technology companies. The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the European Space Agency 's European Space Operations Centre (ESA ESOC) are located in Darmstadt, as well as GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research , where several chemical elements such as bohrium (1981), meitnerium (1982), hassium (1984), darmstadtium (1994), roentgenium (1994), and copernicium (1996) were discovered.

[ 3 ] The existence of the following elements was also confirmed at GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research : nihonium (2012), flerovium (2009), moscovium (2012), livermorium (2010), and tennessine (2012).

[ 4 ] The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is an international accelerator facility under construction. Darmstadt is also the seat of the world's oldest pharmaceutical company, Merck , which is the city's largest employer.

View across Darmstadt towards the Frankfurt skyline The Mathildenhöhe, including the Darmstadt artists' colony , a major centre of the Jugendstil artistic movement, referring both to the group of artists active in the city in the late 19th and early 20th century, as well as the buildings which they designed, together with the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt , were recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2021.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Darmstadt was formerly the capital of a sovereign state, the Grand Duchy of Hesse and its successor, the People's State of Hesse , a federal state of Germany. As the capital of an increasingly prosperous duchy , the city gained some international prominence and remains one of the wealthiest cities in Europe. In the 20th century, industry (especially chemicals), as well as large science and electronics (and later, information technology) sectors became increasingly important, and are still a major part of the city's economy. It is also home to the football club SV Darmstadt 98 .

Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse) , the wife of Nicholas II of Russia , as well as Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse) , the wife of Alexander II of Russia , who were related, were born in this city.

History [ edit ] Darmstadt in 1626 The 'Schlossplatz', a market square in front of the Ducal Palace around 1900: one of the few areas to survive in similar style after World War II Origins [ edit ] The name Darmstadt first appears towards the end of the 11th century, then as Darmundestat .

[ 7 ] Darmstadt was chartered as a city by the Holy Roman Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian in 1330, at which time it belonged to the counts of Katzenelnbogen .

[ 8 ] The city, then called Darmstait , became a secondary residence for the counts, with a small castle established at the site of the current, much larger edifice.

[ 9 ] When the house of Katzenelnbogen became extinct in 1479, the city was passed to the Landgraviate of Hesse , and was seat of the ruling landgraves (1567–1806) and thereafter (to 1918) of the grand dukes of Hesse .

[ 10 ] [ unreliable source?

] Industrial age [ edit ] Darmstadt in 1909 The city's population grew during the 19th century, from a little over 10,000, to 72,000 inhabitants.

[ 11 ] A polytechnical school, which later became a Technical University now known as TU Darmstadt , was established in 1877.

[ 12 ] In the early 20th century, Darmstadt was an important centre for the art movement of Jugendstil , the German variant of Art Nouveau .

[ 13 ] Also during this period, in 1912 the chemist Anton Kollisch , working for the pharmaceutical company Merck , first synthesised the chemical MDMA (ecstasy) in Darmstadt.

[ 14 ] Darmstadt's municipal area was extended in 1937 to include the neighbouring localities of Arheilgen [ 15 ] and Eberstadt, [ 16 ] and in 1938 the city was separated administratively from the surrounding district ( Kreis ).

[ 17 ] Nazi Germany [ edit ] Darmstadt was the first city in Germany to force Jewish shops to close in early 1933, shortly after the Nazis took power in Germany. The shops were only closed for one day, for "endangering communal order and tranquility".

[ 18 ] In 1942, over 3,000 Jews from Darmstadt were first forced into a collection camp located in the Liebigschule, and later deported to concentration camps [ 19 ] where most eventually died. In 1944, the city was also the location of a subcamp of the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp .

[ 20 ] Several prominent members of the German resistance movement against the Nazis were citizens of Darmstadt, including Wilhelm Leuschner and Theodor Haubach , both executed for their opposition to Hitler's regime.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Darmstadt was first bombed on 30 July 1940, and 34 other air raids would follow before the war's end. The old city centre was largely destroyed in a British bombing raid on 11/12 September 1944.

[ 23 ] This attack was an example of "area bombing" using high explosive and incendiary bombs, which combined in that attack to create a firestorm, a self-sustaining combustion process in which winds generated by the fire ensure it continues to burn until everything possible has been consumed.

[ 24 ] During this attack, an estimated 11,000 to 12,500 of the inhabitants were killed, and 66,000 to 70,000 were left homeless.

[ 19 ] Over three-quarters of Darmstadt's inner city was destroyed.

[ 25 ] Post-war rebuilding was done in a relatively plain architectural style, although a number of the historic buildings were rebuilt to their original appearance following the city's capture on 25 March 1945 by the American 4th Armored Division .

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] Today around 30% of Darmstadt consists of buildings from before World War II.

[ 28 ] Post–World War II [ edit ] Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Darmstadt became home to many technology companies and research institutes, and has been promoting itself as a "city of science" since 1997.

[ 29 ] It is well known as a high-tech centre in the vicinity of Frankfurt Airport , with important activities in spacecraft operations (the European Space Agency 's European Space Operations Centre , European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites ), chemistry, pharmacy, information technology, biotechnology, telecommunications (substantial Deutsche Telekom presence) and mechatronics .

[ 29 ] In 2000, its region also scored Rank 3 amongst 97 German regions in the WirtschaftsWoche test ranking Germany's high-tech regions.

[ 8 ] The roots of Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences goes back to 1876 [ 30 ] along with Technische Universität Darmstadt (the first electrical engineering chair and inventions fame), when both these Universities were an integrated entities, a need for a separate industry based research educational institution was felt in the early 1930s, finally University of Applied sciences emerged as a separate industry based research educational institution in 1971 and is the largest University of Applied Sciences in Hesse (German: Hessen ) with about 16,500 students.

[ 31 ] The TU Darmstadt is one of the important technical institutes in Germany and is well known for its research and teaching in the Electrical, Mechanical and Civil Engineering disciplines.

[ 32 ] Together with other tertiary institutions, the TU is responsible for the large student population of the city, which stood at 33,547 in 2004.

[ 8 ] Boroughs [ edit ] Karolinenplatz Rheinstrasse in central Darmstadt Darmstadt has nine official 'Stadtteile' ( boroughs ). These are: [ 33 ] Darmstadt-Arheilgen Darmstadt-Bessungen Darmstadt-Eberstadt Darmstadt-Kranichstein Darmstadt-Mitte ("Central Darmstadt") Darmstadt-Nord ("North") Darmstadt-Ost ("East") Darmstadt-West Darmstadt- Wixhausen Population development [ edit ] Historical population Year Pop.

[ 38 ] It is due to its past as a capital city that it has many architectural testimonies of this period. Many of its major architectural landmarks were created by Georg Moller who was appointed the court master builder of the Grand Duchy of Hesse.

[ 39 ] The Residential Palace Darmstadt ( Stadtschloss ) is located in the city centre. It was the residence of the counts of Hesse-Darmstadt , later as Grand Dukes of Hesse by the grace of Napoleon. The rulers of Hesse also owned Jagdschloss Kranichstein , a hunting lodge in Kranichstein which is a nowadays used as a five star hotel. The most famous castle in the Darmstadt region is Frankenstein Castle due to claims that the real castle may have had an influence on Mary Shelley's decision to choose the name Frankenstein for her monster-creating scientist. This castle dates back to the 13th century, but it was acquired by the counts of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1662.

Russian Chapel [ edit ] Russian Chapel in Darmstadt Haus der Geschichte The last ruling Grand Duke of Hesse, Ernst Ludwig was a grandson of Queen Victoria and brother to Empress Alexandra of Russia . The architecture of Darmstadt has been influenced by British and Russian imperial architecture with many examples still existing, such as the Luisenplatz with its grand-ducal column, the old Hessian State Theatre and the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt . The Russian Chapel is a Russian orthodox church which is still in use. It was built and used as a private chapel by the last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II , whose wife Alexandra was born in Darmstadt. Although Russian orthodox churches also exist in other cities outside Russia, the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt was the only official Russian church used by the Tsar outside the Russian Empire . It is said that the chapel was built on Russian soil that was brought to Darmstadt exclusively for the purpose of building the Tsar's private chapel on it. by Leon Benois . The Russian church, St. Mary Magdalene Chapel, is named in honor of the patron saint of Tsar Nicholas' mother and was built of Russian stone on Russian soil brought to Darmstadt by train. It was used by the Russian imperial family and court during regular visits to the Tsarina's brother and family in Darmstadt.

[ 40 ] Modern architecture [ edit ] The Waldspirale Darmstadt has a rich tradition in modern architecture. After 1945 several "Meisterbauten" ( Masterful Architectonic Creations ) were built that set standards for modern architecture. These buildings still exist and are used for various public and private purposes. In the late 1990s the Waldspirale ('Forest Spiral') was built, a residential complex by Austrian Friedensreich Hundertwasser . As an almost surreal building, it is internationally famous for its almost absolute rejection of rectangular forms, down to every window having a different shape, the style being a trademark of Hundertwasser's work. Hundertwasser died before the Waldspirale was finished.

Art Nouveau [ edit ] The Mathildenhöhe Darmstadt was a centre of the Art Nouveau movement . Surviving examples of the Jugendstil period include the Rosenhöhe, a landscaped English-style rose garden from the 19th century, recently renovated and replanted, [ 41 ] the UNESCO World Heritage Site Mathildenhöhe , [ 42 ] with the Hochzeitsturm ('Wedding tower', also commonly known as the 'Five-Finger-Tower') by Joseph Maria Olbrich , the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt and large exhibition halls as well as many private villas built by Jugendstil architects who had settled in Darmstadt. German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, Jugendstil. The name is taken from the artistic journal, Die Jugend, which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by Georg Hirth (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: Jugendstil ("young style"). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts, especially the forms of organic typography and graphic design found in and influenced by German magazines like Jugend, Pan, and Simplicissimus , it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the Netherlands, the Baltic states, and Nordic countries. The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were Munich and Darmstadt.

Squares [ edit ] Luisenplatz with Ludwigsäule The Luisenplatz , the central square of the city, forms the centre of the city and is the main public transport hub. In 1844 the Ludwigsäule (called Langer Lui , meaning Long Ludwig ), a 33-metre (108 ft) column commemorating Ludwig I , first Grand Duke of Hesse , was placed in the middle of the square. While the column still stands, the square is today surrounded by mostly modern buildings. Other important squares are the Marktplatz (see image) near the old city hall and the Sabaisplatz at the Mathildenhöhe .

Parks [ edit ] Park Rosenhöhe The city has a high density of parks. Among the most important parks are the English style Herrngarten in central Darmstadt.

Other important parks are the French style parks Prinz-Georgs-Garten and Orangerie , the modern style Bürgerpark ("People's Park") in northern Darmstadt and the mystical Rosenhöhe Park ("Rose Heights"), which also serves as the cemetery for the grand dukes and their immediate family, with two impressive mausoleum buildings (the Old Mausoleum and New Mausoleum) standing within it. The Botanischer Garten in eastern Darmstadt is a botanical garden maintained by the Technische Universität Darmstadt with a fine collection of rare plants and trees.

Churches [ edit ] Marktplatz with the old city hall and Stadtkirche Church St. Ludwig Church The Protestant Stadtkirche Darmstadt built in 1369, is in the pedestrian zone of the downtown city center, next to the historic Hotel Bockshaut.

It included six principal installations in Darmstadt and nearby Babenhausen , Griesheim and Münster , plus several housing areas, an airfield and a large number of smaller facilities as far away as Bensheim and Aschaffenburg . The military newspaper European Stars and Stripes also had its headquarters there. As of 1993, the Darmstadt military community also assumed responsibility for the remaining U.S. Army facilities in the Frankfurt area.

[ citation needed ] As part of the U.S. Army's ongoing transformation in Germany, the Darmstadt military community, by then designated U.S. Army Garrison Darmstadt , inactivated on 30 September 2008. Even after the garrison inactivation, however, there is still one unit active in Darmstadt: The 66th Military Intelligence Group at the Dagger Complex on Eberstädter Weg.
