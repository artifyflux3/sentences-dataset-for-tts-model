See also: glossary of topology , list of algebraic topology topics , glossary of category theory , glossary of differential geometry and topology , Timeline of manifolds .

Convention : Throughout the article, I denotes the unit interval, S n the n -sphere and D n the n -disk. Also, throughout the article, spaces are assumed to be reasonable ; this can be taken to mean for example, a space is a CW complex or compactly generated weakly Hausdorff space . Similarly, no attempt is made to be definitive about the definition of a spectrum . A simplicial set is not thought of as a space; i.e., we generally distinguish between simplicial sets and their geometric realizations.

Inclusion criterion : As there is no glossary of homological algebra in Wikipedia right now, this glossary also includes a few concepts in homological algebra (e.g., chain homotopy); some concepts in geometric topology and differential topology are also fair game. On the other hand, the items that appear in glossary of topology are generally omitted.

Abstract homotopy theory and motivic homotopy theory are also outside the scope.

Glossary of category theory covers (or will cover) concepts in theory of model categories . See the glossary of symplectic geometry for the topics in symplectic topology such as quantization.

3.  The cellular homology is the (canonical) homology of a CW complex. Note it applies to CW complexes and not to spaces in general. A cellular homology is highly computable; it is especially useful for spaces with natural cell decompositions like projective spaces or Grassmannian.

chain homotopy Given chain maps f , g : ( C , d C ) → → ( D , d D ) {\displaystyle f,g:(C,d_{C})\to (D,d_{D})} between chain complexes of modules, a chain homotopy s from f to g is a sequence of module homomorphisms s i : C i → → D i + 1 {\displaystyle s_{i}:C_{i}\to D_{i+1}} satisfying f i − − g i = d D ∘ ∘ s i + s i − − 1 ∘ ∘ d C {\displaystyle f_{i}-g_{i}=d_{D}\circ s_{i}+s_{i-1}\circ d_{C}} . It is also called a homotopy operator .

chain map A chain map f : ( C , d C ) → → ( D , d D ) {\displaystyle f:(C,d_{C})\to (D,d_{D})} between chain complexes of modules is a sequence of module homomorphisms f i : C i → → D i {\displaystyle f_{i}:C_{i}\to D_{i}} that commutes with the differentials; i.e., d D ∘ ∘ f i = f i − − 1 ∘ ∘ d C {\displaystyle d_{D}\circ f_{i}=f_{i-1}\circ d_{C}} .

chain homotopy equivalence A chain map that is an isomorphism up to chain homotopy; that is, if ƒ : C → D is a chain map, then it is a chain homotopy equivalence if there is a chain map g : D → C such that g ƒ and ƒ g are chain homotopic to the identity homomorphisms on C and D , respectively.

change of fiber The change of fiber of a fibration p is a homotopy equivalence, up to homotopy, between the fibers of p induced by a path in the base.

character variety The character variety [ 2 ] of a group π and an algebraic group G (e.g., a reductive complex Lie group) is the geometric invariant theory quotient by G : X ( π π , G ) = Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( π π , G ) / / G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {X}}(\pi ,G)=\operatorname {Hom} (\pi ,G)/\!/G} .

characteristic class Let Vect( X ) be the set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles on X . We can view X ↦ ↦ Vect ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle X\mapsto \operatorname {Vect} (X)} as a contravariant functor from Top to Set by sending a map ƒ: X → Y to the pullback ƒ * along it. Then a characteristic class is a natural transformation from Vect to the cohomology functor H * . Explicitly, to each vector bundle E we assign a cohomology class, say, c ( E ). The assignment is natural in the sense that ƒ * c( E ) = c(ƒ * E ).

cofibrant approximation cofibration A map i : A → → B {\displaystyle i:A\to B} is a cofibration if it satisfies the property: given h 0 : B → → X {\displaystyle h_{0}:B\to X} and homotopy g t : A → → X {\displaystyle g_{t}:A\to X} such that g 0 = h 0 ∘ ∘ i {\displaystyle g_{0}=h_{0}\circ i} , there is a homotopy h t : B → → X {\displaystyle h_{t}:B\to X} such that h t ∘ ∘ i = g t {\displaystyle h_{t}\circ i=g_{t}} .

covering 1.  A map p : Y → X is a covering or a covering map if each point of x has a neighborhood N that is evenly covered by p ; this means that the pre-image of N is a disjoint union of open sets, each of which maps to N homeomorphically.

2.  It is n -sheeted if each fiber p −1 ( x ) has exactly n elements.

3.  It is universal if Y is simply connected.

4.  A morphism of a covering is a map over X . In particular, an automorphism of a covering p : Y → X (also called a deck transformation ) is a map Y → Y over X that has inverse; i.e., a homeomorphism over X .

5.  A G -covering is a covering arising from a group action on a space X by a group G , the covering map being the quotient map from X to the orbit space X/G . The notion is used to state the universal property: if X admits a universal covering (in particular connected), then Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( π π 1 ( X , x 0 ) , G ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (\pi _{1}(X,x_{0}),G)} is the set of isomorphism classes of G -coverings.

In particular, if G is abelian, then the left-hand side is Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( π π 1 ( X , x 0 ) , G ) = H 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( X ; G ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (\pi _{1}(X,x_{0}),G)=\operatorname {H} ^{1}(X;G)} (cf.

nonabelian cohomology .) cup product CW complex A CW complex is a space X equipped with a CW structure; i.e., a filtration X 0 ⊂ ⊂ X 1 ⊂ ⊂ X 2 ⊂ ⊂ ⋯ ⋯ ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle X^{0}\subset X^{1}\subset X^{2}\subset \cdots \subset X} such that (1) X 0 is discrete and (2) X n is obtained from X n -1 by attaching n -cells.

cyclic homology D [ edit ] deck transformation Another term for an automorphism of a covering.

deformation retract A subspace A ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle A\subset X} is called a deformation retract of X if there is a homotopy h t : X → → X {\displaystyle h_{t}:X\to X} such that h 0 {\displaystyle h_{0}} is the identity, h 1 ( X ) ⊂ ⊂ A {\displaystyle h_{1}(X)\subset A} and h 1 | A {\displaystyle {h_{1}}|_{A}} is the identity (i.e., h 1 {\displaystyle h_{1}} is a retract of A ↪ ↪ X {\displaystyle A\hookrightarrow X} in the sense in category theory). It is called a strong deformation retract if, in addition, h t {\displaystyle h_{t}} satisfies the requirement that h t | A {\displaystyle {h_{t}}|_{A}} is the identity. For example, a homotopy h t : B → → B , x ↦ ↦ ( 1 − − t ) x {\displaystyle h_{t}:B\to B,\,x\mapsto (1-t)x} exhibits that the origin is a strong deformation retract of an open ball B centered at the origin.

excision The excision axiom for homology says: if U ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle U\subset X} and U ¯ ¯ ⊂ ⊂ int ⁡ ⁡ ( A ) {\displaystyle {\overline {U}}\subset \operatorname {int} (A)} , then for each q , H q ⁡ ⁡ ( X − − U , A − − U ) → → H q ⁡ ⁡ ( X , A ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {H} _{q}(X-U,A-U)\to \operatorname {H} _{q}(X,A)} is an isomorphism.

excisive pair/triad F [ edit ] factorization homology fiber-homotopy equivalence Given D → B , E → B , a map ƒ: D → E over B is a fiber-homotopy equivalence if it is invertible up to homotopy over B . The basic fact is that if D → B , E → B are fibrations, then a homotopy equivalence from D to E is a fiber-homotopy equivalence.

fiber sequence The fiber sequence of a map f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} is the sequence F f → → p X → → f Y {\displaystyle F_{f}{\overset {p}{\to }}X{\overset {f}{\to }}Y} where F f → → p X {\displaystyle F_{f}{\overset {p}{\to }}X} is the homotopy fiber of f ; i.e., the pullback of the path space fibration P Y → → Y {\displaystyle PY\to Y} along f .

(The above property is called the homotopy lifting property .) A covering map is a basic example of a fibration.

fibration sequence One says F → → X → → p B {\displaystyle F\to X{\overset {p}{\to }}B} is a fibration sequence to mean that p is a fibration and that F is homotopy equivalent to the homotopy fiber of p , with some understanding of base points.

finitely dominated fundamental class fundamental group The fundamental group of a space X with base point x 0 is the group of homotopy classes of loops at x 0 . It is precisely the first homotopy group of ( X , x 0 ) and is thus denoted by π π 1 ( X , x 0 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(X,x_{0})} .

fundamental groupoid The fundamental groupoid of a space X is the category whose objects are the points of X and whose morphisms x → y are the homotopy classes of paths from x to y ; thus, the set of all morphisms from an object x 0 to itself is, by definition, the fundament group π π 1 ( X , x 0 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(X,x_{0})} .

framed A framed manifold is a manifold with a framing.

free Synonymous with unbased. For example, the free path space of a space X refers to the space of all maps from I to X ; i.e., X I {\displaystyle X^{I}} while the path space of a based space X consists of such map that preserve the base point (i.e., 0 goes to the base point of X ).

Then π π 0 X {\displaystyle \pi _{0}X} is the set of path-connected components of X , π π 1 X {\displaystyle \pi _{1}X} is the fundamental group of X and π π n X , n ≥ ≥ 2 {\displaystyle \pi _{n}X,\,n\geq 2} are the (higher) n -th homotopy groups of X .

2.  For based spaces A ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle A\subset X} , the relative homotopy group π π n ( X , A ) {\displaystyle \pi _{n}(X,A)} is defined as π π n − − 1 {\displaystyle \pi _{n-1}} of the space of paths that all start at the base point of X and end somewhere in A . Equivalently, it is the π π n − − 1 {\displaystyle \pi _{n-1}} of the homotopy fiber of A ↪ ↪ X {\displaystyle A\hookrightarrow X} .

In other words, it is the k -th homotopy group of the suspension spectrum of X .

The mapping cone of a map ƒ: X → Y is obtained by gluing the cone over X to Y .

The mapping cone (or cofiber) of a map ƒ: X → Y is C f = Y ∪ ∪ f C X {\displaystyle C_{f}=Y\cup _{f}CX} .

2.  The mapping cylinder of a map ƒ: X → Y is M f = Y ∪ ∪ f ( X × × I ) {\displaystyle M_{f}=Y\cup _{f}(X\times I)} . Note: C f = M f / ( X × × { 0 } ) {\displaystyle C_{f}=M_{f}/(X\times \{0\})} .

4.  The mapping path space P p of a map p : E → B is the pullback of B I → → B {\displaystyle B^{I}\to B} along p . If p is fibration, then the natural map E → P p is a fiber-homotopy equivalence ; thus, one can replace E by the mapping path space without changing the homotopy type of the fiber. A mapping path space is also called a mapping cocylinder .

5.  As a set, the mapping space from a space X to a space Y is the set of all continuous maps from X to Y . It is topologized in such a way the mapping space is a space; tha is, an object in the category of spaces used in algebraic topology; e.g., the category of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces . This topology may or may not be compact-open topology.

path lifting A path lifting function for a map p : E → B is a section of E I → → P p {\displaystyle E^{I}\to P_{p}} where P p {\displaystyle P_{p}} is the mapping path space of p . For example, a covering is a fibration with a unique path lifting function. By formal consideration, a map is a fibration if and only if there is a path lifting function for it.

path space The path space of a based space X is P X = Map ⁡ ⁡ ( I , X ) {\displaystyle PX=\operatorname {Map} (I,X)} , the space of based maps, where the base point of I is 0.

The projection P X → → X , χ χ ↦ ↦ χ χ ( 1 ) {\displaystyle PX\to X,\,\chi \mapsto \chi (1)} is called the path space fibration , whose fiber over the base point of X is the loop space Ω Ω X {\displaystyle \Omega X} .

pseudomanifold pseudomanifold pullback Given a map p : E → B , the pullback of p along ƒ : X → B is the space f ∗ ∗ E = { ( e , x ) ∈ ∈ E × × X | p ( e ) = f ( x ) } {\displaystyle f^{*}E=\{(e,x)\in E\times X|p(e)=f(x)\}} (succinctly it is the equalizer of p and f ).

pushout Given A ⊂ ⊂ B {\displaystyle A\subset B} and a map f : A → → X {\displaystyle f:A\to X} , the pushout of X and B along f is X ∪ ∪ f B = X ⊔ ⊔ B / ( a ∼ ∼ f ( a ) ) {\displaystyle X\cup _{f}B=X\sqcup B/(a\sim f(a))} ; that is X and B are glued together along A through f . The map f is usually called the attaching map.

An important example is when B = D n , A = S n -1 ; in that case, forming such a pushout is called attaching an n -cell (meaning an n -disk) to X .
