Demographics [ edit ] People with Welsh ancestry as a percentage of the population in Australia divided geographically by statistical local area, as of the 2011 census According to the 2006 Australian census 25,317 Australian residents were born in Wales , [ 2 ] while 113,242 (0.44%) claimed Welsh ancestry, either alone or with another ancestry.

[ 3 ] The name Jones , common in Wales, although the name first arrived from England in the middle ages, is one of the most common surnames in Australia, accounting for over 1% of Australians, which suggests a higher rate of Welsh ancestry than indicated by self-identification.

[ citation needed ] A 1996 study gives the total ethnic strength of Welsh Australians as 243,400. This is made up by 44,100 of un-mixed origin and 683,700 of mixed origin.

[ 4 ] This would make the Welsh the fifth largest Anglo-Celtic group in Australia after the English , Irish , Scottish and Cornish .

Find sources: "Welsh Australians" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) It is believed that the eastern coast of Australia reminded Captain James Cook of the coast of South Wales (especially the Vale of Glamorgan coast, which he knew), hence the name he gave to it, "New South Wales". The first European colony in Australia was in New South Wales, beginning with the First Fleet of 1788. Welsh people numbered amongst these first settlers, and continued to arrive in the new colony through the British policy of penal transportation that was implemented for many criminal acts.

[ citation needed ] Mass emigration from Wales to Australia began in the nineteenth century with New South Wales and Victoria being popular destinations. Nineteenth-century Welsh settlers were mostly farmers, followed later by gold diggers and coal miners .

[ citation needed ] A gold rush began in Australia in the early 1850s, and the Eureka Stockade rebellion in 1854 was an early expression of nationalist sentiment. Amongst its leaders was the Welsh-born Chartist John Basson Humffray , one of a significant group of immigrants that came over from Wales at this time.
