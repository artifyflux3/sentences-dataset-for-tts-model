Recognized by 147 of the UN's 193 member states , it encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank , including East Jerusalem , and the Gaza Strip , collectively known as the occupied Palestinian territories. The territories share the vast majority of their borders with Israel, with the West Bank bordering Jordan to the east and the Gaza Strip bordering Egypt to the southwest. It has a total land area of 6,020 square kilometres (2,320 sq mi) while its population exceeds five million. Its proclaimed capital is Jerusalem , while Ramallah serves as its de facto administrative center.

Gaza City was its largest city prior to evacuations in 2023 .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Situated at a continental crossroad , the Palestine region was ruled by various empires and experienced various demographic changes from antiquity to the modern era. It was treading ground for the Nile and Mesopotamian armies and merchants from North Africa, China and India. The region has religious significance . The ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict dates back to the rise of the Zionist movement , supported by the United Kingdom during World War I . The war saw Britain occupying Palestine from the Ottoman Empire , where it set up Mandatory Palestine under the auspices of the League of Nations . Increased Jewish immigration led to intercommunal conflict between Jews and Palestinian Arabs , which escalated into a civil war in 1947 after a proposed partitioning by the United Nations was rejected by the Palestinians and other Arab nations .

The 1948 Palestine war saw the forcible displacement of a majority of the Arab population, and consequently the establishment of Israel; these events are referred to by Palestinians as the Nakba ('catastrophe'). In the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip , which had been held by Jordan and Egypt respectively. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) declared independence in 1988. In 1993, the PLO signed the Oslo Accords with Israel, creating limited PLO governance in the West Bank and Gaza Strip through the Palestinian Authority (PA). Israel withdrew from Gaza in its unilateral disengagement in 2005, but the territory is still considered to be under military occupation and has been blockaded by Israel. In 2007, internal divisions between political factions led to a takeover of Gaza by Hamas . Since then, the West Bank has been governed in part by the Fatah -led PA, while the Gaza Strip has remained under the control of Hamas .

Israel has constructed large settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967, which currently house more than 670,000 Israeli settlers, which are illegal under international law . Attacks by Hamas-led armed groups in October 2023 in Israel were followed by the Gaza war , which has caused large-scale loss of life, mass population displacement , a humanitarian crisis , and an imminent famine in the Gaza Strip.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] According to a United Nations special committee , [ 26 ] Amnesty International , and other experts and human rights organisations, Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinian people during its ongoing invasion and bombing of the Gaza Strip .

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Some of the challenges to Palestine include ineffective government, Israeli occupation, a blockade, restrictions on movement , Israeli settlements and settler violence , as well as an overall poor security situation. The questions of Palestine's borders , legal and diplomatic status of Jerusalem, and the right of return of Palestinian refugees remain unsolved. Despite these challenges, the country maintains an emerging economy and sees frequent tourism .

Arabic is the official language of the country. While the majority of Palestinians practice Islam , Christianity also has a presence . Palestine is also a member of several international organizations , including the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation , UNESCO [ 30 ] and a delegation of parliamentarians sit at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe .

[ 31 ] Etymology Further information: Palestine (region) § Etymology , and Timeline of the name Palestine The term "Palestine" (in Latin, Palæstina ) comes via ancient Greek from a Semitic toponym for the general area dating back to the late second millennium BCE, a reflex of which is also to be found in the Biblical ethnonym Philistines . The term "Palestine" has been used to refer to the area at the southeast corner of the Mediterranean Sea beside Syria . In the 5th century BCE, in his work The Histories , Herodotus used the term to describe a "district of Syria, called Palaistine" in which Phoenicians interacted with other maritime peoples.

[ 32 ] Terminology This article uses the terms "Palestine", "State of Palestine", "occupied Palestinian territory (oPt or OPT)" interchangeably depending on context. Specifically, the term "occupied Palestinian territory" refers as a whole to the geographical area of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967. Palestine can, depending on contexts, be referred to as a country or a state, and its authorities can generally be identified as the Government of Palestine .

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] History Main articles: History of the State of Palestine and History of Palestine See also: History of the ancient Levant From prehistory to the Ottoman era These paragraphs are an excerpt from History of Palestine .

[ edit ] The region of Palestine is part of the wider region of the Levant , which represents the land bridge between Africa and Eurasia .

[ 35 ] The areas of the Levant traditionally serve as the "crossroads of Western Asia , the Eastern Mediterranean , and Northeast Africa ", [ 36 ] and in tectonic terms are located in the "northwest of the Arabian Plate ".

[ 37 ] Palestine itself was among the earliest regions to see human habitation, agricultural communities and civilization . Because of its location, it has historically been seen as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. In the Bronze Age , the Canaanites established city-states influenced by surrounding civilizations, among them Egypt, which ruled the area in the Late Bronze Age. During the Iron Age , two related Israelite kingdoms, Israel and Judah , controlled much of Palestine, while the Philistines occupied its southern coast. The Assyrians conquered the region in the 8th century BCE, then the Babylonians c.

601 BCE , followed by the Persian Achaemenid Empire that conquered the Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE.

Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire in the late 330s BCE, beginning Hellenization .

In the late 2nd-century BCE Maccabean Revolt , the Jewish Hasmonean Kingdom conquered most of Palestine; the kingdom subsequently became a vassal of Rome , which annexed it in 63 BCE.

Roman Judea was troubled by Jewish revolts in 66 CE, so Rome destroyed Jerusalem and the Second Jewish Temple in 70 CE. In the 4th century, as the Roman Empire adopted Christianity , Palestine became a center for the religion, attracting pilgrims, monks and scholars. Following Muslim conquest of the Levant in 636–641, ruling dynasties succeeded each other: the Rashiduns ; Umayyads , Abbasids ; the semi-independent Tulunids and Ikhshidids ; Fatimids ; and the Seljuks . In 1099, the First Crusade resulted in Crusaders establishing of the Kingdom of Jerusalem , which was reconquered by the Ayyubid Sultanate in 1187. Following the invasion of the Mongol Empire in the late 1250s, the Egyptian Mamluks reunified Palestine under its control, before the region was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1516, being ruled as Ottoman Syria until the 20th century largely without dispute.

Rise of Palestinian nationalism Though Palestinian elites, in particular urban notable families who worked within the Ottoman bureaucracy, generally retained their loyalty to the Ottomans, they also played a significant role proportionately in the rise of Arab nationalism , and the Pan-Arabic movements that arose in response to both the emergence of the Young Turks movement and the subsequent weakening of Ottoman power in World War I.

[ 38 ] The onset of the Zionist movement , which sought to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine, also exercised a strong influence on Palestinian national consciousness.

Abdul Hamid , the last sultan of the Ottoman Empire, opposed the Zionist movement's efforts in Palestine. The end of the Ottoman Empire 's rule in Palestine coincided with the conclusion of World War I . The failure of Emir Faisal to establish a Greater Syria in the face of French and British colonial claims to the area, also shaped Palestinian elites' efforts to secure local autonomy.

[ 39 ] In the aftermath of the war Palestine came under British control with the implementation of the British Mandate for Palestine in 1920.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] British Mandate Main article: Mandatory Palestine Deir Yassin massacre of Palestinian villagers was carried out by Zionist militias, the Irgun and Lehi during the 1948 Palestine war .

The defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I resulted in the dismantling of their rule.

[ 42 ] In 1920, the League of Nations granted Britain the mandate to govern Palestine, leading to the subsequent period of British administration.

[ 42 ] In 1917, Jerusalem was captured by British forces led by General Allenby , marking the end of Ottoman rule in the city.

[ 42 ] By 1920, tensions escalated between Jewish and Arab communities, resulting in violent clashes and riots across Palestine.

[ 42 ] The League of Nations approved the British Mandate for Palestine in 1922, entrusting Britain with the administration of the region.

[ 42 ] Throughout the 1920s, Palestine experienced growing resistance from both Jewish and Arab nationalist movements, which manifested in sporadic violence and protests against British policies.

[ 42 ] In 1929, violent riots erupted in Palestine due to disputes over Jewish immigration and access to the Western Wall in Jerusalem.

[ 42 ] The 1930s witnessed the outbreak of the Arab Revolt , as Arab nationalists demanded an end to Jewish immigration and the establishment of an independent Arab state.

[ 42 ] In response to the Arab Revolt, the British deployed military forces and implemented stringent security measures in an effort to quell the uprising.

[ 42 ] Arab nationalist groups, led by the Arab Higher Committee , called for an end to Jewish immigration and land sales to Jews.

[ 43 ] The issuance of the 1939 White Paper by the British government aimed to address escalating tensions between Arabs and Jews in Palestine.

[ 43 ] This policy document imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration and land purchases, with the intention to limit the establishment of a Jewish state.

[ 43 ] Met with strong opposition from the Zionist movement, the White Paper was perceived as a betrayal of the Balfour Declaration and Zionist aspirations for a Jewish homeland.

[ 43 ] In response to the White Paper, the Zionist community in Palestine organized a strike in 1939, rallying against the restrictions on Jewish immigration and land acquisition.

[ 43 ] This anti-White Paper strike involved demonstrations, civil disobedience, and a shutdown of businesses.

[ 43 ] Supported by various Zionist organizations, including the Jewish Agency and the Histadrut (General Federation of Jewish Labor), the anti-White Paper strike aimed to protest and challenge the limitations imposed by the British government.

[ 43 ] In the late 1930s and 1940s, several Zionist militant groups, including the Irgun , Hagana , and Lehi , carried out acts of violence against British military and civilian targets in their pursuit of an independent Jewish state.

[ 43 ] While the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini , collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II, not all Muslims supported his actions, and there were instances where Muslims helped rescue Jews during the Holocaust.

[ 43 ] [ failed verification ] [ opinion ] In 1946, a bombing orchestrated by the Irgun at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem resulted in the deaths of 91 people, including British officials, civilians, and hotel staff.

[ 43 ] Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir , who later became political leaders in the state of Israel, were behind these terrorist attacks.

[ 44 ] The Exodus 1947 incident unfolded when a ship carrying Jewish Holocaust survivors, who sought refuge in Palestine, was intercepted by the British navy, leading to clashes and the eventual deportation of the refugees back to Europe.

[ 43 ] During World War II , Palestine served as a strategically significant location for British military operations against Axis forces in North Africa .

[ 43 ] In 1947, the United Nations proposed a partition plan for Palestine, suggesting separate Jewish and Arab states, but it was rejected by Arab nations while accepted by Jewish leaders.

[ 43 ] Arab–Israeli wars In 1947, the UN adopted a partition plan for a two-state solution in the remaining territory of the mandate. The plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership but rejected by the Arab leaders, and Britain refused to implement the plan. On the eve of final British withdrawal, the Jewish Agency for Israel , headed by David Ben-Gurion , declared the establishment of the State of Israel according to the proposed UN plan. The Arab Higher Committee did not declare a state of its own and instead, together with Transjordan , Egypt, and the other members of the Arab League of the time, commenced military action resulting in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War . During the war, Israel gained additional territories that were designated to be part of the Arab state under the UN plan.

Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip , and Transjordan occupied and then annexed the West Bank . Egypt initially supported the creation of an All-Palestine Government but disbanded it in 1959. Transjordan never recognized it and instead decided to incorporate the West Bank with its own territory to form Jordan . The annexation was ratified in 1950 but was rejected by the international community.

In 1964, when the West Bank was controlled by Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organization was established there with the goal to confront Israel. The Palestinian National Charter of the PLO defines the boundaries of Palestine as the whole remaining territory of the mandate, including Israel. The Six-Day War in 1967, when Israel fought against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, ended with Israel occupying the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, besides other territories.

[ 45 ] [ better source needed ] Following the Six-Day War, the PLO moved to Jordan, but relocated to Lebanon in 1971.

[ 46 ] [ better source needed ] The October 1974 Arab League summit designated the PLO as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people" and reaffirmed "their right to establish an independent state of urgency".

[ 47 ] In November 1974, the PLO was recognized as competent on all matters concerning the question of Palestine by the UN General Assembly granting them observer status as a "non-state entity" at the UN.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] Through the Camp David Accords of 1979, Egypt signaled an end to any claim of its own over the Gaza Strip. In July 1988, Jordan ceded its claims to the West Bank —with the exception of guardianship over Haram al-Sharif—to the PLO.

After Israel captured and occupied the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza Strip from Egypt, it began to establish Israeli settlements there. Administration of the Arab population of these territories was performed by the Israeli Civil Administration of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories and by local municipal councils present since before the Israeli takeover. In 1980, Israel decided to freeze elections for these councils and to establish instead Village Leagues , whose officials were under Israeli influence. Later this model became ineffective for both Israel and the Palestinians, and the Village Leagues began to break up, with the last being the Hebron League, dissolved in February 1988.

[ 50 ] Uprising, declaration and peace treaty The First Intifada broke out in 1987, characterized by widespread protests, strikes, and acts of civil disobedience by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank against Israeli occupation.

[ 23 ] In November 1988, the PLO legislature, while in exile, declared the establishment of the "State of Palestine" .

[ 23 ] In the month following, it was quickly recognized by many states, including Egypt and Jordan.

[ 23 ] In the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, the State of Palestine is described as being established on the "Palestinian territory", without explicitly specifying further.

[ 23 ] [ 51 ] After the 1988 Declaration of Independence, the UN General Assembly officially acknowledged the proclamation and decided to use the designation "Palestine" instead of "Palestine Liberation Organization" in the UN.

[ 23 ] [ 51 ] In spite of this decision, the PLO did not participate at the UN in its capacity of the State of Palestine's government.

[ 52 ] Violent clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces intensified throughout 1989, resulting in a significant loss of life and escalating tensions in the occupied territories.

[ 51 ] 1990 witnessed the imposition of strict measures by the Israeli government, including curfews and closures, in an attempt to suppress the Intifada and maintain control over the occupied territories.

[ 51 ] Intifada in Gaza The 1990–1991 Gulf War brought increased attention to the conflict, leading to heightened diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful resolution.

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] Saddam Hussein was a supporter of Palestinian cause and won support from Arafat during the war.

[ 53 ] Following the invasion of Kuwait , Saddam surprised the international community by presenting a peace offer to Israel and withdrawing Iraqi forces from Kuwait, in exchange of withdrawal from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights.

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] Though the peace offer was rejected, Saddam then ordered firing of scud missiles into Israeli territory.

[ 53 ] This movement was supported by Palestinians.

[ 53 ] The war also led to the expulsion of Palestinians from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , as their government supported Iraq .

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] In 1993, the Oslo Accords were signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), leading to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and a potential path to peace.

[ 55 ] Yasser Arafat was elected as president of the newly formed Palestinian Authority in 1994, marking a significant step towards self-governance.

[ f ] Yasser Arafat Israel acknowledged the PLO negotiating team as "representing the Palestinian people", in return for the PLO recognizing Israel's right to exist in peace, acceptance of UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 , and its rejection of "violence and terrorism".

[ 55 ] As a result, in 1994 the PLO established the Palestinian National Authority (PNA or PA) territorial administration, that exercises some governmental functions [ f ] in parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] As envisioned in the Oslo Accords, Israel allowed the PLO to establish interim administrative institutions in the Palestinian territories, which came in the form of the PNA.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] It was given civilian control in Area B and civilian and security control in Area A, and remained without involvement in Area C .

[ 65 ] Civil unrest in Jerusalem as a result of 1994 massacre The peace process gained opposition from both Palestinians and Israelis. Islamist militant organizations such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad opposed the attack and responded by conducting attacks on civilians across Israel. In 1994, Baruch Goldstein , an Israeli extremist shot 29 people to death in Hebron, known as the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre . These events led an increase in Palestinian opposition to the peace process. Tragically, in 1995, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir – an extremist, causing political instability in the region.

The first-ever Palestinian general elections took place in 1996, resulting in Arafat's re-election as president and the formation of a Palestinian Legislative Council . Initiating the implementation of the Oslo Accords, Israel began redeploying its forces from select Palestinian cities in the West Bank in 1997.

[ 66 ] Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority continued, albeit with slow progress and contentious debates on Jerusalem, settlements, and refugees in 1998.

[ 66 ] In 1997, Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian government signed the Hebron Protocol , which outlined the redeployment of Israeli forces from parts of Hebron in the West Bank, granting the government greater control over the city.

[ 66 ] Israel and the Palestinian government signed the Wye River Memorandum in 1998, aiming to advance the implementation of the Oslo Accords.

[ 66 ] The agreement included provisions for Israeli withdrawals and security cooperation.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] The period of the Oslo Years brought a great prosperity to the government-controlled areas, despite some economic issues. The Palestinian Authority built the country's second airport in Gaza, after the Jerusalem International Airport . Inaugural ceremony of the airport was attended by Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela . In 1999, Ehud Barak assumed the position of Israeli Prime Minister, renewing efforts to reach a final status agreement with the Palestinians. The Camp David Summit in 2000 aimed to resolve the remaining issues but concluded without a comprehensive agreement, serving as a milestone in the peace process.

Second intifada and civil war Further information: Second Intifada , Fatah–Hamas conflict , and Battle of Gaza (2007) Civil unrest in Hebron A peace summit between Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak was mediated by Bill Clinton in 2000.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] It was supposed to be the final agreement ending conflict officially forever. However the agreement failed to address the Palestinian refugee issues, status of Jerusalem and Israeli security concerns.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] Both sides blamed each other for the summit failures.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] This became one of the main triggers for the uprising that would happen next.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] In September 2000, then opposition leader from the Likud Party , Ariel Sharon , made a proactive visit to the Temple Mount and delivered a controversial speech, which angered Palestinian Jerusalemites .

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] The tensions escalated into riots.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] Bloody clashes took place around Jerusalem. Escalating violence resulted in the closure of Jerusalem Airport , which haven't operated to date.

[ 68 ] More and more riots between Jews and Arabs took place in October 2000 in Israel.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] The Church of the Nativity under siege in 2002 In the same month, two Israeli soldiers were lynched and killed in Ramallah .

[ 68 ] Between November and December clashes between Palestinians and Israelis increased further.

[ 68 ] In 2001 Taba summit was held between Israel and Palestine.

[ 68 ] But the summit failed to implement and Ariel Sharon became prime minister in the 2001 elections.

[ 68 ] By 2001, attacks from Palestinian militant groups towards Israel increased.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] Gaza Airport was destroyed in an airstrike by the Israeli army in 2001, claiming itself in retaliation to previous attacks by Hamas.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] In January 2002, the IDF Shayetet 13 naval commandos captured the Karine A , a freighter carrying weapons from Iran towards Israel.

[ 68 ] UNSC Resolution 1397 was passed, which reaffirmed a two-state solution and laid the groundwork for a road map for peace .

[ 68 ] Another attack by Hamas left 30 people killed in Netanya .

[ 68 ] A peace summit was organized by the Arab League in Beirut , which was endorsed by Arafat and nearly ignored by Israel.

[ 68 ] In 2002, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield after the Passover massacre .

[ 69 ] Heavy fighting between IDF and Palestinian fighters took place in Jenin .

[ 69 ] [ 67 ] [ 70 ] The Church of the Nativity was besieged by the IDF for one week until successful negotiations took place, which resulted in withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the church.

[ 69 ] Between 2003 and 2004, people from Qawasameh tribe in Hebron were either killed or blew themselves in suicide bombing.

[ 69 ] [ 66 ] Ariel Sharon ordered construction of barriers across Palestinian-controlled areas and Israeli settlements in the West Bank to prevent future attacks.

[ 69 ] Saddam Hussein provided financial support to Palestinian militants from Iraq during the intifada period, from 2000 until his overthrow in 2003.

[ 69 ] A peace proposal was made in 2003, which was supported by Arafat and rejected by Sharon.

[ 69 ] In 2004 Hamas's leader and co-founder Ahmed Yassin was assassinated by the Israeli army in Gaza.

[ 69 ] [ 66 ] Yasser Arafat was confined to his headquarters in Ramallah.

[ 69 ] On 11 November, Yasser Arafat died in Paris.

[ 69 ] Demonstration against road block, Kafr Qaddum , March 2012 In the first week of 2005, Mahmoud Abbas was elected as the president of the State of Palestine.

[ 69 ] In 2005, Israel completely withdrew from the Gaza Strip by destroying its settlements over there.

[ 69 ] By 2005, the situation began de-escalating.

[ 69 ] In 2006, Hamas won in Palestinian legislative elections.

[ 71 ] This led to a political standoff with Fatah.

[ 71 ] Armed clashes took place across both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

[ 71 ] The clashes turned into a civil war, which ended in bloody clashes on the Gaza Strip.

[ 71 ] As a result, Hamas gained control over all the territory of Gaza.

[ 71 ] Hundreds of people were killed in the civil war, including militants and civilians.

[ 71 ] Since then Hamas has gained more independence in its military practices.

[ 71 ] Since 2007, Israel has been leading a partial blockade on Gaza.

[ 71 ] Another peace summit was organized by the Arab League in 2007, with the same offer which was presented at the 2002 summit.

[ 71 ] However the peace process could not progress.

[ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] The PNA gained full control of the Gaza Strip with the exception of its borders, airspace, and territorial waters .

[ f ] Continued conflict See also: Fatah–Hamas conflict , Battle of Gaza (2007) , and Gaza–Israel conflict Israeli settlements in the West Bank The division between the West Bank and Gaza complicated efforts to achieve Palestinian unity and negotiate a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel . Multiple rounds of reconciliation talks were held, but no lasting agreement was reached. The division also hindered the establishment of a unified Palestinian state and led to different governance structures and policies in the two territories.

[ 74 ] Following the inter-Palestinian conflict in 2006, Hamas took over control of the Gaza Strip (it already had majority in the PLC), and Fatah took control of the West Bank. From 2007, the Gaza Strip was governed by Hamas, and the West Bank by the Fatah party led Palestinian Authority.

[ 75 ] International efforts to revive the peace process continued. The United States, under the leadership of different administrations, made various attempts to broker negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

[ 76 ] However, significant obstacles such as settlement expansion, the status of Jerusalem, borders , and the right of return for Palestinian refugees , remained unresolved.

[ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ excessive citations ] In recent years, diplomatic initiatives have emerged, including the normalization agreements between Israel and several Arab states , known as the Abraham Accords .

[ 81 ] These agreements, while not directly addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, have reshaped regional dynamics and raised questions about the future of Palestinian aspirations for statehood.

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] The status quo remains challenging for Palestinians, with ongoing issues of occupation, settlement expansion, restricted movement, and economic hardships.

[ 84 ] Attacks by Hamas-led armed groups in October 2023 in Israel were followed by the Gaza war . The war has caused widespread destruction, a humanitarian crisis , and an imminent famine in the Gaza Strip.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] Most of the population was forcibly displaced .

[ 24 ] Several human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and B'Tselem , various genocide studies and international law scholars, and other experts say that a genocide is taking place in Gaza , though some dispute this.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Since the start of the war, over 60,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed , almost half of them women and children , and more than 148,000 injured.

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] A study in The Lancet estimated 64,260 deaths in Gaza from traumatic injuries by June 2024, while noting a potentially larger death toll when "indirect" deaths are included.

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] As of May 2025, a comparable figure for traumatic injury deaths would be 93,000.

[ 92 ] There was also a spillover of the war occurring in the West Bank .

Geography Main article: Geography of Palestine Located around Nablus , Mount Gerizim is the holiest site for Samaritans .

Areas claimed by the country, known as the Palestinian territories , lie in the Southern Levant of the Middle East region.

[ 93 ] Palestine is part of the Fertile Crescent , along with Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. The Gaza Strip borders the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Egypt to the south, and Israel to the north and east.

[ 93 ] The West Bank is bordered by Jordan to the east, and Israel to the north, south, and west.

[ 93 ] Palestine shares its maritime borders with Israel , Egypt and Cyprus . Thus, the two enclaves constituting the area claimed by the State of Palestine have no geographical border with one another, being separated by Israel.

[ 93 ] These areas would constitute the world's 163rd largest country by land area .

[ 13 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] [ better source needed ] The West Bank is a mountainous region. It is divided in three regions, namely the Mount Nablus ( Jabal Nablus ), the Hebron Hills and Jerusalem Mountains ( Jibal al–Quds ).

[ 95 ] The Samarian Hills and Judean Hills are mountain ranges in the West Bank, with Mount Nabi Yunis at a height of 1,030 metres (3,380 ft) in Hebron Governorate as their highest peak.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] Until 19th century, Hebron was highest city in the Middle East.

[ 97 ] While Jerusalem is located on a plateau in the central highlands and is surrounded by valleys.

[ 97 ] The territory consists of fertile valleys, such as the Jezreel Valley and the Jordan River Valley . Palestine is home to world's largest olive tree, located in Jerusalem.

[ 98 ] [ 97 ] Around 45% of Palestine's land is dedicated to growing olive trees.

[ 99 ] Palestine features significant lakes and rivers that play a vital role in its geography and ecosystems.

[ 100 ] The Jordan River flows southward, forming part of Palestine's eastern border and passing through the Sea of Galilee before reaching the Dead Sea.

[ 101 ] According to Christian traditions, it is site of the baptism of Jesus .

[ 101 ] The Dead Sea , bordering the country's east is the lowest point on the earth.

[ 102 ] Jericho , located nearby, is the lowest city in the world.

[ 103 ] Villages and suburban areas around Jerusalem are home to ancient water bodies.

[ 104 ] There are several river valleys ( wadi ) across the country.

[ 100 ] These waterways provide essential resources for agriculture and recreation while supporting various ecosystems.

[ 100 ] Three terrestrial ecoregions are found in the area: Eastern Mediterranean conifer–sclerophyllous–broadleaf forests , Arabian Desert , and Mesopotamian shrub desert .

[ 105 ] Palestine has a number of environmental issues; issues facing the Gaza Strip include desertification ; salination of fresh water; sewage treatment ; water-borne diseases ; soil degradation ; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources. In the West Bank, many of the same issues apply; although fresh water is much more plentiful, access is restricted by the ongoing dispute .

[ 106 ] Climate Main article: Climate of Palestine Temperatures in Palestine vary widely. The climate in the West Bank is mostly Mediterranean , slightly cooler at elevated areas compared with the shoreline, west to the area. In the east, the West Bank includes much of the Judean Desert including the western shoreline of the Dead Sea, characterised by dry and hot climate. Gaza has a hot semi-arid climate ( Köppen : BSh) with mild winters and dry hot summers.

[ 107 ] Spring arrives around March–April and the hottest months are July and August, with the average high being 33 °C (91 °F). The coldest month is January with temperatures usually at 7 °C (45 °F). Rain is scarce and generally falls between November and March, with annual precipitation rates approximately at 4.57 inches (116 mm).

[ 108 ] Biodiversity Main article: Biodiversity in Palestine Camels in the Judaean Desert Palestine does not have officially recognized national parks or protected areas. However, there are areas within the West Bank that are considered to have ecological and cultural significance and are being managed with conservation efforts. These areas are often referred to as nature reserves or protected zones.

Located near Jericho in the West Bank, Wadi Qelt is a desert valley with unique flora and fauna. The reserve is known for its rugged landscapes, natural springs, and historical sites such as the St. George Monastery .

[ 109 ] Efforts have been made to protect the biodiversity and natural beauty of the area.

[ 110 ] The Judaean Desert is known for its Judaean Camels.

Qalqilya Zoo in Qalqilya Governorate , is the only zoo currently active in the country. Gaza Zoo was closed due to poor conditions. The Israeli government has established various national parks in Area C , which is considered illegal under international law .

Government and politics Main article: Government of Palestine See also: Politics of the Palestinian National Authority and Politics of the Palestine Liberation Organization President Mahmoud Abbas Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa Mausoleum of Yasser Arafat at the Palestinian Authority's headquarters in Ramallah Palestine operates a semi-presidential system of government.

[ 111 ] The country consists of the institutions that are associated with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which includes the President of the State of Palestine , [ 112 ] [ e ] who is appointed by the Palestinian Central Council , [ 115 ] the Palestinian National Council , and the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization , which performs the functions of a government in exile, [ 113 ] [ 114 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ excessive citations ] maintaining an extensive foreign-relations network. The PLO is combination of several political parties.

These should be distinguished from the President of the Palestinian National Authority , Palestinian Legislative Council, and PNA Cabinet , all of which are instead associated with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Palestine's founding document is the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, [ 9 ] which should be distinguished from the unrelated PLO Palestinian National Covenant and PNA Palestine Basic Law .

The Palestinian government is divided into two geographic entities – the Palestinian Authority governed by Fatah, which has partial control over the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, which is under control of the militant group Hamas.

[ 118 ] [ 119 ] Fatah is a secular party that was founded by Yasser Arafat and enjoys relatively good relations with the western powers. On the other hand, Hamas is a militant group based on Palestinian nationalist and Islamic ideology , inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood .

[ 120 ] [ 121 ] Hamas has tense relations with the United States, but receives support from Iran.

Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is another popular secular party, which was founded by George Habash . Mahmoud Abbas is the president of the country since 2005.

[ 122 ] Mohammad Shtayyeh was the prime minister of Palestine, who resigned in 2024.

[ 123 ] In 2024, Mohammad Mustafa was appointed as the new prime minister of the country, after resigning of Shtayyeh.

[ 124 ] Yahya Sinwar was leader of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip before his death on 16 October 2024.

[ 125 ] According to Freedom House , the PNA governs Palestine in an authoritarian manner, including by repressing activists and journalists critical of the government.

[ 126 ] Jerusalem including Haram ash-Sharif , is claimed as capital by Palestine, which has been under occupation by Israel .

[ 127 ] Currently the temporary administration center is in Ramallah , which is 10 km from Jerusalem.

[ 128 ] Muqata hosts state ministries and representative office.

[ 129 ] In 2000, a government building was built in Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis , to house office of Yasser Arafat and Palestinian parliament.

[ 130 ] Since second intifada , condition of the town made this site unsuitable to operate as a capital, either temporarily or permanently.

[ 131 ] Nevertheless, the Palestinian entity have maintained their presence in the city. As few parts of the city is also under Palestinian control and many some countries have their consulates in Jerusalem.

Administrative divisions Main article: Governorates of Palestine See also: Palestinian enclaves and ISO 3166-2:PS Palestinian Governorates (official) Palestinian controlled areas The State of Palestine is divided into sixteen administrative divisions . The governorates in the West Bank are grouped into three areas per the Oslo II Accord . Area A forms 18% of the West Bank by area, and is administered by the Palestinian government.

[ 132 ] [ 133 ] Area B forms 22% of the West Bank, and is under Palestinian civil control, and joint Israeli-Palestinian security control.

[ 132 ] [ 133 ] Area C , except East Jerusalem, forms 60% of the West Bank, and is administered by the Israeli Civil Administration , however, the Palestinian government provides the education and medical services to the 150,000 Palestinians in the area, [ 132 ] an arrangement agreed upon in the Oslo II accord by Israeli and Palestinian leadership. More than 99% of Area C is off limits to Palestinians, due to security concerns and is a point of ongoing negotiation.

[ 134 ] [ 135 ] There are about 330,000 Israelis living in settlements in Area C.

[ 136 ] Although Area C is under martial law , Israelis living there are entitled to full civic rights .

[ 137 ] Palestinian enclaves currently under Palestinian administration in red ( Areas A and B ; not including Gaza Strip, which is under Hamas rule).

Governorates of Palestine East Jerusalem (comprising the small pre-1967 Jordanian eastern-sector Jerusalem municipality together with a significant area of the pre-1967 West Bank demarcated by Israel in 1967) is administered as part of the Jerusalem District of Israel but is claimed by Palestine as part of the Jerusalem Governorate . It was effectively annexed by Israel in 1967, by application of Israeli law, jurisdiction and administration under a 1948 law amended for the purpose, this purported annexation being constitutionally reaffirmed (by implication) in Basic Law: Jerusalem 1980 , [ 132 ] but this annexation is not recognised by any other country.

[ 138 ] In 2010 of the 456,000 people in East Jerusalem, roughly 60% were Palestinians and 40% were Israelis.

[ 132 ] [ 139 ] However, since the late 2000s, Israel's West Bank Security Barrier has effectively re-annexed tens of thousands of Palestinians bearing Israeli ID cards to the West Bank, leaving East Jerusalem within the barrier with a small Israeli majority (60%).

[ citation needed ] Under Oslo Accords, Jerusalem was proposed to be included in future negotiations and according to Israel, Oslo Accords prohibits the Palestinian Authority to operates in Jerusalem. However, certain parts of Jerusalem, those neighborhoods which are located outside the historic Old City but are part of East Jerusalem, were allotted to the Palestinian Authority.

The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) represents the State of Palestine and maintains embassies in countries that recognize it. It also participates in international organizations as a member, associate, or observer. In some cases, due to conflicting sources, it is difficult to determine if the participation is on behalf of the State of Palestine, the PLO as a non-state entity, or the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). The Vatican shifted recognition to the State of Palestine in May 2015, following the 2012 UN vote .

[ 142 ] This change aligned with the Holy See's evolving position.

[ 143 ] Indian prime minister Narendra Modi with Mahmoud Abbas in at Ramallah in 2018 Currently, 146 UN member states (75%) recognize the State of Palestine. Though some do not recognize it, they acknowledge the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people. The PLO's executive committee acts as the government, empowered by the PNC.

[ 144 ] It is a full member of the Arab League , the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Union for the Mediterranean . Sweden took a significant step in 2013 by upgrading the status of the Palestinian representative office to a full embassy. They became the first EU member state outside the former communist bloc to officially recognize the State of Palestine.

[ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ] [ excessive citations ] Members of the Arab League and member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation have strongly supported the country's position in its conflict with Israel .

[ 149 ] [ 150 ] Iran has been a strong ally of Palestine since the Islamic revolution and has provided military support to Palestinian fedayeen and militant groups, including Hamas through its Axis of Resistance , which includes a military coalition of governments and rebels from Iraq , [ 151 ] Syria , [ 152 ] Lebanon [ 153 ] and Yemen .

[ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] [ 157 ] [ 158 ] [ excessive citations ] Hamas is also part of the axis of resistance. Even before the emergence of the Iran-backed Islamic Resistance in Iraq , Iraq was a strong supporter of Palestine when it was under the Ba'athist government of Saddam Hussein .

[ 165 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ] The Republic of Ireland , Venezuela and South Africa are political allies of Palestine and have strongly advocated for establishment of independent Palestine.

[ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ] As a result of the ongoing war , support for the country has increased. Since Israel's invasion of Gaza , many countries in support of Palestinians have officially recognized the country. This includes Armenia , Spain , Norway , The Bahamas , Jamaica , Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago .

[ 171 ] Status and recognition Main articles: Legal status of Palestine and Palestine and the United Nations The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) declared the establishment of the State of Palestine on 15 November 1988. There is a wide range of views on the legal status of the State of Palestine, both among international states and legal scholars.

[ 172 ] The existence of a state of Palestine is recognized by the states that have established bilateral diplomatic relations with it.

[ 173 ] [ 174 ] In January 2015, the International Criminal Court affirmed Palestine's "State" status after its UN observer recognition, [ 175 ] a move condemned by Israeli leaders as a form of "diplomatic terrorism".

[ 176 ] In December 2015, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution demanding Palestinian sovereignty over natural resources in the occupied territories.

[ 177 ] It called on Israel to cease exploitation and damage while granting Palestinians the right to seek restitution. In 1988, the State of Palestine's declaration of independence was acknowledged by the General Assembly with Resolution 43/177 .

[ 178 ] In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 67/19 , granting Palestine " non-member observer state " status, effectively recognizing it as a sovereign state .

[ 113 ] [ 179 ] In August 2015, Palestine's representatives at the United Nations presented a draft resolution that would allow the non-member observer states Palestine and the Holy See to raise their flags at the United Nations headquarters. Initially, the Palestinians presented their initiative as a joint effort with the Holy See, which the Holy See denied.

[ 180 ] In a letter to the Secretary General and the President of the General Assembly, Israel's Ambassador at the UN Ron Prosor called the step "another cynical misuse of the UN ... in order to score political points".

[ 181 ] After the vote, which was passed by 119 votes to 8 with 45 countries abstaining, [ 182 ] [ 183 ] [ 184 ] the US Ambassador Samantha Power said that "raising the Palestinian flag will not bring Israelis and Palestinians any closer together".

[ 185 ] US Department of State spokesman Mark Toner called it a "counterproductive" attempt to pursue statehood claims outside of a negotiated settlement.

[ 186 ] At the ceremony itself, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the occasion was a "day of pride for the Palestinian people around the world, a day of hope", [ 187 ] and declared "Now is the time to restore confidence by both Israelis and Palestinians for a peaceful settlement and, at last, the realization of two states for two peoples." [ 182 ] International recognition Main article: International recognition of Palestine State of Palestine Countries that have recognized Palestine Countries that have announced their impending recognition of Palestine ( France , Malta , Portugal , San Marino , Australia ) Countries that have announced their conditional, impending recognition of Palestine ( United Kingdom , Canada ) [ h ] Countries that have not recognized Palestine The State of Palestine has been recognized by 146 of the 193 UN members and since 2012 has had a status of a non-member observer state in the United Nations.

[ 188 ] [ 189 ] [ 190 ] This limited status is largely due to the fact that the United States , a permanent member of the UN Security Council with veto power, has consistently used its veto or threatened to do so to block Palestine's full UN membership.

[ 1 ] [ 191 ] On 29 November 2012, in a 138–9 vote (with 41 abstentions and 5 absences), [ 179 ] the United Nations General Assembly passed resolution 67/19 , upgrading Palestine from an "observer entity" to a " non-member observer state " within the United Nations System , which was described as recognition of the PLO's sovereignty.

[ 189 ] [ 190 ] [ 192 ] [ 113 ] [ 193 ] [ excessive citations ] Palestine's UN status is equivalent to that of the Holy See .

[ 194 ] The UN has permitted Palestine to title its representative office to the UN as "The Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations", [ 195 ] and Palestine has instructed its diplomats to officially represent "The State of Palestine"—no longer the Palestinian National Authority.

[ 193 ] On 17 December 2012, UN Chief of Protocol Yeocheol Yoon declared that "the designation of 'State of Palestine' shall be used by the Secretariat in all official United Nations documents", [ 196 ] thus recognising the title 'State of Palestine' as the state's official name for all UN purposes; on 21 December 2012, a UN memorandum discussed appropriate terminology to be used following GA 67/19. It was noted therein that there was no legal impediment to using the designation Palestine to refer to the geographical area of the Palestinian territory. At the same time, it was explained that there was also no bar to the continued use of the term "Occupied Palestinian Territory including East Jerusalem" or such other terminology as might customarily be used by the Assembly.

[ 197 ] As of 21 March 2025, 147 ( 76.2%) of the 193 member states of the United Nations have recognised the State of Palestine .

[ 113 ] [ 198 ] Many of the countries that do not recognise the State of Palestine nevertheless recognise the PLO as the "representative of the Palestinian people ". The PLO's Executive Committee is empowered by the Palestinian National Council to perform the functions of government of the State of Palestine.

[ 114 ] On 2 April 2024, Riyad Mansour , the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, requested that the Security Council consider a renewed application for membership. As of April, seven UNSC members recognize Palestine but the US has indicated that it opposes the request and in addition, US law stipulates that US funding for the UN would be cut off in the event of full recognition without an Israeli-Palestinian agreement.

[ 199 ] On 18 April, the US vetoed a widely supported UN resolution that would have admitted Palestine as a full UN member.

[ 200 ] [ 201 ] [ 202 ] A May 2024 UNGA resolution came into force with the 2024 general assembly. The resolution, which recognized the Palestinian right to become a full member state, also granted the right to Palestinians to submit proposals and amendments and Palestine was permitted to take a seat with other member states in the assembly.

[ 203 ] [ 204 ] Military Main article: Palestinian Security Services See also: Palestinian fedayeen 25th anniversary of Hamas taking place in Gaza The Palestinian Security Services consists of the armed forces and intelligence agencies, which were established during the Oslo Accords. Their function is to maintain internal security and enforce law in the PA-controlled areas. It does not operate as an independent armed force of a country. Before the Oslo Accords, the PLO led armed rebellion against Israel, which included coalition of militant groups and included its own military branch – the Palestine Liberation Army .

[ 205 ] However, since the 1993–1995 agreements, it has been inactive and operates only in Syria.

Palestinian fedayeen are the Palestinian militants and guerilla army. They are considered as "freedom fighter" by Palestinians and "terrorists" by Israelis.

[ 206 ] Hamas considers itself as an independent force, which is more powerful and influential than PSF, along with other militant organizations such as Islamic Jihad (Al-Quds Bridage).

[ 207 ] It is a guerilla army, which is supported by Iran, Qatar and Turkey.

[ 208 ] According to the CIA World Factbook, the Qassam Brigades have 20,000 to 25,000 members, although this number is disputed.

[ 209 ] Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza provided Hamas with the opportunity to develop its military wing.

[ 208 ] Iran and Hezbollah have smuggled weapons to Hamas overland through the Sinai Peninsula via Sudan and Libya , as well as by sea. Intensive military training and accumulated weapons have allowed Hamas to gradually organize regional units as large as brigades containing 2,500–3,500 fighters each. Since 2020, joint exercises conducted with other militant groups in Gaza like the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) have habituated units to operating in a coordinated fashion, supported Hamas command and control, and facilitated cooperation between Hamas and smaller factions. Such efforts began in earnest in 2007, upon Hamas's seizure of power in the Gaza Strip. Iran has since supplied materiel and know-how for Hamas to build a sizable rocket arsenal, with more than 10,000 rockets and mortar shells fired in the current conflict. With Iran's help, Hamas has developed robust domestic rocket production that uses pipes, electrical wiring, and other everyday materials for improvised production.

[ 210 ] Law and security Main articles: Palestinian Security Services and Crime in Palestine The State of Palestine has a number of security forces, including a Civil Police Force , National Security Forces and Intelligence Services, with the function of maintaining security and protecting Palestinian citizens and the Palestinian State. All of these forces are part of Palestinian Security Services . The PSF is primarily responsible for maintaining internal security, law enforcement, and counterterrorism operations in areas under Palestinian Authority control.

[ 211 ] The Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA) is the standing army of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

[ 212 ] It was established during the early years of the Palestinian national movement but has largely been inactive since the Oslo Accords.

[ 213 ] The PLA's role was intended to be a conventional military force but has shifted to a more symbolic and political role.

[ 214 ] Economy Main article: Economy of Palestine Palestine is classified as a middle income and developing country by the IMF. In 2023, GDP of the country was $40 billion and per-capita around $4,500. Due to its disputed status, the economic condition have been affected.

[ 215 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ] Carbon dioxide emissions were 0.6 metric tons per capita in 2010. According to a survey of 2011, Palestine's poverty rate was 25.8%. According to a new World Bank report, Palestinian economic growth is expected to soften in 2023. Economy of Palestine relies heavily on international aids , remittances by overseas Palestinians and local industries.

[ 218 ] Construction of Rawabi and surrounding industrial areas According to a report by the World Bank , the economic impact of Israel's closure policy has been profound, directly contributing to a significant decline in economic activity, widespread unemployment, and a rise in poverty since the onset of the Second Intifada in September 2000.

[ 219 ] The Israeli restrictions imposed on Area C alone result in an estimated annual loss of approximately $3.4 billion, which accounts for nearly half of the current Palestinian GDP.

[ 219 ] These restrictions have severely hindered economic growth and development in the region.

[ 219 ] In the aftermath of the 2014 Gaza War , where many structures were damaged or destroyed, the flow of construction and raw materials into Gaza has been severely limited.

[ 219 ] Additionally, regular exports from the region have been completely halted, exacerbating the economic challenges faced by the population.

[ 219 ] Gaza before the 2023 war One of the burdensome measures imposed by Israel is the "back-to-back" system enforced at crossing points within Palestinian territories .

[ 219 ] This policy forces shippers to unload and reload their goods from one truck to another, resulting in significant transportation costs and longer transit times for both finished products and raw materials.

[ 219 ] These additional expenses further impede economic growth and viability.

[ 219 ] Under the 1995 Oslo II Accord , it was agreed that governance of Area C would be transferred to the Palestinian Authority within 18 months, except for matters to be determined in the final status agreement.

[ 219 ] However, Israel has failed to fulfill its obligations under the Oslo agreement, highlighting the urgent need for accountability and an end to impunity.

[ 219 ] The European Commission has highlighted the detrimental impact of the Israeli West Bank barrier , estimating that it has led to an annual economic impoverishment of Palestinians by 2–3% of GDP.

[ 219 ] Furthermore, the escalating number of internal and external closures continues to have a devastating effect on any prospects for economic recovery in the region.

[ 219 ] According to a 2015 study, the economic impact of Israel's illegal use of Palestinian natural resources was conservatively estimated at US$1.83 billion, equivalent to 22% of Palestine's GDP that year.

[ 219 ] According to a World Bank report, the manufacturing sector's share of GDP decreased from 19% to 10% between the signing of the Oslo Accords until 2011.

[ 219 ] The same report, which adopted conservative estimates, suggests that access to Area 'C' in specific sectors like Dead Sea minerals, telecommunications , mining, tourism , and construction could contribute at least 22% to Palestinian GDP.

[ 219 ] In fact, the report notes that Israel and Jordan together generate around $4.2 billion annually from the sale of these products, representing 6% of the global potash supply and 73% of global bromine output.

[ 219 ] Overall, if Palestinians had unrestricted access to their own land in Area 'C,' the potential economic benefits for Palestine could increase by 35% of GDP, amounting to at least $3.4 billion annually.

[ 219 ] Similarly, water restrictions incurred a cost of US$1.903 billion, equivalent to 23.4% of GDP, while Israel's ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip resulted in a cost of $1.908 billion US$, representing 23.5% of GDP in 2010.

[ 219 ] These burdens are unsustainable for any economy, artificially limiting Palestine's economic potential and its right to develop a prosperous society with a stable economy and sustainable growth.

[ 219 ] The State of Palestine's overall gross-domestic-product (GDP) has declined by 35% in the first quarter of 2024, due to the ongoing war in Gaza, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) reports.

[ 220 ] [ 221 ] There was a stark difference between the West Bank, which witnessed a decline of 25% and in the Gaza Strip, the number is 86% amid the ongoing war.

[ 220 ] The manufacturing sector decreased by 29% in the West Bank and 95% in Gaza, while the construction sector decreased by 42% in the West Bank and essentially collapsed in Gaza, with a 99% decrease.

This report focuses on the Israeli authorities' policies and actions in Gaza as part of the military offensive they launched in the wake of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 while situating them within the broader context of Israel's unlawful occupation, and system of apartheid against Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Israel. It assesses allegations of violations and crimes under international law by Israel in Gaza within the framework of genocide under international law, concluding that there is sufficient evidence to believe that Israel's conduct in Gaza following 7 October 2023 amounts to genocide.

The review presented in this report leaves no room for doubt: since October 2023, the Israeli regime has been responsible for carrying out genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Killing tens of thousands of people; causing bodily or mental harm to hundreds of thousands more; destroying homes and civilian infrastructure on a massive scale; starvation, displacement, and denying humanitarian aid — all this is being perpetrated systematically, as part of a coordinated attack aimed at annihilating all facets of life in the Gaza Strip.

A study of traumatic injury deaths in Gaza in The Lancet using multiple data sources and capture-recapture analysis suggested that the MoH's methods, far from producing an exaggerated number, actually under-estimated the death toll by around 41 percent. ... When considering the total 'excess mortality,' we need to add the Palestinians who have died because of the blockade in combination with the IDF's destruction of health and sanitation and food infrastructure. As public health experts noted, in many wars, 'most deaths' are 'due to the indirect [sic] impacts of war: malnutrition, communicable disease, exacerbations of noncommunicable disease, [and] maternal and infant disorders.'117 'Indirect' would be the wrong word for this conflict given the nature of Israeli policies, including the systematic obstruction of supplies into Gaza.

The researchers found that the overlap was so small that the true number of deaths was probably 46-107% higher than the official ministry total. If you assume that the ratio has stayed the same since last June (and not fallen, as systems caught up during the ceasefire, say) and apply them to the current tally, it would suggest that between 77,000 and 109,000 Gazans have been killed, 4-5% of the territory's pre-war population (see chart).

Q. Does Palestine meet that legal definition [Montevideo Convention]? A.Many experts say that it does, though there is considerable complexity surrounding the particular criteria. & Q. What about recognition? A.The Palestinian leadership has been trying for years to garner as much international recognition as possible, hoping to achieve a diplomatic critical mass that would force the hand of Israel and the United States. By November 2012, when the United Nations General Assembly voted to upgrade Palestine's status to that of a nonmember observer state, 132 of the 198 members of the United Nations recognized Palestinian statehood. Several more have done so since then.

It would be difficult to deny that the recognition of Palestine by over two-thirds of the member states of the United Nations (72 per cent of members), its membership of seventeen international organizations, three international courts and its accession to many major multilateral treaties, in pursuit of Palestinian self-determination, means that Palestine is a state under international law even though its territory continues to be occupied – illegally – by the Government of Israel ^ "The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, opens a preliminary examination of the situation in Palestine" .

37–38, 40–42.

Segev's biography... shows how central exclusionary nationalism , war and racism were to Ben-Gurion 's vision of the Jewish homeland in Palestine , and how contemptuous he was not only of the Arabs but of Jewish life outside Zion . [Liberal Jews] may look at the state that Ben-Gurion built, and ask if the cost has been worth it.
