[ 3 ] The Warren also has objects significant to medical history, such as the inhaler used during the first public demonstration of ether -assisted surgery in 1846 (on loan to the Massachusetts General Hospital since 1948 [ 4 ] ), and the skull of Phineas Gage , who survived a large iron bar being driven through his brain. The museum's first curator was J.B.S. Jackson .

[ 5 ] Early 2020s closure [ edit ] The museum gallery was closed for renovation through winter/spring 2023, as stated on the museum's website, [ 6 ] although the collection remains accessible to researchers by appointment. Normally a rotating subset of items, including Gage's skull and the tamping iron that passed through it, is on public display.
