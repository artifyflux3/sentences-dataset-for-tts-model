**Space tourism** is [human space travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") for recreational purposes.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-1) There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital, [suborbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight "Sub-orbital spaceflight") and lunar space tourism. Tourists are motivated by the possibility of viewing Earth from space, feeling weightlessness, experiencing extremely high speed and something unusual, and contributing to science.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-2)

Space tourism started in April 2001, when American businessman and engineer [Dennis Tito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Tito "Dennis Tito") became the first ever space tourist to travel to space aboard a Soyuz-TM32 spacecraft. During the period from 2001 to 2009, seven space tourists made eight space flights aboard a Russian [Soyuz spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft) "Soyuz (spacecraft)") to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station"), brokered by American company [Space Adventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Adventures "Space Adventures") in conjunction with [Roscosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos "Roscosmos") and [RSC Energia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.P._Korolev_Rocket_and_Space_Corporation_Energia "S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia"). Iranian-American businesswoman [Anousheh Ansari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anousheh_Ansari "Anousheh Ansari") became the first ever female space tourist in September 2006. The publicized price was in the range of US$20–25 million per trip. Some space tourists have signed contracts with third parties to conduct certain research activities while in orbit. By 2007, space tourism was thought to be one of the earliest [markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy "Market economy") that would emerge for commercial spaceflight.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-belfiore2007-3): 11

Space tourists need to be in good physical form before going to space. In particular, they have to train for fast acceleration or g-forces in a centrifuge and weightlessness by flying in a high-altitude jet plane doing parabolic arcs. They may have to learn how to operate and even fix parts of the spaceship using simulators.

Russia halted orbital space tourism in 2010 due to the increase in the International Space Station crew size, using the seats for expedition crews that would previously have been sold to paying spaceflight participants.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-nomorespacetourism-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-interfaxtourism-5) Orbital tourist flights were set to resume in 2015 but the planned flight was postponed indefinitely.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-spaceadventures.com-6) Russian orbital tourism eventually resumed with the launch of [Soyuz MS-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_MS-20 "Soyuz MS-20") in 2021.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-nsf-soyuz-ms-20-7)

On June 7, 2019, [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Association "National Aeronautics and Space Association") announced that starting in 2020, the organization aims to start allowing private astronauts to go on the International Space Station, with the use of the [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX")[Crew Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon "Crew Dragon") spacecraft and the [Boeing Starliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner "Boeing Starliner") spacecraft for public astronauts, which is planned to be priced at 35,000 [USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar") per day for one astronaut,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-$35ktogototheISS-8) and an estimated 50 million [USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar") for the ride there and back.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-$50mridetotheISS-9)

Work also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace companies like [Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin "Blue Origin") and [Virgin Galactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic "Virgin Galactic"). SpaceX announced in 2018 that they are [planning on sending space tourists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DearMoon_project "DearMoon project"), including [Yusaku Maezawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusaku_Maezawa "Yusaku Maezawa"), on a [free-return trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-return_trajectory "Free-return trajectory") around the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") on the [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship "SpaceX Starship"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-teslarati_moonflight-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-grush-11) however the project was cancelled on June 1, 2024.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The [Soviet space program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_program "Soviet space program") was successful in broadening the pool of [cosmonauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmonauts "Cosmonauts"). The Soviet [Intercosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interkosmos "Interkosmos") program included cosmonauts selected from [Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact "Warsaw Pact") member countries ([Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia "Czechoslovakia"), Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania) and later from allies of the USSR (Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam) and [non-aligned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement "Non-Aligned Movement") countries (India, Syria, Afghanistan). Most of these cosmonauts received full training for their missions and were treated as equals, but were generally given shorter flights than Soviet cosmonauts. The [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") (ESA) also took advantage of the program.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-12)

The [US Space Shuttle program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program "Space Shuttle program") included [payload specialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_Specialist "Payload Specialist") positions which were usually filled by representatives of companies or institutions managing a specific payload on that mission. These payload specialists did not receive the same training as professional [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") astronauts and were not employed by NASA. In 1983, [Ulf Merbold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulf_Merbold "Ulf Merbold") from the ESA and [Byron Lichtenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_K._Lichtenberg "Byron K. Lichtenberg") from [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") (engineer and [Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force") fighter pilot) were the first payload specialists to fly on the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle"), on mission [STS-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-9 "STS-9").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-14)

In 1984, [Charles D. Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_D._Walker "Charles D. Walker") became the first non-government astronaut to fly, with his employer [McDonnell Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas "McDonnell Douglas") paying US$40,000 (equivalent to $121,063 in 2024) for his flight.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-unl2011-15): 74–75  During the 1970s, Shuttle prime contractor [Rockwell International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_International "Rockwell International") studied a $200–300 million removable cabin that could fit into the Shuttle's cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days. Space Habitation Design Associates proposed, in 1983, a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay. Passengers were located in six sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the [Spacelab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacelab "Spacelab") habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area. A 1985 presentation to the [National Space Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Space_Society "National Space Society") stated that, although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 million to $1.5 million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years, 30,000 people a year would pay US$25,000 (equivalent to $73,089 in 2024) each to fly in space on new spacecraft. The presentation also forecast flights to [lunar orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit "Lunar orbit") within 30 years and visits to the lunar surface within 50 years.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-l5198504-16)

As the shuttle program expanded in the early 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly. [Christa McAuliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christa_McAuliffe "Christa McAuliffe") was chosen as the first [Teacher in Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher_in_Space "Teacher in Space") in July 1985 from 11,400 applicants. 1,700 applied for the Journalist in Space program. An Artist in Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe's flight two to three civilians a year would fly on the shuttle. After McAuliffe was killed in the [_Challenger_ disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster "Space Shuttle Challenger disaster") in January 1986, the programs were canceled. McAuliffe's backup, [Barbara Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Morgan "Barbara Morgan"), eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on [STS-118](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-118 "STS-118") as a [mission specialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_specialist "Mission specialist").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-unl2011-15): 84–85  A second journalist-in-space program, in which NASA green-lighted [Miles O'Brien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_O%27Brien_(journalist) "Miles O'Brien (journalist)") to fly on the Space Shuttle, was scheduled to be announced in 2003. That program was canceled in the wake of the [_Columbia_ disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster "Space Shuttle Columbia disaster") on [STS-107](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-107 "STS-107") and subsequent emphasis on finishing the International Space Station before retiring the Space Shuttle.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Initially, senior figures at NASA strongly opposed space tourism on principle; from the beginning of the ISS expeditions, NASA stated it was not interested in accommodating paying guests.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-NoTourists-17) The Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics Committee on Science of the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives") held in June 2001 revealed the shifting attitude of NASA towards paying space tourists wanting to travel to the ISS in its statement on the hearing's purpose:

> "Review the issues and opportunities for flying nonprofessional astronauts in space, the appropriate government role for supporting the nascent space tourism industry, use of the Shuttle and Space Station for Tourism, safety and training criteria for space tourists, and the potential commercial market for space tourism."

The subcommittee report was interested in evaluating [Dennis Tito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Tito "Dennis Tito")'s extensive training and his experience in space as a nonprofessional astronaut.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

With the realities of the post-[Perestroika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika "Perestroika") economy in Russia, its space industry was especially starved for cash. The [Tokyo Broadcasting System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Broadcasting_System "Tokyo Broadcasting System") (TBS) offered to pay for one of its reporters to fly on a mission. [Toyohiro Akiyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyohiro_Akiyama "Toyohiro Akiyama") was flown in 1990 to _[Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir")_ with the eighth crew and returned a week later with the seventh crew. Cost estimates vary from $10 million up to $37 million.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-19) Akiyama gave a daily TV broadcast from orbit and also performed scientific experiments for Russian and Japanese companies.

In 1991, British chemist [Helen Sharman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Sharman "Helen Sharman") was selected from a pool of 13,000 applicants to be the first Briton in space.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-FirstBriton-20) The program was known as [Project Juno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Juno "Project Juno") and was a cooperative arrangement between the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") and a group of British companies. The Project Juno consortium failed to raise the funds required, and the program was almost canceled. Reportedly [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev") ordered it to proceed under Soviet expense in the interests of international relations, but in the absence of Western underwriting, less expensive experiments were substituted for those in the original plans. Sharman flew aboard [Soyuz TM-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TM-12 "Soyuz TM-12") to _Mir_ and returned aboard [Soyuz TM-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TM-11 "Soyuz TM-11").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-21)

In April 1999, the Russian space agency announced that 51-year-old British billionaire Peter Llewellyn would be sent to the aging Mir space station in return for a payment of $100 million by Llewellyn.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-22) Llewellyn, however, denied agreeing to pay that sum, his refusal to pay which prompted his flight's cancellation a month later.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-23)

The altitude is beyond the [Kármán Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_Line "Kármán Line"), the arbitrarily defined boundary of space.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-Xprize1-24) The first flight was flown by [Michael Melvill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Melvill "Mike Melvill") in June 2004, to a height of 100 km (62 mi), making him the first commercial astronaut.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-25) The prize-winning flight was flown by [Brian Binnie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Binnie "Brian Binnie"), which reached a height of 112.0 km (69.6 mi), breaking the [X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-15 "X-15") record.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-Xprize2-26) There were no space tourists on the flights even though the vehicle has seats for three passengers. Instead there was additional weight to make up for the weight of passengers.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-BritannicaTopicSpaceShipOne-27)
*   In 2005, [Virgin Galactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic "Virgin Galactic") was founded as a joint venture between Scaled Composites and Richard Branson's Virgin Group.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-28) Eventually Virgin Group owned the entire project.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-29) Virgin Galactic began building [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo "SpaceShipTwo")-class spaceplanes. The first of these [spaceplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane"), [VSS _Enterprise_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSS_Enterprise "VSS Enterprise"), was intended to commence its first commercial flights in 2015, and tickets were on sale at a price of $200,000 (later raised to $250,000). However, the company suffered a considerable setback when [the _Enterprise_ broke up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Virgin_Galactic_crash "2014 Virgin Galactic crash") over the [Mojave Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Desert "Mojave Desert") during a test flight in October 2014. Over 700 tickets had been sold prior to the accident.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-30) A second spaceplane, [VSS _Unity_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSS_Unity "VSS Unity"), completed a successful test flight with four passengers on July 11, 2021, to an altitude of nearly 90 km (56 mi).[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-31)[Galactic 01](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_01 "Galactic 01") became the company's first commercial spaceflight on June 29, 2023.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-32)
*   [Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin "Blue Origin") developed the [New Shepard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Shepard "New Shepard") reusable suborbital launch system specifically to enable short-duration space tourism. Blue Origin plans to ferry a maximum of six persons on a brief journey to space on board the New Shepard. The capsule is attached to the top portion of an 18-meter (59-foot) rocket. The rocket successfully launched with four passengers on July 20, 2021, and reached an altitude of 107 km (66 mi).[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-33) Blue Origin's 10th human flight lifted off on the morning of February 25, 2025. Six paying passengers, including a Spanish TV host, and several investors, experienced weightlessness during the 10-12-minute flight and can see Earth against the blackness of space.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-34)

*   [Armadillo Aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo_Aerospace "Armadillo Aerospace") was developing a two-seat vertical takeoff and landing ([VTOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTOL "VTOL")) rocket called Hyperion, which will be marketed by Space Adventures.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-35) Hyperion uses a capsule similar in shape to the Gemini capsule. The vehicle will use a parachute for descent but will probably use [retrorockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrorocket "Retrorocket") for final touchdown, according to remarks made by Armadillo Aerospace at the Next Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference in February 2012. The assets of Armadillo Aerospace were sold to [Exos Aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exos_Aerospace "Exos Aerospace") and while SARGE is continuing to be developed, it is unclear whether Hyperion is still being developed.
*   [XCOR Aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOR_Aerospace "XCOR Aerospace") was developing a suborbital vehicle called [Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(spacecraft) "Lynx (spacecraft)") until development was halted in May 2016.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-36) The Lynx would take off from a runway under rocket power. Unlike SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo, Lynx would not require a mothership. Lynx was designed for rapid turnaround, which would enable it to fly up to four times per day. Because of this rapid flight rate, Lynx had fewer seats than SpaceShipTwo, carrying only one pilot and one spaceflight participant on each flight. XCOR expected to roll out the first Lynx prototype and begin flight tests in 2015, but as of late 2017, XCOR was unable to complete their prototype development and filed for bankruptcy.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-37)

Citizens in Space combines [citizen science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science "Citizen science") with citizen space exploration. The goal is to fly citizen-science experiments and citizen explorers (who travel free) who will act as payload operators on suborbital space missions. By 2012, Citizens in Space had acquired a contract for 10 suborbital flights with XCOR Aerospace and expected to acquire additional flights from XCOR and other suborbital spaceflight providers in the future. In 2012, Citizens in Space reported they had begun training three citizen astronaut candidates and would select seven additional candidates over the next 12 to 14 months.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-38)[_[needs update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_]

Orbital space tourism
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_tourism&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Orbital space tourism")]

As of 2021, Space Adventures and SpaceX are the only companies to have coordinated tourism flights to Earth's orbit. Virginia-based Space Adventures has worked with Russia to use its Soyuz spacecraft to fly ultra-wealthy individuals to the International Space Station. The tourists included entrepreneur and space investor [Anousheh Ansari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anousheh_Ansari "Anousheh Ansari") and [Cirque du Soleil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirque_du_Soleil "Cirque du Soleil") co-founder [Guy Laliberté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Lalibert%C3%A9 "Guy Laliberté"). Those missions were priced at around $20 million each. The space industry could soon be headed for a tourism revolution if SpaceX and Boeing make good on their plans to take tourists to orbit.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-42)

Space tourist [Mark Shuttleworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth "Mark Shuttleworth")

At the end of the 1990s, [MirCorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MirCorp "MirCorp"), a private venture that was by then in charge of the space station, began seeking potential space tourists to visit _Mir_ in order to offset some of its maintenance costs. [Dennis Tito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Tito "Dennis Tito"), an American businessman and former [JPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory "Jet Propulsion Laboratory") scientist, became their first candidate. When the decision was made to de-orbit _Mir_, Tito managed to switch his trip to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") (ISS) aboard a Russian [Soyuz spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft) "Soyuz (spacecraft)") through a deal between MirCorp and US-based [Space Adventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Adventures "Space Adventures"), Ltd. Dennis Tito visited the ISS for seven days in April–May 2001, becoming the world's first "fee-paying" space tourist. Tito paid a reported $20 million for his trip.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-Tito-43)

Tito was followed in April 2002 by South African [Mark Shuttleworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth "Mark Shuttleworth") ([Soyuz TM-34](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TM-34 "Soyuz TM-34")). In February 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven astronauts aboard. After this disaster, space tourism on the Russian [Soyuz program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_program "Soyuz program") was temporarily put on hold, because [Soyuz vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_spacecraft "Soyuz spacecraft") became the only available transport to the ISS. After the Shuttle's return to service in July 2005, space tourism was resumed. The third was [Gregory Olsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Olsen "Gregory Olsen") in October 2005 ([Soyuz TMA-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-7 "Soyuz TMA-7")). In September 2006, an [Iranian American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_American "Iranian American") businesswoman named [Anousheh Ansari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anousheh_Ansari "Anousheh Ansari") became the fourth space tourist ([Soyuz TMA-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-9 "Soyuz TMA-9")).[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-Anousheh_Ansari-44)) In April 2007, [Charles Simonyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Simonyi "Charles Simonyi"), an American businessman of Hungarian descent, joined their ranks ([Soyuz TMA-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-10 "Soyuz TMA-10")). Simonyi became the first repeat space tourist, paying again to fly on [Soyuz TMA-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-14 "Soyuz TMA-14") in March 2009. [British-American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British-American "British-American")[Richard Garriott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garriott "Richard Garriott") became the next space tourist in October 2008 aboard [Soyuz TMA-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-13 "Soyuz TMA-13").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-45) Canadian [Guy Laliberté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Lalibert%C3%A9 "Guy Laliberté") visited the ISS in September 2009 aboard [Soyuz TMA-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-16 "Soyuz TMA-16"), becoming the last visiting tourist until Japanese nationals [Yusaku Maezawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusaku_Maezawa "Yusaku Maezawa") and [Yozo Hirano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yozo_Hirano "Yozo Hirano") aboard [Soyuz MS-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_MS-20 "Soyuz MS-20") in December 2021. Originally the third member aboard [Soyuz TMA-18M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-18M "Soyuz TMA-18M") would have been the British singer [Sarah Brightman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Brightman "Sarah Brightman") as a space tourist, but on May 13, 2015, she announced she had withdrawn from training.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-46)

Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, Soyuz once again became the only means of accessing the ISS, and so tourism was once again put on hold. On June 7, 2019, NASA announced a plan to open the ISS to space tourism again.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-47)

On September 16, 2021, the [Inspiration4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspiration4 "Inspiration4") mission launched from the [Kennedy Space Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center "Kennedy Space Center") on a [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX")[Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") and spent almost three days in orbit aboard the [Crew Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon "Crew Dragon")_[Resilience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew\_Dragon\_Resilience "Crew Dragon Resilience")_, becoming the first all-civilian crew to fly an orbital space mission.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-49)

On September 12, 2024, [Jared Isaacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Isaacman "Jared Isaacman") and [Sarah Gillis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Gillis "Sarah Gillis") performed the first commercial [spacewalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity") during the _[Polaris Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris\_Dawn "Polaris Dawn")_ spaceflight operated by [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-50)

On April 1, 2025, [Fram2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fram2 "Fram2") became the first [crewed spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") to enter a [polar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_orbit "Polar orbit")[retrograde orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_orbit "Retrograde orbit"),[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-51) launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-52)

*   [Axiom Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_Space "Axiom Space") uses [Crew Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_2 "Dragon 2") flights contracted with [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") to send crews to the International Space Station.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-Sheetz_2021-53)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-Ax-2_Overview-54)[Mission 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_Mission_1 "Axiom Mission 1") flew in April 2022, [Mission 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_Mission_2 "Axiom Mission 2") in May 2023, [Mission 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_Mission_3 "Axiom Mission 3") in January 2024, and [Mission 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_Mission_4 "Axiom Mission 4") in June 2025. Through these missions, NASA hopes to create a non-NASA market for human spaceflight to enable cost-sharing on future commercial space stations.
*   The [Boeing Starliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner "Boeing Starliner") capsule is being developed as part of the NASA's [Commercial Crew Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program "Commercial Crew Program"). Part of the agreement with NASA allows Boeing to sell seats for space tourists. Boeing proposed including one seat per flight for a [spaceflight participant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_participant "Spaceflight participant") at a price that would be competitive with what Roscosmos charges tourists.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-55)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-56)
*   The [Polaris Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris_Program "Polaris Program"): The commander and financier of the Inspiration4 mission, [Jared Isaacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Isaacman "Jared Isaacman"), announced plans for a three-mission program called Polaris in February 2022. The first mission, [Polaris Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris_Dawn "Polaris Dawn"), launched four private astronauts in a [Crew Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon "Crew Dragon") spacecraft to earth orbit. Polaris Dawn was a free-flyer mission in which the spacecraft did not perform any rendezvous maneuvers, instead setting the all-time earth orbit altitude record at 1,400 km, surpassing the 1,373 km record set by [Gemini XI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_XI "Gemini XI"). Polaris Dawn also included the first private [extravehicular activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity") (EVA). The last Polaris program mission is planned to be the first crewed flight of the in-development Starship launch system.

*   In 2004, [Bigelow Aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigelow_Aerospace "Bigelow Aerospace") established a competition called [America's Space Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Space_Prize "America's Space Prize"), which offered a $50 million prize to the first US company to create a reusable spacecraft capable of carrying passengers to a Nautilus space station. The prize expired in January 2010 without anyone making a serious effort to win it.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-57)

Yusaku Maezawa described the plan for his trip in further detail, dubbed the #[dearMoon project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DearMoon_project "DearMoon project"), intended to take 6–8 artists with him on the journey to inspire the artists to create new art.

Under the [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty "Outer Space Treaty") signed in 1967, the launch operator's nationality and the launch site's location determine which country is responsible for any damages occurred from a launch.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-76)

After valuable resources were detected on the Moon, private companies began to formulate methods to extract the resources. Article II of the [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty "Outer Space Treaty") dictates that "outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means".[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-77) However, countries have the right to freely explore the Moon and any resources collected are property of that country when they return.

In December 2005, the US government released a set of proposed rules for space tourism.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-78) These included screening procedures and training for emergency situations, but not health requirements.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In 1984, the U.S. Congress passed the [Commercial Space Launch Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Space_Launch_Act_of_1984 "Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984"), which, among other things, encourages space commercialization ([51 U.S.C. § 20102(c)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=%2Fprelim%40title51&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title51&f=&fq=&num=0&hl=false&edition=prelim)).

Under current US law, any company proposing to launch paying passengers from American soil on a suborbital rocket must receive a license from the Federal Aviation Administration's [Office of Commercial Space Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Commercial_Space_Transportation "Office of Commercial Space Transportation") (FAA/AST). The licensing process focuses on public safety and safety of property, and the details can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter III.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-FAAReg-79) This is in accordance with the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act passed by Congress in 2004,[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-SpaceTourismCongress-80) which required that NASA and the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") to allow paying passengers fly on suborbital launch vehicles at their own risk.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-81)

In March 2010, the New Mexico legislature passed the Spaceflight Informed Consent Act. The SICA gives legal protection to companies who provide private space flights in the case of accidental harm or death to individuals. Participants sign an Informed Consent waiver, dictating that spaceflight operators cannot be held liable in the "death of a participant resulting from the inherent risks of space flight activities". Operators are however not covered in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-82)

In December 2021, the FAA announced that starting in 2022, it would recognize on its official website those who travel to space.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-:0-83) "Any individual who is on an FAA-licensed or permitted launch and reaches 50 statute miles above the surface of the Earth will be listed on the site."[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-:0-83) The announcement ended the [Commercial Space Astronaut Wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_astronaut "Commercial astronaut") program, under which the FAA had offered commercial astronaut wings to individuals on private spacecraft who made it above 50 miles (80 kilometers) in altitude above Earth since 2004.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-84)

### Legal issues and challenges

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_tourism&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Legal issues and challenges")]

With the increasing advent of sub-orbital flights, there are growing concerns that the present international framework is insufficient to address the significant issues raised by space tourism. The concerns relate to commercial Liability, insurance, consumer protection, passenger safety, environmental impact, and emergency response.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-85)[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-86)

List of space tourism trips
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_tourism&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: List of space tourism trips")]

The following list notes each trip taken by an individual for whom a fee was paid (by themselves or another party) to go above the [Kármán Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_Line "Kármán Line"), the internationally recognized boundary of space at 100 km, or above the US definition of the boundary of space at 50 miles (80 km). It also includes future trips which are paid for and scheduled.

Criticism of the term _space tourist_
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_tourism&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Criticism of the term space tourist")]

Many private space travelers have objected to the term _space tourist_, often pointing out that their role went beyond that of an observer, since they also carried out scientific experiments in the course of their journey. [Richard Garriott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garriott "Richard Garriott") additionally emphasized that his training was identical to the requirements of non-Russian Soyuz crew members, and that teachers and other non-professional astronauts chosen to fly with NASA are called astronauts. He has said that if the distinction has to be made, he would rather be called "private astronaut" than "tourist".[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-Garriott-108)[Mark Shuttleworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth "Mark Shuttleworth") described himself as a "pioneer of commercial space travel".[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-109)[Gregory Olsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Olsen "Gregory Olsen") prefers "private researcher",[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-110) and [Anousheh Ansari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anousheh_Ansari "Anousheh Ansari") prefers the term "private space explorer". Other advocates of private spaceflight object to the term on similar grounds. [Rick Tumlinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Tumlinson "Rick Tumlinson") of the [Space Frontier Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Frontier_Foundation "Space Frontier Foundation"), for example, has said: "I hate the word tourist, and I always will ... 'Tourist' is somebody in a flowered shirt with three cameras around his neck."[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-111) Russian cosmonaut [Maksim Surayev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maksim_Surayev "Maksim Surayev") told the press in 2009 not to describe [Guy Laliberté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Lalibert%C3%A9 "Guy Laliberté") as a tourist: "It's become fashionable to speak of space tourists. He is not a tourist but a participant in the mission."[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-112)

"[Spaceflight participant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_participant "Spaceflight participant")" is the official term used by NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency to distinguish between private space travelers and career astronauts. Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen, Ansari, and Simonyi were designated as such during their respective space flights. NASA also lists [Christa McAuliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christa_McAuliffe "Christa McAuliffe") as a spaceflight participant (although she did not pay a fee), apparently due to her non-technical duties aboard the [STS-51-L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-51-L "STS-51-L") flight.

The US Federal Aviation Administration awards the title of "[commercial astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_astronaut "Commercial astronaut")" to trained crew members of privately funded spacecraft.

Attitudes towards space tourism
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_tourism&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Attitudes towards space tourism")]

A 2018 survey from the PEW Research Center identifies the top three motivations for a customer to purchase a flight into space as:[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-113)

*   To experience something unique ( e.g. pioneering, one of a kind)
*   To see the view of Earth from space
*   To learn more about the world

The PEW study also found that only 43% of Americans would be definitely or probably interested in going into space. NASA astronaut [Megan McArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Megan_McArthur "K. Megan McArthur") has a message to space tourists: spaceflight is uncomfortable and risky, and takes grit.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-114)

A web-based survey suggested that over 70% of those surveyed wanted less than or equal to two weeks in space; in addition, 88% wanted to spacewalk, of whom 14% would pay a 50% premium for the experience, and 21% wanted a hotel or space station.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-Space.comSurvey-115)

The concept has met with some criticism; [Günter Verheugen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnter_Verheugen "Günter Verheugen"), vice-president of the [European Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission "European Commission"), said of the EADS Astrium Space Tourism Project: "It's only for the super-rich, which is against my social convictions".[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-116)

On October 14, 2021, [Prince William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge "Prince William, Duke of Cambridge") suggested that entrepreneurs should focus on saving [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") rather than engaging in space tourism and also warned about a rise in "[climate anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_anxiety "Climate anxiety")" among younger generations.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-117)

Influence of a decade of contemporary rocket launch and re-entry heating emissions on stratospheric chemical composition[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-10.1029/2021EF002612-118)

A 2010 study published in _[Geophysical Research Letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical\_Research\_Letters "Geophysical Research Letters")_ raised concerns that the growing commercial spaceflight industry could accelerate global warming. The study, funded by NASA and The Aerospace Corporation, simulated the impact of 1,000 suborbital launches of [hybrid rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_rocket "Hybrid rocket") from a single location, calculating that this would release a total of 600 tonnes of [black carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_carbon "Black carbon") into the stratosphere. They found that the resultant layer of soot particles remained relatively localized, with only 20% of the carbon straying into the southern hemisphere, thus creating a strong hemispherical asymmetry.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-GRL-119) This unbalance would cause the temperature to decrease by about 0.4°C (0.72°F) in the tropics and subtropics, whereas the temperature at the poles would increase by between 0.2 and 1°C (0.36 and 1.80°F). The ozone layer would also be affected, with the tropics losing up to 1.7% of ozone cover, and the polar regions gaining 5–6%.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-120) The researchers stressed that these results should not be taken as "a precise forecast of the climate response to a specific launch rate of a specific rocket type", but as a demonstration of the sensitivity of the atmosphere to the large-scale disruption that commercial space tourism could bring.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-GRL-119)

A 2022 study estimated the [air pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution "Air pollution") impacts on climate change and the ozone layer from rocket launches and re-entry of reusable components and [debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") in 2019 and from a theoretical future [space industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_industry "Space industry") extrapolated from the "[billionaire space race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire_space_race "Billionaire space race")". It concludes that substantial effects from routine space tourism should "motivate [regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_law "Space law")".[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-121)[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-10.1029/2021EF002612-118)

### Education and advocacy

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_tourism&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Education and advocacy")]

Several organizations have been formed to promote the space tourism industry, including the Space Tourism Society, Space Future, and HobbySpace. _UniGalactic Space Travel Magazine_ is a bi-monthly educational publication covering space tourism and space exploration developments in companies like SpaceX, Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic and organizations like NASA.

Classes in space tourism are currently taught at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology "Rochester Institute of Technology") in New York,[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-122) and [Keio University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keio_University "Keio University") in Japan.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-123)[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embry%E2%80%93Riddle_Aeronautical_University "Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University") in Florida launched a worldwide space tourism course in 2017.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-124)

A 2010 report from the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration"), titled "The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U.S. Economy in 2009", cites studies done by Futron, an aerospace and technology-consulting firm, which predict that space tourism could become a billion-dollar market within 20 years.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-125) Eight tourists reached orbit between 2001 and 2009. In 2011 Space Adventures suggested that this number could reach 140 by 2020,[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-126) but with commercial crewed rockets only just beginning to enter service, such numbers have yet to be achieved.

According to a 2022 report by [Research and Markets](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/report/space-tourism), titled "Global Space Tourism Market," the global space tourism industry is projected to reach US$8.67 billion by 2030, with an estimated [compound annual growth rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_annual_growth_rate "Compound annual growth rate") (CAGR) of 37.1% between 2022 and 2030.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#cite_note-127)
