Doppler on Wheels ( DOW ) is a fleet of quickly deployable truck-mounted weather radars managed by the FARM (Flexible Array of Radars and Mesonets) Facility, an American research company affiliated with the University of Alabama Huntsville .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The group, which started as the Center for Severe Weather Research, is led by atmospheric scientist Joshua Wurman , and is partially funded by the National Science Foundation , as part of the "Community Instruments and Facilities" program. The DOW fleet have been used throughout the United States since 1995, as well as occasionally in Europe and South America, to research hazardous and challenging weather phenomena such as tornados .

[ 1 ] The name refers to the Doppler effect at the basis of modern weather radar technology.

Data gathered by a Doppler on Wheels unit showing a tornado near La Grange, Wyoming History [ edit ] See also: Mobile radar observation of tornadoes The first DOW platform was created and deployed in 1995, substantially changing the design paradigm of targeted meteorological studies. Ground-breaking, extremely fine-scale data was collected in tornadoes [ 3 ] and hurricanes , [ 4 ] as well as other phenomena. DOWs, by virtue of providing especially fine-scale targeted observations, have been central to various scientific discoveries, "firsts", and pioneering observations, e.g. the first concrete documentation of specific impacts of weather modification cloud seeding, the first mapping of multiple-vortices in tornadoes, the quantification of tornado low-level wind structure, etc. The DOW program rapidly expanded and evolved to include the first mobile dual- Doppler weather radar network, the first mobile rapid-scan radar (the Rapid-Scan DOW, RSDOW), [ 1 ] and the first quickly-deployable 1-degree C-band radar, the C-band on Wheels (COW). The DOWs, Mobile Mesonets , PODs & POLEs, as well as many other devices were crucial for instrumentation in numerous field projects, including VORTEX , VORTEX2 , COPS, MAP, ASCII, IHOP, SCMS, CASES, ROTATE, PAMREX, SNOWD-UNDER, FLATLAND, HERO, UIDOW, UNDEO [ citation needed ] , LEE, PERILS, [ 5 ] WINTRE-MIX, [ 6 ] RELAMPAGO, [ 7 ] GRAINEX, [ 8 ] and others.

In late 2018, the DOW Facility debuted a new quickly-deployable C-band radar (or COW) featuring a larger antenna and 5 cm wavelength (as compared to the 3 cm wavelength of the DOWs). Due to the larger size of the antenna, the truck features a built-in crane allowing for the radar to be assembled on site. The COW was first deployed as part of the RELAMPAGO field campaign in Argentina in late 2018.

[ 9 ] The DOW fleet has collected data in 250 tornadoes and inside the cores of eighteen hurricanes. DOWs have been deployed to Europe twice, [ 10 ] for the MAP and COPS field programs, and to Alaska twice for the JAWS-Juneau projects, and to South America for RELAMPAGO. DOWs have operated as high as 12,700 feet (3,900 m) on Bristol Head and at 10,000 feet (3,000 m) for the ASCII project at Battle Pass .

The DOW fleet, PODS, and Mobile Mesonets have been featured on television, including Discovery Channel 's series Storm Chasers (joined by the Tornado Intercept Vehicles and the Dominator SRV vehicles), [ 11 ] National Geographic Channel 's specials Tornado Intercept and The True Face of Hurricanes , and PBS 's Nova episode "The Hunt for the Supertwister," and others.

ability typical of stationary weather research systems.

[ 12 ] It was constructed from November 1994 to April 1995, in preparation for VORTEX-95 . DOW 1 was able to deploy for the project, and able to observe several tornadoes. DOW 1 was also used for several other research projects, including Small Cumulus Mesoscale Study (SCMS) in Florida in 1995, the FLATLAND/LIFT
Boundary Layer Experiment in Illinois in 1996, and a microburst study run by MIT/LL and the FAA in 1996. DOW 1 was decommissioned in 1997, with the creation of DOW 2 and DOW 3.

NSSL Project Vortex - Mobile Radar No.1 SE of Shamrock, Texas DOW 1 used the transmitter of a CP-2 radar provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Research , along with a surplus antenna, pedestal, and receiver
hardware. It was mounted on a modified Chevrolet flatbed truck, costing roughly $50,000. In 1996, the radar was upgraded with the installation of a new 2.44 meter antenna, replacing the previous 1.88 meter antenna. The new antenna allowed for a decreased beamwidth of 0.93°, improving the radar's overall resolution.

[ 12 ] This upgraded radar would later be used by DOW 3 upon its completion in 1997.

While the mobile mesonets provided key insights into pressure, temperature, and humidity near the surface in the lead up to and during tornadogenesis , they failed to provide a detailed view of three dimensional airflow in the storm and its surrounding regions.

[ 13 ] Without a detailed view of airflow and conditions above the surface, project VORTEX researchers were be unable to observe key ingredients and steps that occur during the formation of a tornado. While a NOAA WP-3 equipped with a C-Band doppler radar [ 14 ] and the National Center for Atmospheric Research's ELDORA aircraft equipped with a X-Band doppler radar [ 15 ] were used for VORTEX operations in both 1994 and 1995, they only provided data every 300 meters and were therefor unable to document the motion of air within small regions of the storm, especially the mesocyclone. This lack of information also meant that researchers were unable to verify several key hypothesis established prior to field operations.

[ 13 ] To obtain data on wind variation and movement from altitudes of 100 meters to 10,000 meters, VORTEX scientists and the NSSL collaborated with University of Oklahoma School of Meteorology Assistant Professor Dr. Joshua Wurman , who had spent the past several years developing doppler radar technology at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , to develop a truck mounted doppler radar in time for the VORTEX-95 field campaign.

[ 13 ] The antenna pedestal and dish were taken from old military missile tracking radars, while the transmitter was provided by the NCAR from a CP-2 research radar. The receiver and signal processor were developed by Mitch Randell and Eric Loew, while the system was mostly built by NSSL technicians Paul Griffin and Dennis Nealson.

[ 13 ] For their work on the Doppler on Wheels, Paul Griffin and Dennis Nealson were awarded the NOAA Bronze Medal .

[ 16 ] Parts for the Doppler on Wheels were ordered in November and December 1994, with testing taking place during March and April 1995. DOW 1 was first deployed on May 12, and scanned its first tornado just 4 days later on May 16 near Hanston, Kansas. DOW 1 was deployed on a ridge to the south of town and scanned as the tornado progressed for 45 minutes.

[ 13 ] On June 2, DOW 1 was deployed to the Dimmitt Texas, where it would scan one of the most studied tornadoes in history. The chase initially started in Friona Texas, where DOW 1, along with the rest of VORTEX-95 intercepted a violent F4 tornado.

[ 13 ] After dissipating, Erik Rasmussen directed DOW 1, driven by Jerry Straka and operated by Joshua Wurman, to drive south towards an intensifying mesocyclone near Dimmitt, Texas. DOW 1 deployed south of town, and was able to start scanning before the tornado touched down. This meant that for the first time, meteorologists were able to observe highly detailed reflectivity and velocity radar data throughout the entire tornadogenesis process.

[ 13 ] After touching down, the tornado followed an arcing path, which kept it at a constant sub 2 miles from DOW 1. This close range radar intercept, combined with other data collected by probe teams, mobile mesonets, and airborne radar aircraft, resulted in the most comprehensive tornado research dataset ever produced, until VORTEX 2 intercepted the Goshen County, Wyoming EF2 in 2009.

DOW 2 was built off the base of a modified 1995 Ford F700, being able to reach 74 mph and weighing 25,000 lbs when fully equipped with its radar and scientific instrumentation.

[ 12 ] DOW 2 used a surplus 2.44 m antenna from NCAR’s CP-2 radar, being able to achieve a beamwidth of 0.93°. This was mounted on a spare pedestal from NCAR's CP-3 radar, often noted for its bright red color. This pedestal came with improved scan rotation speed, now being able to achieve 60° per second.

[ 12 ] The most important update was to the DOW's Tx power. While DOW 1 was only able to have a maximum transmit power of 40 kW, DOW 2 was able to reach a peak Tx power of 250 kW. This increase in power allowed for improved sensitivity to low reflectivity and clear air. The receiver was also redesigned to be compatible with mobile bistatic systems.

While DOW 2 was used alongside DOW 3 for domestic research projects, including Radar Observations of Tornadoes And Thunderstorms Experiment (ROTATE) 1998-2004, and Hurricanes at Landfall (HAL), it is perhaps more notable for the research it conducted in Europe. DOW 2 was deployed to Switzerland in 1999 for the Mesoscale Alpine Programme (MAP), studying atmospheric and hydrological processes over mountainous terrain with the goal of better understanding how complex topography impacts weather systems.

[ 19 ] In 2007, DOW 2 was deployed to France and Germany for the Convective and Orographically Induced Precipitation Study (COPS), studying how orographic terrain influences convective precipitation. According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM), there were three primary questions investigated: [ 20 ] What are the processes responsible for the formation and evolution of convective clouds in orographic terrain?

What are the microphysical properties of orographically induced clouds and how do these depend on dynamics, thermodynamics, and aerosol microphysics?

How can convective clouds in orographic terrain be represented in atmospheric models based on AMF, COPS, and GOP data?

After COPS 2007, DOW 2 was retired with the introduction of DOW 6 at the start of the 2008 storm season.

DOW 3 was largely the same as DOW 2, but incorporated several pieces of hardware including the green radar pedestal and a differently shaped radar dish that were originally used on DOW 1. The actual truck, a modified 1995 Ford F700, was identical to DOW 2 apart from small cosmetic differences.

[ 12 ] Both second generation DOWs were also outfitted with an extendable 10 meter meteorological and communication masts, allowing for both atmospheric measurements such as temperature, wind speed, and pressure, while also allowing for extended radio communications and better internet signal.

DOW 3’s radar specifications were also the same as DOW 2, excluding the cosmetic radar dish covering the antenna. This included a peak Tx power of 250 kW, a 2.44 m parabolic antenna, a beamwidth of 0.93°, a pulsewidth of 0.1 - 2.0 μs, and a staggered PRF between 500–5000 Hz. In 1999, DOWs 2 and 3 were upgraded with new antenna control hardware and software.

Unlike DOWs 1, 2, and 3, it was not part of the University of Oklahoma Mobile Radar Research Lab and therefor constructed as a joint venture by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and Wurman's private company, BINET Inc.

[ 12 ] It was built on a 1999 Chevrolet 3500HD chassis, smaller than the Ford F700 used for DOWs 2 and 3 but better optimized for narrower European roadways.

[ 12 ] DOW 4 was first Doppler on Wheels to possess dual polarization, [ 12 ] meaning it could scan using horizontal and vertical radar beams simultaneously and therefor better differentiate between different types of precipitation.

[ 23 ] Before being transferred to the National Observatory of Athens and stationed at the Penteli Observatory , DOW 4 was able to participate in several research studies including ROTATE-2001, [ 12 ] CAMEX-4 Keys Area Microphysics Project (KAMP), [ 24 ] and The International H2O Project 2002 (IHOP).

DOW 5 began construction in 2001 with the goal of fitting a phased array radar capable of rapidly scanning a storm environment and detecting small changes in storm evolution that occur within timescales too short to detect using traditional parabolic antenna radars, including those on DOWs and National Weather Service WSR-88D NEXRAD radars.

[ 25 ] While originally planned to be part of the University of Oklahoma's Mobile Radar Research Lab, DOW 5 was completed in 2003 and transferred to the Center for Severe Weather Research, along with Wurman's other DOW radars.

[ 26 ] DOW 5 is unique in that it was the first mobile weather radar platform to feature a phased array radar, which utilizes many smaller antennas to near simultaneously transmit and receive high resolution data in very short timescales usually missed by slower scanning mechanical radars.

[ 25 ] Because conventional phased array technologies are prohibitively expensive to design and deploy, especially in the early 2000s when DOW 5 was developed, it utilizes a hybrid electronic and mechanical scanning system. DOW 5 maintains mechanically rotating azimuth while incorporating frequency based electronic vertical steering.

[ 27 ] This is achieved by using a vertically aligned array of slotted waveguide antennas that produce 6 - 10 near simultaneous radar beams at different frequencies, providing a single polarization volumetric scan at 6 elevations in 6 seconds.

[ 25 ] DOW 5's radar does have several drawbacks compared to parabolic antenna radars, primarily considering its range. DOW 5 has a radar scanning range of 10 km, although ideal measurements are much closer at sub 3 km ranges. This is much shorter than other DOWs, which have a maximum radar range of 60 km.

[ 28 ] This makes DOW 5's general application much more narrow, especially on research missions where there is greater uncertainty and sparse road networks.

[ 25 ] In the case of tornadoes, rapid scan radar data is crucial to understand they key processes in the lead up to and during tornadogenesis, what tornadogenesis mode is occurring (non-descending, descending, or simultaneous), what changes in a storm can lead to the sudden strengthening or weakening of a tornado, what processes precede and occur during tornado dissipation, and how factors such as RFD play a role throughout a tornado's lifespan.

[ 27 ] For hurricanes, rapid scanning technology allows for radars to observe and study vortex Rossby waves, tornado-scale vortices within hurricanes that last less than 10 seconds, hurricane boundary layer rolls, and provide an overall better understanding of destructive winds within hurricanes.

DOW 6, along with DOWs 7 and 8, were built on 7500 series International Workstar Trucks , which are more powerful and rugged than the Ford F700 used for DOWs 2 and 3 or the 4300/4700 Workstar series used for other mobile radars including NOXP, MAX, and Smart-R. Mounted on the 7500 series, DOW 6 was able to reach peak speeds of 75 mph and boasted increased acceleration, allowing for faster deployment times.

Doppler on Wheels 7 (DOW 7) was introduced one year after DOW 6, in time for the start of the 2009 storm season and VORTEX 2 research project. Like DOW 6, it was built on a 7500 series International Workstar Truck and featured comparable radar and processing specifications. These differences were primarily present in 2009, where DOW 7 utilized a slightly lower pulselength of 150 - 2000 ns compared to DOW 6's 200 - 2000 ns pulselength.

[ 33 ] There were also some slight differences in the cabin design and layout, but these are negligible and had no impact on the radar's performance.

DOW 7 was retired at the end of 2024 to make way for the next generation of Doppler on Wheels radar trucks. These two new DOWs, named "DOW A" and "DOW B", made several improvements on DOWs 6 and 7 by improving ergonomics, field maintenance, reduced front-sector radar beam blockage, new computers, new transmitters, new antenna control, identical layouts, and new trucks.

[ 35 ] It was first deployed in 2012 with a rapid scan phased array radar previously used on DOW 5, but was shortly thereafter upgraded to carry a single polarization X-Band radar used on DOW 2 and 6.

[ 36 ] In late 2024, the CROW was upgraded again to carry a 1.5 degree beam dual polarization C-band radar, similar to those mounted on SMART-R research vehicles. Like DOW's 6 and 7, the CROW is built on a 7500 series International Workstar Truck .

Because of this, it uses a singular 250 kW generator to power the singular frequency used when scanning.

[ 37 ] While not as advanced as the dual polarization radars on DOWs A and B (previously 6 and 7), it is still incredibly valuable during research deployments and allows for the creation of a 3 X-band radar network that provides more extensive coverage and allows for dual doppler wind velocity analysis.

[ 38 ] This versatility has been utilized on several large NSF research projects, including Plains Elevated Convection at Night 2015 (PECAN), The Great Plains Irrigation Experiment 2018 (GRAINEX), Remote sensing of Electrification, Lighting, And Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations 2018 (RELAMPAGO), and Propagation, Evolution and Rotation in Linear Storms 2022 (PERiLS).

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] It still maintains the frequency based, electronic vertical steering phased array radar that has a peak transmit power of 40 kW, but the radar is now mounted on a small elevator system.

[ 31 ] [ 40 ] This elevator system allows for the radar and its pedestal to be raised while stationary, reducing radar beam blockage from the cabin.

C-band radars are useful because they serve as an intermediate frequency between S-bands and X-bands, gaining some of the benefits of each. C-band radars have longer ranges than X-band radars and are less susceptible to clutter, meaning they can scan through more precipitation and experience less attenuation degradation.

[ 41 ] However, C-band radars have lower overall resolution than X-band radars because of their longer wavelength. This makes C-band radars ideal for high precipitation events like hurricanes , mesoscale convective systems , squall lines , and supercells .

[ 38 ] When paired up with X-band DOWs and the larger COW, the FARM Facility can get a more comprehensive view of severe weather by having both smaller scale high frequency data and a better overall view of precipitation and velocity throughout an entire storm system.

Like the SMART-R mobile C-band radars, the Mini-COW utilizes a beamwidth of 1.5 degrees while also incorporating newer and more advanced technologies.

[ 35 ] These newer technologies allow for the Mini-COW to have a lower pulsewidth range of 0.15 - 1.0 μs compared to the 0.2 - 2.0 μs of SMART-R's 1 and 2, which gives the Mini-COW an overall higher resolution at the slight cost of range.

[ 42 ] This is compensated for by the Mini-COW having a significantly higher peak transmit power of 1 MW compared to the SMART-R's 250 kW, allowing for better precipitation penetration.

[ 37 ] Traditional MQD radars use parabolic antennas smaller than 2.5 meters to fit under bridges and underpasses, meaning mobile radars are generally built to operate from 3 mm W-band wavelengths to 3 cm X-band wavelengths.

[ 37 ] Smaller wavelengths allow for the detection of smaller particles and higher resolutions, but are also much more susceptible to clutter, contamination, and attenuation.

[ 43 ] This forces them to operate at extremely close ranges, limiting deployment opportunities and increasing the chance of unsuccessful data collection missions, especially when studying high precipitation events like supercells. While several W-band and Ka-band mobile doppler radars exist, most notably the UMASS W-band [ 44 ] and Texas Tech TTUKa (Ka-band), [ 45 ] most MQD radars operate within the X-band because it still offers high-frequency performance while suffering from significantly less attenuation and can operate at longer ranges. X-band MQD radars include the DOW Network, NO-XP, MAX, RaXPol , UMass X-Pol, MWR-05XP, and Atmospheric Imaging Radar (AIR).

However, mobile X-band radars still suffer from attenuation, especially in high precipitation systems. This is most noticeable in areas behind the hail core and rear flanking downdraft.

[ 46 ] This can be addressed by using mid-band radars, which have longer wavelengths that are able to penetrate deeper through precipitation. The problem with using mid-band radars for MQD platforms is that they generally require antennas longer than 2.5 m to maintain high resolutions comparable to those of X-band radars.

SMART-R mobile radars chose to compromise overall resolution by fitting a 2.4 m parabolic antenna that has a beamwidth of 1.6 degrees, but those compromises created resolution volumes over 2.5 times larger than those produced by X-band radars with 0.93 degree beamwidths.

[ 37 ] Rear view of C-band radar COW Radar Specifications [ 37 ] Tx Power (Peak) 2x 1000 kW Antenna Dimension 3.8 m Parabolic Beamwidth (3 dB) 1.05° Pulsewidth (μs) 0.167 - 1.0 μs Gatelength 12.5 - 600(0.08 - 2 μs) PRF 500–6000 Hz (+stagger) Polarization dual-frequency, dual-polarization Processing TITAN Products LDR, ZDR, ρHV, V, Z, SW, NCP, IQ Antenna Scan Speed 0 - 24°s - 1 Antenna Scan Modes PPI, RHI, SUR, Solar To avoid making compromises in resolution like the SMART-R, the COW chose to use a 3.8 m parabolic antenna that is powered by a pair of 1 MW generators. This allows for the COW to have high resolution and high precipitation penetration at long ranges, but comes at the COW's ability to move once deployed. The COW's dish and antenna are split in half while being transported, and need to be assembled and disassembled during and after each deployment.

[ 37 ] This is done with a built in crane, and requires several people  operating the COW to help construct and place the antenna onto the pedestal. The process takes 2 hours to set up and another 2 hours to disassemble, meaning it takes a 4 hours in total to deploy. This limitation means the COW can usually be deployed only once per day, but the benefits from large radar allow the COW to fill niches that were previously impossible for quickly deployable radars.

[ 37 ] COW deployment strategies [ edit ] The COW's long range dual polarized radar with a narrow beamwidth of 1.05 degrees makes it ideal for targeted studies where the radar changes locations between IOPs, longer period stationary deployments, and even allows it to serve as a gap filling radar.

[ 37 ] During the PERiLS project, which was a targeted study of QLCS tornadoes that required the COW to change locations every IOP, the radar operated with a scan radius of ~90 km (180 km diameter) and paired with other mobile radars to create a broad radar array network. Because of their greater range and less susceptibility to attenuation, C-band radars made up the backbone of the radar network.

[ 47 ] The COW operated as the central radar, with 2 SMART-R radars being spaced 35 km from the central COW. Higher frequency X-band radars, consisting of DOW 6, DOW 7, NO-XP, MAX, and occasionally DOW 8, functioned as baseline extenders for the SMART-R radars, especially in areas with poor site suitability. The X-band radars were spaced 25 km apart from each other and the SMART-Rs.

[ 47 ] This setup, enabled by the COW, allowed for high resolution radar data across a large geographic area in a way that would previously not be possible.

2022-2023 PERiLS Propagation, Evolution and Rotation in Linear Storms Southeast QLCS Tornadoes Capabilities [ edit ] As of May 2024, the current operational Doppler on Wheels vehicles include the CROW (which consists of the DOW8/RSDOW/Mini-COW), [ 48 ] and the COW (C-band On Wheels, occasionally referred to as the COW1).

The COW consists of a C-band dual-polarization dual-frequency radar system utilizing two 1 MW transmitters set to a 5 cm wavelength configuration.

[ 49 ] The CROW consists of three separate configurations, the DOW8, which utilizes a single-polarization 250 kW X-band transmitter, the RSDOW, which consists of a 7-second rapid-scan passive phased array antenna, utilizing a TWT 40 kW X-band transmitter system, [ 50 ] and the Mini-COW, utilizing a singular 1 MW C-band transmitter capable of 50-second dual-polarization updates.

[ 48 ] As of May 2024, the DOW6 and DOW7 are currently undergoing overhauls with new equipment, including the vehicles themselves, the transmitters, and the computing systems, as well as the integration with the new GURU software.

[ 48 ] The previous iterations of the DOW6 and DOW7 utilized dual-polarization dual-frequency 250 KW X-band transmitters, and were the most powerful mobile X-band systems at the time.

On 27 April 2025, @DOWFacility on X (formerly Twitter) posted "DOW6’s last day. At over 17 years old (that’s 170 in radar years!), DOW6 has joined DOWs 1,2, and 3 in radar heaven.  DOW6 was the longest lived DOW.  Its first research mission was for ROTATE in 2008 and its last research mission was Hurricane Milton in 2024.". DOW 6 has since been retired, and DOW A is its successor.

DOWs are frequently deployed with the tightly integrated surface instrumentation network of the FARM.

[ 49 ] Several instrumented mobile mesonet pickup trucks host in situ weather instrumentation on 3.5-metre (11 ft) masts to complement the remote sensing radars. These mobile mesonets also carry approximately twenty instrumented "PODS", which are ruggedized quickly deployable weather stations designed to survive inside tornadoes, tropical cyclones, and other adverse environments, and a Polenet comprising instrumentation deployed on poles, railings, fences, etc. during hurricane landfalls . An array of up to seven upper air and swarm sounding systems can also be deployed with the DOWs. The DOW fleet is sometimes accompanied by a Mobile Operations and Repair Center (MORC), a large van containing workstations for in-field coordination, data management, and equipment repair.

[ 51 ] Findings [ edit ] DOW data led to the discovery of sub-kilometer hurricane boundary layer rolls, which likely modulate wind damage and may play a key role in hurricane intensification . DOW data revealed some of the most intense tornadic winds ever recorded (the Bridge Creek–Moore tornado , 3 May 1999, the El Reno tornado , 31 May 2013, and the Greenfield, Iowa Tornado , 21 May 2024), [ 52 ] [ 53 ] and the largest tornadic circulation ever documented (the Cimarron City–Mulhall–Perry Tornado , which also occurred on 3 May 1999), [ 54 ] and made the first 3D maps of tornado winds and sub-tornadic vortex winds, and documented intense vortices within lake-effect snow bands. About 70 peer-reviewed scientific publications have used DOW data.

[ citation needed ] DOW data has led to the discovery of the descending reflectivity core , a microscale phenomenon that may aid in tornadogenesis.

Future instrumentation [ edit ] There are currently two major projects planned to expand the FARM's capabilities. The first is the creation of an S-band on Wheels Network (SOWNET) featuring four quickly-deployable S-band radars with 10 cm wavelengths capable of seeing through intense precipitation. These smaller truck-mounted radars would replace a single large S-band radar, allowing for dual-Doppler analyses and quicker deployment times. The second planned project is the Bistatic Adaptable Radar Network (BARN) which will be integrated with existing DOWs and the COW to provide high resolution wind vector observations without the need for multiple, expensive transmitters. These bistatic receivers will consist of small antennas that can be deployed like Pods or mounted onto a Mobile Mesonet or similar vehicle.

Scientists measured the fastest wind speed ever recorded, 318 mph, in one of the tornadoes that hit the suburbs of Oklahoma City on May 3, 1999. [...] The record-setting wind occurred about 7 p.m. near Moore, where the tornado killed four people and destroyed about 250 houses ^ "As the 2024 #BEST field season ends, a glimpse into the data collection during the Greenfield, IA tornado. Peak wind speeds as high as 309–318 mph were calculated in a narrow region 100–160 feet ARL. These are among the highest wind speeds ever determined using DOW data" .
