continuous pointed maps from the pointed circle S 1 to X , equipped with the compact-open topology . Two loops can be multiplied by concatenation . With this operation, the loop space is an A ∞ -space . That is, the multiplication is homotopy-coherently associative .

The set of path components of Ω X , i.e. the set of based-homotopy equivalence classes of based loops in X , is a group , the fundamental group π 1 ( X ).

The iterated loop spaces of X are formed by applying Ω a number of times.

There is an analogous construction for topological spaces without basepoint. The free loop space of a topological space X is the space of maps from the circle S 1 to X with the compact-open topology. The free loop space of X is often denoted by L X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}X} .

As a functor , the free loop space construction is right adjoint to cartesian product with the circle, while the loop space construction is right adjoint to the reduced suspension . This adjunction accounts for much of the importance of loop spaces in stable homotopy theory . (A related phenomenon in computer science is currying , where the cartesian product is adjoint to the hom functor .) Informally this is referred to as Eckmann–Hilton duality .

Eckmann–Hilton duality [ edit ] The loop space is dual to the suspension of the same space; this duality is sometimes called Eckmann–Hilton duality . The basic observation is that [ Σ Σ Z , X ] ≊ ≊ [ Z , Ω Ω X ] {\displaystyle [\Sigma Z,X]\approxeq [Z,\Omega X]} where [ A , B ] {\displaystyle [A,B]} is the set of homotopy classes of maps A → → B {\displaystyle A\rightarrow B} ,
and Σ Σ A {\displaystyle \Sigma A} is the suspension of A, and ≊ ≊ {\displaystyle \approxeq } denotes the natural homeomorphism .  This homeomorphism is essentially that of currying , modulo the quotients needed to convert the products to reduced products.

In general, [ A , B ] {\displaystyle [A,B]} does not have a group structure for arbitrary spaces A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} . However, it can be shown that [ Σ Σ Z , X ] {\displaystyle [\Sigma Z,X]} and [ Z , Ω Ω X ] {\displaystyle [Z,\Omega X]} do have natural group structures when Z {\displaystyle Z} and X {\displaystyle X} are pointed , and the aforementioned isomorphism is of those groups.

[ 1 ] Thus, setting Z = S k − − 1 {\displaystyle Z=S^{k-1}} (the k − − 1 {\displaystyle k-1} sphere) gives the relationship π π k ( X ) ≊ ≊ π π k − − 1 ( Ω Ω X ) {\displaystyle \pi _{k}(X)\approxeq \pi _{k-1}(\Omega X)} .

This follows since the homotopy group is defined as π π k ( X ) = [ S k , X ] {\displaystyle \pi _{k}(X)=[S^{k},X]} and the spheres can be obtained via suspensions of each-other, i.e.

S k = Σ Σ S k − − 1 {\displaystyle S^{k}=\Sigma S^{k-1}} .
