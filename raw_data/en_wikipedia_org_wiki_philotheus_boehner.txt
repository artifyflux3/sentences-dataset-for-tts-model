Alma mater University of Münster Employer St. Bonaventure University Known for Medieval scholarship Philotheus Boehner ( German: [ˈbøːnɐ] ; born Heinrich Boehner ; 17 February 1901 – 22 May 1955) was a member of the Franciscan order known for medieval scholarship.

[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] Boehner was born Heinrich Boehner in Lichtenau, Westphalia .  He entered the Franciscan Order in 1920, and was given the name Philotheus , [ 2 ] the Latin form of the Greek Philotheos , ("friend of God").  In 1927 he was ordained as a priest, although he was so ill with tuberculosis he was not expected to live.  While resting, he began his work as a medieval scholar by translating Étienne Gilson 's work on Saint Bonaventura .  He became a close friend of Gilson in the 1930s.

In the summer of 1940 Boehner moved to Saint Bonaventure College (now a university) where he lectured on Franciscan philosophy, and it was here that he began to build the Franciscan Institute into a center of international Franciscan scholarship.

Works [ edit ] As a result of his work and influence, a large output of scholarly publications were issued from the Franciscan Institute (more than thirty volumes from 1944–55, divided into five series— Philosophy , Theology , Texts, History, and Missiology ).

Probably his most enduring work is the critical edition of William of Ockham 's Opera omnia theologica et philosophica , which he produced with Professor Ernest Moody .
