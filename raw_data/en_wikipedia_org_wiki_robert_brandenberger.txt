Brandenberger (born 1956) is a Swiss-Canadian theoretical cosmologist and a professor of physics at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec , Canada .

Biography [ edit ] Brandenberger completed his undergraduate degree at ETH Zurich , in Switzerland, and went on to receive his Ph.D. from Harvard University .

[ 1 ] He was a postdoctoral student under Stephen Hawking at the DAMTP at Cambridge University .
