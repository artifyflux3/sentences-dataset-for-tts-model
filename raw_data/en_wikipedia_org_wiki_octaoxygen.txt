This allotrope forms at room temperature at pressures between 10 and 96 GPa .

[ 1 ] Preparation and properties [ edit ] As the pressure of oxygen at room temperature is increased above 10 gigapascals (1,500,000 psi), it undergoes a dramatic phase transition to a different allotrope . Its volume decreases significantly, [ 2 ] and it changes color from sky-blue to deep red.

[ 3 ] This ε-phase was discovered in 1979, but the structure has been unclear.  Based on infrared spectroscopy , researchers assumed in 1999 that this phase consists of O 4 molecules in a crystal lattice.

[ 4 ] However, in 2006, it was shown by X-ray crystallography that this stable phase is in fact O 8 .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] No one predicted the structure theoretically: [ 1 ] a rhomboid O 8 cluster [ 7 ] consisting of four O 2 molecules.

In this phase, it exhibits a dark-red color, very strong infrared absorption , and a magnetic collapse .

[ 8 ] It is also stable over a very large pressure domain [ citation needed ] and has been the subject of numerous X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic and theoretical studies. It has been shown to have a monoclinic C2/m symmetry, and its infrared absorption behaviour was attributed to the association of oxygen molecules into larger units. At 11 GPa, the intra-cluster bond length of the O 8 cluster is 0.234 nm, and the inter-cluster distance is 0.266 nm, both longer than the 0.120 nm bond-length in the oxygen molecule O 2 .

[ 1 ] The formation mechanism of the O 8 cluster found in the work is not clear yet, and the researchers think that the charge transfer between oxygen molecules or the magnetic moment of oxygen molecules has a significant role in the formation.

[ 1 ] Potential applications [ edit ] Liquid oxygen is already used as an oxidant in rockets , and it has been speculated that octaoxygen could make an even better oxidant, because of its higher energy density .

[ 9 ] Researchers think that this structure may greatly influence the structural investigation of elements.
