It has its roots in The Institution For The Diffusion Of Useful Knowledge , founded in 1828. Previously known as the University of Central Lancashire , Harris Art College , Preston Polytechnic and Lancashire Polytechnic, in 1992 it was granted university status by the Privy Council . The university is the 19th largest in the UK in terms of student numbers.

[ 3 ] In December 2024, the university received approval from the Office for Students to change its name to the University of Lancashire , with the rebrand intended to come into effect by September 2025.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] History [ edit ] The Institution for the Diffusion of Knowledge was founded in 1828 by Joseph Livesey 's Temperance Society . The society was born from a pledge made by seven Preston working men (whose names can be seen on a plaque in the university's library) to never again consume alcohol.

[ 6 ] The institute was housed in a classical-revivalist building on Cannon Street, before eventually expanding under the endowment of a local lawyer Edmund Robert Harris , who died in 1877. The expansion brought with it several new buildings and houses in the nearby Regent Street were purchased and demolished as a consequence. The institute became a regional centre for the arts and sciences.

As part of Queen Victoria 's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 1897, the institute's trustees paid the Victorian / Edwardian architect Henry Cheers to design the "Victoria Jubilee Technical School" (later known as the Harris Institute and now known as the Harris Building), to be built on Corporation Street. The foundation stone was laid in July 1895.  Its goal was to provide local youths with a technical education in all areas. The building was progressive for the period, being powered entirely by electricity.

The institute existed in this state until 1932, when it changed its name to become the Harris Art College. It underwent further expansion and in 1952, and became the Harris College. In 1973, this became Preston Polytechnic, then the Lancashire Polytechnic in 1984. In 1992, full university status was awarded, and the University of Central Lancashire came into existence. The first chancellor of the university was Sir Francis Kennedy, and he was succeeded in 2001 by Sir Richard Evans . In 2016, Ranvir Singh became the new chancellor of the university.

The journalism division, now part of the School of Journalism and Media, is one of the oldest in the country, opening as part of the Harris College in 1962. In 1991, it became one of the first to teach journalism undergraduate degrees, with a strong emphasis on practical work.

In 2012, the University of Lancashire announced a partnership with the BAE Systems, and four other north-western universities ( Liverpool , Salford , Lancaster and Manchester ) in order to work on the Gamma Programme which aims to develop "autonomous systems". According to the University of Liverpool when referring to the programme, "autonomous systems are technology based solutions that replace humans in tasks that are mundane, dangerous and dirty, or detailed and precise, across sectors, including aerospace, nuclear, automotive and petrochemicals".

[ 7 ] In 2013, the School of Dentistry and the School of Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education merged to create the School of Medicine and Dentistry.

The university sponsored the now-defunct Wigan UTC , a university technical college which opened in September 2013.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] The university applied for permission to change its name to the University of Lancashire in January 2024.

[ 10 ] [ 4 ] 90% of respondents to the official consultation argued that the name change was confusing, particularly given the existence of Lancaster University . The Office for Students found that the change had "the potential to be confusing for particular groups" but ultimately approved it, citing a need to "protect the institutional autonomy of English higher education providers, and the need to encourage competition".
