Pritchard [ citation needed ] William Daniel Phillips [ citation needed ] Julia Steinberger [ 1 ] Website physics .mit .edu /faculty /daniel-kleppner / Daniel Kleppner (December 16, 1932 – June 16, 2025) was an American physicist who was the Lester Wolfe Professor Emeritus of Physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and co-founder and co-director of the MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms. His areas of science included atomic, molecular, and optical physics , and his research interests included experimental atomic physics , laser spectroscopy , and high precision measurements.

[ 2 ] Together with Robert J. Kolenkow , he authored a popular textbook An Introduction to Mechanics for advanced students.

[ 3 ] Early life [ edit ] Kleppner was born in New York City on December 16, 1932, and grew up in nearby New Rochelle, New York .

[ 4 ] His father was Otto Kleppner, founder of an advertising agency.

[ 5 ] Education and career [ edit ] Kleppner graduated from Williams College with a B.A. in 1953 in Williamstown, Massachusetts . He also attended Cambridge University in England with a B.A. in 1955, and Harvard University , he attended the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , with a Ph.D. in 1959.

[ 6 ] In the 1950s, Kleppner became a physics doctoral student at Harvard University, where he worked under Norman Ramsey .
Here, Kleppner took the concepts behind an ammonia maser and applied them to a hydrogen maser , which became his Ph.D.

thesis .
Kleppner did important research into Rydberg atoms .

[ 7 ] Later, he became interested in creating a hydrogen Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). In 1995, a group of researchers, including Kleppner's former students, made a BEC using rubidium atoms.
It was not until 1998 that Kleppner and Tom Greytak finally created a hydrogen BEC.

[ 8 ] Personal life and death [ edit ] Kleppner married Beatrice Spencer in 1958, and they had three children.

[ 4 ] They were longtime residents of Belmont, Massachusetts .

[ 9 ] After falling ill while visiting family in California, Kleppner died at a hospital in Palo Alto on June 16, 2025, at the age of 92.

[ 4 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Honors and awards [ edit ] Kleppner was the recipient of many awards including 1991 Lilienfeld Prize , 1991 William F. Meggers Award , [ 12 ] 1997 Oersted Medal , 2005 Wolf Prize in Physics , [ 13 ] 2006 National Medal of Science 2007 Frederic Ives Medal , 2014 Benjamin Franklin Medal , [ 14 ] and 2017 American Physical Society Medal for Exceptional Achievement in Research.

[ 15 ] Within MIT he won the institute's prestigious James R. Killian, Jr. Faculty Achievement Award, conferring him the title of Killian Award Lecturer [ 16 ] for 1995-1996.

[ 17 ] He was elected the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986, [ 18 ] a Fellow of OSA in 1992, [ 19 ] the French Academy of Sciences in 2004, [ 20 ] and the American Philosophical Society in 2007.

[ 21 ] Books [ edit ] Kleppner and Robert J. Kolenkow wrote An Introduction to Mechanics in 1973. 40 years later, Kleppner and Kolenkow returned to edit and publish a second edition in 2013.
