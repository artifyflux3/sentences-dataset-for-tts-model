This is the prototype of an abelian category : [ 1 ] indeed, every small abelian category can be embedded in Ab .

[ 2 ] Properties [ edit ] The zero object of Ab is the trivial group {0} which consists only of its neutral element .

The monomorphisms in Ab are the injective group homomorphisms, the epimorphisms are the surjective group homomorphisms, and the isomorphisms are the bijective group homomorphisms.

Ab is a full subcategory of Grp , the category of all groups . The main difference between Ab and Grp is that the sum of two homomorphisms f and g between abelian groups is again a group homomorphism: ( f + g )( x + y ) = f ( x + y ) + g ( x + y ) = f ( x ) + f ( y ) + g ( x ) + g ( y ) = f ( x ) + g ( x ) + f ( y ) + g ( y ) = ( f + g )( x ) + ( f + g )( y ) The third equality requires the group to be abelian. This addition of morphism turns Ab into a preadditive category , and because the direct sum of finitely many abelian groups yields a biproduct , we indeed have an additive category .

In Ab , the notion of kernel in the category theory sense coincides with kernel in the algebraic sense , i.e. the categorical kernel of the morphism f : A → B is the subgroup K of A defined by K = { x ∈ A : f ( x ) = 0}, together with the inclusion homomorphism i : K → A . The same is true for cokernels ; the cokernel of f is the quotient group C = B / f ( A ) together with the natural projection p : B → C . (Note a further crucial difference between Ab and Grp : in Grp it can happen that f ( A ) is not a normal subgroup of B , and that therefore the quotient group B / f ( A ) cannot be formed.) With these concrete descriptions of kernels and cokernels, it is quite easy to check that Ab is indeed an abelian category .

The forgetful functor from Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } Mod to Ab that sends a Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } -module ( M , + , ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle (M,+,\cdot )} to its underlying abelian group ( M , + ) {\displaystyle (M,+)} and the functor from Ab to Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } that sends an abelian group ( G , + ) {\displaystyle (G,+)} to the Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } -module ( G , + , ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle (G,+,\cdot )} obtained by setting k ⋅ ⋅ g := g k {\displaystyle k\cdot g:=g^{k}} define an isomorphism of categories .

The product in Ab is given by the product of groups , formed by taking the Cartesian product of the underlying sets and performing the group operation componentwise. Because Ab has kernels, one can then show that Ab is a complete category . The coproduct in Ab is given by the direct sum; since Ab has cokernels, it follows that Ab is also cocomplete .

We have a forgetful functor Ab → Set which assigns to each abelian group the underlying set , and to each group homomorphism the underlying function . This functor is faithful , and therefore Ab is a concrete category . The forgetful functor has a left adjoint (which associates to a given set the free abelian group with that set as basis) but does not have a right adjoint.

Taking direct limits in Ab is an exact functor . Since the group of integers Z serves as a generator , the category Ab is therefore a Grothendieck category ; indeed it is the prototypical example of a Grothendieck category.

An object in Ab is injective if and only if it is a divisible group ; it is projective if and only if it is a free abelian group . The category has a projective generator ( Z ) and an injective cogenerator ( Q / Z ).

Given two abelian groups A and B , their tensor product A ⊗ B is defined; it is again an abelian group. With this notion of product, Ab is a closed symmetric monoidal category .

Ab is not a topos since e.g. it has a zero object.
