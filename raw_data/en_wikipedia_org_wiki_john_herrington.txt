He completed two years of training and evaluation, and qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Herrington was assigned to the Flight Support Branch of the Astronaut Office where he served as a member of the Astronaut Support Personnel team responsible for Shuttle launch preparations and post-landing operations.

Spaceflight [ edit ] Herrington making a spacewalk during the STS-113 mission Main article: STS-113 Herrington was selected as a mission specialist for STS-113, the sixteenth Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station .

Endeavour was launched from Kennedy Space Center on November 23, 2002, to deliver the P1 Truss segment, which provides structural support for the Space Station radiators.

Endeavour also delivered a new Expedition 6 crew to the Station, returning to Earth on December 7, 2002, with the Expedition 5 crew ending their 6-month stay in space. The total mission duration was 13 days, 18 hours and 47 minutes.

During the mission Herrington performed three spacewalks , totaling 19 hours and 55 minutes.  These spacewalks are commemorated on the reverse of the 2019 Sacagawea dollar coin.

[ 6 ] Underwater laboratory [ edit ] In July 2004, Herrington served as the commander of the NEEMO 6 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory , living and working underwater for ten days.

[ 7 ] Herrington retired from the Navy and NASA in July 2005.

, where he replaced Mitchell Burnside Clapp. He was also to serve as the pilot of the XP Spaceplane .  Herrington also provides part-time support for the Center for Space Studies at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs .

In December 2007, Herrington resigned from Rocketplane, and stated that he plans to continue doing public speaking engagements as well as work with the Chickasaw Nation.
