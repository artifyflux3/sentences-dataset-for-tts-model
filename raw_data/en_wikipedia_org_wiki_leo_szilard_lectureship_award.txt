[ 2 ] It is given internationally in commemoration of physicist Leo Szilard .

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] "In the year's of Szilard's life and activity it became clearer than ever before how great the responsibility of scientists is to the society.  And, to a large extent, it is due to Szilard that this awareness began to spread in the scientific community." - Andrei Sakharov [ 3 ] It is often awarded to physicists early in their careers who are active in areas such as environmental issues , arms control , or science policy . As of 2015 [update] the recipient is given $3,000 plus $2,000 travel expenses and is expected to lecture at an APS meeting and at educational or research laboratories, to promote awareness of their activities.

[ 2 ] Recipients [ edit ] The award is given yearly and was first presented in 1974.
