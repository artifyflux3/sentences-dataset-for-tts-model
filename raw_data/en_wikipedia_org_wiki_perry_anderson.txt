Background and early life [ edit ] Anderson was born in London on 11 September 1938.

[ 1 ] His father, James Carew O'Gorman Anderson (1893–1946), known as Séamas, an official with the Chinese Maritime Customs , was born into an Anglo-Irish family, the younger son of Brigadier-General Sir Francis Anderson, of Ballydavid , County Waterford .

[ 2 ] He was descended from the Anderson family of Ardbrake, Bothriphnie , Scotland, who had settled in Ireland in the early 18th century.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Anderson's mother, Veronica Beatrice Mary Bigham, was English, [ 6 ] the daughter of Trevor Bigham , who was the Deputy Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police , 1914–1931. Anderson's grandmother, Frances, Lady Anderson, belonged to the Gaelic Gorman clan of County Clare and was the daughter of the Irish Home Rule Member of Parliament Major Purcell O'Gorman , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] himself the son of Nicholas Purcell O'Gorman who had been involved with the Republican Society of United Irishmen during the 1798 Rebellion , later becoming Secretary of the Catholic Association in the 1820s.

[ 7 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Anderson's father had previously been married to the novelist Stella Benson , and it was after her death in 1933 that he married again.

[ 3 ] Anderson was educated at Eton and Worcester College, Oxford , where he took his first degree.

[ 12 ] Early in his life, Anderson made a brief foray into rock criticism , writing under the pseudonym Richard Merton.

[ 13 ] Career [ edit ] In 1962 Anderson became editor of the New Left Review , a position he held for twenty years.

[ 14 ] As scholars of the New Left began to reassess their canon in the mid-1970s, Anderson provided an influential perspective.

[ 14 ] He published two major volumes of analytical history in 1974: Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism focuses on the creation and endurance of feudal social formations , while Lineages of the Absolutist State examines monarchical absolutism . Within their respective topics they are each vast in scope, assessing the whole history of Europe from classical times to the nineteenth century. The books achieved an instant prominence for Anderson, whose wide-ranging analysis synthesised elements of history, philosophy, and political theory .

[ 14 ] In the 1980s, Anderson took office as a professor at the New School for Social Research in New York .

[ 14 ] He returned as editor at NLR in 2000 for three more years, and after his retirement continued to serve on the journal's editorial committee. As of 2019, he has continued to make contributions to the London Review of Books , [ 15 ] and pursued teaching as a Distinguished Professor of History and Sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles .

Find sources: "Perry Anderson" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( January 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Anderson bore the brunt of the disapproval of E. P. Thompson in the latter's The Poverty of Theory , in a controversy during the late 1970s over the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser , and the use of history and theory in the politics of the Left. In the mid-1960s, Thompson wrote an essay for the annual Socialist Register that rejected Anderson's view of aristocratic dominance of Britain's historical trajectory, as well as Anderson's seeming preference for continental European theorists over radical British traditions and empiricism . Anderson delivered two responses to Thompson's polemics , first in an essay in New Left Review (January–February 1966) called "Socialism and Pseudo-Empiricism", [ 17 ] and then in a more conciliatory yet ambitious overview, Arguments within English Marxism (1980).

While Anderson faced many attacks in his native Britain for favouring continental European philosophers over British thinkers, he did not spare Western European Marxists from criticism, such as in his Considerations on Western Marxism (1976). Nevertheless, many of his assaults were delivered against postmodernist currents in continental Europe. In his book In the Tracks of Historical Materialism , Anderson depicts Paris as the new capital of intellectual reaction.

Prudence was displayed in the use of a pseudonym for two Andersonian forays onto the terrain of rock music, under the signature of Richard Merton, who opted for the Stones rather than the Beatles, and the Beach Boys rather than Bob Dylan.
