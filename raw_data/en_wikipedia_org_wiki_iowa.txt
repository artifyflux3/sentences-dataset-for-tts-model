ə w ə / ⓘ EYE -ə-wə ) [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] is a state in the upper Midwestern region of the United States . It borders the Mississippi River to the east and the Missouri River and Big Sioux River to the west; Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to the east and southeast, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the northwest, and Minnesota to the north.

Iowa is the 26th largest in total area and the 31st most populous of the 50 U.S. states , with a population of 3.19 million.

[ 11 ] The state's capital , most populous city , and largest metropolitan area fully located within the state is Des Moines . A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.

[ 12 ] Other metropolitan statistical areas in Iowa include Iowa City , Cedar Rapids , Waterloo-Cedar Falls , Ames , Dubuque , Sioux City , and the Iowa portion of the Quad Cities . Iowa is home to 940 small towns, though its population is increasingly urbanized as small communities and rural areas decline in population.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] During the 18th and early 19th centuries, Iowa was a part of French Louisiana and Spanish Louisiana ; its state flag is patterned after the flag of France . After the Louisiana Purchase , pioneers laid the foundation for an agriculture-based economy in the heart of the Corn Belt .

[ 15 ] In the latter half of the 20th century, Iowa's agricultural economy began to transition to a diversified economy of advanced manufacturing, processing, financial services , information technology , biotechnology , and green energy production.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] Politically, Iowa is notable for the Iowa Caucuses , an influential event in national politics, as well as its high levels of voter turnout and foundational leadership in civil rights including early adoption or support of black suffrage .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Iowa's standard of living is ranked highly on metrics such as governance, education, infrastructure, and safety.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Etymology [ edit ] Like many other states , Iowa takes its name from its predecessor, Iowa Territory , whose name in turn is derived from the Iowa River , and ultimately from the ethnonym of the indigenous Ioway people .
The Ioway are a Chiwere -speaking Siouan Nation , who were once part of the Ho-Chunk Confederation that inhabited the area now corresponding to several Midwest states. The Ioway were one of the many Native American nations whose territory comprised the future state of Iowa before the time of European colonization.

[ 22 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Iowa See also: Native American tribes in Iowa Prehistory [ edit ] Main articles: Iowa archaeology and American Indians of Iowa Excavation of the 3,800-year-old Edgewater Park Site When Indigenous peoples of the Americas first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, Native Americans were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), Native Americans adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.

[ 23 ] More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period , Native Americans in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.

[ 23 ] The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous native American tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric Oneota include the Dakota , Ho-Chunk , Ioway , and Otoe . Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the Illiniwek , Meskwaki , Omaha , and Sauk .

[ 23 ] Early colonization and trade, 1673–1808 [ edit ] Main articles: New France , Louisiana (New France) , French and Indian War , Treaty of Paris (1763) , New Spain , Louisiana (New Spain) , Treaty of Aranjuez (1801) , Louisiana Purchase , District of Louisiana , and Louisiana Territory Iowa in 1718 with the modern state area highlighted The first known European explorers to document Iowa were Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet who traveled the Mississippi River in 1673 documenting several Indigenous villages on the Iowa side.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] The area of Iowa was claimed for France and remained a French territory until 1763. The French, before their impending defeat in the French and Indian War , transferred ownership to their ally, Spain.

[ 26 ] Spain practiced very loose control over the Iowa region, granting trading licenses to French and British traders, who established trading posts along the Mississippi and Des Moines Rivers .

[ 24 ] Iowa was part of a territory known as La Louisiane or Louisiana , and European traders were interested in lead and furs obtained by Indigenous people. The Sauk and Meskwaki effectively controlled trade on the Mississippi in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Among the early traders on the Mississippi were Julien Dubuque , Robert de la Salle , and Paul Marin .

[ 24 ] Along the Missouri River at least five French and English trading houses were built before 1808.

[ 27 ] In 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte took control of Louisiana from Spain in a treaty .

[ 28 ] After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase , Congress divided the Louisiana Purchase into two parts—the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana, with present-day Iowa falling in the latter. The Indiana Territory , created in 1800, exercised jurisdiction over this portion of the District; William Henry Harrison was its first governor. Much of Iowa was mapped by Zebulon Pike in 1805, [ 29 ] but it was not until the construction of Fort Madison in 1808 that the U.S. established tenuous military control over the region.

[ 30 ] War of 1812 and unstable U.S. control [ edit ] Main article: Missouri Territory Fort Madison was built to control trade and establish U.S. dominance over the Upper Mississippi, but it was poorly designed and disliked by the Sauk and Meskwaki, many of whom allied with the British, who had not abandoned claims to the territory.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] Fort Madison was defeated by British-supported Indigenous people in 1813 during the War of 1812 , and Fort Shelby in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin , also fell to the British.

Black Hawk took part in the siege of Fort Madison.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Another small military outpost was established along the Mississippi River in present-day Bellevue . This poorly situated stockade was similarly attacked by hundreds of Indigenous people in 1813, but was successfully defended and later abandoned until settlers returned to the area in the mid-1830s.

[ 34 ] After the war, the U.S. re-established control of the region through the construction of Fort Armstrong , Fort Snelling in Minnesota , and Fort Atkinson in Nebraska .

[ 35 ] Indian removal, 1814–1832 [ edit ] See also: Indian removal The United States encouraged settlement of the east side of the Mississippi and removal of Indians to the west.

[ 36 ] A disputed 1804 treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison (then governor of the Indiana Territory ) that surrendered much of Illinois to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 Black Hawk War .

[ 37 ] The Sauk and Meskwaki were forced to sell some of their land in the Mississippi Valley to the U.S. in 1832 in the Black Hawk Purchase Treaty [ 38 ] and sold their remaining land in Iowa in 1842, most of them moving to a reservation in Kansas.

[ 37 ] In 1837, some the Potawatomi from Illinois were resettled in Iowa, while many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa ; the Meskwaki Settlement remains to this day.

[ 39 ] In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskwaki to purchase the land.

[ 40 ] The federal government, in contrast, used treaties to force the Ho-Chunk and the Dakota from Iowa by 1848 [ 41 ] and 1858, [ 42 ] respectively. Western Iowa around modern Council Bluffs was used as an Indian Reservation for members of the Council of Three Fires .

[ 43 ] U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832–1860 [ edit ] Main articles: Michigan Territory , Wisconsin Territory , Organic act § List of organic acts , Iowa Territory , Admission to the Union , and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union Iowa Territorial Seal Bellevue along the Mississippi, 1848 The first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833.

[ 44 ] Primarily, they were families from Ohio , Pennsylvania , New York , Indiana , Kentucky , and Virginia who settled along the western banks of the Mississippi River , founding the modern day cities of Dubuque and Bellevue near the site of Julien Dubuque's 1785–1810 lead mining operation.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] On July 4, 1838, the U.S. Congress established the Territory of Iowa . President Martin Van Buren appointed Robert Lucas governor of the territory, which at the time had 22 counties and a population of 23,242.

[ 47 ] Almost immediately after Iowa achieved territorial status, a clamor arose for statehood. On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President James K. Polk signed its admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, with the state's boundary issues resolved and most of its land purchased from Natives, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.

[ 48 ] Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs. The first and second Iowa State Fairs were held in the more developed eastern part of the state at Fairfield . The first fair was held October 25–27, 1854, at a cost of around $323. Thereafter, the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines. The State Fair has been held annually since then, except for a few exceptions: 1898 due to the Spanish–American War and the World's Fair being held in nearby Omaha, Nebraska ; from 1942 to 1945, due to World War II , as the fairgrounds were being used as an army supply depot; and in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic .

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] Civil War, 1861–1865 [ edit ] Main article: Iowa in the American Civil War Iowa supported the Union during the Civil War , voting heavily for Abraham Lincoln , though there was an antiwar " Copperhead " movement in the state, caused partially by a drop in crop prices caused by the war.

[ 51 ] There were no battles in the state, although the Battle of Athens , Missouri, 1861, was fought just across the Des Moines River from Croton, Iowa , and shots from the battle landed in Iowa. Iowa sent large supplies of food to the armies and the eastern cities.

[ 52 ] Much of Iowa's support for the Union can be attributed to Samuel J. Kirkwood , its first wartime governor. Of a total population of 675,000, about 116,000 men were subjected to military duty. Iowa contributed proportionately more soldiers to Civil War military service than did any other state, north or south, sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, over one-sixth of whom were killed before the Confederates surrendered at Appomattox .

[ 52 ] Most fought in the great campaigns in the Mississippi Valley and in the South .

[ 53 ] Iowa troops fought at Wilson's Creek in Missouri , Pea Ridge in Arkansas , Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and Rossville Gap as well as Vicksburg, Iuka, and Corinth. They served with the Army of the Potomac in Virginia and fought under Union General Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley . Many died and were buried at Andersonville. They marched on General Nathaniel Banks ' ill-starred expedition to the Red River. Twenty-seven Iowans have been awarded the Medal of Honor , the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government, which was first awarded in the Civil War.

[ 54 ] Iowa had several brigadier generals and four major generals— Grenville Mellen Dodge , Samuel R. Curtis , Francis J. Herron , and Frederick Steele —and saw many of its generals go on to state and national prominence following the war.

[ 52 ] Agricultural expansion, 1865–1930 [ edit ] Following the Civil War, Iowa's population continued to grow dramatically, from 674,913 people in 1860 [ 55 ] to 1,624,615 in 1880.

[ 56 ] The American Civil War briefly brought higher profits.

[ 57 ] In 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity, which lasted until the end of the war.

[ 57 ] In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first industries developed in the 1830s, [ 58 ] which were mainly for processing materials grown in the area, [ 59 ] Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations.

Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930–1985 [ edit ] The transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The Great Depression and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization. The period after World War II witnessed a particular increase in manufacturing operations.

[ 60 ] In 1975, Governor Robert D. Ray petitioned President Ford to allow Iowa to accept and resettle Tai Dam refugees fleeing the Indochina War.

[ 61 ] An exception was required for this resettlement as State Dept policy at the time forbid resettlement of large groups of refugees in concentrated communities; an exception was ultimately granted and 1200 Tai Dam were resettled in Iowa. Since then Iowa has accepted thousands of refugees from Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Bhutan, and Burma.

[ 62 ] The farm crisis of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing poverty not seen since the Depression.

[ 63 ] The crisis spurred a major, decade-long population decline.

[ 64 ] Reemergence as a mixed economy, 1985–present [ edit ] After bottoming out in the 1980s, Iowa's economy began to reduce its dependence on agriculture. By the early 21st century, it was characterized by a mix of manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services.

[ 65 ] The population of Iowa has increased at a slower rate than the U.S. as a whole since at least the 1900 census , [ 66 ] though Iowa now has a predominantly urban population.

[ 67 ] The Iowa Economic Development Authority, created in 2011 has replaced the Iowa Department of Economic Development and its annual reports are a source of economic information.

[ 68 ] Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Iowa Boundaries [ edit ] See also: List of counties in Iowa Topography of Iowa, with counties and major streams Iowa is bordered by the Mississippi River on the east along with the Missouri River and the Big Sioux River on the west. The northern boundary is a line along 43 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude.

[ 69 ] [ b ] The southern border is the Des Moines River and a not-quite-straight line along approximately 40 degrees 35 minutes north, as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in Missouri v. Iowa (1849) after a standoff between Missouri and Iowa known as the Honey War .

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] Iowa is the only state whose east and west borders are formed almost entirely by rivers.

[ 72 ] Carter Lake, Iowa , is the only city in the state located west of the Missouri River.

[ 73 ] Iowa has 99 counties , but 100 county seats because Lee County has two. The state capital, Des Moines , is in Polk County .

[ 74 ] Geology and terrain [ edit ] DeSoto Lake at DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge Iowa terrain Iowa's bedrock geology generally decreases in age from east to west. In northwest Iowa, Cretaceous bedrock can be 74 million years old; in eastern Iowa Cambrian bedrock dates to c. 500 million years ago.

[ 75 ] The oldest radiometrically dated bedrock in the state is the 2.9 billion year old Otter Creek Layered Mafic Complex.

Precambrian rock is exposed only in the northwest of the state.

[ 76 ] Iowa can be divided into eight landforms based on glaciation , soils , topography , and river drainage.

[ 77 ] Loess hills lie along the western border of the state, some of which are several hundred feet thick.

[ 78 ] Northeast Iowa along the Upper Mississippi River is part of the Driftless Area , consisting of steep hills and valleys which appear as mountainous.

[ 79 ] Several natural lakes exist, most notably Spirit Lake , West Okoboji Lake , and East Okoboji Lake in northwest Iowa ( see Iowa Great Lakes ). To the east lies Clear Lake . Man-made lakes include Lake Odessa, [ 80 ] Saylorville Lake , Lake Red Rock , Coralville Lake , Lake MacBride, and Rathbun Lake. Before European settlement, 4 to 6 million acres of the state was covered with wetlands; about 95% of these wetlands have since been drained.

[ 81 ] Ecology and environment [ edit ] Main article: Environment of Iowa Landforms of Iowa Iowa's natural vegetation is tallgrass prairie and savanna in upland areas, with dense forest and wetlands in flood plains and protected river valleys, and pothole wetlands in northern prairie areas.

[ 77 ] Most of Iowa is used for agriculture; crops cover 60% of the state, grasslands (mostly pasture and hay with some prairie and wetland) cover 30%, and forests cover 7%; urban areas and water cover another 1% each.

[ 82 ] The southern part of Iowa is categorized as the Central forest-grasslands transition ecoregion.

[ 83 ] The Northern, drier part of Iowa is categorized as part of the Central tall grasslands .

[ 84 ] There is a dearth of natural areas in Iowa; less than 1% of the tallgrass prairie that once covered most of Iowa remains intact; only about 5% of the state's prairie pothole wetlands remain, and most of the original forest has been lost.

[ 85 ] As of 2005 [update] Iowa ranked 49th of U.S. states in public land holdings.

[ 86 ] Threatened or endangered animals in Iowa include the interior least tern , piping plover , Indiana bat , pallid sturgeon , the Iowa Pleistocene land snail , Higgins' eye pearly mussel , and the Topeka shiner .

[ 87 ] Endangered or threatened plants include western prairie fringed orchid , eastern prairie fringed orchid , Mead's milkweed , prairie bush clover , and northern wild monkshood .

[ 88 ] The explosion in the number of high-density livestock facilities in Iowa has led to increased rural water contamination and a decline in air quality.

[ 89 ] Other factors negatively affecting Iowa's environment include the extensive use of older coal-fired power plants , [ 90 ] fertilizer and pesticide runoff from crop production, [ 91 ] and diminishment of the Jordan Aquifer .

[ 92 ] The 2020–2023 North American drought has affected Iowa particularly: As of January 2024, Iowa was in its 187th consecutive week of at least moderate drought , the longest stretch since the 1950s. 96% of areas are affected by drought.

[ 93 ] Climate [ edit ] Further information: Climate change in Iowa Köppen climate types of Iowa, using 1991–2020 climate normals Iowa annual rainfall, in inches; as of 2009 Iowa has a humid continental climate throughout the state ( Köppen climate classification Dfa ) with extremes of both heat and cold. The average annual temperature at Des Moines is 50 °F (10 °C); for some locations in the north, such as Mason City, the figure is about 45 °F (7 °C), while Keokuk , on the Mississippi River , averages 52 °F (11 °C).

[ 94 ] Snowfall is common, with Des Moines getting about 26 days of snowfall a year, and other places, such as Shenandoah , getting about 11 days of snowfall in a year.

[ 95 ] Spring ushers in the beginning of the severe weather season. As of 2008, Iowa averaged about 50 days of thunderstorm activity per year.

[ 96 ] As of 2015, the 30-year annual average of tornadoes in Iowa was 47.

[ 97 ] In 2008 , twelve people were killed by tornadoes in Iowa, making it the deadliest year since 1968 and also the second most tornadoes in a year with 105, matching the total from 2001.

[ 98 ] Iowa summers are known for heat and humidity, with daytime temperatures sometimes near 90 °F (32 °C) and occasionally exceeding 100 °F (38 °C). Average winters in the state have been known to drop well below freezing, even dropping below −18 °F (−28 °C). As of 2018, Iowa's all-time hottest temperature of 118 °F (48 °C) was recorded at Keokuk on July 20, 1934, during a nationwide heat wave; [ 99 ] as of 2014, the all-time lowest temperature of −47 °F (−44 °C) was recorded in Washta on January 12, 1912.

[ 107 ] The pattern of precipitation across Iowa is seasonal with more rain falling in the summer months. Virtually statewide, the driest month is January or February, while the wettest month is June due to frequent showers and thunderstorms, some of which produce hail, damaging winds or tornadoes. In Des Moines, roughly in the center of the state, over two-thirds of the 34.72 inches (88.2 cm) of rain falls from April through September, and about half the average annual precipitation falls from May through August peaking in June.

[ 108 ] Settlements [ edit ] Percent population changes by counties in Iowa, 2000–2009; dark green counties have gains of more than 5% [ 109 ] See also: List of cities in Iowa Iowa's population is more urban than rural, with 61 percent living in urban areas in 2000, a trend that began in the early 20th century.

[ 67 ] Urban counties in Iowa grew 8.5% from 2000 to 2008, while rural counties declined by 4.2%.

[ 110 ] The shift from rural to urban has caused population increases in more urbanized counties such as Dallas , Johnson , Linn , Polk , and Scott , at the expense of more rural counties.

[ 14 ] Iowa, in common with other Midwestern states (especially Kansas , Nebraska , North Dakota , and South Dakota ), is feeling the brunt of rural flight , although the population of Iowa has been increasing since approximately 1990. Some smaller communities, such as Denison and Storm Lake , have mitigated this population loss through gains in immigrant laborers.

[ 111 ] Another demographic problem for Iowa is brain drain , in which educated young adults leave the state in search of better prospects in higher education or employment. During the 1990s, Iowa had the second highest exodus rate for single, educated young adults, second only to North Dakota.

Smaller numbers of Greeks and Italians are scattered in Iowa's metropolitan areas. The majority of Hispanics in Iowa are of Mexican origin .

African Americans , who constitute around 2% of Iowa's population, didn't live in the state in any appreciable numbers until the early 20th century. Many blacks worked in the coal-mining industry of southern Iowa. Others blacks migrated to Waterloo, Davenport, and Des Moines, where the black population remained substantial in the early 21st century.

[ 123 ] The African-American population in Des Moines experienced a significant increase with the establishment of the Colored Officers Training Camp at Fort Des Moines in 1917. Following the conclusion of World War I in 1918, numerous African-American families made the decision to remain in Des Moines. This marked the inception of a thriving community that eventually became a residence for numerous African-American leaders.

[ 124 ] There is one federally recognized tribe in Iowa, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa , and in 2020, 14,486 identified as being Native American alone, and 41,472 did in combination with one or more other races.

Iowa is the nation's largest producer of ethanol and corn and some years is the largest grower of soybeans. In 2008, the 92,600 farms in Iowa produced 19% of the nation's corn, 17% of the soybeans, 30% of the hogs, and 14% of the eggs.

King represented the old fifth congressional district .

Political parties [ edit ] Main article: Political party strength in Iowa Samuel J. Kirkwood , founder of the Iowa Republican Party, abolitionist, and Iowa's Civil War Governor In Iowa, the term "political party" refers to political organizations which have received two percent or more of the votes cast for president or governor in the "last preceding general election". Iowa recognizes three political parties—the Republican Party , the Democratic Party , and the Libertarian Party .

[ 277 ] The Libertarian Party obtained official political party status in 2017 as a result of presidential candidate Gary Johnson receiving 3.8% of the Iowa vote in the 2016 general election .

[ 278 ] Third parties , officially termed "nonparty political organizations", can appear on the ballot as well. Four of these have had candidates on the ballot in Iowa since 2004 for various positions: the Constitution Party , the Green Party , the Pirate Party , and the Socialist Workers Party .

[ 279 ] [ 280 ] Voter trends [ edit ] See also: United States presidential elections in Iowa As a result of the 2010 elections, each party controlled one house of the Iowa General Assembly : the House had a Republican majority, while the Senate had a Democratic majority. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans gained control of the Senate. Incumbent Democratic governor Chet Culver was defeated in 2010 by Republican Terry Branstad , who had served as governor from 1983 to 1999. On December 14, 2015, Branstad became the longest serving governor in U.S. history, serving (at that time) 20 years, 11 months, and 3 days; eclipsing George Clinton , who served 21 years until 1804.

[ 281 ] Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds succeeded him on May 24, 2017, following Branstad's appointment as U.S. Ambassador to China.

In previous eras, Democratic and Republican parties had a balance in state politics and federal representation. By 2024, the two became dominated by the Republican Party. Factors include younger people leaving for more urbanized, more Democratic-leaning states, as well as homogenization of rural voters in the Midwest and in other regions.

[ 282 ] Party registration as of July 1, 2025: [ 283 ] Party Total voters Percentage Republican 775,233 36.64% No affiliation 724,907 34.26% Democratic 595,903 28.17% Other 19,590 0.93% Total 2,115,633 100.00% Presidential caucus [ edit ] Main article: Iowa caucuses The state gets considerable attention every four years because the Iowa caucus , gatherings of voters to select delegates to the state conventions, is the first presidential caucus in the country. The caucuses, held in January or February of the election year, involve people gathering in homes or public places and choosing their candidates, rather than casting secret ballots as is done in a presidential primary election.

[ 284 ] Along with the New Hampshire primary the following week, Iowa's caucuses have become the starting points for choosing the two major-party candidates for president.

[ 285 ] The national and international media give Iowa and New Hampshire extensive attention, which gives Iowa voters leverage.

[ 286 ] In 2007 presidential campaign spending was the seventh highest in the country.

[ 287 ] Civil rights [ edit ] In a 2020 study, Iowa was ranked as the 24th easiest state for citizens to vote in.

[ 288 ] Racial equality [ edit ] The Union Block building in Mount Pleasant , scene of early civil rights and women's rights activities In the 19th century Iowa was among the earliest states to enact prohibitions against race discrimination, especially in education, but was slow to achieve full integration in the 20th century. In the first decision of the Iowa Supreme Court — In Re the Matter of Ralph , [ 289 ] decided July 1839—the Court rejected slavery in a decision that found a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil, 26 years before the end of the Civil War.

[ 290 ] The state did away with racial barriers to marriage in 1851, more than 100 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would ban miscegenation statutes nationwide.

[ 291 ] The Iowa Supreme Court decided Clark v. The board of directors [ 292 ] in 1868, ruling that racially segregated "separate but equal" schools had no place in Iowa, 85 years before Brown v. Board of Education .

[ 290 ] By 1875, a number of additional court rulings effectively ended segregation in Iowa schools.

[ 293 ] Social and housing discrimination continued against Blacks at state universities until the 1950s.

[ 294 ] The Court heard Coger v. The North Western Union Packet Co.

[ 295 ] in 1873, ruling against racial discrimination in public accommodations 91 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.

[ 290 ] In 1884, the Iowa Civil Rights Act apparently outlawed discrimination by businesses, reading: "All persons within this state shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, chophouses, eating houses, lunch counters, and all other places where refreshments are served, public conveyances, barber shops, bathhouses, theaters, and all other places of amusement." However, the courts chose to narrowly apply this act, allowing de facto discrimination to continue.

[ 296 ] Racial discrimination at public businesses was not deemed illegal until 1949, when the court ruled in State of Iowa v. Katz that businesses had to serve customers regardless of race; the case began when Edna Griffin was denied service at a Des Moines drugstore.

[ 297 ] Full racial civil rights were codified under the Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1965.

[ 298 ] Women's rights [ edit ] As with racial equality, Iowa was a vanguard in women's rights in the mid-19th century, but did not allow women the right to vote until the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1920, Iowa legislature being one of the ratifying votes.

[ 299 ] In 1847, the University of Iowa became the first public university in the U.S. to admit men and women on an equal basis.

[ 300 ] In 1869, Iowa became the first state in the union to admit women to the practice of law, with the Court ruling women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa and admitting Arabella A. Mansfield to the practice of law.

[ 290 ] Several attempts to grant full voting rights to Iowa women were defeated between 1870 and 1919. In 1894 women were given "partial suffrage", which allowed them to vote on issues, but not for candidates. It was not until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment that women had full suffrage in Iowa.

[ 301 ] Although Iowa supported the Federal Equal Rights Amendment , in 1980 and 1992 Iowa voters rejected an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution.

[ 302 ] Iowa added the word "women" to the Iowa Constitution in 1998. After the amendment, it reads: "All men and women are, by nature, free and equal, and have certain inalienable rights—among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness." [ 303 ] In May 2018 Iowa signed into law one of the country's most restrictive abortion bans: the requirement that a doctor cannot perform an abortion if they can detect a fetal heartbeat, which in many cases would restrict abortions pregnancies less than six weeks old.

[ 304 ] It was struck down in January 2019, when an Iowa state judge ruled that the "fetal heartbeat" law was unconstitutional.

[ 305 ] LGBTQ rights [ edit ] Main article: LGBTQ rights in Iowa This article needs to be updated . The reason given is: update with 2020s anti-transgender legislation including Iowa Senate File 538 and Senate File 418 .

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

( June 2025 ) The state's law criminalizing same-sex sexual activity was repealed in June 1976, 27 years before Lawrence v. Texas . In 2007, the Iowa Legislature added "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" to the protected classes listed in the Iowa Civil Rights Act.

[ 306 ] The Iowa Legislature later struck "gender identity" from these protections in 2025, making Iowa the first U.S. state to remove a protected group from a state anti-discrimination law .

[ 307 ] On April 3, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court decided Varnum v. Brien , [ 308 ] holding in a unanimous decision, [ 309 ] the state's law forbidding same-sex marriage was unconstitutional . This made Iowa the third state in the U.S. and first in the Midwest to permit same-sex marriage.

[ 310 ] [ 311 ] Sister jurisdictions [ edit ] Iowa has ten official partner jurisdictions: [ 312 ] Yamanashi Prefecture , Japan (1960) Yucatán , Mexico (1964) Hebei Province , People's Republic of China (1983) Terengganu , Malaysia (1987) Taiwan , Republic of China (1989) Stavropol Krai , USSR/Russia (1989) Cherkasy Oblast , Ukraine (1996) Veneto Region , Italy (1997) Republic of Kosovo (2013) A consulate was opened in Des Moines in 2015.
