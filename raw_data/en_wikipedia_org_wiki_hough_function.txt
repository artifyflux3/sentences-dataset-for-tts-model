As such, they are relevant in geophysics and meteorology where they form part of the solutions for atmospheric and ocean waves . These functions are named in honour of Sydney Samuel Hough .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Each Hough mode is a function of latitude and may be expressed as an infinite sum of associated Legendre polynomials ; the functions are orthogonal over the sphere in the continuous case. Thus they can also be thought of as a generalized Fourier series in which the basis functions are the normal modes of an atmosphere at rest.
