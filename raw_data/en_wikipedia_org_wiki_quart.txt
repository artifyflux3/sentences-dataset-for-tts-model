Three kinds of quarts are currently used: the liquid quart and dry quart of the US customary system and the imperial quart of the British imperial system . All are roughly equal to one liter . It is divided into two pints or (in the US) four cups . Historically, the size of a quart has varied with the different values of gallons over time, and in the case of the dry quart, in reference to different commodities.

Name [ edit ] The term comes from the Latin quartus (meaning one-quarter) via the French quart .  However, although the French word quart has the same root, it frequently means something entirely different. In Canadian French in particular, the quart is called pinte , [ 2 ] while the pint is called chopine .

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] Main article: Gallon Since gallons of various sizes have historically been in use, the corresponding quarts have also existed with various sizes.

Definitions and equivalencies [ edit ] Imperial quart [ edit ] The imperial quart is equal to one-quarter of an imperial gallon of exactly 4.546 09 L , i.e.

1.136 5225 L . In the United Kingdom, goods may be sold by the quart if the equivalent metric measure is also given.

[ 5 ] [ 2 ] US liquid quart [ edit ] In the United States, traditional length and volume measures have been legally standardized for commerce by the international yard and pound agreement of 1959, using the definition of 1 yard being 0.9144 meters : from this definition the metric equivalents for inches, feet, miles, area measures, and measures of volume are determined. The US liquid quart is equal to one-quarter of a gallon of exactly 231 cubic inches , i.e. 57.75 cubic inches or 0.946 352 946 L .

Despite its name, it is unrelated to the Winchester measure .

[ 11 ] The 2.5 L bottles in which laboratory chemicals are supplied are sometimes referred to as Winchester quart bottles , although these contain 10% more than a traditional Winchester quart.

Reputed quart [ edit ] The reputed quart was a measure equal to two-thirds of an imperial quart (one-sixth of an imperial gallon), or exactly 0.757681 6 liters, which is only 0.08% larger than one US fifth (exactly 0.7570823568 liters).

The reputed quart was previously recognized as a standard size of wine bottle in the United Kingdom, and is only about 1% larger than the current standard wine bottle of 0.75 L.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ This has been the exact conversion since the redefinition of the imperial gallon in 1976 in the UK, [ 4 ] and in 1964 in Canada.
