He is a professor of physics at University of California, Berkeley , a senior faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , a senior research scientist at Riken , and an affiliate member at Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe . Since 2015, he has been the director of the Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics .

[ 1 ] Career [ edit ] Nomura received his Ph.D.

from University of Tokyo (supervisor Tsutomu Yanagida ) in 2000 and became a Miller Research Fellow at University of California, Berkeley. In 2002-03 he was an associate scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory . In July 2003 he joined the Department of Physics at University of California, Berkeley. In 2017, Nomura was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society "for pioneering contributions to a variety of areas of particle theory, including gauge unification in extra dimensions, electroweak symmetry breaking, supersymmetric models, dark matter, the multiverse, foundations of quantum mechanics, and black holes." [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Work [ edit ] Nomura works on particle physics, quantum gravity, and cosmology. He developed theories of grand unification in higher dimensional spacetime [ 4 ] and constructed the so-called holographic Higgs model, the first realistic model in which a composite Higgs particle arises as a pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone boson .

[ 5 ] He also proposed that the eternally inflating multiverse is the same thing as quantum many worlds .
