[ 1 ] Established in 1977, the forest park is located between Nelson and Marlborough and consists of 1,659 km 2 (641 sq mi) of conservation estate.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Around 80% of the area is covered in bush. The most notable peak in the forest park is Mount Richmond, which has an elevation above sea level of 1,760 metres (5,770 ft).

[ 4 ] The park covers 165,946 hectares (410,060 acres).

[ 5 ] [ 1 ] History [ edit ] The future park was the location of New Zealand's first deadly civilian aviation incident associated with regular passenger air service. On 7 May 1942, a plane flying from Wellington to Nelson with two pilots and three passengers, was lost in the area. A subsequent investigation found a burnt out plane and no survivors on the upper slopes of Mount Richmond.

[ 6 ] The park was established in 1977.

[ 5 ] Te Araroa uses some of the 250 kilometers of tracks and huts in the forest park.
