They are the most common, and probably most widespread, form of protected area in the country.

[ 1 ] The reserve vary size: while most are less than 100 hectares, some are more than 1,000 hectares. Some are "islands of unspoilt nature in a sea of farmland".

[ 1 ] Scenic reserves were first created when communities decided to keep some original vegetation in an area where most original vegetation had been removed. Most are patches of bush, often close to roads.

[ 1 ] Statutory control of scenic reserves was covered by the Scenery Preservation Act 1903 until the passing of the Reserves Act 1977.

[ 1 ] Ball's Clearing Scenic Reserve in Hawke’s Bay , an area of native forest fenced off from the surrounding pasture land, is typical scenic reserve.
