It is located at the southern tip of New York State on one of the world's largest natural harbors . The city comprises five boroughs , each coextensive with its respective county . The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area , the largest metropolitan area in the United States by both population and urban area. New York is a global center of finance [ 13 ] and commerce , culture , technology , [ 14 ] entertainment and media , academics and scientific output , [ 15 ] the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations , international diplomacy.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] With an estimated population in July 2024 of 8,478,072, distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km 2 ), [ 5 ] the city is the most densely populated major city in the United States.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] New York City has more than double the population of Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city.

[ 21 ] Over 20.1 million people live in New York City's metropolitan statistical area [ 22 ] and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, both largest in the US. New York City is one of the world's most populous megacities .

[ 23 ] The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States . An estimated 800 languages are spoken in New York City, [ 24 ] [ 25 ] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.

[ 26 ] In 2021, the city was home to nearly 3.1 million residents who were born outside the US.

[ 21 ] New York City traces its origins to Fort Amsterdam and a trading post founded on Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists around 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was temporarily renamed New York after King Charles II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York , [ 27 ] before being permanently renamed New York in 1674. Following independence from Great Britain, the city was the national capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790.

[ 28 ] The modern city was formed by the 1898 consolidation of its five boroughs : Manhattan , Brooklyn , Queens , the Bronx , and Staten Island .

Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan , New York City has been called both the world's premier financial and fintech center [ 29 ] [ 30 ] and the most economically powerful city in the world.

[ 31 ] As of 2022 [update] , the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy in the world , with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.16 trillion.

[ 11 ] The New York metropolitan area's economy is larger than all but nine countries . Despite having a 24/7 rapid transit system , New York also leads the world in urban automobile traffic congestion .

[ 32 ] The city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization of their listed companies: the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq . New York City is an established haven for global investors.

[ 33 ] As of 2025 [update] , New York City is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates [ 34 ] and has by a wide margin the highest residential rents of any city in the nation.

[ 35 ] Fifth Avenue is the most expensive shopping street in the world.

[ 36 ] New York City is home to the highest number of billionaires , [ 37 ] individuals of ultra-high net worth (greater than US$30 million), [ 38 ] and millionaires of any city in the world by a significant margin.

[ 39 ] Etymology See also: Nicknames of New York City In 1664, New York was named in honor of the Duke of York (later King James II of England ).

[ 40 ] James's elder brother, King Charles II , appointed him proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland , including the city of New Amsterdam , when the Kingdom of England seized it from Dutch control .

[ 41 ] At the same time, New Netherland was also renamed New York (province, now New York State ).

[ 42 ] History Main articles: History of New York City and Timeline of New York City Further information: History of Manhattan , Timeline of Brooklyn , Timeline of Queens , Timeline of the Bronx , and Timeline of Staten Island Early history Main article: History of New York City (prehistory–1664) In the pre-Columbian era , the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquians , including the Lenape . Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking , included the present-day areas of Staten Island , Manhattan , the Bronx , the western portion of Long Island (including Brooklyn and Queens ), and the Lower Hudson Valley .

[ 43 ] The first documented visit to New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano .

[ 44 ] He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoulême (New Angoulême ).

[ 45 ] A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V , arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River , which he named Río de San Antonio ('Saint Anthony's River').

[ 46 ] In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company .

[ 47 ] He sailed up what the Dutch called North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange .

[ 48 ] Hudson claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (' New Netherland '). The first non–Native American inhabitant of what became New York City was Juan Rodriguez , a merchant from Santo Domingo who arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch.

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] Dutch rule Main articles: New Amsterdam , Fort Amsterdam , and New Netherland The Castello Plan , a 1660 map of New Amsterdam in Lower Manhattan New Amsterdam , centered in what eventually became Lower Manhattan, in 1664, the year England took control and renamed it New York A permanent European presence near New York Harbor was established in 1624, making New York the 12th-oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States , with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island . In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam , later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island.

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] The colony of New Amsterdam extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day Wall Street , where a 12-foot (3.7 m) wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and English raids.

[ 53 ] In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit , as charged by the Dutch West India Company , purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie , a small Lenape band, [ 54 ] for "the value of 60 guilders " [ 55 ] (about $900 in 2018).

[ 56 ] A frequently told but disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.

[ 27 ] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen ( patroons , or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded land, local political autonomy, and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.

[ 59 ] Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General . In 1639–1640, to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies ).

[ 27 ] [ 60 ] In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000.

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order; however, he earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church , and blocked other religious groups from establishing houses of worship.

[ 63 ] English rule Main articles: Province of New York and History of New York City (1665–1783) The Fall of New Amsterdam , painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris , depicting the Conquest of New Netherland Fort George and New York with British warships, c.

1731 In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel Richard Nicolls , without bloodshed.

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.

[ 65 ] In 1667, during negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda after the Second Anglo-Dutch War , the victorious Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of what is now Suriname , which they had gained from the English, [ 66 ] and in return the English kept New Amsterdam. The settlement was promptly renamed "New York" after the Duke of York (the future King James II and VII).

[ 3 ] The duke gave part of the colony to proprietors George Carteret and John Berkeley .

[ 67 ] On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War , Anthony Colve of the Dutch navy seized New York at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it "New Orange" after William III , the Prince of Orange .

[ 68 ] The Dutch soon returned the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between 1660 and 1670.

[ 71 ] By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200.

[ 72 ] New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population in 1702 alone.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] In the early 18th century, New York grew in importance as a trading port as a part of the colony of New York .

[ 75 ] It became a center of slavery , with 42% of households enslaving Africans by 1730.

[ 76 ] Most were domestic slaves ; others were hired out as labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banking and shipping industries trading with the American South . During construction in Foley Square in the 1990s, the African Burying Ground was discovered; the cemetery included 10,000 to 20,000 graves of colonial-era Africans, some enslaved and some free.

[ 77 ] The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger , who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby , helped to establish freedom of the press in North America.

[ 78 ] In 1754, Columbia University was founded.

[ 79 ] American Revolution Further information: American Revolution The Battle of Long Island , one of the largest battles of the American Revolutionary War , which took place in Brooklyn on August 27, 1776 The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty organization emerged in the city and skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.

[ 80 ] The Battle of Long Island , the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War , was fought in August 1776 within modern-day Brooklyn.

[ 81 ] A British rout of the Continental Army at the Battle of Fort Washington in November 1776 eliminated the last American stronghold in Manhattan, causing George Washington and his forces to retreat across the Hudson River to New Jersey , pursued by British forces.

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made New York their military and political base of operations in North America.

[ 84 ] The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom promised by the Crown , with as many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation, the largest such community on the continent.

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] When the British forces evacuated New York at the close of the war in 1783, they transported thousands of freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia , England, and the Caribbean .

[ 87 ] The attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin , and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776.

[ 88 ] Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York destroyed nearly 500 buildings, about a quarter of the structures in the city, including Trinity Church .

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] Post-revolutionary period and early 19th century Main article: History of New York City (1784–1854) A portrait of the first inauguration of George Washington in 1789 In January 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital.

[ 91 ] New York was the last capital of the United States under the Articles of Confederation and the first under the Constitution .

[ 92 ] As the capital, New York City hosted the inauguration of the first President, George Washington , and the first Congress , at Federal Hall on Wall Street . Congress drafted the Bill of Rights there.

[ 92 ] The Supreme Court held its first organizational sessions in New York in 1790.

In 1790, for the first time, New York City surpassed Philadelphia as the nation's largest city. At the end of 1790, the national capital was moved to Philadelphia , where it remained while the new capital in Washington, D.C. was being constructed.

[ 93 ] [ 94 ] During the 19th century New York City's population grew from 60,000 to 3.43 million.

[ 95 ] Under New York State's gradual emancipation act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] A significant free Black population gradually developed in Manhattan, made up of former slaves who had been freed by their masters after the American Revolutionary War , as well as escaped slaves. The New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate Black children.

[ 98 ] It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state .

[ 99 ] Free Blacks struggled with discrimination, and interracial abolitionist activism continued. New York City's population jumped from 123,706 in 1820 (10,886 of whom were Black and of whom 518 were enslaved) to 312,710 by 1840 (16,358 of whom were Black).

[ 100 ] Broadway , which follows the Native American Wecquaesgeek Trail through Manhattan, 1840 [ 101 ] Also in the 19th century, the city was transformed by both commercial and residential development relating to its status as a national and international trading center, as well as by European immigration, respectively.

[ 102 ] The city adopted the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 , which expanded the city street grid to encompass almost all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes .

[ 103 ] Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall , a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants .

[ 104 ] In 1831, New York University was founded.

[ 105 ] Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant , Washington Irving , Herman Melville , Rufus Wilmot Griswold , John Keese , Nathaniel Parker Willis , and Edgar Allan Poe . Members of the business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park , which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.

[ 106 ] The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants, of whom more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, representing over a quarter of the city's population.

[ 107 ] Extensive immigration from the German provinces meant that Germans comprised another 25% of New York's population by 1860.

[ 108 ] [ 109 ] American Civil War Main articles: New York City in the American Civil War and History of New York City (1855–1897) Departure of the 7th New York Militia Regiment for the defense of Washington, D.C., April 19, 1861 Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.

[ 98 ] Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863 , whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.

[ 98 ] The draft riots deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and Black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground.

[ 108 ] At least 120 people were killed.

[ 110 ] Eleven Black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of Blacks to flee. The Black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865. The White working class had established dominance.

[ 108 ] [ 110 ] It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history .

1900 In 1886, the Statue of Liberty , a gift from France, was dedicated in New York Harbor. The statue welcomed 14 million immigrants as they arrived via Ellis Island by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the United States and American ideals of liberty and peace.

[ 112 ] [ 113 ] In 1898 the City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens.

[ 114 ] The opening of the New York City Subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together.

[ 115 ] Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.

[ 116 ] In 1904 the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River , killing 1,021 people.

[ 117 ] In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire , the city's worst industrial disaster, killed 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.

New York's non-White population was 36,620 in 1890.

[ 119 ] New York City was a prime destination in the early 20th century for Blacks during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had the largest urban African diaspora in North America.

[ 120 ] The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition .

[ 121 ] The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height.

[ 122 ] New York City became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed 10 million in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity .

[ 123 ] The Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.

[ 124 ] Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County , with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The United Nations headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York's displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.

[ 129 ] They are widely considered to be the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement [ 126 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ] [ 132 ] and the modern fight for LGBT rights .

[ 133 ] [ 134 ] Wayne R. Dynes , author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality , wrote that drag queens were the only " transgender folks around" during the Stonewall riots. The transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality.

[ 136 ] Growing fiscal deficits in 1975 led the city to appeal to the federal government for financial aid; President Gerald Ford gave a speech denying the request, which was paraphrased on the front page of the New York Daily News as "FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD".

[ 137 ] The Municipal Assistance Corporation was formed and granted oversight authority over the city's finances.

[ 138 ] While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.

[ 139 ] New York City's population passed 8 million for the first time in the 2000 census ; [ 140 ] further records were set in the 2010 and 2020 censuses.

[ 141 ] Important new economic sectors, such as Silicon Alley , emerged.

[ 142 ] The World Trade Center , in Lower Manhattan , during the September 11 attacks in 2001 The year 2000 was celebrated with fanfare in Times Square .

[ 143 ] New York City suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks .

[ 144 ] Two of the four hijacked airliners were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, resulting in the collapse of both buildings and the deaths of 2,753 people, including 343 first responders from the New York City Fire Department and 71 law enforcement officers.

[ 145 ] The area was rebuilt with a new World Trade Center , the National September 11 Memorial and Museum , and other new buildings and infrastructure, [ 146 ] including the World Trade Center Transportation Hub , the city's third-largest hub.

[ 147 ] The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere [ 148 ] and the world's seventh-tallest building by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3 m), a reference to the year of American independence .

[ 149 ] [ 150 ] [ 151 ] The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.

[ 152 ] New York City was heavily impacted by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, including flooding that led to the days-long shutdown of the subway system, [ 153 ] and flooding of all East River subway tunnels and of all road tunnels entering Manhattan except the Lincoln Tunnel .

[ 154 ] The New York Stock Exchange closed for two days due to weather for the first time since the Great Blizzard of 1888 .

[ 155 ] At least 43 people died in New York City as a result of Sandy, and the economic losses in New York City were estimated to be roughly $19 billion.

[ 156 ] The disaster spawned long-term efforts towards infrastructural projects to counter climate change and rising seas, with $15 billion in federal funding received through 2022 towards those resiliency efforts.

[ 157 ] [ 158 ] In March 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in the city was confirmed.

[ 159 ] With its population density and extensive exposure to global travelers, the city rapidly replaced Wuhan , China as the global epicenter of the pandemic during the early phase, straining the city's healthcare infrastructure.

[ 160 ] [ 161 ] Through March 2023, New York City recorded more than 80,000 deaths from COVID-19-related complications.

[ 162 ] Geography Main articles: Geography of New York City and Geography of New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary Aerial view of the New York City metropolitan area with Manhattan at its center New York City lies in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston . Its location at the mouth of the Hudson River , which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city become a significant trading port. Most of the city is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island.

During the Wisconsin glaciation , 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City area was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet .

[ 163 ] The erosive forward movement of the ice (and its subsequent retreat) contributed to the separation of what is now Long Island and Staten Island. That action left bedrock at a relatively shallow depth, providing a solid foundation for most of Manhattan's skyscrapers.

[ 164 ] The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay . Between New York City and Troy, New York , the river is an estuary .

[ 165 ] The Hudson River separates the city from New Jersey. The East River—a tidal strait —flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River , another tidal strait between the East and Hudson rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River , which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County , is the only entirely freshwater river in the city.

[ 166 ] [ importance?

] The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s.

[ 167 ] Some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out, especially in Manhattan.

[ 168 ] The city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km 2 ). 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km 2 ) of the city is land and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km 2 ) of it is water.

[ 169 ] [ 170 ] The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level , is the highest point on the eastern seaboard south of Maine .

[ 171 ] The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt .

Manhattan (New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough. It is home to Central Park and most of the city's skyscrapers, and is sometimes locally known as The City .

[ 174 ] Manhattan's population density of 70,450.8 inhabitants per square mile (27,201.2/km 2 ) in 2022 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city .

[ 175 ] Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial center of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations , the United Nations headquarters , Wall Street, and many important universities. The borough is often described as the financial and cultural center of the world.

[ 176 ] [ 177 ] Brooklyn (Kings County), on the western tip of Long Island , is the city's most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods , and a distinctive architectural heritage.

[ 188 ] Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport , are in Queens.

[ 189 ] The Bronx (Bronx County) is both New York City's northernmost borough and the only one that is mostly on the U.S. mainland . It is the location of Yankee Stadium , the baseball park of the New York Yankees , and home to the largest cooperatively-owned housing complex in the United States, Co-op City .

[ 190 ] It is home to the Bronx Zoo , the world's largest metropolitan zoo, [ 191 ] which spans 265 acres (1.07 km 2 ) and houses more than 6,000 animals.

[ 192 ] The Bronx is the birthplace of hip hop music and its associated culture .

[ 193 ] Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City, at 2,772 acres (1,122 ha).

[ 194 ] Staten Island (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. It is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge , and to Manhattan by way of the free Staten Island Ferry . In central Staten Island, the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately 2,500 acres (10 km 2 ), including 28 miles (45 km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city.

[ 195 ] Designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.

The suburbs to the immediate north and west are in the transitional zone between humid subtropical and humid continental climates (Dfa).

[ 196 ] [ 197 ] The city receives an average of 49.5 inches (1,260 mm) of precipitation annually, which is relatively evenly spread throughout the year. New York averages over 2,500 hours of sunshine annually.

[ 198 ] Winters are chilly and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow sea breezes offshore temper the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean, yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachian Mountains keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes.

[ 199 ] The daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 33.3 °F (0.7 °C).

[ 200 ] Temperatures usually drop to 10 °F (−12 °C) several times per winter, [ 201 ] yet can also reach 60 °F (16 °C) for several days even in the coldest winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from cool to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 77.5 °F (25.3 °C) in July.

[ 200 ] Nighttime temperatures are 9.5 °F (5.3 °C) degrees higher for the average city resident due to the urban heat island effect, caused by paved streets and tall buildings.

[ 202 ] Daytime temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed 100 °F (38 °C), although this is a rare occurrence, last noted on July 18, 2012.

[ 203 ] [ 204 ] [ 205 ] [ 206 ] Similarly, readings of 0 °F (−18 °C) are extremely rare, last occurring on February 14, 2016.

[ 207 ] Extreme temperatures have ranged from 106 °F (41 °C), recorded on July 9, 1936, down to −15 °F (−26 °C) on February 9, 1934; [ 200 ] the coldest recorded wind chill was −37 °F (−38 °C) on the same day as the all-time record low.

[ 208 ] Average winter snowfall between 1991 and 2020 was 29.8 inches (76 cm); this varies considerably between years. The record cold daily maximum was 2 °F (−17 °C) on December 30, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum was 87 °F (31 °C), on July 2, 1903.

[ 203 ] The average water temperature of the nearby Atlantic Ocean ranges from 39.7 °F (4.3 °C) in February to 74.1 °F (23.4 °C) in August.

[ 209 ] Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area.

[ 210 ] Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs.

[ 211 ] The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.

[ 32 ] The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 greatly influenced its physical development. New York City has an extensive web of freeways and parkways , which link the city's boroughs to each other and North Jersey , Westchester County, Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut through bridges and tunnels . Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who commute into Manhattan, it is common for motorists to be stranded for hours in dense traffic congestion that is a daily occurrence, particularly during rush hour .

[ 577 ] [ 578 ] Congestion pricing in New York City , first such program in the nation, [ 579 ] was activated in January 2025, applying to most motor vehicular traffic using the area of Manhattan south of 60th Street , in an effort to encourage commuters to use rapid transit instead.

[ 580 ] Unlike the rest of the country, New York State prohibits turns on red lights in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City, therefore, all turns on red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present.

Lincoln Tunnel The Lincoln Tunnel , which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world.

[ 590 ] The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The Holland Tunnel , connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey , was the first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927.

New York City is divided between, and is host to the main branches of, two different U.S. district courts : the District Court for the Southern District of New York , whose main courthouse is on Foley Square in Manhattan and whose jurisdiction includes Manhattan and the Bronx; [ 600 ] and the District Court for the Eastern District of New York , whose main courthouse is in Brooklyn and whose jurisdiction includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.

[ 601 ] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and U.S. Court of International Trade are also based on Foley Square.

[ 602 ] [ 603 ] Politics Eric Adams , the current Mayor of New York City The city's mayor is Eric Adams , a Democrat who was elected in 2021 .

[ 604 ] The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. As of November 2023, 67% of active registered voters in the city are Democrats and 10.2% are Republicans .

[ 605 ] New York City has not been carried by a Republican presidential candidate since 1924 , and no Republican candidate for statewide office has won all five boroughs since the city was incorporated in 1898. In redistricting following the 2020 census, 14 of New York's 26 congressional districts include portions of New York City.

[ 606 ] New York City is a significant source of political fundraising .

[ 607 ] The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends $11.4 billion more than it receives back). City residents and businesses also sent an additional $4.1 billion in the 2009–2010 fiscal year to the state than the city received in return.

[ 608 ] International relations Main article: List of sister cities of New York City In 2006, the sister city program [ 609 ] was restructured as New York City Global Partners . New York's historic sister cities are denoted below by the year they joined New York City's partnership network.

'Leaving their homes,' [immigrants] say, 'with the brightest prospects,' alluring representations presented to them of the blessed state of American life, a few scanty coins in their pockets, though feeling in the enjoyment of rugged health, and surrounded by their young and innocent offspring, little did they imagine the trials to which they would be exposed; but at length they discover to their sorrow, and very natural discontent, that the foul steerage of some ocean-tossed ship is to form the filthy receptacle of persons, crowded too with hordes of human beings, with scarcely space enough to contain the half of them—certainly not more than the quarter of them comfortably ; and thus huddled together en masse , they become the " emigrant passengers " destined to this country.
