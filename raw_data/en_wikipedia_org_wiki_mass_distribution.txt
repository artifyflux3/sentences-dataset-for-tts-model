In physics and mechanics , mass distribution is the spatial distribution of mass within a solid body. In principle, it is relevant also for gases or liquids , but on Earth their mass distribution is almost homogeneous.

Astronomy [ edit ] In astronomy mass distribution has decisive influence on the development e.g. of nebulae , stars and planets .
The mass distribution of a solid defines its center of gravity and influences its dynamical behaviour - e.g. the oscillations and eventual rotation .

Mathematical modelling [ edit ] A mass distribution can be modeled as a measure . This allows point masses, line masses, surface masses, as well as masses given by a volume density function. Alternatively the latter can be generalized to a distribution . For example, a point mass is represented by a delta function defined in 3-dimensional space . A surface mass on a surface given by the equation f ( x , y , z ) = 0 may be represented by a density distribution g ( x , y , z ) δ ( f ( x , y , z )) , where g / | ∇ ∇ f | {\textstyle g/\left|\nabla f\right|} is the mass per unit area.

The mathematical modelling can be done by potential theory , by numerical methods (e.g. a great number of mass points ), or by theoretical equilibrium figures.

Geology [ edit ] In geology the aspects of rock density are involved.

Rotating solids [ edit ] Rotating solids are affected considerably by the mass distribution, either if they are homogeneous or inhomogeneous - see Torque , moment of inertia , wobble , imbalance and stability.
