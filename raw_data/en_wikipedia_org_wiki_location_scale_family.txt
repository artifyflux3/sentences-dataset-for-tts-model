For any random variable X {\displaystyle X} whose probability distribution function belongs to such a family, the distribution function of Y = d a + b X {\displaystyle Y\,{\stackrel {d}{=}}\,a+bX} also belongs to the family (where = d {\displaystyle {\stackrel {d}{=}}} means " equal in distribution "—that is, "has the same distribution as").

In other words, a class Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } of probability distributions is a location–scale family if for all cumulative distribution functions F ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle F\in \Omega } and any real numbers a ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle a\in \mathbb {R} } and b > 0 {\displaystyle b>0} , the distribution function G ( x ) = F ( a + b x ) {\displaystyle G(x)=F(a+bx)} is also a member of Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } .

If X {\displaystyle X} has a cumulative distribution function F X ( x ) = P ( X ≤ ≤ x ) {\displaystyle F_{X}(x)=P(X\leq x)} , then Y = a + b X {\displaystyle Y=a+bX} has a cumulative distribution function F Y ( y ) = F X ( y − − a b ) {\displaystyle F_{Y}(y)=F_{X}\left({\frac {y-a}{b}}\right)} .

If X {\displaystyle X} is a discrete random variable with probability mass function p X ( x ) = P ( X = x ) {\displaystyle p_{X}(x)=P(X=x)} , then Y = a + b X {\displaystyle Y=a+bX} is a discrete random variable with probability mass function p Y ( y ) = p X ( y − − a b ) {\displaystyle p_{Y}(y)=p_{X}\left({\frac {y-a}{b}}\right)} .

If X {\displaystyle X} is a continuous random variable with probability density function f X ( x ) {\displaystyle f_{X}(x)} , then Y = a + b X {\displaystyle Y=a+bX} is a continuous random variable with probability density function f Y ( y ) = 1 b f X ( y − − a b ) {\displaystyle f_{Y}(y)={\frac {1}{b}}f_{X}\left({\frac {y-a}{b}}\right)} .

If X {\displaystyle X} has a moment generating function M X ( t ) {\displaystyle M_{X}(t)} , then Y = a + b X {\displaystyle Y=a+bX} has a moment generating function M Y ( t ) = e a t M X ( b t ) {\displaystyle M_{Y}(t)=e^{at}M_{X}(bt)} .

If X {\displaystyle X} has a characteristic function φ φ X ( t ) {\displaystyle \varphi _{X}(t)} , then Y = a + b X {\displaystyle Y=a+bX} has a characteristic function φ φ Y ( t ) = e i a t φ φ X ( b t ) {\displaystyle \varphi _{Y}(t)=e^{iat}\varphi _{X}(bt)} .

Moreover, if X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are two random variables whose distribution functions are members of the family, and assuming existence of the first two moments and X {\displaystyle X} has zero mean and unit variance,
then Y {\displaystyle Y} can be written as Y = d μ μ Y + σ σ Y X {\displaystyle Y\,{\stackrel {d}{=}}\,\mu _{Y}+\sigma _{Y}X} , where μ μ Y {\displaystyle \mu _{Y}} and σ σ Y {\displaystyle \sigma _{Y}} are the mean and standard deviation of Y {\displaystyle Y} .

In decision theory , if all alternative distributions available to a decision-maker are in the same location–scale family, and the first two moments are finite,  then a two-moment decision model can apply, and decision-making can be framed in terms of the means and the variances of the distributions.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Examples [ edit ] Often, location–scale families are restricted to those where all members have the same functional form. Most location–scale families are univariate , though not all. Well-known families in which the functional form of the distribution is consistent throughout the family include the following: Normal distribution Elliptical distributions Cauchy distribution Uniform distribution (continuous) Uniform distribution (discrete) Logistic distribution Laplace distribution Student's t-distribution Generalized extreme value distribution Converting a single distribution to a location–scale family [ edit ] The following shows how to implement a location–scale family in a statistical package or programming environment where only functions for the "standard" version of a distribution are available. It is designed for R but should generalize to any language and library.

The example here is of the Student's t -distribution , which is normally provided in R only in its standard form, with a single degrees of freedom parameter df . The versions below with _ls appended show how to generalize this to a generalized Student's t-distribution with an arbitrary location parameter m and scale parameter s .

Probability density function (PDF): dt_ls(x, df, m, s) = 1/s * dt((x - m) / s, df) Cumulative distribution function (CDF): pt_ls(x, df, m, s) = pt((x - m) / s, df) Quantile function (inverse CDF): qt_ls(prob, df, m, s) = qt(prob, df) * s + m Generate a random variate : rt_ls(df, m, s) = rt(df) * s + m Note that these generalized functions do not have standard deviation s since standard t distributions do not have a standard deviation of 1.
