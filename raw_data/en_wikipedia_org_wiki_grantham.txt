It lies 23 miles (37 km) south of Lincoln and 22 miles (35 km) east of Nottingham . The population in 2016 was put at 44,580.

[ 1 ] The town is the largest settlement and the administrative centre of the South Kesteven District.

Grantham was the birthplace of the UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher .

Isaac Newton was educated at the King's School . The town was the workplace of the UK's first warranted female police officer, Edith Smith in 1914. The UK's first running diesel engine was made there in 1892 and the first tractor in 1896.

[ citation needed ] Thomas Paine worked there as an excise officer in the 1760s.

[ 2 ] The villages of Manthorpe , Great Gonerby , Barrowby , Londonthorpe and Harlaxton form outlying suburbs of the town.

Etymology [ edit ] Grantham's name is first attested in the Domesday Book (1086); its origin is not known with certainty. The ending -hām is Old English and means "homestead". The first part of the name may either be the personal name Granta or derive from the Old English word Grand ( gravel ), implying either "Granta's homestead" or "homestead by gravel".

[ 3 ] In the early 20th century, the town's name was still pronounced Grant-m or Grahnt-m ; but as people moved more frequently and became more literate, they began to derive the place name from its spelling and the pronunciation shifted to Granthum (the t and h becoming a th phoneme). This was already becoming common in 1920, [ 4 ] and the later pronunciation is now the norm.

[ 5 ] [ n 1 ] Geography [ edit ] Grantham and surrounding settlements, roads, railways and watercourses. The urban area is in grey; areas over 100m in elevation are shaded beige.

Grantham is a town in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire , a non-metropolitan county in the East Midlands of England.

[ 7 ] Until 1974 it was a borough , [ 8 ] but it is now a civil parish and bounded by the parishes of Great Gonerby to the north-west, Belton and Manthorpe to the north, Londonthorpe and Harrowby Without to the north-east and east, Little Ponton and Stroxton to the south, Harlaxton to the south-west, and Barrowby to the west. Its urban area is almost entirely within the parish, [ 7 ] though The Spinney housing estate , Alma Park industrial estate and part of the Bridge End Road housing estate are in Londonthorpe and Harrowby Without.

[ 9 ] Topography and geology [ edit ] The town lies in the valley of the River Witham , its core at the Witham's confluence with the Mowbeck (or Mow Beck).

[ 10 ] The Witham flows south–north through Grantham.

[ 11 ] The Mowbeck, which rises from springs at Harlaxton about 3 miles (4.8 km) to the south-west of the town, [ 12 ] is culverted behind Westgate and Brook Street [ 10 ] until it joins the Witham at White Bridge.

[ 13 ] The floor of the Witham valley – 50–60 m above sea level in the town centre – is underlain by mudstone of the Charmouth formation of the Lower Jurassic period (199–183 million years ago). This formation is overlain by Belton sand and gravel laid down in estuaries and rivers in the Quaternary period up to 3 million years ago. The river courses are overlain by Quaternary alluvium and to the north by river terrace deposits.

[ 14 ] The soil around the route of the Witham is wet, acidic, sandy and loamy; its fertility is poor.

[ 15 ] As the ground rises on the town's eastern and southern fringes, it is underlain by Jurassic Marlstone rocks of ferruginous sandstone and ironstone formed 190–174 million years ago, and then by Whitby Mudstone of 174–183 million years ago. The land rises sharply to form the Lincoln Cliff that marks the edge of the urban area and start of the Lincoln Heath and Kesteven Uplands, which are capped by Jurassic Oolitic Limestone , [ 14 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] mostly overlain by shallow, free-draining, lime -rich soils.

[ 15 ] To the west, the town is near the edge of the low-lying Vale of Belvoir [ 18 ] but fringed by an escarpment [ 19 ] rising in places to over 100 m to form the hills on which sit Barrowby, Great Gonerby, the Green Hill and Earlesfield suburban areas and the business parks off Trent Road. These hills are of siltstone and mudstone of the Jurassic Dyrham Formation , which line the edges of the Witham and Mowbeck valleys and the shallow valley of Barrowby Stream . At its highest the scarp is capped by Jurassic ferruginous sandstone and ironstone rocks of the Marlstone formation. There are some head deposits and pleistocene glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel east of Barrowby.

[ 14 ] The soil in the lower areas is slowly permeable , seasonally wet and slightly acidic, though base-rich . On higher ground it tends to be slightly acidic and base-rich, but freely draining and highly fertile.

[ 15 ] Grantham Canal , which opened in 1797, [ 20 ] closely follows the route of the Mowbeck from Echo Farm into the town. West of there it cuts through a valley north of Harlaxton into the Vale of Belvoir, eventually reaching West Bridgford near Nottingham .

[ 21 ] Urban area [ edit ] Map of Grantham town centre. London Road, Wharf Road, Sankt Augustin Way and Barrowby Road form the A52. Harlaxton Road is the A607.

The historical core of Grantham is bounded by Westgate, Brook Street and Castlegate, and includes the High Street down to St Peter's Hill. This is the town's main retail and commercial area. It includes many historic buildings. Between Westgate and the A52 to the west are postwar retail buildings and blocks of flats . North of it is 18th, 19th and 20th-century suburban housing focused on North Parade, which include villas and terraced housing.

[ 22 ] Further north, off Gonerby Road and Manthorpe Road ( A607 ), these give way to large, low-density, suburban, privately owned housing on estates mostly built in the 1970s and 1980s. Those at the base of Gonerby Hill are known as Gonerby Hill Foot and lie west of the railway line, to the east of which developments are contiguous with the historical core of Manthorpe village.

[ 23 ] [ n 2 ] South of the town centre, suburban housing takes the form of late- Victorian and Edwardian brick, terraced and villa houses in grid-plan layouts, initially built for industrial workers and now largely owned or let privately.

[ 25 ] Alongside some housing in Harlaxton Road (A607), most of these streets cluster round the railway station and nearby retail and industrial units in an area known as Spittlegate (also spelled Spitalgate or Spittalgate), the town cemetery – an area called New Somerby in older maps – and the Wharf Road, London Road and Bridge End Road stretches of the A52.

[ 21 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Further south-east, low-density, mostly privately owned, suburban housing estates of the 1970s and 1980s cluster round the A52, marking the edge of the town's urban area in an area of rising ground that forms part of Somerby Hill .

[ 28 ] Further east, off the A52, are the Prince William of Gloucester Barracks , on the brow of the hill.

[ 21 ] [ 29 ] The north-east fringe of the urban area is marked by 20th-century development. An exception is a piece of land east of the Witham and north of Stonebridge Road that includes schools and colleges and portions of a 19th-century barracks complex south of greenspace, including Wyndham Park . Otherwise the area between the Witham, Belton Lane, Londonthorpe Lane and the Lincoln Cliff has suburban housing, mostly privately owned with some let by housing associations . It includes part of the Harrowby Estate , begun in 1928 as council housing ). The part round Belton Lane and Harrowby Lane is a low-density mix of pre- First World War , interwar and postwar houses; the remainder of the large estate and the Cherry Orchard Estate appeared in the immediate postwar period in medium density, on a layout inspired by the Garden City movement . South of Londonthorpe Lane and north-east of the other estates are medium and high-density housing areas dating largely from the 1970s to the early 21st century; [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The northernmost, known as The Spinney or Sunningdale , [ 9 ] adjoins the post-war Alma Park industrial estate off Londonthorpe Lane.

[ 32 ] The town's western fringe sits between the railway line, the A1 bypass and the Kesteven Uplands. North of the canal are large, varied developments mostly from the 20th century, including the Earlesfield estate, begun as a council estate in the 1920s and expanded in the postwar period, industrial estates, and a leisure centre complex, all south of Barrowby Stream, by the expansive 1980s estate on Green Hill , the Edwardian and Victorian villas lining Barrowby Road, and the large 1980s and 1990s estate to its north. Most of this is privately owned, but some is let by housing associations. The canal basin is lined with industrial, warehouse , retail and office buildings that continue up to Dysart Road. South of them are Harlaxton Road (A607) and Springfield Road, round which separate residential developments have been built, including inter-war homes in Huntingtower Road, a 21st-century estate centred on Hudson Way, post-war social housing at Walton Gardens, post-war housing Denton Avenue, and late-20th-century developments at Harris Way.

[ 31 ] [ 33 ] Climate [ edit ] The British Isles experience a temperate, maritime climate with warm summers and cool winters.

[ 34 ] Data from the weather station nearest to Grantham, at Cranwell, 10 miles (16 km) away, shows an average daily mean temperature of 9.8 °C (49.6 °F) fluctuates from a peak of 16.9 °C (62.4 °F) in July to 3.9 °C (39.0 °F) in January. The average high temperature is 13.7 °C (56.7 °F), though monthly averages vary from 6.7 °C (44.1 °F) in January and December to 21.8 °C (71.2 °F) in July; the average low is 5.9 °C (42.6 °F), reaching lowest in February at 0.8 °C (33.4 °F) and highest in July and August at 12.0 °C (53.6 °F).

[ 10 ] Early prehistoric hunter-gatherers visited the area. Scattered Stone Age tools have been found, the earliest being a Palaeolithic axe on the Cherry Orchard Estate, dating between 40,000 and 150,000 years ago. The next earliest material consist of Mesolithic flints crafted 4,000 to 8,000 years ago and found round Gonerby Hill and the riverside in the south of the town.

Neolithic people probably settled in the Grantham area for its proximity to the rivers and its fertile soils; material suggesting settlement in this period has been found at Great Ponton . Other scattered finds have been unearthed around the town. Remains of a Neolithic ritual site on the parish boundary between Harlaxton and Grantham are known from aerial photography .

Bronze Age artefacts include pottery vessels, with human remains found in Little Gonerby, a Beaker pot, Beaker pottery sherds, cinerary urns and a food vessel, and a later cemetery at Belton Lane, but there is little direct evidence of Bronze Age settlement in the area of the modern town. Little is known about it in the Iron Age , though ditched enclosures and a field system of this date are known to lie off Gorse Lane.

[ 38 ] Various Romano-British coins and pottery finds have emerged in Grantham; [ 39 ] a burial and pottery from the 2nd century AD were uncovered off Trent Road in 1981. Small settlements or farmsteads from the period have been discerned on the hills overlooking Grantham from the east, and another has been found in Barrowby. There were probably Romano-British farmsteads on the site of the modern town, [ 40 ] but the wet soils round the Mowbeck and flooding by the Witham probably made it hard for a larger settlement to grow there.

[ 39 ] Three kilometres to the south of the modern town, an important Roman site has been found at Saltersford , a crossing of the River Witham near Little Ponton. Extensive finds and evidence of a significant Romano-British occupation have emerged in the vicinity since the 19th century; it has been tentatively identified by some scholars as Causennae , mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary , and sat at the place where River Witham was crossed by the Salter's Way , a trade route connecting the salt-producing coastal and marshland regions with the Midlands. Salter's Way may also have crossed Ermine Street (now B6403) at Cold Harbour , 4 km south-east of Grantham. Saltersford may have been a small town with a market for local farmsteads and smaller settlements.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] Medieval town [ edit ] Origins [ edit ] The local historian Michael Honeybone has "no doubt that the town of Grantham was established during [Anglo-]Saxon times"; its name suggests it emerged in the earliest phase of Anglo-Saxon settlement, probably by the 7th century.

[ 39 ] The archaeological evidence for this is limited to finds indicating cemeteries at the sites of the Central School in Manthorpe and the junction of Bridge End Road and London Road in the town, and to small quantities of pottery sherds found on London Road, Belton Lane, Saltersford, New Somerby and Barrowby.

[ 43 ] The town's Saxon-period history is obscure and debated.

[ 44 ] The medievalist Sir Frank Stenton argued that Grantham probably emerged as an "important estate centre" before the Viking invasions in the 9th century and then functioned as a "minor local capital" in the Danelaw .

[ 45 ] By contrast, the historian David Roffe has argued that the town and its outlying soke were established in the 1040s or 1050s by Queen Edith and Leofric, Earl of Mercia , to strengthen their hands in the county at the expense of Siward, Earl of Northumbria . They may have also created St Wulfram's Church either as a new place of worship or as one revived from a possible earlier cell of Crowland Abbey . Roffe argues that Siward's death in 1055 made Grantham's new role less important; as such, its soke only grew to its full extent after the Norman Conquest of England, when the king merged it with the soke of Great Ponton.

[ 46 ] Whatever its origins, by the time of the Domesday Book (1086, the earliest documentary evidence for the settlement), Grantham was a town and royal manor ; under its jurisdiction fell soke comprising lands in 16 villages. St Wulfram's served this extended parish area.

[ 44 ] Royal manor [ edit ] Grantham's Domesday entries show it as an estate centre, where Queen Edith had a hall before 1066. Twenty years later, the king had the manor; there were four mills and eight acres of meadow, but no arable land. The demesne appears to have been land now known as Earlesfield in Great Gonerby. There were 111 burgesses and 72 bordars , possibly labourers or craftsmen, indicating that Grantham was both a manor and a borough where the lord retained exclusive rights.

[ 47 ] [ n 3 ] It was a valuable asset, used by the king to reward loyal followers.

[ 49 ] By 1129, the manor and soke had been granted to Rabel de Tancarville , the king's chamberlain in Normandy . He sided against King Stephen during The Anarchy (1135–1154) and his lands were probably forfeited on his death in 1140, although restored to his son William and confirmed in the early 1180s.

[ 50 ] The king retook the manor after William's heir Ralph de Tancarville failed to support him in Normandy.

[ 49 ] In 1205, the king granted it to his ally William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey . It was held as a life interest and reverted to the Crown on his widow's death in 1249, but regranted to his son the 6th earl in 1266. On his death in 1304 it reverted to the crown and was soon granted to Aymer de Valence , but had been regranted to Warenne's grandson, the 7th earl , by 1312. Four years later it was resettled on the 7th earl for life with reversion to the crown.

William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton was granted the reversion in 1337 and took seisin ten years later. After his death, it reverted again to the Crown and in 1363 Edward II granted it to his son Edmund of Langley, Duke of York , through whose heirs it passed to Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York , [ 51 ] a major figure in the Wars of the Roses and rival of Henry VI . After Richard's death in 1460, Henry's Queen Margaret of Anjou attacked Grantham in 1461, but later that year was defeated by Richard's son Edward, who took the throne as Edward IV . Two years later, Grantham was rewarded for loyalty to the Yorkist cause when the king granted the borough a charter of incorporation , as a self-governing council – the Corporation of Grantham headed by an Alderman – with various freedoms.

[ 52 ] [ n 4 ] Economy and government [ edit ] Watercolour and graphite painting of Grantham Church by J. M. W. Turner (1797) Its lords encouraged Grantham to expand as a commercial centre.

[ 59 ] By the late 11th century it was an "important market town".

[ 60 ] The wool trade prospered, benefiting from its proximity to grazing lands on the Lincoln Heath. This wealth contributed towards the building of St Wulfram's Church .

[ 61 ] Wool shops were in Grantham in 1218 [ 61 ] and Walkergate (now Watergate) was recorded in 1257, indicating the presence of fullers (walkers), who played a role in processing wool. Cloth manufacture declined around this time, but wool continued to be produced for trading, primarily for export from Boston . Wool merchants are recorded from the town in the late 13th century (foremost being was Roger de Belvoir, who contributed over £296 to the Wool Prize of 1297). By this time merchants from Italy , [ 62 ] Saint-Omer and Amiens were active in the town.

[ 63 ] In 1269, the earl granted the town free tronage – the right to weigh wool without paying a toll . Less than 30 years later, its merchants were asked to send a representative to counsel the king.

[ 59 ] The wool trade boomed in the early 14th century; the town's merchants traded at least 980 sacks of wool at Boston during Edward II 's reign, half from the de Chesterton family.

[ 64 ] In 1312, the earl granted the burgesses various freedoms and the right to elect a leader (the Alderman ), codifying a longstanding informal arrangement.

[ 65 ] Later in the century the king sought to raise revenues by taxing the wool trade; some Grantham merchants, including the wealthy Roger de Wollesthorpe, acted as creditors to the king.

[ 66 ] England's falling population, continued taxation of wool exports and the growth of cloth exports and monopolisation led to the wool trade declining by the mid-15th century.

[ 67 ] Cloth exports became more important nationally. Grantham had a small cloth industry, but it could not compete with new fulling mills , which required fast-flowing water.

[ 68 ] Its merchants continued to trade in wool and it remained a dominant aspect of the town's economy.

[ 66 ] Other industries also existed during the Middle Ages; there is evidence of wine trading, brewing , parchment making, weaving and other trades and crafts.

[ 68 ] The bridging of the River Trent at Newark by the late 12th century realigned the Great North Road so that it passed through Grantham, [ 69 ] bringing traffic to the town as an important stopping place and leading to the development of inns such as The George and The Angel .

[ 70 ] By the 16th century, the economy was diverse. The largest sector was the leather trade, employing a quarter of the known workforce; distribution, food, drink and agricultural trades were also important. By that time, clothing and textiles each accounted for less than 10 per cent of the town's workers.

[ 71 ] Modern history [ edit ] 19th and 20th centuries [ edit ] The Lincoln Theatre Company of actors took a 21-year lease on the theatre in 1800.

[ 72 ] Westgate Hall , which was commissioned as the local corn exchange , was completed in 1852.

[ 73 ] The town developed when the railway came. The Nottingham Line ( LNER ) arrived first in 1850, then the London line ( GNR ) – the Towns Line from Peterborough to Retford – arrived in 1852. The Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway arrived in 1857.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] Gas lighting appeared in 1833. The corporation became a borough council in 1835. Little Gonerby and Spittlegate were added to the borough in 1879. The town had been in the wapentake of Loveden and included three townships of Manthorpe with Little Gonerby, Harrowby and Spittlegate with Houghton and Walton.

[ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Grantham Golf Club, now defunct, was founded in 1894 and continued until the onset of the Second World War.

[ 80 ] Until the 1970s, the housing estates west of the town centre were green fields. Green Hill, on the A52, was literally a green hill.

[ 77 ] [ 79 ] In July 1975 the National Association of Ratepayers' Action Groups (NARAG) was formed in Grantham by John Wilks, its chairman, as a forerunner of the TaxPayers' Alliance .

[ citation needed ] Military history [ edit ] Army barracks, next to the A52 , east of the town The town has a long military history since the completion of the Old Barracks in 1858.

[ 81 ] Dambusters [ edit ] During the Dambuster Raids Royal Air Force missions in May 1943, the RAF Bomber Command 's No. 5 Group and operation HQ were in St Vincents , [ 82 ] a building later owned by Aveling-Barford and housing a district council planning department. It was built by Richard Hornsby in 1865 and lived in by his son. It is now a private house. In 1944 (including D-Day ), it was the headquarters for the USAAF 's Ninth Air Force 's IX Troop Carrier Command , known as Grantham Lodge.

[ 83 ] RAF Spitalgate [ edit ] RAF Spitalgate trained pilots during both world wars, initially as a Royal Flying Corps establishment. It was the first military airfield in Lincolnshire. It has never been an operational fighter or bomber base; although it did see operational service during the 1943 invasion of Europe as a base for American and Polish gliders and parachutists. It officially closed in 1974. The Women's Royal Air Force had been there from 1960 until closure.

[ 84 ] (as RAF Wilmslow was closing due to the imminent ending of National Service ), and moved to RAF Hereford (now the home of SAS ).

[ citation needed ] After closure, RAF Spitalgate became the Royal Corps of Transport, later Royal Logistic Corps barracks: Prince William of Gloucester Barracks , named after Prince William of Gloucester .

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] Grantham College used the site's two football pitches for their South Lincolnshire Football Development Centre (from September 2004).

[ 86 ] After closure in 1975 a vehicle test centre was built on the outfield; this closed in 2011.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] The large mast on the base was part of the BT microwave network .

[ 89 ] The Queen's Royal Lancers (part of the Royal Armoured Corps ) have their RHQ on the base.

RAF Regiment [ edit ] The RAF Regiment was formed north-east of the town in parts of Londonthorpe and Harrowby Without during December 1941 with its headquarters at RAF Belton Park , which is recognised as its birthplace.

[ 90 ] The Belton Park estate had been a training centre for the Machine Gun Corps from November 1915.

[ 91 ] The RAF Regiment reached in excess of 66,000 personnel and during training was housed at RAF Belton Park , the Regiment's first depot, RAF Folkingham and RAF North Witham .

Women's police force [ edit ] Grantham was first after London to recruit and train women police officers. It was the first provincial force to ask the newly formed Corps of Women's Police Volunteers to supply them with occasional policewomen, recognising them as useful for dealing with women and juveniles. In December 1914 Miss Damer Dawson, the Chief of the Corps, came to Grantham to supervise the preliminary work of the women police. Officers stationed there were Miss Allen and Miss Harburn.

[ 92 ] In 1915, Grantham magistrates swore in Edith Smith , making her the first policewoman in Britain with full powers of arrest.

[ 93 ] Industrial history [ edit ] Richard Hornsby & Sons [ edit ] Richard Hornsby and Richard Seaman founded Seaman & Hornsby, Iron Founders and Millwrights, at Spittlegate in Grantham in 1810. The company was renamed Richard Hornsby & Sons when Seaman retired in 1828.

[ 94 ] Products included ploughs and seed drills.

From 1840 until 1906 the company built steam engines. Thereafter production shifted to oil, petrol and gas engines. It employed 378 men in 1878 and 3,500 in 1914.

[ 95 ] In 1905 Richard Hornsby & Sons invented a caterpillar track for a machine using Hornsby's oil engines ; these engines were developed by Yorkshireman Herbert Akroyd Stuart , from which compression-ignition principle the diesel engine evolved, being manufactured in Grantham from 8 July 1892.

[ 96 ] Although such engines were not wholly compression-ignition derived, in 1892 a prototype high-pressure version was built at Hornsby's, developed by Thomas Henry Barton OBE – later to found Nottingham's Barton Transport – whereby ignition was achieved solely through compression; it ran continuously for six hours as the first known diesel engine. In the town, Hornsby's built Elsham House, whose grounds became Grantham College ) and the Shirley Croft. Its site in Houghton Road was bought from Lord Dysart.

[ citation needed ] Hornsby oil engine at the Museum of Lincolnshire Life In 1910 Hornsby presented its chain-track vehicle to the British Army, which then bought four caterpillar tractors to tow artillery. At the demonstration, a British transport officer suggested putting armour plating and a gun on a Hornsby tractor, so creating some sort of self-propelled gun. David Roberts, managing director of Hornsby, did not pursue the idea, but later expressed regret at not having done so. Four years later, Hornsby sold the patent for its caterpillar track to the Holt Manufacturing Company of California, USA, for $8,000, having itself sold only one caterpillar tractor commercially.

[ 97 ] The Holt system was superior to Hornsby's, but the Hornsby transmission was what Holt really wanted. Thanks in part to this acquisition, Holt eventually became the successful Caterpillar Inc.

Tractor Company. In 1918, Hornsby's amalgamated with Rustons as Ruston & Hornsby . In the 1920s the company had its own orchestra in the town; the site was a diesel engine plant. During the Second World War, the company made tanks such as the Matilda at the Grantham factory. Ruston and Hornsby left in 1963 and most of the factory was taken over by a subsidiary, Alfred Wiseman Gears, which itself left in 1968.

[ citation needed ] Scale model of Hornsby 1910 steam caterpillar tractor Barford's [ edit ] The agricultural engine and steamroller manufacturer Aveling and Porter of Rochester , Kent, merged with Barford & Perkins of Peterborough as Aveling-Barford Ltd in 1934, largely with financial help from Ruston & Hornsby, as both firms had entered into administration. The new company took a former site of Hornsbys, naming it the Invicta works, from the motto on the coat of arms of Kent , which translates as "unconquered"; all Aveling & Porter machinery was brought from Kent by rail.

[ citation needed ] During the 1970s Barford's was the town's largest employer, with around 2,000 employees.

[ 98 ] It initially prospered, but declined with the sinking market for large dumper trucks and road rollers . In 1947, its agricultural division, Barfords of Belton , developed the world's smallest tractor, the Barford Atom, weighing 177 pounds (80 kilograms).

[ citation needed ] Now Barford Construction Equipment, it makes dumpers for construction sites, being owned by Wordsworth Holdings PLC , owned in turn by the entrepreneur Duncan Wordsworth until it went into administration in March 2010. A restructuring package resulted in ownership transferring to Bowdon Investment Group in May 2010. It is now known as Invictas Engineering.

A trailer company, Crane-Fruehauf, moved into part of the factory from its former home at Dereham , when it went into receivership in early 2005.

BMARC [ edit ] British Manufacture and Research Company (British Marc Ltd or BMARC ), in Springfield Road, made munitions, notably the Hispano cannon for the Spitfire and Hurricane from 1937 onwards. It was owned by the Swiss Oerlikon from 1971 until 1988, becoming part of Astra Holdings plc. The firm was bought by British Aerospace in 1992, which then closed the site. It has now been developed as a housing estate. The site's former offices are now business units for the Springfield Business Centre. Grantham's register office moved there in 2007.

Angel and Royal [ edit ] Main article: Angel and Royal The sign of the Angel and Royal The Angel and Royal in 1836 The Angel and Royal in the High Street is reputedly the oldest inn in England. The present façade was built about 600 years ago, but the site had already held an inn for 200 years before that, and its origins are older still, as a hostel for the Knights Templar .

King John is reputed to have visited with his Royal Court in 1213. A visit by Richard III was the origin of the gold emblem angel holding the King's crown over the original archway. Other royal visitors include King Charles I , George IV and Edward VII , when Prince of Wales , leading to the inclusion of "Royal" in the inn's name.

[ 111 ] Closures [ edit ] Brook Street and Hill Avenue sub-post offices were closed in Grantham in 2008 as part of the Post Office Network Change programme. In August 2010 it was confirmed that the Grantham branch of Marks and Spencer would close, with two other Lincolnshire branches in Skegness and Scunthorpe , due to low sales, although a Marks and Spencer Food Hall re-opened in 2014. The closure met with local protests.

However, compared to England's population, Christians were a higher proportion of the Grantham population (67.6% compared with 59.4%), and all other groups were present at a lower proportion than the national rates. There were 20 Sikhs in Grantham, making up a negligible proportion of the population compared with 0.8% nationally; Hindus composed 0.5% (compared with 1.5% in England), Muslims 0.5% against 5% nationally, Jewish people 0.1% compared with 0.5% for all of England, and Buddhists 0.3% of the town's population, contrasting with 0.5% nationally.

Of the population over 16, 47.2% were married, compared to 46.6% in England; 31.1% were single (a smaller proportion than in England where it was 34.6%), 10.9% divorced (compared with 9% in England), 7.3% widowed (slightly higher than the 6.9% for all of England), 3.3% separated and 0.2% in same-sex civil partnerships (2.7% and 0.2% respectively in England). In 2011, there were 17,944 households in the Grantham urban area. It had a slightly lower than average proportion of one-person households (28.8% compared with England's figure of 30.2%); most other households consisted of one family, which was more common in Grantham than England as a whole (65.3% of the total, compared with 61.8% in England). This was because there were slightly higher than average rates of cohabiting couples (12% compared with 9.8%), lone parent households (11.2% against 10.6%) and married couples (34.2% compared with 33.2%), but fewer people in multiple and other household types (5.9% compared with 8%).

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] The 2011 census showed the average age of Grantham's population to be in line with the national average; the mean age was 39.3 and the median 39 years, compared with 39.3 and 39 for England. 24.8% of the population was under 20, versus 24% of England's, and 22.4% of Grantham's population was aged over 60, compared with 22% of England's population.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] In 2011, 80.7% of the population were in good or very good health, compared to 81.4% in England, and 5.4% in very bad or bad health, exactly the same rate as in England. 18% of people (9.3% in 16–64 year-olds) also reported having their day-to-day activities limited, compared with 17.6% in England (8.2% in 16–64 year-olds).

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] As of 2011, Grantham had similar proportions of people who owned their homes with or without a mortgage (62.2%) than in England (63.3%) and who rented socially (17.1% compared with 17.7% nationally); there was a slightly higher rate of private renting (18.8% compared with 16.8%) while owner-occupiers were more likely to be mortgaged than in England as a whole (55.7% of them, compared with 51.8%). The proportion of household spaces which are detached or semi-detached houses is higher than average (27.8% and 33.6%, compared with 22.3% and 30.7%), while the proportion of households living in apartments, flats and maisonettes is much lower (13.1% against 22.1%). The proportion of terraced household spaces is similar (25.4% compared with 24.5%).

The proportion in full-time employment is also comparatively high, at 42.7% (against 38.6% for England). The proportion of retirees was in line with the national figure, at 13.9% compared with 13.7% for England, as was the proportion of long-term sick or disabled (3.9%, compared with England's 4%); 1.6% of people were long-term unemployed , compared with 1.7% in all of England. The 2011 census revealed that the most common industry residents worked in were: wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles (19.1%), manufacturing (13.9%), and human health and social work (12.9%). The latter category was in line with the national average, but retail and manufacturing were overrepresented compared with England (where the proportions were 15.9% and 8.8%, respectively). Most other industries were under-represented comparatively, with financial services (2.4% versus 4.4% nationally), information and communication (2.0% against 4.1% nationally), and professional, scientific and technical activities (3.9% compared with 6.7%) especially so.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] Compared with the whole of England, the workforce had modestly higher proportions of people in elementary occupations (14.4% compared with 11.1%), process, plant and machinery operative roles (10.9% against 7.2%), skilled trades (12.8% versus 11.4%), and caring and other service occupations (10.5% against 9.3%). There was a much lower proportion of people in professional , associate professional, technical, administrative and secretarial occupations than in England as a whole (combined 32.6% versus 41.7% of England's population aged 16–74), principally driven by a lower proportion of full professionals (11.1% compared with 17.5%).

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] The proportion of residents aged 16 to 74 with no qualifications was 23.7%, only slightly higher than the national figure (22.5%); the proportion of residents whose highest qualification is at Level 1 or 2 (equivalent to GCSEs ) is higher than in the national population, but 19.8% of Grantham's population have a qualification at Level 4 or above ( Certificate of Higher Education upwards, including graduates ), compared with 27.4% nationally.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] Deprivation [ edit ] The government's Indices of Multiple Deprivation (2019) show that Grantham contains both dense pockets of deprivation and areas of substantial affluence. The county council note that high levels of deprivation in parts of the town contrast with the less deprived rural hinterlands around it.

[ 118 ] A statistical area covering part of the Earlesfield estate falls within the most deprived 10% of areas in the country; it is the most deprived place in South Kesteven. Other parts of Earlesfield and the Cherry Orchard suburb fall within the most deprived 20% of areas nationally, while much of the central urban area also falls below the national median and the top five most deprived areas in the district are all parts of Grantham. However, the Green Hill and Spinney housing estates and parts of Gonerby Hill Foot and Manthorpe fall within the least deprived decile nationally; one of them is in the least 10 deprived places in South Kesteven.

[ 119 ] Transport [ edit ] Rail [ edit ] Class 91 Electric locomotive at the station in May 2004, looking south Bridge 66 on the Grantham Canal at Harlaxton Spittlegate Millhouse, Grantham Grantham railway station is served by the London–Edinburgh East Coast Main Line , between Peterborough and Newark Northgate ). It is joined by the Nottingham to Skegness Line ( Poacher Line ). Liverpool–Norwich trains also call at Grantham. Electric trains began running in October 1988. Transport links to Nottingham and Peterborough attract some commuters. The town's grammar schools also attract pupils from Radcliffe on Trent , Bingham , Newark and even Retford via the train.

[ citation needed ] Grantham is the best-served station in Lincolnshire, [ citation needed ] although after October 1970, most of Lincolnshire's branch lines were closed. Before October 1970 the connection from King's Cross to Lincoln Central was through Grantham and followed the A607 via Leadenham . After that date, London-Lincoln trains still passed through Grantham, but then continued up the main line to Newark Northgate , where the trains branched off to Lincoln St Marks Railway Station via a new curve just north of Newark.

In 1906 a rail accident killed 14 people.

[ citation needed ] On 3 July 1938 Mallard broke the world speed record for steam locomotives , at 126 mph (203 km/h), on the slight downward grade of Stoke Bank south of Grantham on the East Coast Main Line .

Road [ edit ] The Great North Road was routed through the town in 1196. The turnpike to the north reached the town in 1725, that to Stamford in 1739, to Nottingham in 1758, and that to Melton in 1780.

The A1 main road from London to Edinburgh runs past the town, which was bypassed in 1962. The A52 linking Nottingham and the East Coast was diverted from High Street onto the Inner Relief Road, Sankt Augustin Way, in 1998. Wharf Road and London Road junction is still a busy junction on the A607 for Lincoln. Motorway-style Grantham North Services , at the north end of Grantham bypass, is on a new junction which replaced a roundabout in May 2008.

[ 120 ] Grantham, with Stamford , had been earmarked for a bypass before the war in 1939. There were 60 serious accidents a year, with three to four deaths. After the war, on 21 November 1945, there was a meeting at the Guildhall about the proposed bypass of the London-Edinburgh-Thurso trunk road for Grantham and Great Gonerby. This was the first enquiry into a trunk road scheme in the country after the war. The proposed route followed the current line, from Little Ponton to College Farm, except it was to be a single carriageway road.

[ citation needed ] On 8 February 1960, it was announced that a bypass would be built, including the route south to the B6403 at Colsterworth .

Robert McGregor and Sons Ltd of Manchester would build the road for £1,856,009. (The company went on to build Newark bypass in 1964.) The bridges were built by Simon Carves of Cheadle Hulme . It was formally opened on 10 October 1962 by James Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 3rd Earl of Ancaster , then the Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire (from 1950 to 1975).

[ 121 ] He was married to the (only) daughter of Nancy Astor .

Various attempts at one-way systems in Grantham have been introduced, but traffic delays are still commonplace. Low railway bridges also add to traffic difficulties, with lorries becoming stuck under them. Many promises have been made by the local council for a Grantham bypass road. The latest, the Grantham Southern Relief Road, has been in planning since 2007. Phase one of the project was completed in 2016 which provided access to some commercial facilitates and a new roundabout on the B1174.

[ 122 ] Phase Two, started in October 2019, involves a new grade separated junction on the A1 and is due to be opened on 20 December 2022. Phase three for the main stretch of road started in 2021 and due to be completed by 2023. In July 2022 it was found that ground conditions at a new viaduct were for as expected, and the project would be delayed as the viaduct would need to be redesigned.

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] Waterways [ edit ] Grantham was once linked to Nottingham by the Grantham Canal . It is possible to walk and cycle along the canal starting from Grantham near the A1/A607 intersection (opposite The Farrier ).

The River Witham runs through Grantham. It has a riverside walk linking Dysart Park and Wyndham Park, on which is a view of Spittlegate Mill. The walk passes Inner Street allotment and the rear of Sainsbury's car park, access to which is by a pedestrian bridge at the end of College Street. There are other footbridges with views of the river and its weirs. Swans, ducks and trout are among the wildlife that can be seen along the river.

Education [ edit ] Mannequin of Isaac Newton at Grantham Museum Grantham College , a further education college for the district, opened in 1948, for those not attending school sixth forms. It has a satellite site at Sleaford, Sleaford College.

[ citation needed ] Since September 2008 the Walton Academy in Kitty Briggs Lane near Harlaxton Road has run post-16 courses. In September 2019, the school had its first intake of male students in the lower school, making the former all-girls school co-educational.

[ 125 ] Two notable schools in the district are Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School and The King's Grammar School . Both have large sixth forms and eminent past students. Britain's first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher , attended Kesteven and Grantham, and Isaac Newton famously attended The King's. Both have remained single-sex up to the age of 16.

[ citation needed ] In 1970, Kesteven County Council (based in Sleaford) announced plans to turn the grammar schools into co-educational comprehensives for ages of 11–16 and leave Grantham College the only sixth form for the town. Later it was proposed to create two sixth-form colleges from one of the grammar schools. Other parts of Kesteven became comprehensive but responsibility for education passed to Lincolnshire under the local government reorganization of 1974, and both schools stayed as grammar schools .

[ citation needed ] Ex-pupil Margaret Thatcher was education secretary at the time. The governors of the King's School delayed the process in July 1973, and in January 1975 a plan to make Grantham comprehensive was voted against by the county council, having been approved by the council's own education committee.

[ citation needed ] On 1 August 2011 The King's School ended its long relationship with the local elected authorities and the town of Grantham, by converting to a selective academy. It remains a selective boys' school and has kept its name and logo.

[ 126 ] All four secondary modern schools are on the outskirts of Grantham. Only three of the six secondary schools are co-educational.

[ citation needed ] The Priory Ruskin Academy (formerly Central Technology & Sports College ) is a co-educational school sited near Manthorpe , this school is part of the wider Priory Federation, which has multiple schools in Lincolnshire and Leicestershire.
