She was employed on the Amsterdam – Batavia route until the outbreak of the Second World War . Requisitioned as a troopship , she was employed in the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean . Surviving the end of the war in Europe, she struck a mine in the Scheldt on 26 August 1945 and was beached. She broke in two on 5 September and was declared a total loss.

Ordering and construction [ edit ] The order for Christiaan Huygens became known in February 1926. Previously Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland (SMN) had ordered a comparable ocean liner, Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft from the French shipyard Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire . The price offered was so advantageous that it fell outside the contractual limits up to which the Nederlandsche Scheepsbouw Maatschappij (NSM) was the preferred supplier for SMN. For Christiaan Huygens Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland did not get such an advantageous offer, and NSM offered to build her at a loss.

[ 2 ] Big delays in the construction of P.C. Hooft might also have been instrumental in securing the order for NSM, which was capable to deliver quickly.

Launch of Christiaan Huygens Christiaan Huygens was built as yard number 186 [ 3 ] by the Nederlandsche Scheepsbouw Maatschappij, Amsterdam , North Holland , Netherlands. She was laid down on 13 March 1926.

[ 4 ] She was launched on 28 September 1927, the biggest ship built in the Netherlands up to that date. On 11 December 1927 she was towed from the NSM yard to the drydock Hendrik Dok of Amsterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij , where the propellers were added.

[ 5 ] On 25 January Christiaan Huygens left IJmuiden for her technical trials on the North Sea. These were finished with positive results on the 26th. Later on the 26th, a second 'official' trial run was made with about two hundred technicians, prominent people from the shipbuilding industry and journalists. During the trial, there was a dinner at which Mr. Tegelberg announced that MSN would accept delivery. Having delivered months ahead of schedule, Mr. D. Goedkoop CEO of the NSM yard created a laugh by remarking that: The most difficult part of building a ship is getting a contract that has a solid name under it. Really, construction itself is much easier.

[ 6 ] Almost immediately after the speedy delivery of Christiaan Huygens SMN ordered two much bigger ocean liners at NSM, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and Marnix van Sint Aldegonde .

[ 7 ] Christiaan Huygens was registered in Port of Amsterdam , and her code letters were NJWV.

[ 8 ] In 1934 they were superseded by the call sign PDKD.

[ 9 ] Description [ edit ] Dimensions [ edit ] The ship was 168.07 metres (551.4 ft) long, with a beam of 20.97 metres (68.8 ft). She had a depth of 11.03 metres (36.2 ft) [ 8 ] and a draught of 12.12 metres (39 ft 9 in).

Machinery [ edit ] The ship was powered by two ten-cylinder single cycle single-acting two-stroke diesel engines , [ 3 ] They were rated at 2,490 nhp , [ 8 ] 5,800 bhp . Each engine drove a single screw propeller, giving the ship a speed of 16 knots (30 km/h).

[ 3 ] The engines were built by Sulzer Brothers, Winterthur, Switzerland.

[ 8 ] They were model 10ST68 engines. Her auxiliary engines were three Sulzer 5S38 and a Sulzer 6RKH30 diesel engine, together rated at 2,250 bhp.
