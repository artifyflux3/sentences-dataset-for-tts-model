**Frequency** is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per [unit of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_time "Unit of time").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-1) Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of [oscillatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation "Oscillation") and [vibratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration "Vibration") phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, [audio signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal "Audio signal") ([sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound "Sound")), [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave"), and [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light").

The interval of time between events is called the **period**. It is the [reciprocal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") of the frequency.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-2) For example, if a heart beats at a frequency of 120 times per minute (2 hertz), its period is one half of a second.

Special definitions of frequency are used in certain contexts, such as the [angular frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency "Angular frequency") in rotational or cyclical properties, when the rate of angular progress is measured. [Spatial frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_frequency "Spatial frequency") is defined for properties that vary or cccur repeatedly in geometry or space.

The unit of measurement of frequency in the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI) is the [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz "Hertz"), having the symbol Hz.

A [pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum "Pendulum") with a period of 2.8 s and a frequency of 0.36[Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz "Hertz")

For cyclical phenomena such as [oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation "Oscillation"), [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave"), or for examples of [simple harmonic motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion "Simple harmonic motion"), the term _frequency_ is defined as the number of cycles or repetitions per unit of time. The conventional symbol for frequency is _f_ or _ν_ (the Greek letter [nu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_(letter) "Nu (letter)")) is also used.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-FOOTNOTESerwayFaughn1989346-3) The _period_ _T_ is the time taken to complete one cycle of an oscillation or rotation. The frequency and the period are related by the equation[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-FOOTNOTESerwayFaughn1989354-4)[![Image 4: {\displaystyle f={\frac {1}{T}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01d0a6b6ad677166ddf5f54f8782bbe74b6890ae)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q11652)

The term _temporal frequency_ is used to emphasise that the frequency is characterised by the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time.

The [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI") unit of frequency is the [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz "Hertz") (Hz),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-FOOTNOTESerwayFaughn1989354-4) named after the German physicist [Heinrich Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz "Heinrich Hertz") by the [International Electrotechnical Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission "International Electrotechnical Commission") in 1930. It was adopted by the [CGPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGPM "CGPM") (Conférence générale des poids et mesures) in 1960, officially replacing the previous name, _[cycle per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle\_per\_second "Cycle per second")_ (cps). The SI unit for the period, as for all measurements of time, is the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-5) A traditional unit of frequency used with rotating mechanical devices, where it is termed _[rotational frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational\_frequency "Rotational frequency")_, is [revolution per minute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_per_minute "Revolution per minute"), abbreviated r/min or rpm.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-6) Sixty rpm is equivalent to one hertz.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies1997275-7)

Period versus frequency
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frequency&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Period versus frequency")]

As a matter of convenience, longer and slower waves, such as [ocean surface waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_surface_wave "Ocean surface wave"), are more typically described by wave period rather than frequency.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-FOOTNOTEYoung19997-8) Short and fast waves, like [audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound "Sound") and radio, are usually described by their frequency. Some commonly used conversions are listed below:

| Frequency | Period |
| --- | --- |
| 1 mHz (10−3 Hz) | 1 ks (10 3 s) |
| 1 Hz (10 0 Hz) | 1 s (10 0 s) |
| 1 kHz (10 3 Hz) | 1 ms (10−3 s) |
| 1 MHz (10 6 Hz) | 1 μs (10−6 s) |
| 1 GHz (10 9 Hz) | 1 ns (10−9 s) |
| 1 THz (10 12 Hz) | 1 ps (10−12 s) |

*   [Rotational frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_frequency "Rotational frequency"), usually denoted by the Greek letter [_ν_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_(letter) "Nu (letter)") (nu), is defined as the instantaneous rate of change of the [number of rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_rotations "Number of rotations"), _N_, with respect to time: _ν_ = d _N_/d _t_; it is a type of frequency applied to [rotational motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_motion "Rotational motion").
*   [Angular frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency "Angular frequency"), usually denoted by the Greek letter [_ω_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_(letter) "Omega (letter)") (omega), is defined as the rate of change of [angular displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_displacement "Angular displacement") (during rotation), [_θ_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta "Theta") (theta), or the rate of change of the [phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves) "Phase (waves)") of a [sinusoidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave "Sine wave") waveform (notably in oscillations and waves), or as the rate of change of the [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function "Argument of a function") to the [sine function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_function "Sine function"):

![Image 6: {\displaystyle y(t)=\sin \theta (t)=\sin(\omega t)=\sin(2\mathrm {\pi } ft)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45524af174b06aad8c581e853b8368e4bc09783e)[![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \theta }{\mathrm {d} t}}=\omega =2\mathrm {\pi } f.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/205b0665c12fb880734dc68dc3ea72a1bbcb89be)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q161635)The unit of angular frequency is the [radian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian") per second (rad/s) but, for [discrete-time signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_signal "Discrete-time signal"), can also be expressed as radians per [sampling interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_interval "Sampling interval"), which is a [dimensionless quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity "Dimensionless quantity"). Angular frequency is frequency multiplied by 2 π.

In wave propagation
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frequency&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: In wave propagation")]

For periodic waves in [nondispersive media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_relation "Dispersion relation") (that is, media in which the wave speed is independent of frequency), frequency has an inverse relationship to the [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength"), _λ_ ([lambda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda "Lambda")). Even in dispersive media, the frequency _f_ of a [sinusoidal wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave "Sine wave") is equal to the [phase velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_velocity "Phase velocity")_v_ of the wave [divided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics) "Division (mathematics)") by the wavelength _λ_ of the wave: ![Image 8: {\displaystyle f={\frac {v}{\lambda }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/888f09904f5fa6e98f3e7dee005f1696c09910c0)

In the [special case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_case "Special case") of electromagnetic waves in [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"), then _v_ = _c_, where _c_ is the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") in vacuum, and this expression becomes ![Image 9: {\displaystyle f={\frac {c}{\lambda }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8c478df44b1179ad1b63bc286e0f247b859db5d9)

When [monochromatic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochromatic_radiation "Monochromatic radiation") travel from one [medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(optics) "Medium (optics)") to another, their frequency remains the same—only their wavelength and [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_speed "Phase speed") change.

Measurement of frequency can be done in the following ways:

Calculating the frequency of a repeating event is accomplished by counting the number of times that event occurs within a specific time period, then dividing the count by the period. For example, if 71 events occur within 15 seconds the frequency is: ![Image 10: {\displaystyle f={\frac {71}{15\,{\text{s}}}}\approx 4.73\,{\text{Hz}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/57f7e18bffda1c9ffdf7eb5733672b8de9f381f9) If the number of counts is not very large, it is more accurate to measure the time interval for a predetermined number of occurrences, rather than the number of occurrences within a specified time.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The latter method introduces a [random error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_error "Random error") into the count of between zero and one count, so on [average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average "Average") half a count. This is called _gating error_ and causes an average error in the calculated frequency of ![Image 11: {\textstyle \Delta f={\frac {1}{2T_{\text{m}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66e74b667ed2dd759d869c2cba88ae905c2c2cdc), or a fractional error of ![Image 12: {\textstyle {\frac {\Delta f}{f}}={\frac {1}{2fT_{\text{m}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97eaa9cc148ebae9308585211b78c29a26e0ab70) where ![Image 13: {\displaystyle T_{\text{m}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec5e24395517d85782d6d98612875ee34553e136) is the timing interval and ![Image 14: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) is the measured frequency. This error decreases with frequency, so it is generally a problem at low frequencies where the number of counts _N_ is small.

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Czestosciomierz-49.9Hz.jpg/330px-Czestosciomierz-49.9Hz.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Czestosciomierz-49.9Hz.jpg)

A resonant-reed frequency meter, an obsolete device used from about 1900 to the 1940s for measuring the frequency of alternating current. It consists of a strip of metal with reeds of graduated lengths, vibrated by an [electromagnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet "Electromagnet"). When the unknown frequency is applied to the electromagnet, the reed which is [resonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance "Resonance") at that frequency will vibrate with large amplitude, visible next to the scale.

An old method of measuring the frequency of rotating or vibrating objects is to use a [stroboscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroboscope "Stroboscope"). This is an intense repetitively flashing light ([strobe light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strobe_light "Strobe light")) whose frequency can be adjusted with a calibrated timing circuit. The strobe light is pointed at the rotating object and the frequency adjusted up and down. When the frequency of the strobe equals the frequency of the rotating or vibrating object, the object completes one cycle of oscillation and returns to its original position between the flashes of light, so when illuminated by the strobe the object appears stationary. Then the frequency can be read from the calibrated readout on the stroboscope. A downside of this method is that an object rotating at an integer multiple of the strobing frequency will also appear stationary.

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Frequency_counter.jpg/250px-Frequency_counter.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frequency_counter.jpg)

Modern frequency counter

Higher frequencies are usually measured with a [frequency counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_counter "Frequency counter"). This is an [electronic instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_instrumentation "Electronic instrumentation") which measures the frequency of an applied repetitive electronic [signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics) "Signal (electronics)") and displays the result in hertz on a [digital display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_display "Digital display"). It uses [digital logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_logic "Digital logic") to count the number of cycles during a time interval established by a precision [quartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_clock "Quartz clock") time base. Cyclic processes that are not electrical, such as the rotation rate of a shaft, mechanical vibrations, or [sound waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_wave "Sound wave"), can be converted to a repetitive electronic signal by [transducers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer "Transducer") and the signal applied to a frequency counter. As of 2018, frequency counters can cover the range up to about 100 GHz. This represents the limit of direct counting methods; frequencies above this must be measured by indirect methods.

Above the range of frequency counters, frequencies of electromagnetic signals are often measured indirectly utilizing [heterodyning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodyning "Heterodyning") ([frequency conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_changer "Frequency changer")). A reference signal of a known frequency near the unknown frequency is mixed with the unknown frequency in a nonlinear mixing device such as a [diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode "Diode"). This creates a [heterodyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodyne "Heterodyne") or "beat" signal at the difference between the two frequencies. If the two signals are close together in frequency the heterodyne is low enough to be measured by a frequency counter. This process only measures the difference between the unknown frequency and the reference frequency. To convert higher frequencies, several stages of heterodyning can be used. Current research is extending this method to infrared and light frequencies ([optical heterodyne detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_heterodyne_detection "Optical heterodyne detection")).

Complete spectrum of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") with the visible portion highlighted

Visible light is an [electromagnetic wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave "Electromagnetic wave"), consisting of oscillating [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") and [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") traveling through space. The frequency of the wave determines its color: 400 THz (4×10 14 Hz) is red light, 800 THz (8×10 14 Hz) is violet light, and between these (in the range 400–800 THz) are all the other colors of the [visible spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum "Visible spectrum"). An electromagnetic wave with a frequency less than 4×10 14 Hz will be invisible to the human eye; such waves are called [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared "Infrared") (IR) radiation. At even lower frequency, the wave is called a [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave"), and at still lower frequencies it is called a [radio wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave"). Likewise, an electromagnetic wave with a frequency higher than 8×10 14 Hz will also be invisible to the human eye; such waves are called [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") (UV) radiation. Even higher-frequency waves are called [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray"), and higher still are [gamma rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray "Gamma ray").

All of these waves, from the lowest-frequency radio waves to the highest-frequency gamma rays, are fundamentally the same, and they are all called [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation"). They all travel through vacuum at the same speed (the speed of light), giving them wavelengths inversely proportional to their frequencies. [![Image 19: {\displaystyle \displaystyle c=f\lambda ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3d59bfb44bbd4c234fabaa8337fa47f7579e2f94)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q2111) where _c_ is the speed of light (_c_ in vacuum or less in other media), _f_ is the frequency and _λ_ is the wavelength.

In [dispersive media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics) "Dispersion (optics)"), such as glass, the speed depends somewhat on frequency, so the wavelength is not quite inversely proportional to frequency.

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Ultrasound_range_diagram.svg/430px-Ultrasound_range_diagram.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ultrasound_range_diagram.svg)

The [sound wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_wave "Sound wave") spectrum, with rough guide of some applications

Sound propagates as mechanical vibration waves of pressure and displacement, in air or other substances.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-11) In general, frequency components of a sound determine its "color", its [timbre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre "Timbre"). When speaking about the frequency (in singular) of a sound, it means the property that most determines its [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music) "Pitch (music)").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-12)

The frequencies an ear can hear are limited to a [specific range of frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_hearing "Threshold of hearing"). The [audible frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audible_frequency "Audible frequency") range for humans is typically given as being between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (20 kHz), though the high frequency limit usually reduces with age. Other [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species") have different hearing ranges. For example, some dog breeds can perceive vibrations up to 60,000 Hz.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-Physics_Factbook-13)

In many media, such as air, the [speed of sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound "Speed of sound") is approximately independent of frequency, so the wavelength of the sound waves (distance between repetitions) is approximately inversely proportional to frequency.

In [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"), [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa"), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), southern [South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America"), most of [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia"), and [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), the frequency of the [alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current") in [household electrical outlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity "Mains electricity") is 50 Hz (close to the [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note "Musical note") G), whereas in [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") and northern South America, the frequency of the alternating current in household electrical outlets is 60 Hz (between the tones B♭ and B; that is, a [minor third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_third "Minor third") above the European frequency). The frequency of the '[hum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_hum "Mains hum")' in an [audio recording](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_recording "Audio recording") can show in which of these general regions the recording was made.

Aperiodic frequency

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frequency&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Aperiodic frequency")]

**Aperiodic frequency** is the [rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_(mathematics) "Rate (mathematics)") of incidence or occurrence of non-[cyclic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function "Periodic function") phenomena, including random processes such as [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay"). It is expressed with the unit [reciprocal second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_second "Reciprocal second") (s−1)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-14) or, in the case of radioactivity, with the unit [becquerel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becquerel "Becquerel").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-15)

It is defined as a [rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_(mathematics) "Rate (mathematics)"), _f_ = _N_/Δ _t_, involving the [number of entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_entities "Number of entities") counted or the number of [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(philosophy) "Event (philosophy)") happened (_N_) during a given [time duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") (Δ _t_);[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#cite_note-16) it is a [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity") of type [temporal rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_rate "Temporal rate").
