His streams typically consist of political and social commentary, gaming, and media consumption .

[ 4 ] As of 2025, Piker is the twenty-second-most-subscribed channel on the streaming platform Twitch .

[ 5 ] Early life and education Hasan Piker was born to Turkish parents in New Brunswick, New Jersey , but grew up in Istanbul and was raised as a Muslim .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] His father's family emigrated to Turkey from Thessaloniki and Crete , Greece.

[ 8 ] His father, Mehmet Behçet Piker, is a political scientist and economist who served on the Board of Directors (and as Vice President) of Sabancı Holding , and who is a founding member of the Future Party in Turkey.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] His mother, Ülker Sedef Piker, ( née Uygur ) [ 11 ] [ 12 ] is an art and architectural historian teaching at the New Jersey Institute of Technology .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] His uncle Cenk Uygur is a political commentator and co-founder of The Young Turks news network.

[ 15 ] Piker returned to the United States and attended the University of Miami , then transferred to Rutgers University , where he graduated cum laude with a double major in political science and communication studies in 2013.

[ 16 ] [ 7 ] In 2013, Piker moved to Los Angeles , California, after graduating from Rutgers University.

[ 17 ] In 2021, Piker purchased a $2.7 million 3,800-square-foot two-story house in West Hollywood, California .

[ 18 ] Most of Piker’s streams have been filmed in his house. Piker typically spends around 10 hours a day streaming in his studio.

[ 17 ] Career The Young Turks During his senior year of college in 2013, Piker interned for The Young Turks (TYT), a progressive news show and network co-founded by his uncle, Cenk Uygur . After graduating, Piker was hired by the network's ad sales and business department. He asked to host the show when a fill-in was needed and later became a host and producer.

[ 7 ] [ 19 ] In 2016, Piker created and hosted The Breakdown , a TYT Network video series which aired on Facebook and presented left-leaning political analyses targeted, at the time, at millennial supporters of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders .

[ 16 ] [ 19 ] Piker also contributed political content to HuffPost from 2016 to 2018.

[ 1 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Twitch Piker started streaming on Twitch in March 2018 while working at TYT.

[ 6 ] In January 2020, he left TYT to focus on his career as a Twitch streamer.

[ 22 ] Piker said that he shifted his attention from Facebook to Twitch in order to reach a younger audience and because of what he felt was a preponderance of right-wing commentators on YouTube and a lack of leftist representation among streamers.

[ 4 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] He became a popular left-wing political commentator, and was invited to appear on KTTV 's The Issue Is and the political podcast Chapo Trap House .

[ 4 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] His YouTube channel features highlights of his streams, and in 2022 reached over 1,000,000 subscribers.

[ 27 ] Piker also streams gameplay and commentary of video games on his Twitch channel.

[ 22 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Sometimes Piker will role-play as "Hank Pecker", an ethno-political caricature of a right-wing redneck .

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] Suspensions During a Twitch stream on August 20, 2019, Piker mocked U.S. Representative Dan Crenshaw , a SEAL Team 3 veteran who served in Afghanistan , for his support of American military interventionism overseas.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Piker said of Crenshaw, "What the fuck is wrong with this dude? Didn't he go to war and like, literally lose his eye because some mujahideen, a brave fucking soldier, fucked his eye-hole with their dick?", [ 34 ] [ 35 ] adding that Crenshaw "deserved" his fate.

[ 34 ] In the same stream, Piker criticized American foreign policy and made controversial comments relating to the September 11, 2001, attacks , including "America deserved 9/11." [ 33 ] [ 32 ] [ 35 ] His statements caused outrage on social media various other media outlets. Crenshaw said that Piker's comments were a "disgusting defense of the 9/11 terrorist attacks against Americans." In response, Piker described his comments as satirical and cited American foreign policy as promoting conditions to make an event like 9/11 possible, but acknowledged that he should have used "more precise" language.

[ 7 ] [ 32 ] Twitch banned Piker for one week due to the comments.

[ 35 ] On December 13, 2021, Piker was banned from Twitch for one week for using the racial epithet " cracker " repeatedly on stream. Piker argued the term should not be considered a slur against white people since a person using it is "powerless" and "doing it as someone who has been historically oppressed blowing off steam." [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] An August 2023 paper in New Media & Society criticized Twitch for punishing Piker while epithets aimed minority groups were prevalent on the platform.

[ 39 ] On February 28, 2025, Piker stated that if Republicans "cared about Medicare fraud, or Medicaid fraud, [they] would kill Rick Scott ", in a reference to Scott's involvement in Medicare and Medicaid fraud when he was the CEO of Columbia/HCA. Piker was banned for 24 hours by Twitch on March 3 in relation to the comment.

[ 40 ] On May 25, 2025, Piker was banned on Twitch for 24 hours after showing an alleged manifesto of Elias Rodriguez, the perpetrator of the 2025 Capital Jewish Museum shooting . Twitch banned Piker shortly after, citing their policy of "improper handling of terrorist propaganda".

[ 41 ] 2020 and 2024 US presidential elections On October 19, 2020, U.S. representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez collaborated with Piker and fellow Twitch streamer Pokimane to organize a stream of the Representative playing the popular multiplayer game Among Us for the " Get out the vote " initiative for the upcoming presidential election .

[ 22 ] [ 42 ] The stream aired the following day, featuring both Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar playing the game with Piker and other popular Twitch streamers, reaching a total concurrent viewership of almost 700,000.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] During the first 2020 United States presidential debate on September 29, Piker had over 125,000 viewers watching his commentary of the broadcast, the highest viewership of the debate on Twitch.

[ 46 ] Piker's stream covering the results of the 2020 United States presidential election peaked at 230,000 concurrent viewers and was the sixth most-watched source of election coverage across YouTube and Twitch, comprising 4.9% of the market share.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] He was the most watched Twitch streamer during the election week; his 80 hours of streams were viewed for a cumulative 6.8 million hours by an average of 75,000 concurrent viewers.

[ 6 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Piker's stream reached a new high of 231,000 viewers during the January 6 United States Capitol attack .

[ 53 ] Piker's 2024 election night coverage stream had 7.5 million total viewers.

[ 54 ] Coverage of the Gaza war Piker has regularly spoken about the Gaza war by advocating for Palestinians and criticizing the Israeli government.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] Andrew Marantz of The New Yorker noted that Piker's criticism of Israel, as well as his comments about Hamas , the Houthis , and Hezbollah , had generated controversy. The pro-Israel group StopAntisemitism nominated Piker as " Antisemite of the Year" in 2024.

[ 57 ] In January 2024, Piker interviewed a Yemeni self-proclaimed "pirate" who had filmed himself on board the Galaxy Leader , a Bahamas-flagged ship that has been held captive by Houthi militants since November 2023.

[ 58 ] In November 2024, congressman Ritchie Torres criticized Twitch for alleged "amplification of antisemitism ", specifically calling for an investigation into Piker.

[ 55 ] Piker defended himself, arguing that he did not criticize Jewish people as a whole and was only anti-Zionist .

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 59 ] A campaign by various commentators, including the streamer Destiny , pressured advertisers to leave Twitch due to the platforming of alleged antisemitism, including Piker's political commentary of the conflict.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] Both the pressure campaign and Ritchie Torres posted clips of Piker's channel they alleged to be antisemitic. Piker rejected the charge, arguing the clips were taken out of context.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 59 ] Because of the controversy, some advertisers have pulled advertisements.

[ 59 ] Fundraisers During the Russian invasion of Ukraine , Piker, in partnership with CARE , raised over $200,000 for Ukrainian relief funds while playing Elden Ring , with an average of over 70,000 people watching his coverage of the conflict.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] In the aftermath of the February 6, 2023, Turkey–Syria earthquake , Piker organized a fundraiser that was also contributed to and promoted by other streamers and content creators including Jacksepticeye , Valkyrae , Ludwig Ahgren and IShowSpeed . As of February 10 [update] , the fundraiser had raised over $1,200,000 for charities such as CARE International's Turkish and Syrian branches as well as two Turkish NGOs : the AKUT Search and Rescue Association , and Ahbap, which was founded by Turkish musician Haluk Levent .

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] During the Gaza war , Piker's charity drive on his channel raised over $1,000,000, as of October 21, 2023, for the Palestine Children's Relief Fund , American Near East Refugee Aid , Medical Aid for Palestinians , and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society .

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] Other ventures Since 2021, Piker has hosted the podcast Fear& (formerly Fear& Malding ) alongside his friend and fellow Twitch streamer, Will Neff .

[ 68 ] Streamers QTCinderella and AustinShow would later join the podcast as co-hosts in 2022.

[ 69 ] From September 26, 2021, to October 12, 2023, Piker co-hosted the left-leaning political podcast Leftovers with co-host Ethan Klein .

[ 68 ] [ 70 ] The two later had a public feud due to diverging views of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict . While both Klein and Piker accused Israel of genocide , Klein accused Piker of sympathizing with terrorism , while Piker accused Klein of racism .

[ 71 ] Views and political beliefs Piker's content has been identified as a progressive , leftist , and socialist .

[ 4 ] [ 6 ] [ 27 ] [ 72 ] He has advocated in favor of workplace democracy , [ 73 ] universal health care , [ 74 ] LGBTQ+ rights , [ 74 ] anti-Zionism [ 57 ] and gun control .

[ 75 ] Andrew Marantz of The New Yorker described Piker as anti-Trump but "hardly a loyal Democrat ". Instead, Marantz classified Piker as an "old-school leftist", critical of the " American empire ".

[ 57 ] In an interview with GQ magazine, Piker stated that his goal was to push the Democratic Party to be more progressive.

[ 71 ] Piker has cited his upbringing in Turkey under the Premiership of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as an influence on both his left-wing views and willingness to speak out about them.

[ 27 ] [ 19 ] He has mentioned Amy Goodman , Jon Stewart , Aaron McGruder and Bill Burr as influences on the content and style of his streams.

[ 76 ] Piker supported the presidential primary campaigns of Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020 , [ 77 ] and has been an outspoken critic of both the Democratic and Republican parties.

[ 7 ] [ 78 ] Piker opposed Donald Trump 's travel ban in 2017.

[ 19 ] [ 79 ] Following the arrest of Luigi Mangione (the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson), Piker supported Mangione and praised the tactic of the propaganda of the deed on his stream, but avoided breaking Twitch's terms of service rules regarding glorification of violence.

[ 57 ] Customs and Border Patrol questioning In May 2025, Piker was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago after returning from a trip to France. According to Piker, the officials who questioned him during his detainment knew who he was and asked him detailed questions about his views on Donald Trump, Israel, Houthi rebels, Hamas and his bans from Twitch. Piker believes that he was detained due to his political views and that his detainment is part of intimidation tactics by the Trump administration to silence political opposition. Tricia McLaughlin, the Assistant Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security , accused Piker of "lying for likes" and claimed that it was a "routine" inspection that any traveler could be subjected to.

[ 80 ] Reception Piker in 2021 Piker has been described as Twitch's " de facto political commentator" who uses an unabashedly ideological framing.

[ 81 ] Outlets dedicated to video game culture and youth culture have covered Piker's streams positively. In particular, journalists have noted his ability to "combine information and entertainment," [ 19 ] [ 81 ] and to approach left-wing political coverage in a way that is relatable and accessible to Twitch viewers, who may feel out of touch with cable news .

[ 47 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 60 ] Some authors also cite Piker's vulgar, animated style of expression and his physical appearance as notable factors behind his popularity.

[ 19 ] [ 82 ] [ 84 ] In July 2024, Alex Mahadevan of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies cited Piker as an example of the "online chattering class" who do not hold themselves to journalistic ethics , in contrast to their peers in traditional media .

[ 85 ] A September 2024 article in the academic journal Digital Journalism discussed a similar theme, characterizing Piker as emblematic of an emerging "Newsfluencers" class ( influencers who mainly cover news) with a tendency towards "problematic behavior" that conflicted with journalistic objectivity.

[ 84 ] In April 2024, a contributor to the same journal noted that Piker is familiar with journalistic mechanics such as sourcing, framing, and objectivity, but rejects these as methods used for "manufacturing consent for elites".

[ 81 ] Instead, Piker mainly sources his information from social media, often supplied to him by his audience.

[ 81 ] The Washington Post has also categorized Piker as a news-based influencer who does not feel bound to journalistic objectivity.

[ 60 ] Andrew Marantz of The New Yorker noted that Piker was controversial on both the political left and the right : "When Piker is criticized by the right, it’s usually for soft-pedalling the brutality of Hamas , or the Houthis , or the Chinese Communist Party ... By the left, he is more likely to be dismissed as a limousine socialist who lives in a $2.7-million house." [ 57 ] According to Kieran Press-Reynolds of GQ magazine, Piker was also controversial among liberals and the Democratic Party , the cause of which Piker attributed to his criticism of Israel .

[ 71 ] However, Marantz also wrote that Piker's tolerance of controversy and appeal to young men made him an ideal candidate for the " Joe Rogan of the left".

[ 57 ] Kieran Press-Reynolds of GQ magazine reported that Piker had previously been criticized for playing other content creators' videos on his streams while he was off-camera. In an interview with Press-Reynolds, Piker acknowledged that he had responded to the criticism, dubbed "Reactgate", poorly, and apologized.

[ 71 ] Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Piker apologized for insisting in the prelude that Russia would not attack. "[I] didn't think a regional power would act so irrationally. I've admitted my mistakes. I got things wrong," stated Piker.

[ 60 ] Awards and nominations Gaming website Kotaku selected Piker as one of their "Gamers of the Year" for 2020, citing him as a major figure in the mainstreaming of political commentary on Twitch, a platform which in the past was seen as discouraging to political discussion.

[ 52 ] [ 83 ] [ 86 ] Piker won a Streamy in the News category at the 10th annual awards in 2020 and was nominated again in the same category for the 2021 event .

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] In 2022, Piker was nominated in the categories News, Just Chatting, and Streamer of the Year, winning the News award for the second time and being nominated for three consecutive years.

Halkias : By the way, I was doing a little research ... your family immigrated from where, Hasan?

Piker : Oh my god ... my mother's side is all the way from Kudüs, so they have like Arabic descent – and y'know Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, all that stuff. My father's side on the other hand, is from Selanik and Crete.

Halkias : I don't know about Selanik, they say something else on the internet ... "his father's family emigrated to Turkey from Drama, Greece." Piker : Wait, that's not correct.

Halkias : (laughs) Well, that's what the internet says. So, whatever part of him that of him that's successful, that's the Greek part, folks. And the backstabbing, conniving, uh.. other stuff, Turk. (laughs) Piker : I don't know why it says Drama ... my grandfather that I'm named after ... is from Selanik and then my grandmother is from Crete. So we hit the mainland and the islands, y'know what I mean? We got it all.
