[ 2 ] In December 2019 the institute's activities were suspended.

[ 3 ] The NAI is a virtual, [ 4 ] distributed organization that integrates astrobiology research and training programs in concert with the national and international science communities.

[ 5 ] History [ edit ] Although NASA had explored the idea of forming an astrobiology institute in the past, when the Viking biological experiments returned negative results for life on Mars , the public lost interest and federal funds for exobiology dried up. In 1996, the announcement of possible traces of ancient life in the Allan Hills 84001 meteorite from Mars led to new interest in the subject. At the same time, NASA developed the Origins Program , broadening its reach from exobiology to astrobiology , the study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe.

[ 1 ] In 1998, $9 million was set aside to fund the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI), an interdisciplinary research effort using the expertise of different scientific research institutions and universities from across the country, centrally linked to Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California .

Gerald Soffen former Project Scientist with the Viking program , helped coordinate the new institute.

[ 1 ] In May, [ 5 ] NASA selected eleven science teams, each with a Principal Investigator (PI).

[ 6 ] NAI was established in July with Scott Hubbard as interim Director.

[ 5 ] Nobel laureate Baruch S. Blumberg was appointed the first Director of the institute, and served from May 15, 1999 – October 14, 2002.

[ 7 ] Program [ edit ] The NASA Astrobiology Program includes the NAI as one of four components, including the Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology Program; the Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development (ASTID) Program; and the Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP) Program.

[ 2 ] Program budgets for fiscal year 2008 were as follows: NAI, $16 million; Grants for the Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology Program, $11 million; ASTID, $9 million; ASTEP, $5 million.

[ 5 ] Teams [ edit ] Joint Russian-NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) expedition studying microbial life in extreme environments in the crater of Mutnovsky Volcano in Kamchatka, far east Russia.

As of 2018, the NAI has 10 teams including about 600 researchers distributed across ~100 institutions. It also has 13 international partner organizations. Some past and present teams are: [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Arizona State University Carnegie Institution of Washington Georgia Institute of Technology Harvard University Indiana University Jet Propulsion Laboratory Johnson Space Center Massachusetts Institute of Technology Marine Biological Laboratory Michigan State University Montana State University NASA Ames Research Center NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Pennsylvania State University Rutgers University Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Scripps Research Institute SETI Institute University of Arizona University of California, Berkeley University of California, Los Angeles University of California, Santa Cruz University of Colorado, Boulder University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa University of Rhode Island University of Washington University of Wisconsin Virtual Planetary Laboratory International partners [ edit ] NAI has partnership program with other international astrobiology organizations to provide collaborative opportunities for its researchers within the global science community.

NASA Astrobiology Institute awarded the SETI Institute $5 million spread over five years for 10 projects, including one that feeds directly into the search for intelligent life. This project aims to target specific solar systems that are likely to support life, and will use telescopes to screen a type of star called an M-star Dick, Steven J. (2005).
