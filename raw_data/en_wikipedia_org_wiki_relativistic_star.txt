The first such object to be identified was radio pulsars , which consist of rotating neutron stars . Rotating supermassive stars are a hypothetical form of a relativistic star.

[ 3 ] Relativistic stars are one possible source to allow gravitational waves to be studied.

Another definition of a relativistic star is one with the equation of state of a special relativistic gas. This can happen when the core of a massive main-sequence star becomes hot enough to generate electron - positron pairs . Stability analysis shows that such a star is only marginally bound, and is unstable to either collapse or explode . This instability is believed to limit the mass of main-sequence stars to a couple of hundred solar masses or so. Stars of this size and larger are able to directly collapse into a black hole of either intermediate or supermassive size.
