Babenko [ ru ] and William E. Beckner ) is a sharpened form of the Hausdorff–Young inequality having applications to uncertainty principles in the Fourier analysis of L p spaces .  The ( q , p )-norm of the n -dimensional Fourier transform is defined to be [ 1 ] ‖ ‖ F ‖ ‖ q , p = sup f ∈ ∈ L p ( R n ) ‖ ‖ F f ‖ ‖ q ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ p , where 1 < p ≤ ≤ 2 , and 1 p + 1 q = 1.

{\displaystyle \|{\mathcal {F}}\|_{q,p}=\sup _{f\in L^{p}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})}{\frac {\|{\mathcal {F}}f\|_{q}}{\|f\|_{p}}},{\text{ where }}1<p\leq 2,{\text{ and }}{\frac {1}{p}}+{\frac {1}{q}}=1.} In 1961, Babenko [ 2 ] found this norm for even integer values of q .  Finally, in 1975, using Hermite functions as eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform, Beckner [ 3 ] proved that the value of this norm for all q ≥ ≥ 2 {\displaystyle q\geq 2} is ‖ ‖ F ‖ ‖ q , p = ( p 1 / p / q 1 / q ) n / 2 .

{\displaystyle \|{\mathcal {F}}\|_{q,p}=\left(p^{1/p}/q^{1/q}\right)^{n/2}.} Thus we have the Babenko–Beckner inequality that ‖ ‖ F f ‖ ‖ q ≤ ≤ ( p 1 / p / q 1 / q ) n / 2 ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ p .

{\displaystyle \|{\mathcal {F}}f\|_{q}\leq \left(p^{1/p}/q^{1/q}\right)^{n/2}\|f\|_{p}.} To write this out explicitly, (in the case of one dimension,) if the Fourier transform is normalized so that g ( y ) ≈ ≈ ∫ ∫ R e − − 2 π π i x y f ( x ) d x and f ( x ) ≈ ≈ ∫ ∫ R e 2 π π i x y g ( y ) d y , {\displaystyle g(y)\approx \int _{\mathbb {R} }e^{-2\pi ixy}f(x)\,dx{\text{ and }}f(x)\approx \int _{\mathbb {R} }e^{2\pi ixy}g(y)\,dy,} then we have ( ∫ ∫ R | g ( y ) | q d y ) 1 / q ≤ ≤ ( p 1 / p / q 1 / q ) 1 / 2 ( ∫ ∫ R | f ( x ) | p d x ) 1 / p {\displaystyle \left(\int _{\mathbb {R} }|g(y)|^{q}\,dy\right)^{1/q}\leq \left(p^{1/p}/q^{1/q}\right)^{1/2}\left(\int _{\mathbb {R} }|f(x)|^{p}\,dx\right)^{1/p}} or more simply ( q ∫ ∫ R | g ( y ) | q d y ) 1 / q ≤ ≤ ( p ∫ ∫ R | f ( x ) | p d x ) 1 / p .

{\displaystyle \left({\sqrt {q}}\int _{\mathbb {R} }|g(y)|^{q}\,dy\right)^{1/q}\leq \left({\sqrt {p}}\int _{\mathbb {R} }|f(x)|^{p}\,dx\right)^{1/p}.} Main ideas of proof [ edit ] Throughout this sketch of a proof, let 1 < p ≤ ≤ 2 , 1 p + 1 q = 1 , and ω ω = 1 − − p = i p − − 1 .

{\displaystyle 1<p\leq 2,\quad {\frac {1}{p}}+{\frac {1}{q}}=1,\quad {\text{and}}\quad \omega ={\sqrt {1-p}}=i{\sqrt {p-1}}.} (Except for q , we will more or less follow the notation of Beckner.) The two-point lemma [ edit ] Let d ν ν ( x ) {\displaystyle d\nu (x)} be the discrete measure with weight 1 / 2 {\displaystyle 1/2} at the points x = ± ± 1.

{\displaystyle x=\pm 1.} Then the operator C : a + b x → → a + ω ω b x {\displaystyle C:a+bx\rightarrow a+\omega bx} maps L p ( d ν ν ) {\displaystyle L^{p}(d\nu )} to L q ( d ν ν ) {\displaystyle L^{q}(d\nu )} with norm 1; that is, [ ∫ ∫ | a + ω ω b x | q d ν ν ( x ) ] 1 / q ≤ ≤ [ ∫ ∫ | a + b x | p d ν ν ( x ) ] 1 / p , {\displaystyle \left[\int |a+\omega bx|^{q}d\nu (x)\right]^{1/q}\leq \left[\int |a+bx|^{p}d\nu (x)\right]^{1/p},} or more explicitly, [ | a + ω ω b | q + | a − − ω ω b | q 2 ] 1 / q ≤ ≤ [ | a + b | p + | a − − b | p 2 ] 1 / p {\displaystyle \left[{\frac {|a+\omega b|^{q}+|a-\omega b|^{q}}{2}}\right]^{1/q}\leq \left[{\frac {|a+b|^{p}+|a-b|^{p}}{2}}\right]^{1/p}} for any complex a , b .  (See Beckner's paper for the proof of his "two-point lemma".) A sequence of Bernoulli trials [ edit ] The measure d ν ν {\displaystyle d\nu } that was introduced above is actually a fair Bernoulli trial with mean 0 and variance 1.  Consider the sum of a sequence of n such Bernoulli trials, independent and normalized so that the standard deviation remains 1.  We obtain the measure d ν ν n ( x ) {\displaystyle d\nu _{n}(x)} which is the n -fold convolution of d ν ν ( n x ) {\displaystyle d\nu ({\sqrt {n}}x)} with itself.  The next step is to extend the operator C defined on the two-point space above to an operator defined on the ( n + 1)-point space of d ν ν n ( x ) {\displaystyle d\nu _{n}(x)} with respect to the elementary symmetric polynomials .

Convergence to standard normal distribution [ edit ] The sequence d ν ν n ( x ) {\displaystyle d\nu _{n}(x)} converges weakly to the standard normal probability distribution d μ μ ( x ) = 1 2 π π e − − x 2 / 2 d x {\displaystyle d\mu (x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}e^{-x^{2}/2}\,dx} with respect to functions of polynomial growth.  In the limit, the extension of the operator C above in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials with respect to the measure d ν ν n ( x ) {\displaystyle d\nu _{n}(x)} is expressed as an operator T in terms of the Hermite polynomials with respect to the standard normal distribution.  These Hermite functions are the eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform, and the ( q , p )-norm of the Fourier transform is obtained as a result after some renormalization.
