The Revaluation of All Values was also the working title of a series of four books Nietzsche was planning to write, only the first of which— The Antichrist —he ever completed. However, one of his schemas for The Will to Power used "The Revaluation of All Values" as a subtitle, and it was this scheme that his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche used to assemble his notes into the final book with that title.
