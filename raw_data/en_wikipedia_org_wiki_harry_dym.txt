Dym's research interests included operator theory , interpolation theory, and inverse problems .

Dym earned his Ph.D. in 1965 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , under the supervision of Henry McKean .

[ 1 ] He introduced the Dym equation , which bears his name.

[ 2 ] Dym died on July 18, 2024, at the age of 86.
