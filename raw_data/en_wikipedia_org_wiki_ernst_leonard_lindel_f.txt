Lindelöf spaces are named after him. He was the son of mathematician Lorenz Leonard Lindelöf and brother of the philologist Uno Lorenz Lindelöf [ fi ] .

[ 1 ] He was secretary of the Finnish Society of Science and Letters (societas scientiarum Fennica) in its centenary year, 1938.

[ 2 ] Biography [ edit ] Lindelöf studied at the University of Helsinki , where he completed his PhD in 1893, became a docent in 1895 and professor of Mathematics in 1903. He was a member of the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters .

In addition to working in a number of different mathematical domains including complex analysis , conformal mappings , topology , ordinary differential equations and the gamma function , Lindelöf promoted the study of the history of Finnish mathematics. He is known for the Picard–Lindelöf theorem on differential equations and the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle , one of several refinements of the maximum modulus principle that he proved in complex function theory . He was the PhD supervisor for Lars Ahlfors at the University of Helsinki .
