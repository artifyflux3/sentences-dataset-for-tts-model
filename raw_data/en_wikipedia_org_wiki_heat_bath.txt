[ 1 ] As a conceptual simplification, it effectively functions as an infinite pool of thermal energy at a given, constant temperature. Since it can act as an inertial source and sink of heat, it is often also referred to as a heat reservoir or heat bath .

Lakes, oceans and rivers often serve as thermal reservoirs in geophysical processes, such as the weather. In atmospheric science , large air masses in the atmosphere often function as thermal reservoirs.

Since the temperature of a thermal reservoir T does not change during the heat transfer , the change of entropy in the reservoir is: d S Res = δ δ Q T {\displaystyle dS_{\text{Res}}={\frac {\delta Q}{T}}} where δ δ Q {\displaystyle \delta Q} is the incremental reversible transfer of heat energy into the reservoir.

The microcanonical partition sum Z ( E ) {\displaystyle Z(E)} of a heat bath of temperature T has the property: Z ( E + Δ Δ E ) = Z ( E ) e Δ Δ E / k B T {\displaystyle Z(E+\Delta E)=Z(E)e^{\Delta E/k_{\text{B}}T}} where k B {\displaystyle k_{\text{B}}} is the Boltzmann constant . It thus changes by the same factor when a given amount of energy is added. The exponential factor in this expression can be identified with the reciprocal of the Boltzmann factor .

For an engineering application, see geothermal heat pump .
