The National Journalism Center ( NJC ) is an American conservative political organization established in 1977 by conservative journalist M. Stanton Evans . Its president is Scott Walker , former Republican governor of Wisconsin , who is also president of Young America's Foundation . The current program director is Becket Adams, who has written for conservative publications including the Washington Examiner and the National Review .

[ 1 ] The NJC runs programs and internships for journalism students to educate them on professional journalism and conservative political issues and values.

Internships [ edit ] The 12-week Washington, D.C.

–based program places interns at news outlets where they work four days a week. Placements have included Newsmax , The Daily Caller , The Washington Free Beacon , Catholic News Service , RealClearReligion , and Red Alert Politics . Participants also attend a weekly seminar at Young America's Foundation headquarters in Reston, Virginia . Additional reported program activities have included a six-week course on investigative reporting from a Free Beacon journalist and visits to National Rifle Association headquarters where interns shot AR-15 rifles and AK-47s .

[ 2 ] Though the program does not accept or deny placement in regard to political preference, intern placements are often in well-known conservative publications. Internships draw from the United States and Canada .  Each intern is given a monthly stipend ($1,000 a month as of 2015).

[ 2 ] Weekly discussion groups on issues are held at the National Press Club , where the NJC offices are located.  Guest speakers include journalists, alumni, and lobbyists that share the NJC's political stance. Academic directors moderate discussion groups following breakfast.

[ citation needed ] Controversies [ edit ] In the 1990s a number of NJC alumni worked with tobacco company Philip Morris USA as part of a campaign to generate public distrust of the United States Environmental Protection Agency risk assessment report on Environmental Tobacco Smoke . Philip Morris financially supported the NJC in order to gain access to alumni journalists.

[ 3 ] Some participants have stated that NJC's internship programs encourage conservative students to enter and ideologically diversify media organizations accused of showing a liberal bias .

[ 2 ] Notable alumni [ edit ] Alumni of journalism include: [ 4 ] Ann Coulter , conservative author, commentator and columnist Michael Fumento , conservative author and attorney John Fund , columnist, National Review Online and senior editor, The American Spectator Maggie Gallagher , conservative author, commentator and columnist Malcolm Gladwell , Canadian author, journalist and staff writer, The New Yorker Daniel T. Griswold , co-director of the Program on the American Economy and Globalization, Mercatus Center Greg Gutfeld , Fox News television host and author Steven F.
