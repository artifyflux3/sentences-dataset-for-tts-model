It is a companion work of his Gesta Pontificum Anglorum ( Deeds of the English Bishops ) and was followed by his Historia Novella , which continued its account for several more years.

[ 1 ] The portions of the work concerning the First Crusade were derived from Gesta Francorum Iherusalem peregrinantium , a chronicle by Fulcher of Chartres .
