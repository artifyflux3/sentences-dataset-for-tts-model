Albert Einstein College of Medicine Motto Science at the heart of medicine Type Private medical school Established 1953 ; 72 years ago ( 1953 ) Parent institution Montefiore Health System Dean Yaron Tomer Academic staff 2,061 (2025) [ 1 ] Students 789 (2025) [ 1 ] Location The Bronx , New York City , New York , U.S.

Campus Urban Website www .einsteinmed .edu The Albert Einstein College of Medicine is a private medical school in New York City . Founded in 1953, Einstein is an independent degree-granting institution within the Montefiore Einstein Health System .

Einstein hosts MD , PhD , and masters programs. Admission to its MD program is highly selective, with an acceptance rate of 1.85% in 2024. Joint masters are offered with the City University of New York and Yeshiva University 's Cardozo School of Law . Einstein is also home to one of the first three Medical Scientist Training Programs inaugurated in 1964. This joint MD/PhD program has received continuous funding from the National Institutes of Health .

Planning for the college was initiated by Yeshiva University President Samuel Belkin in 1945. Physicist Albert Einstein , who noted that the college would be unique as it would provide medical training to "students of all creeds and races", [ 2 ] lent his name to the institution. Due to Yeshiva's financial difficulties, Einstein was transferred to Montefiore in 2015. Following a $1 billion donation to the school by Ruth Gottesman in 2024, Einstein became tuition-free for all MD students.

Einstein houses several NIH-designated centers and has contributed to major medical advances, including the first coronary artery bypass surgery . Faculty members have included 18 members of the National Academy of Sciences , three National Medal of Science recipients, and neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks . Alumni have made significant scientific contributions and include seven members of the National Academy of Sciences, two Howard Hughes Medical Investigators , a MacArthur Fellow , a National Medal of Science awardee, a National Medal of Technology recipient, and one governor .

History [ edit ] Founding [ edit ] College namesake Albert Einstein (center) examines a model of the campus in 1953, and, at right, New York Attorney General Nathaniel Goldstein , Governor Thomas Dewey , and Yeshiva University head Samuel Belkin during the college's groundbreaking.

In 1945, Yeshiva University President Samuel Belkin began planning a new medical school.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ note 1 ] Under his urging, Yeshiva's Board of Trustees negotiated with the New York State Board of Regents to expand the university's charter to grant MD degrees, finalized in December 1950.

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] In 1951, physicist Albert Einstein wrote a letter to Belkin lauding the planned school, writing that it was "of the greatest importance to American Jewry" and would "welcome students of all creeds and races". He became an honorary chairman for the medical school campaign, alongside former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt , New York Governor Thomas Dewey , and Richard Nixon .

[ 2 ] When approached, Einstein was initially reluctant to associate his name with the school—he had recently refused to lend his name to Brandeis University and had declined to become the second president of Israel —and instead suggested that it be named for the Jewish physician Maimonides .

[ 2 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Two years later, at an event marking his 74th birthday, March 14, 1953, Einstein agreed to lend his name to the medical school.

[ 2 ] [ 8 ] [ note 2 ] At the gathering—his only public appearance in 22 years at the Institute for Advanced Study —Einstein told The New York Times that "physics has favored medicine by giving civilized man confidence in the scientific method." [ 6 ] [ 9 ] In 1954, the college sponsored the awarding of that year's Albert Einstein Award to physicist Richard Feynman and, on his 75th birthday, gifted Einstein a Festschrift with contributions from ten Nobel laureates, Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharett , and President Harry S. Truman , among others.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Einstein died on April 18, 1955, months prior to the institution's dedication and opening.

[ 2 ] Although affiliation with Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan was considered, a site in the Bronx 's Morris Park was selected due to ample land and proximity to the adjacent Bronx Municipal Hospital then under construction.

[ 12 ] Construction of the first medical school building—now the Leo Forchheimer Medical Sciences Building—began in October 1953, with a contemporary design of steel and concrete.

[ 6 ] [ 13 ] On September 12, 1955, Einstein welcomed its first class of 56 students in the partially completed Forchheimer Building.

[ 3 ] [ 14 ] Einstein was the first new medical school to open in New York City since 1897 and the first in the United States to open under Jewish auspices.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Expansion [ edit ] Family matriarch Rose Kennedy during the 1966 ground-breaking of the Rose F. Kennedy Center, with Senator Robert F. Kennedy to her left The Sue Golding Graduate Division was established in 1957 to offer Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in biomedical science . In 1963, Einstein established its Department of Genetics, the first at any at any medical school; [ 17 ] the coursework it offered was possibly the first formal medical curriculum on genetics.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] The following year, the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP), a combined MD/PhD program, was established.

[ 20 ] The first successful coronary artery bypass surgery was performed in 1960 at Einstein by a team led by Robert H. Goetz ; [ 21 ] [ 22 ] the procedure has been described in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery as "one of the most significant surgical achievements of the 20th century".

[ 22 ] In 1966, the school completed a 375-bed private teaching hospital—now known as the Jack D. Weiler Hospital—with New York City Mayor John Lindsay presiding over its opening.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] The Ullmann Research Center for Health Sciences, a 12-story facility, opened in 1964.

[ 25 ] The following year, the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation donated $1.45 million to Einstein to establish a center to study human development and mental disabilities.

[ 26 ] [ note 3 ] The center, named for Rose F. Kennedy , opened with 200 staff scientists in 1970.

[ 3 ] [ 29 ] Also that year, the college began construction on the 15-story Charles C. and Beulah Bassine Educational Center devoted to public health.

[ 30 ] Beginning in 1971, aided by a five-year, $12,157,000 federal grant, the college experimented with a 3-year MD degree pathway and increased class sizes.

[ 31 ] Post-1990 [ edit ] First Lady Jill Biden (far right) at a cancer awareness event at Einstein, 2021 In 1990, following cumulative $8.5 million donations by Bronx businessman Jack Resnick, Einstein's campus was designated as the Jack and Pearl Resnick Campus.

[ 32 ] Six years later, Einstein built a 10-story research complex, the Samuel H. and Rachel Golding Building.

[ 3 ] In 2002, the college opened the three-story Gruss Magnetic Resonance Research Center. Equipped with magnetic resonance equipment beyond conventional MRI, the center was one of six such facilities in the world upon opening.

[ 33 ] In 2008, Einstein opened a $225 million research complex, the Price Center.

[ 34 ] This expansion doubled the size of Einstein's campus to nearly 40 acres.

[ 35 ] Also that year, the college replaced its old logo—a "staid" portrait of Albert Einstein—with a stylized symbol that represents the helical structure of DNA , a notable spiral staircase on campus, and 'E' for Einstein.

[ 34 ] In 2024, Ruth Gottesman —a long-time professor at the medical school and head of the board of trustees—donated $1 billion to the school to make tuition free for all students in perpetuity.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] The contribution also stipulated that the college never change its name. The donation was one of the largest to any educational institution, and, according to The New York Times , likely the largest donation to any medical school.

[ 36 ] Organization and affiliations [ edit ] Einstein comprises 30 academic departments, spanning clinical care and both basic and translational research .

[ 38 ] The college's chief academic officer is the Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean, a position held by Yaron Tomer since 2023.

[ 39 ] The Board of Trustees consists of three officers—Chair Ruth Gottesman , treasurer Nathan Gantcher, and Montefiore Einstein CEO and President Philip Ozuah as of 2025—and 28 members.

[ 40 ] Montefiore [ edit ] See also: Montefiore Einstein Medical Center Financier Moses Montefiore (left) and Montefiore's Moses Campus (right) in the Bronx Einstein's parent institution, Montefiore Health System, is a private non-profit healthcare system and one of the largest employers in New York.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] It comprises 15 member hospitals, including Montefiore Einstein Medical Center and Children's Hospital at Montefiore , and has the busiest emergency room in New York City and the ninth busiest in the United States.

[ 42 ] The system was founded in 1884 and is named for Moses Montefiore , a British financier and the Sheriff of London .

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] Einstein first became affiliated with Montefiore in 1963, with Montefiore attending physicians serving as Einstein faculty.

[ 14 ] By 1969, financial troubles led Yeshiva University to contract its Jack D. Weiler Hospital to the Montefiore Medical Center.

[ 13 ] [ 45 ] In 1980, the college's Department of Medicine merged with Montefiore.

[ 23 ] In the 2010s, Yeshiva University's mounting financial troubles—caused in part by Einstein's high operational costs and a $110 million loss to Bernie Madoff 's Ponzi scheme in 2008—led the university to transfer ownership of the medical school to Montefiore in 2015.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] Although the deal's details were largely kept private, Einstein became a new entity with 51 percent ownership by Montefiore and 49 percent by Yeshiva. Montefiore assumed all operational and financial responsibilities.

[ 46 ] Yeshiva continued to grant Einstein's degrees until 2019, when the medical school achieved independent degree-granting authority.

[ 48 ] In 2021, Yeshiva and Montefiore launched a joint BA/BS-MD program for students entering Yeshiva.

[ 49 ] Jacobi [ edit ] Main article: Jacobi Medical Center Jacobi Medical Center In conjunction with the construction of Einstein's first building, New York City constructed a 1,349-bed, $37.5 million hospital adjacent to the school.

[ 6 ] [ 14 ] Now the Jacobi Medical Center , Belkin and New York City Mayor Vincent Impellitteri agreed to permit its use as Einstein's teaching hospital .

[ 3 ] [ 6 ] [ 14 ] Jacobi is a member of NYC Health + Hospitals , the largest municipal health system in the United States.

[ 50 ] Student body and life [ edit ] As of 2025, Einstein had 789 medical students according to U.S. News & World Report .

[ 1 ] Admission to Einstein's MD program is highly selective, [ 51 ] with an acceptance rate of 1.85% in 2024. All students are awarded the full-tuition Gottesman Scholarship. The average post-scholarship cost of attendance for all four years is $138,000. New York residents comprise 44 percent of MD students.

[ 52 ] Einstein offers housing for students and postdoctoral researchers.

[ 53 ] Student housing consists of three 28-story towers built in 1970.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] Living spaces include studios, three-bedroom penthouses, and one-, two-, or three-bedroom apartments.

[ 55 ] The campus also hosts a recreational facility, the Falk Center, that houses a gym, pool, and courts for basketball, racquetball, and squash.

[ 55 ] An underground parking garage is located on campus.

[ 53 ] [ 55 ] Academic programs [ edit ] MD program [ edit ] Part of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine campus The first 16 months of the MD program, the preclerkship phase, consists of fundamental scientific and medical coursework. Multi-semester courses include bioethics and service learning.

[ 56 ] This is followed by a 12 month clinical phase that includes clerkships and preparation for and completion of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 . Clerkships are followed by completion of the USMLE Step 2 exam . The final 18 months of medical school include clinical electives, increased clinical duties, and a research capstone project.

[ 57 ] In addition to Jacobi and Montefiore hospitals, medical students can train in medical facilities such as the VA Bronx Healthcare System and Bronx Psychiatric Center .

[ 58 ] Students may also volunteer at the Einstein Community Health Outreach (ECHO) Free Clinic, which provides care to those without health insurance. Founded in 1999, ECHO was the first such clinic in New York City and one of the first in the United States.

[ 59 ] Medical Scientist Training Program [ edit ] Further information: Medical Scientist Training Program Einstein hosts one of the three inaugural MSTPs launched by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1964.

[ 20 ] These fully-funded dual doctoral MD/PhD programs provide integrated graduate and clinical training for aspiring physician-scientists .

[ 20 ] [ 60 ] The program includes waived tuition, a stipend, subsidized housing, and a sesquiennial retreat to the Edith Macy Conference Center .

[ 61 ] The first year of the program integrates medical school preclerkship curriculum with graduate school coursework and lab rotations . In the second year, trainees complete preclinical medical courses, take USMLE Step 1, and choose a PhD advisor based on lab rotations. Years three to five focus on PhD research, publication, and optional clinical activities, followed by intensive clinical clerkships in years six and seven after dissertation defense.

[ 62 ] While working in the lab, students engage in both pathology case studies and clinics to maintain clinical skills.

[ 61 ] PhD program [ edit ] The Graduate Division of Biomedical Sciences hosts an "umbrella" PhD program that is not confined to a specific department.

[ 63 ] In 2023, the program had 39  matriculants.

[ 64 ] Students undertake three lab rotations before selecting a mentor.

[ 65 ] A concentration in clinical investigation is offered for both PhD and MD/PhD candidates.

[ 66 ] PhD students receive full tuition remission, a stipend, and subsidized housing.

[ 67 ] Master's degree programs [ edit ] A Master of Science in Bioethics is offered with Yeshiva's Cardozo School of Law .

To provide a deeper scientific foundation for MD students, Einstein hosts the five-year Clinical Research Training Program (CRTP). The CRTP confers a Master of Science and requires an additional year of courses on clinical research methods. Students may also graduate with distinction in research for their medical degree.

[ 68 ] With Yeshiva's Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law , Einstein offers both a certificate and Master of Science in Bioethics .

[ 69 ] The program covers clinical bioethics consultation, healthcare ethics policy, and human subject research. Einstein also offers MD students a joint Master of Public Health degree with the City University of New York (CUNY). This Einstein-CUNY MD-MPH program lasts five years.

[ 68 ] Research [ edit ] Research centers [ edit ] Van Etten Building In 2024, Einstein received $192 million in funding from the NIH.

[ 70 ] The college hosts over 200 individual laboratories.

[ 63 ] NIH-designated research centers include: [ 38 ] Diabetes Research Center Einstein-Rockefeller-CUNY Center for AIDS Research Harold and Muriel Block Institute for Clinical and Translational Research at Einstein and Montefiore Institute for Aging Research Montefiore Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center New York Regional Center for Diabetes Translation Research Rose F. Kennedy Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center Notable research [ edit ] The Michael F. Price Center for Genetic and Translational Medicine and Harold and Muriel Block Research Pavilion Notable research at Einstein includes a seminal paper that helped identify nicotine as the prime addictive component of tobacco and a series of studies that uncovered the immunological basis for transplant rejection .

[ 71 ] [ 72 ] Thymosins were discovered in Abraham White 's lab at Einstein in 1966.

[ 73 ] In 1968, after observing elevated hemoglobin A1c in a diabetes patient, Samuel Rahbar confirmed this initial finding at Einstein with Helen Ranney and first structurally characterized A1c.

[ 74 ] A1c tests are now the primary method of diabetes management.

[ 75 ] In 1979, the mechanism of taxol —one of the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines —was identified by Susan Band Horwitz at Einstein.

[ 76 ] During the 1980s, Einstein researchers made significant discoveries on the emerging HIV/AIDS pandemic due to its high prevalence in the Bronx .

[ 77 ] These include the first description of pediatric HIV/AIDS and crucial work on mother-to-child transmission , links with substance abuse and men who have sex with men , and the role of opportunistic infections like tuberculosis .

[ 78 ] Mycobacterium —a bacterial genus that includes the species that cause tuberculosis and leprosy —was first genetically manipulated at Einstein by William Jacobs Jr.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] His large family of Mycobacterium strains (such as mc 2 155 ) are named for Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula: E = mc 2 .

[ 79 ] With Paul Alan Cox , Einstein professor Oliver Sacks proposed that Lytico-bodig disease in the Chamorro people may be caused by consumption of flying foxes that had ingested cycad neurotoxins.

[ 81 ] Faculty member Isabelle Rapin has been described as a "founding mother of autism " and popularized the term " autism spectrum disorder ".

[ 82 ] In 2019, researchers at Einstein mapped the entire nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans , a classic model organism .

[ 83 ] Other work includes the discovery of the Tc1/mariner transposon superfamily and the invention of single molecule mRNA fluorescent in situ hybridization .

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] Notable people [ edit ] Further information: List of Albert Einstein College of Medicine people Faculty [ edit ] Three Einstein faculty members have been awarded the National Medal of Science , the highest science award in the United States. Neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks (right) taught at Einstein for over 40 years.

[ 112 ] [ 113 ] Notes and references [ edit ] Notes [ edit ] ^ It is unclear if someone besides Belkin first initiated the campaign for Yeshiva to build a medical school, with Jaffé noting that it was likely "multifactorial". Key individuals were gastroenterologist Elihu Katz and biologist Shelley Saphine. As early as the 1930s, attorney Max Steuer had approached Yeshiva with plans to construct a new medical school, but nothing came of it due to Yeshiva's financial difficulties.

[ 4 ] ^ The exact reason for Einstein' decision is unclear. According to Yeshiva University, it may have been a reaction to antisemitic quotas in medical schools and a way to preserve his legacy amidst his declining health.

[ 2 ] ^ John F. Kennedy , then a US Senator, had given a speech at a Yeshiva University dinner celebrating Einstein's opening in October 1955.
