He is known principally for his 1842 biography of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and his completion (1853) of Theodor Wilhelm Danzel 's biography of Lessing , G. E. Lessing, sein Leben und seine Werke (1850–53, 2 volumes).

He was born in Bojanowo (then in Grand Duchy of Warsaw , now in Poland ) and died in Breslau (now Wrocław , Poland).

He studied philology and philosophy in Breslau and Berlin. Under the influence of the English missionary William Ayerst , Guhrauer converted from Judaism to Christianity in 1835.

[ 1 ] He traveled to Hanover in 1836 and Paris in 1838 to research Leibniz's biography and works. After his return to Germany, he worked as a librarian at the University of Breslau , where he became a professor in 1843.

[ 2 ] Guhrauer also wrote on Jean Bodin , Joachim Jungius , the Kurmainz ( Electorate of Mainz ), and the Latin poem Vaticinium Lehninense .
