Elk in the Bitterroot River [ 1 ] is a wildlife photograph by John McColgan, a fire behavior analyst who worked for the Alaska Fire Service division of the Bureau of Land Management .

[ 2 ] It was taken on August 6, 2000, [ 2 ] on the East Fork of the Bitterroot River on the Sula Complex, Bitterroot National Forest , Montana , United States, [ 3 ] and is also sometimes known by the title, Bitterroot Forest Fire or, more vaguely, Montana Fire . When NASA featured it in its online Astronomy Picture of the Day series, it was called Fire on Earth . The image shows two Rocky Mountain elk seeking protection from a wildfire by standing in the river.

[ 4 ] It was one of the Time magazine Photographs of the Year 2000, and ran in its The Year in Pictures special edition in winter 2000/2001, and the web equivalent.

[ 5 ] McColgan took the photograph with a Kodak DC280 digital camera [ 6 ] while standing on a bridge at Sula, Montana over the East Fork of the Bitterroot River.

McColgan's photograph has been frequently mis-attributed, with captions claiming it depicts a fire in Yellowstone National Park in 1988 and separately that it originated from a forest fire in Canada in 2003, among other erroneous attributions.

[ 7 ] The picture serves as the front cover art for Cass Sunstein 's 2005 book of legal philosophy, Laws of Fear , which contains a caption that the picture's title, Elk Bath , may originate from.
