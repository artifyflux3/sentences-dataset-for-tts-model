Background [ edit ] This section needs expansion with: other parties and movements. You can help by adding to it .

( June 2024 ) Liberalism has been one of the major political forces in Romania since the Wallachian Revolution of 1848 .

The first Romanian National Liberal Party (PNL) was active from 1875 until both its major factions were quashed in 1947 and 1950 by the communist government. The contemporary National Liberal Party (also PNL) was re-founded in 1990 after the Romanian Revolution .

[ 1 ] The centre-right PNL has had notable factions, splits and mergers, including the re-absorption of breakaway parties. For example, the right-wing and pro-German National Liberal Party–Brătianu reunited with the rest of the party in 1938 [ 2 ] after splitting off in 1930.

[ 3 ] More recently, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE) split from the PNL and was a junior partner in a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party (PSD) between 2017 and 2019, before merging again with the PNL in early 2022.
