Eugenics [ a ] is a set of largely discredited beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Historically, eugenicists have attempted to alter the frequency of various human phenotypes by inhibiting the fertility of those considered inferior, or promoting that of those considered superior.

G. Wells Raymond Cattell bibliography Ronald Fisher bibliography Selective breeding History of Science portal v t e The contemporary history of eugenics began in the late 19th century, when a popular eugenics movement emerged in the United Kingdom, [ 6 ] and then spread to many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, [ 7 ] and most European countries (e.g., Sweden and Germany ).

Historically, the idea of eugenics has been used to argue for a broad array of practices ranging from prenatal care for mothers deemed genetically desirable to the forced sterilization and murder of those deemed unfit.

[ 5 ] To population geneticists , the term has included the avoidance of inbreeding without altering allele frequencies ; for example, British-Indian scientist J. B. S. Haldane wrote in 1940 that "the motor bus, by breaking up inbred village communities, was a powerful eugenic agent." [ 8 ] Debate as to what qualifies as eugenics continues today.

[ 9 ] Although it originated as a progressive social movement in the 19th century, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] in the 21st century the term became closely associated with scientific racism . New liberal eugenics seeks to dissociate itself from the old authoritarian varieties by rejecting coercive state programs in favor of individual parental choice.

[ 14 ] Common distinctions [ edit ] Lester Frank Ward wrote the early paper: "Eugenics, Euthenics and Eudemics", making yet further distinctions.

[ 15 ] Eugenic programs included both positive measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly "fit" to reproduce, and negative measures, such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of people deemed unfit for reproduction.

[ 5 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] : 104–155 Positive eugenics is aimed at encouraging reproduction among the genetically advantaged, for example, the intelligent, the healthy, and the successful. Possible approaches include financial and political stimuli, targeted demographic analyses, in vitro fertilization, egg transplants, and cloning.

[ 18 ] Negative eugenics aimed to eliminate, through sterilization or segregation, those deemed physically, mentally, or morally undesirable. This includes abortions, sterilization, and other methods of family planning.

[ 18 ] Both positive and negative eugenics can be coercive; in Nazi Germany, for example, abortion was illegal for women deemed by the state to be superior.

[ 19 ] As opposed to "euthenics" [ edit ] See also: Nature-nurture debate Ellen Swallow Richards (left), the first female student and instructor at MIT, was one of the first to use the term, while Julia Clifford Lathrop (right) continued to promote it in the form of an interdisciplinary academic program later to be mostly absorbed into the field of home economics .

Euthenics ( / j uː ˈ θ ɛ n ɪ k s / ) is the study of improvement of human functioning and well-being by improvement of living conditions .

[ 20 ] "Improvement" is conducted by altering external factors such as education and the controllable environments , including environmentalism , education regarding employment , home economics , sanitation , and housing , as well as the prevention and removal of contagious disease and parasites .

In a New York Times article of May 23, 1926, Rose Field notes of the description, "the simplest [is] efficient living".

[ 21 ] It is also described as "a right to environment", [ 22 ] commonly as dual to a "right of birth" that correspondingly falls under the purview of eugenics.

[ 23 ] Euthenics is not normally interpreted to have anything to do with changing the composition of the human gene pool by definition, although everything that affects society has some effect on who reproduces and who does not.

[ 24 ] The influential historian of education Abraham Flexner questions its scientific value in stating: [T]he “science” is artificially pieced together of bits of mental hygiene, child guidance, nutrition, speech development and correction, family problems, wealth consumption, food preparation, household technology, and horticulture. A nursery school and a school for little children are also included. The institute is actually justified in an official publication by the profound question of a girl student who is reported as asking, “What is the connection of Shakespeare with having a baby?” The Vassar Institute of Euthenics bridges this gap!

[ 25 ] Eugenicist Charles Benedict Davenport noted in his article "Euthenics and Eugenics," reprinted in Popular Science Monthly : Thus the two schools of euthenics and eugenics stand opposed, each viewing the other unkindly. Against eugenics it is urged that it is a fatalistic doctrine and deprives life of the stimulus toward effort.  Against euthenics the other side urges that it demands an endless amount of money to patch up conditions in the vain effort to get greater efficiency.  Which of the two doctrines is true?

The thoughtful mind must concede that, as is so often the case where doctrines are opposed, each view is partial, incomplete and really false. The truth does not exactly lie between the doctrines; it comprehends them both.

[...] [I]n the generations to come, the teachings and practice of euthenics [...] [may] yield greater result because of the previous practice of the principles of eugenics.

[ 26 ] Along similar lines argued psychologist and early intelligence researcher Edward L. Thorndike some two years later for an understanding that better integrates eugenic study: The more rational the race becomes, the better roads, ships, tools, machines, foods, medicines and the like it will produce to aid itself, though it will need them less. The more sagacious and just and humane the original nature that is bred into man, the better schools, laws, churches, traditions and customs it will fortify itself by. There is no so certain and economical a way to improve man's environment as to improve his nature.

[ 27 ] Historical eugenics [ edit ] Main article: History of eugenics Ancient and medieval origins [ edit ] See also: Sparta § Birth and death Giuseppe Diotti's The selection of the infant Spartans (1840) According to Plutarch , in Sparta every proper citizen's child was inspected by the council of elders, the Gerousia , which determined whether or not the child was fit to live.

[ 28 ] If the child was deemed unfit, the child was thrown into a chasm.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Plutarch is the sole historical source for the Spartan practice of systemic infanticide motivated by eugenics.

[ 31 ] While infanticide was practiced by Greeks, no contemporary sources support Plutarch's claims of mass infanticide motivated by eugenics.

[ 32 ] In 2007 the suggestion that infants were dumped near Mount Taygete was called into question due to a lack of physical evidence. Anthropologist Theodoros Pitsios' research found only bodies from adolescents up to the age of approximately 35.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] Plato's political philosophy included the belief that human reproduction should be cautiously monitored and controlled by the state through selective breeding .

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] According to Tacitus ( c.

56 – c.

120 ), a Roman of the Imperial Period , the Germanic tribes of his day killed any member of their community they deemed cowardly, unwarlike or "stained with abominable vices", usually by drowning them in swamps.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] Modern historians see Tacitus' ethnographic writing as unreliable in such details.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] Academic origins [ edit ] See also: Galton Laboratory and Eugenics Record Office Francis Galton (1822–1911) was a British polymath who coined the term "eugenics".

The term eugenics and its modern field of study were first formulated by Francis Galton in 1883, [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ b ] directly drawing on the recent work delineating natural selection by his half-cousin Charles Darwin .

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ c ] He published his observations and conclusions chiefly in his influential book Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development . Galton himself defined it as "the study of all agencies under human control which can improve or impair the racial quality of future generations".

[ 49 ] The first to systematically apply Darwinism theory to human relations, Galton believed that various desirable human qualities were also hereditary ones, although Darwin strongly disagreed with this elaboration of his theory.

[ 50 ] Eugenics became an academic discipline at many colleges and universities and received funding from various sources.

[ 51 ] Organizations were formed to win public support for and to sway opinion towards responsible eugenic values in parenthood, including the British Eugenics Education Society of 1907 and the American Eugenics Society of 1921. Both sought support from leading clergymen and modified their message to meet religious ideals.

[ 52 ] In 1909, the Anglican clergymen William Inge and James Peile both wrote for the Eugenics Education Society. Inge was an invited speaker at the 1921 International Eugenics Conference , which was also endorsed by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York Patrick Joseph Hayes .

[ 52 ] Three International Eugenics Conferences presented a global venue for eugenicists, with meetings in 1912 in London, and in 1921 and 1932 in New York City.

Eugenic policies in the United States were first implemented by state-level legislators in the early 1900s.

[ 53 ] Eugenic policies also took root in France, Germany, and Great Britain.

[ 54 ] Later, in the 1920s and 1930s, the eugenic policy of sterilizing certain mental patients was implemented in other countries including Belgium, [ 55 ] Brazil, [ 56 ] Canada , [ 57 ] Japan and Sweden .

Frederick Osborn 's 1937 journal article "Development of a Eugenic Philosophy" framed eugenics as a social philosophy —a philosophy with implications for social order .

[ 58 ] That definition is not universally accepted. Osborn advocated for higher rates of sexual reproduction among people with desired traits ("positive eugenics") or reduced rates of sexual reproduction or sterilization of people with less-desired or undesired traits ("negative eugenics").

[ citation needed ] In addition to being practiced in a number of countries, eugenics was internationally organized through the International Federation of Eugenics Organizations .

[ 59 ] Its scientific aspects were carried on through research bodies such as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics , [ 60 ] the Cold Spring Harbor Carnegie Institution for Experimental Evolution , [ 61 ] and the Eugenics Record Office .

[ 62 ] Politically, the movement advocated measures such as sterilization laws.

[ 63 ] In its moral dimension, eugenics rejected the doctrine that all human beings are born equal and redefined moral worth purely in terms of genetic fitness.

[ 64 ] Its racist elements included pursuit of a pure " Nordic race " or " Aryan " genetic pool and the eventual elimination of "unfit" races.

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] Many leading British politicians subscribed to the theories of eugenics.

Winston Churchill supported the British Eugenics Society and was an honorary vice president for the organization. Churchill believed that eugenics could solve "race deterioration" and reduce crime and poverty.

[ 48 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] As a social movement, eugenics reached its greatest popularity in the early decades of the 20th century, when it was practiced around the world and promoted by governments, institutions, and influential individuals. Many countries enacted [ 69 ] various eugenics policies, including: genetic screenings , birth control , promoting differential birth rates, marriage restrictions , segregation (both racial segregation and sequestering the mentally ill), compulsory sterilization , forced abortions or forced pregnancies , ultimately culminating in genocide . By 2014, gene selection (rather than "people selection") was made possible through advances in genome editing , [ 70 ] leading to what is sometimes called new eugenics , also known as "neo-eugenics", "consumer eugenics", or "liberal eugenics"; which focuses on individual freedom and allegedly pulls away from racism, sexism or a focus on intelligence.

[ 71 ] Early opposition [ edit ] Early critics of the philosophy of eugenics included the American sociologist Lester Frank Ward , [ 72 ] the English writer G. K. Chesterton , and Scottish tuberculosis pioneer and author Halliday Sutherland .

[ d ] Ward's 1913 article "Eugenics, Euthenics, and Eudemics", Chesterton's 1917 book Eugenics and Other Evils , [ 74 ] and Franz Boas ' 1916 article " Eugenics " (published in The Scientific Monthly ) [ 75 ] were all harshly critical of the rapidly growing movement.

Several biologists were also antagonistic to the eugenics movement, including Lancelot Hogben .

[ 76 ] Other biologists who were themselves eugenicists, such as J. B. S. Haldane and R. A. Fisher , however, also expressed skepticism in the belief that sterilization of "defectives" (i.e. a purely negative eugenics) would lead to the disappearance of undesirable genetic traits.

[ 77 ] Among institutions, the Catholic Church opposes sterilization for eugenic purposes.

[ 78 ] Attempts by the Eugenics Education Society to persuade the British government to legalize voluntary sterilization were opposed by Catholics and by the Labour Party .

[ 79 ] The American Eugenics Society initially gained some Catholic supporters, but Catholic support declined following the 1930 papal encyclical Casti connubii .

[ 52 ] In this, Pope Pius XI explicitly condemned sterilization laws: "Public magistrates have no direct power over the bodies of their subjects; therefore, where no crime has taken place and there is no cause present for grave punishment, they can never directly harm, or tamper with the integrity of the body, either for the reasons of eugenics or for any other reason." [ 80 ] The eugenicists' political successes in Germany and Scandinavia were not at all matched in such countries as Poland and Czechoslovakia , even though measures had been proposed there, largely because of the Catholic church's moderating influence.

[ 81 ] Eugenic feminism [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Eugenic feminism .

[ edit ] Marie Stopes in her laboratory, 1904 Eugenic feminism was a current of the women's suffrage movement which overlapped with eugenics.

[ 82 ] Originally coined by the Lebanese-British physician and vocal eugenicist Caleb Saleeby , [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] the term has since been applied to summarize views held by prominent feminists of Great Britain and the United States. Some early suffragettes in Canada, especially a group known as The Famous Five , also pushed for various eugenic policies.

Eugenic feminists argued that if women were provided with more rights and equality, the deteriorating characteristics of a given race could be averted.

North American eugenics [ edit ] American eugenicists generally pursued more public-facing work and accordingly became widely known for their racism in particular.

Along these lines, they were often harshly criticized by their British counterparts.

[ 86 ] This section is an excerpt from Eugenics in the United States .

[ edit ] While its American practice was ostensibly about improving genetic quality, it has been argued that eugenics was more about preserving the position of the dominant groups in the population. Scholarly research has determined that people who found themselves targets of the eugenics movement were those who were seen as unfit for society—the poor, the disabled, the mentally ill, and specific communities of color—and a disproportionate number of those who fell victim to eugenicists' sterilization initiatives were women who were identified as African American, Asian American, or Native American.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] As a result, the United States' eugenics movement is now generally associated with racist and nativist elements, as the movement was to some extent a reaction to demographic and population changes, as well as concerns over the economy and social well-being, rather than scientific genetics.

[ 89 ] [ 88 ] Eugenics in Mexico [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Eugenics in Mexico .

[ edit ] Following the Mexican Revolution , the eugenics movement gained prominence in Mexico. Seeking to change the genetic make-up of the country's population, proponents of eugenics in Mexico focused primarily on rebuilding the population, creating healthy citizens, and ameliorating the effects of perceived social ills such as alcoholism, prostitution, and venereal diseases. Mexican eugenics, at its height in the 1930s, influenced the state's health, education, and welfare policies.

[ 90 ] Mexican elites adopted eugenic thinking and raised it under the banner of “the Great Mexican family” ( Spanish : la gran familia mexicana ).

[ 91 ] Unlike in other countries, the eugenics movements in Latin America were largely founded on the idea of neo-Lamarckian eugenics.

[ 92 ] Neo-Lamarckian eugenics stated that the outside effects experienced by an organism, throughout its lifetime, changed its genetics, permanently, allowing the organism to pass acquired traits onto its offspring.

[ 93 ] In the Neo-Lamarckian genetic framework, activities, such as prostitution and alcoholism, could result in the degeneration of future generations, amplifying fears about the effects of certain social ills. However, the supposed genetic malleability also offered hope, to certain Latin American eugenicists, as social reform would have the ability to transform the population, more permanently.

[ 92 ] Nazism and the decline of eugenics [ edit ] See also: Nazi eugenics , Racial hygiene , Life unworthy of life , and Scientific racism Schloss Hartheim , a former center for Nazi Germany's Aktion T4 campaign The reputation of eugenics started to decline in the 1930s, a time when Ernst Rüdin used eugenics as a justification for the racial policies of Nazi Germany .

Adolf Hitler had praised and incorporated eugenic ideas in Mein Kampf in 1925 and emulated eugenic legislation for the sterilization of "defectives" that had been pioneered in the United States once he took power.

[ 94 ] Some common early 20th century eugenics methods involved identifying and classifying individuals and their families. This included racial groups (such as the Roma and Jews in Nazi Germany ), the poor, mentally ill, blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, promiscuous women , and homosexuals as "degenerate" or "unfit". This led to segregation, institutionalization, sterilization, and mass murder .

[ 95 ] The Nazi policy of identifying German citizens deemed unfit and then systematically killing them with poison gas, referred to as the Aktion T4 campaign, paved the way for the Holocaust .

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] "All practices aimed at eugenics, any use of the human body or any of its parts for financial gain, and human cloning shall be prohibited." Hungarian Constitution [ 99 ] By the end of World War II , many eugenics laws were abandoned, having become associated with Nazi Germany .

[ 100 ] H. G. Wells , who had called for "the sterilization of failures" in 1904, [ 101 ] stated in his 1940 book The Rights of Man: Or What Are We Fighting For?

that among the human rights, which he believed should be available to all people, was "a prohibition on mutilation , sterilization, torture , and any bodily punishment".

[ 102 ] After World War II, the practice of "imposing measures intended to prevent births within [a national, ethnical, racial or religious] group" fell within the definition of the new international crime of genocide, set out in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide .

[ 103 ] The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union also proclaims "the prohibition of eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at selection of persons".

[ 104 ] In Singapore [ edit ] Main article: Population control in Singapore § Demographic transition and the Graduate Mothers Scheme Lee Kuan Yew , the founding father of Singapore , actively promoted eugenics as late as 1983.

[ 105 ] In 1984, Singapore began providing financial incentives to highly educated women to encourage them to have more children. For this purpose was introduced the "Graduate Mother Scheme" that incentivized graduate women to get married as much as the rest of their populace.

[ 106 ] The incentives were extremely unpopular and regarded as eugenic, and were seen as discriminatory towards Singapore's non-Chinese ethnic population. In 1985, the incentives were partly abandoned as ineffective, while the government matchmaking agency, the Social Development Network , remains active.

[ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] Modern eugenics [ edit ] See also: New eugenics Liberal eugenics, also called new eugenics, aims to make genetic interventions morally acceptable by rejecting coercive state programs and relying on parental choice.

[ 110 ] [ 14 ] Bioethicist Nicholas Agar , who coined the term, argues that the state should intervene only to forbid interventions that excessively limit a child’s ability to shape their own future.

[ 111 ] Unlike "authoritarian" or "old" eugenics, liberal eugenics draws on modern scientific knowledge of genomics to enable informed choices aimed at improving well-being.

[ 14 ] Julien Savulescu further argues that some eugenic practices, like prenatal screening for Down syndrome , are already widely practiced, without being labeled "eugenics", as they are seen as enhancing freedom rather than restricting it.

[ 112 ] UC Berkeley sociologist Troy Duster argued that modern genetics is a "back door to eugenics".

[ 113 ] This view was shared by then-White House Assistant Director for Forensic Sciences, Tania Simoncelli , who stated in a 2003 publication by the Population and Development Program at Hampshire College that advances in pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) are moving society to a "new era of eugenics", and that, unlike the Nazi eugenics, modern eugenics is consumer driven and market based, "where children are increasingly regarded as made-to-order consumer products".

[ 114 ] The United Nations' International Bioethics Committee also noted that while human genetic engineering should not be confused with the 20th century eugenics movements , it nonetheless challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who do not want or cannot afford the technology.

[ 115 ] In 2025, geneticist Peter Visscher published a paper in Nature , arguing genome editing of human embryos and germ cells may become feasible in the 21st century, and raising ethical considerations in the context of previous eugenics movements.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] A response argued that human embryo genetic editing is "unsafe and unproven".

[ 118 ] Nature also published an editorial, stating: "The fear that polygenic gene editing could be used for eugenics looms large among them, and is, in part, why no country currently allows genome editing in a human embryo, even for single variants".

[ 117 ] Contested scientific status [ edit ] In the decades after World War II , the term "eugenics" had taken on a negative connotation and as a result, the use of it became increasingly unpopular within the scientific community. Many organizations and journals that had their origins in the eugenics movement began to distance themselves from the philosophy which spawned them, as when Eugenics Quarterly was renamed Social Biology in 1969.

One general concern is that the reduced genetic diversity that may be a feature of long-term, species-wide eugenics plans [ 119 ] could eventually result in inbreeding depression , [ 119 ] increased spread of infectious disease , [ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ better source needed ] and decreased resilience to changes in the environment.

[ 122 ] [ better source needed ] Arguments for scientific validity [ edit ] See also: Selective breeding , De novo domestication , List of domesticated animals , List of domesticated plants , and Self-domestication In his original lecture "Darwinism, Medical Progress and Eugenics", Karl Pearson claimed that everything concerning eugenics fell into the field of medicine.

[ 123 ] Anthropologist Aleš Hrdlička said in 1918 that "[t]he growing science of eugenics will essentially become applied anthropology." [ 124 ] The economist John Maynard Keynes was a lifelong proponent of eugenics and described it as a branch of sociology.

[ 125 ] [ 126 ] In a 2006 newspaper article, Richard Dawkins said that discussion regarding eugenics was inhibited by the shadow of Nazi misuse, to the extent that some scientists would not admit that breeding humans for certain abilities is at all possible. He believes that it is not physically different from breeding domestic animals for traits such as speed or herding skill. Dawkins felt that enough time had elapsed to at least ask just what the ethical differences were between breeding for ability versus training athletes or forcing children to take music lessons, though he could think of persuasive reasons to draw the distinction.

[ 127 ] Objections to scientific validity [ edit ] Amanda Caleb, Professor of Medical Humanities at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine , says "Eugenic laws and policies are now understood as part of a specious devotion to a pseudoscience that actively dehumanizes to support political agendas and not true science or medicine." [ 128 ] The first major challenge to conventional eugenics based on genetic inheritance was made in 1915 by Thomas Hunt Morgan . He demonstrated the event of genetic mutation occurring outside of inheritance involving the discovery of the hatching of a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) with white eyes from a family with red eyes, [ 48 ] : 336–337 demonstrating that major genetic changes occurred outside of inheritance.

[ 48 ] : 336–337 [ clarification needed ] Morgan criticized the view that traits such as intelligence or criminality were hereditary, because these traits were subjective .

[ 129 ] [ e ] Pleiotropy occurs when one gene influences multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits , an example being phenylketonuria , which is a human disease that affects multiple systems but is caused by one gene defect.

[ 132 ] Andrzej Pękalski, from the University of Wroclaw , argues that eugenics can cause harmful loss of genetic diversity if a eugenics program selects a pleiotropic gene that could possibly be associated with a positive trait. Pękalski uses the example of a coercive government eugenics program that prohibits people with myopia from breeding but has the unintended consequence of also selecting against high intelligence since the two were associated.

[ 133 ] While the science of genetics has increasingly provided means by which certain characteristics and conditions can be identified and understood, given the complexity of human genetics, culture, and psychology, at this point there is no agreed objective means of determining which traits might be ultimately desirable or undesirable. Some conditions such as sickle-cell disease and cystic fibrosis respectively confer immunity to malaria and resistance to cholera when a single copy of the recessive allele is contained within the genotype of the individual, so eliminating these genes is undesirable in places where such diseases are common.

[ 122 ] Edwin Black , journalist, historian, and author of War Against the Weak , argues that eugenics is often deemed a pseudoscience because what is defined as a genetic improvement of a desired trait is a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined through objective scientific inquiry.

[ 2 ] This aspect of eugenics is often considered to be tainted with scientific racism and pseudoscience.

[ 2 ] [ 134 ] Logo from the Second International Eugenics Conference , 1921. The bottom text reads: "Like A Tree, Eugenics Draws Its Materials From Many Sources And Organizes Them Into An Harmonious Entity" (such sources, i.e. roots, purportedly including e.g.

genetics , physiology , mental testing , anthropology , statistics , medicine , politics and sociology ).

[ 135 ] Contested ethical status [ edit ] Contemporary ethical opposition [ edit ] See also: Larry Arnhart , Leon Kass , and Preimplantation genetic diagnosis § Religious objections In a book directly addressed at socialist eugenicist J.B.S. Haldane and his once-influential Daedalus , Betrand Russell had one serious objection of his own: eugenic policies might simply end up being used to reproduce existing power relations "rather than to make men happy." [ 136 ] Environmental ethicist Bill McKibben argued against germinal choice technology and other advanced biotechnological strategies for human enhancement. He writes that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to aging , maximum life span and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to "improve" themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem meaningful in a world where such limitations could be overcome with technology. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, he argues, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using Ming China , Tokugawa Japan and the contemporary Amish as examples.

[ 137 ] Contemporary ethical advocacy [ edit ] See also: Peter Sloterdijk § Reprogenetics dispute Bioethicist Stephen Wilkinson has said that some aspects of modern genetics can be classified as eugenics, but that this classification does not inherently make modern genetics immoral.

[ 138 ] Historian Nathaniel C. Comfort has claimed that the change from state-led reproductive-genetic decision-making to individual choice has moderated the worst abuses of eugenics by transferring the decision-making process from the state to patients and their families.

[ 139 ] [ 140 ] In their book published in 2000, From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice , bioethicists Allen Buchanan , Dan Brock , Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals' reproductive rights or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) in order to maximize public health and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements.

[ 17 ] In science fiction [ edit ] See also: Speculative evolution , Evolution in fiction , and Genetics in fiction In the movie, " Gattaca " also refers to the futuristic building complex that hosts the astronauts for an ongoing space colonization program.

The novel Brave New World by the English author Aldous Huxley (1931), is a dystopian social science fiction novel which is set in a futuristic World State , whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy .

[ 141 ] Various works by the author Robert A. Heinlein mention the Howard Foundation , a group which attempts to improve human longevity through selective breeding .

[ citation needed ] Among Frank Herbert 's other works, the Dune series, starting with the eponymous 1965 novel , describes selective breeding by a powerful sisterhood, the Bene Gesserit , to produce a supernormal male being, the Kwisatz Haderach .

[ 142 ] The Star Trek franchise features a race of genetically engineered humans which is known as "Augments", the most notable of them being Khan Noonien Singh . These "supermen" were the cause of the Eugenics Wars , a dark period in Earth's fictional history, before they were deposed and exiled.

[ 143 ] [ f ] Spin-offs like Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds present the Eugenics Wars as the main reason why genetic enhancement is illegal in the United Federation of Planets .

[ 146 ] [ 147 ] The film Gattaca (1997) provides a fictional example of a dystopian society that uses eugenics to decide what people are capable of and their place in the world. The title alludes to the letters G , A , T and C , the four nucleobases of DNA , and depicts the possible consequences of genetic discrimination in the present societal framework. Relegated to the role of a cleaner owing to his genetically projected death at age 32 due to a heart condition (being told: "The only way you'll see the inside of a spaceship is if you were cleaning it"), the protagonist observes enhanced astronauts as they are demonstrating their superhuman athleticism. Although it was not a box office success, it was critically acclaimed and influenced the debate over human genetic engineering in the public consciousness.

[ 148 ] [ 149 ] [ g ] As to its accuracy, its production company, Sony Pictures , consulted with a gene therapy researcher and prominent critic of eugenics known to have stated that "[w]e should not step over the line that delineates treatment from enhancement", [ 152 ] W. French Anderson , to ensure that the portrayal of science was realistic. Disputing their success in this mission, Philim Yam of Scientific American called the film "science bashing" and Nature 's Kevin Davies called it a "surprisingly pedestrian affair", while molecular biologist Lee Silver described its extreme determinism as "a straw man ".

[ 153 ] [ 154 ] In his 2018 book Blueprint , the behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin writes that while Gattaca warned of the dangers of genetic information being used by a totalitarian state, genetic testing could also favor better meritocracy in democratic societies which already administer a variety of standardized tests to select people for education and employment. He suggests that polygenic scores might supplement testing in a manner that is essentially free of biases.

what is termed in Greek, eugenes namely, good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities. This, and the allied words, eugeneia , etc., are equally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognisance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word eugenics would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a neater word and a more generalized one than viriculture which I once ventured to use.... The investigation of human eugenics – that is, of the conditions under which men of a high type are produced – is at present extremely hampered by the want of full family histories, both medical and general, extending over three or four generations.

Racially targeted sterilization practices between the 1960s and the present have been perhaps the most common topic among scholars arguing for, and challenging, the ongoing power of eugenics in the United States. Indeed, unlike in the modern period, contemporary expressions of eugenics have met with widespread, thoroughgoing resistance ^ Galton, Francis (1904).

As an applied science, thus, the practice of eugenics referred to everything from prenatal care for mothers to forced sterilization and euthanasia.  Galton divided the practice of eugenics into two types—positive and negative—both aimed at improving the human race through selective breeding.

The goal of enhancing individuals and the human species by engineering the genes related to some characteristics and traits is not to be confused with the barbarous projects of eugenics that planned the simple elimination of human beings considered as 'imperfect' on an ideological basis. However, it impinges upon the principle of respect for human dignity in several ways. It weakens the idea that the differences among human beings, regardless of the measure of their endowment, are exactly what the recognition of their equality presupposes and therefore protects. It introduces the risk of new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who cannot afford such enhancement or simply do not want to resort to it. The arguments that have been produced in favour of the so-called liberal eugenics do not trump the indication to apply the limit of medical reasons also in this case.

[ 130 ] [ 131 ] ^ Similarly, the author Edwin Black has described potential "eugenics wars" as the worst-case outcome of eugenics.

[ page needed ] In his view, this scenario would mean the return of coercive state-sponsored genetic discrimination and human rights violations such as the compulsory sterilization of persons with genetic defects, the killing of the institutionalized and, specifically, the segregation and genocide of races which are considered inferior.

[ 95 ] Law professors George Annas and Lori Andrews have similarly argued that the use of these technologies could lead to such human- posthuman caste warfare.

[ 144 ] [ 145 ] ^ It has been cited by many bioethicists and laypeople in support of their hesitancy about, or opposition to, eugenics and the genetic determinist ideology that may frame it.

[ 150 ] Accordingly, Lee M. Silver stated that " Gattaca is a film that all geneticists should see if for no other reason than to understand the perception of our trade held by so many of the public-at-large".
