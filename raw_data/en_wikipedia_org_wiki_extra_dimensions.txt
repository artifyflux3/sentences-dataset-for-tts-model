Among theories proposing extra dimensions are: [ 1 ] Large extra dimension , mostly motivated by the ADD model, by Nima Arkani-Hamed , Savas Dimopoulos , and Gia Dvali in 1998, in an attempt to solve the hierarchy problem . This theory requires that the fields of the Standard Model are confined to a four-dimensional membrane , while gravity propagates in several additional spatial dimensions that are large compared to the Planck scale .

[ 2 ] Warped extra dimensions, such as those proposed by the Randall–Sundrum model (RS), based on warped geometry where the universe is a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space and the elementary particles except for the graviton are localized on a (3 + 1)-dimensional brane or branes.

[ 3 ] Universal extra dimension , proposed and first studied in 2000, assume, at variance with the ADD and RS approaches, that all fields propagate universally in extra dimensions.

Multiple time dimensions , i.e. the possibility that there might be more than one dimension of time , has occasionally been discussed in physics and philosophy, although those models have to deal with the problem of causality .
