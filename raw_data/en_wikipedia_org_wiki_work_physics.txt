In science, **work** is the [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") transferred to or from an [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object "Physical object") via the application of [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") along a [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)"). In its simplest form, for a constant force aligned with the direction of motion, the work equals the [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics) "Product (mathematics)") of the force strength and the distance traveled. A force is said to do _positive work_ if it has a component in the direction of the displacement of the [point of application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_application "Point of application"). A force does _negative work_ if it has a component opposite to the direction of the displacement at the point of application of the force.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-:1-1)

For example, when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped, the work done by the gravitational force on the ball as it falls is positive, and is equal to the weight of the ball (a force) multiplied by the distance to the ground (a displacement). If the ball is thrown upwards, the work done by the gravitational force is negative, and is equal to the weight multiplied by the displacement in the upwards direction.

Both force and displacement are [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics) "Vector (mathematics and physics)"). The work done is given by the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") of the two vectors, where the result is a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)"). When the force F is constant and the angle θ between the force and the displacement s is also constant, then the work done is given by: [![Image 3: {\displaystyle W=\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {s} =Fs\cos {\theta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1dfb980b215d4d2672ef783886a9f8f7be1c1256)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q42213)

If the force and/or displacement is variable, then work is given by the [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral"):

![Image 4: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}W&=\int \mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {s} \\&=\int \mathbf {F} \cdot {\frac {d\mathbf {s} }{dt}}dt\\&=\int \mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} dt\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bfa9299a5abb1aa7e343bdcfe310219481b7dbb6)

where ![Image 5: {\displaystyle d\mathbf {s} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66a2cf554bba95ffa681032d7aa2ef36ca2c6bd8) is the infinitesimal change in displacement vector, ![Image 6: {\displaystyle dt}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ebee76a835701fd1f26047a09855f2ea36bb08fc) is the infinitesimal increment of time, and ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35c1866e359fbfd2e0f606c725ba5cc37a5195d6) represents the velocity vector. The first equation represents force as a function of the position and the second and third equations represent force as a function of time.

Work is a [scalar quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-Young-2) so it has only magnitude and no direction. Work transfers energy from one place to another, or one form to another. The [SI unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_unit "SI unit") of work is the [joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule "Joule") (J), the same unit as for energy.

The [ancient Greek understanding of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_technology "Ancient Greek technology") was limited to the [statics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics "Statics") of simple machines (the balance of forces), and did not include [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics) "Dynamics (mechanics)") or the concept of work. During the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") the dynamics of the _Mechanical Powers_, as the [simple machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machine "Simple machine") were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how far they could lift a load, in addition to the force they could apply, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical work. The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") in 1600 in _Le Meccaniche_ (_On Mechanics_), in which he showed the underlying mathematical similarity of the machines as force amplifiers.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-Krebs-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-Stephen-4) He was the first to explain that simple machines do not create energy, only transform it.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-Krebs-3)

### Early concepts of work

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Early concepts of work")]

Although _work_ was not formally used until 1826, similar concepts existed before then. Early names for the same concept included _moment of activity, quantity of action, latent live force, dynamic effect, efficiency_, and even _force_.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-5) In 1637, the French philosopher [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") wrote:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-6)

> Lifting 100 lb one foot twice over is the same as lifting 200 lb one foot, or 100 lb two feet.

— René Descartes, Letter to Huygens

In 1686, the German philosopher [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz") wrote:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-7)

> The same force ["work" in modern terms] is necessary to raise body A of 1 pound (libra) to a height of 4 yards (ulnae), as is necessary to raise body B of 4 pounds to a height of 1 yard.

— Gottfried Leibniz, Brevis demonstratio

In 1759, [John Smeaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smeaton "John Smeaton") described a quantity that he called "power" "to signify the exertion of strength, gravitation, impulse, or pressure, as to produce motion." Smeaton continues that this quantity can be calculated if "the weight raised is multiplied by the height to which it can be raised in a given time," making this definition remarkably similar to [Coriolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard-Gustave_de_Coriolis "Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis")'s.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-8)

### Etymology and modern usage

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Etymology and modern usage")]

The term _work_ (or _mechanical work_), and the use of the [work-energy principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#Work%E2%80%93energy_principle) in mechanics, was introduced in the late 1820s independently by French mathematician [Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard-Gustave_Coriolis "Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis") and French Professor of Applied Mechanics [Jean-Victor Poncelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Victor_Poncelet "Jean-Victor Poncelet").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-11) Both scientists were pursuing a view of mechanics suitable for studying the dynamics and power of machines, for example [steam engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine") lifting buckets of water out of flooded ore mines. According to Rene Dugas, French engineer and historian, it is to [Solomon of Caux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomon_de_Caus "Salomon de Caus") "that we owe the term _work_ in the sense that it is used in mechanics now".[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-12) The concept of [virtual work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work "Virtual work"), and the use of [variational methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations "Calculus of variations") in mechanics, preceded the introduction of "mechanical work" but was originally called "virtual moment". It was re-named once the terminology of Poncelet and Coriolis was adopted.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-14)

The [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") unit of work is the [joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule "Joule") (J), named after English physicist [James Prescott Joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule "James Prescott Joule") (1818–1889). According to the [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures") it is defined as "the work done when the point of application of 1 [MKS unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_units "MKS units") of force [newton] moves a distance of 1 metre in the direction of the force."[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-15)

The dimensionally equivalent [newton-metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-metre "Newton-metre") (N⋅m) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work, but this can be confused with the measurement unit of [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque"). Usage of N⋅m is discouraged by the [SI authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures "General Conference on Weights and Measures"), since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton-metres is a torque measurement, or a measurement of work.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-16)

Another unit for work is the [foot-pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-pound_(energy) "Foot-pound (energy)"), which comes from the English system of measurement. As the unit name suggests, it is the product of pounds for the unit of force and feet for the unit of displacement. One joule is approximately equal to 0.7376 ft-lbs.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-:0-18)

Non-SI units of work include the newton-metre, [erg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg "Erg"), the foot-pound, the [foot-poundal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-poundal "Foot-poundal"), the [kilowatt hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt_hour "Kilowatt hour"), the [litre-atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Litre-atmosphere&action=edit&redlink=1 "Litre-atmosphere (page does not exist)"), and the [horsepower-hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower-hour "Horsepower-hour"). Due to work having the same [physical dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis") as [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat"), occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content, such as [therm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therm "Therm"), [BTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTU "BTU") and [calorie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie "Calorie"), are used as a measuring unit.

The work W done by a constant force of magnitude F on a point that moves a displacement s in a straight line in the direction of the force is the product ![Image 8: {\displaystyle W=\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {s} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f62e7b41bc9ba33e6f1d9c7e36d77c48d41a2149)

For example, if a force of 10 newtons (_F_ = 10 N) acts along a point that travels 2 metres (_s_ = 2 m), then _W_ = _Fs_ = (10 N) (2 m) = 20 J. This is approximately the work done lifting a 1 kg object from ground level to over a person's head against the force of gravity.

The work is doubled either by lifting twice the weight the same distance or by lifting the same weight twice the distance.

Work is closely related to [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"). Energy shares the same unit of measurement with work (Joules) because the energy from the object doing work is transferred to the other objects it interacts with when work is being done.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-:0-18) The work–energy principle states that an increase in the kinetic energy of a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") is caused by an equal amount of positive work done on the body by the resultant force acting on that body. Conversely, a decrease in kinetic energy is caused by an equal amount of negative work done by the resultant force. Thus, if the net work is positive, then the particle's kinetic energy increases by the amount of the work. If the net work done is negative, then the particle's kinetic energy decreases by the amount of work.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-walker-19)

From [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion"), it can be shown that work on a free (no fields), rigid (no internal degrees of freedom) body, is equal to the change in kinetic energy _E_ k corresponding to the linear velocity and [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity") of that body, ![Image 9: {\displaystyle W=\Delta E_{\text{k}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/99fd42b68cf01252cc1cd66aba086b58a5a1533f) The work of forces generated by a potential function is known as [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy") and the forces are said to be [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force "Conservative force"). Therefore, work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)"), without change in velocity or rotation, is equal to _minus_ the change of potential energy _E_ p of the object, ![Image 10: {\displaystyle W=-\Delta E_{\text{p}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5a87dcaf2529acf7306203192aea7f78e689f51) These formulas show that work is the energy associated with the action of a force, so work subsequently possesses the [physical dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis"), and units, of energy. The work/energy principles discussed here are identical to electric work/energy principles.

Constraint forces determine the object's displacement in the system, limiting it within a range. For example, in the case of a [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") plus gravity, the object is _stuck to_ the slope and, when attached to a taut string, it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any 'tauter'. It eliminates all displacements in that direction, that is, the velocity in the direction of the constraint is limited to 0, so that the constraint forces do not perform work on the system.

For a [mechanical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_system "Mechanical system"),[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-goldstein-20) constraint forces eliminate movement in directions that characterize the constraint. Thus the [virtual work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work "Virtual work") done by the forces of constraint is zero, a result which is only true if friction forces are excluded.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-21)

Fixed, frictionless constraint forces do not perform work on the system,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-Feynman-22) as the angle between the motion and the constraint forces is always [90°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-Feynman-22) Examples of workless constraints are: rigid interconnections between particles, sliding motion on a frictionless surface, and rolling contact without slipping.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-23)

For example, in a pulley system like the [Atwood machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atwood_machine "Atwood machine"), the internal forces on the rope and at the supporting pulley do no work on the system. Therefore, work need only be computed for the gravitational forces acting on the bodies. Another example is the [centripetal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force "Centripetal force") exerted _inwards_ by a string on a ball in uniform [circular motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_motion "Circular motion")_sideways_ constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the centre of the circle. This force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ball.

The [magnetic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_force "Magnetic force") on a charged particle is **F** = _q_**v** × **B**, where q is the charge, **v** is the velocity of the particle, and **B** is the [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"). The result of a [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors, so **F** ⊥ **v**. The [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") of two perpendicular vectors is always zero, so the work _W_ = **F** ⋅ **v** = 0, and the magnetic force does not do work. It can change the direction of motion but never change the speed.

Mathematical calculation
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Mathematical calculation")]

For moving objects, the quantity of work/time (power) is integrated along the trajectory of the point of application of the force. Thus, at any instant, the rate of the work done by a force (measured in joules/second, or [watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt")) is the [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_product "Scalar product") of the force (a vector), and the velocity vector of the point of application. This scalar product of force and velocity is known as instantaneous [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics) "Power (physics)"). Just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance, by the [fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus "Fundamental theorem of calculus"), the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-Resnick-24)

Work is the result of a force on a point that follows a curve **X**, with a velocity **v**, at each instant. The small amount of work _δW_ that occurs over an instant of time _dt_ is calculated as ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \delta W=\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {s} =\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} dt}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2277d4841d3e704a83a98c202f65edf42acf962f) where the **F** ⋅ **v** is the power over the instant _dt_. The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work, ![Image 12: {\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} \,dt=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {F} \cdot {\tfrac {d\mathbf {s} }{dt}}\,dt=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {s} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/62bae8e044a7815446bf8c42b1a29c91e732e866) where _C_ is the trajectory from **x**(_t_ 1) to **x**(_t_ 2). This integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle, and is therefore said to be _path dependent_.

If the force is always directed along this line, and the magnitude of the force is _F_, then this integral simplifies to ![Image 13: {\displaystyle W=\int _{C}F\,ds}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db7d02ae3321f49301f20f492c5b7784881f4055) where s is displacement along the line. If **F** is constant, in addition to being directed along the line, then the integral simplifies further to ![Image 14: {\displaystyle W=\int _{C}F\,ds=F\int _{C}ds=Fs}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb498cc293d618a52c688cec3f0760af9fc1ad0f) where _s_ is the displacement of the point along the line.

This calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line, followed by the particle. In this case the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product")**F** ⋅ _d_**s** = _F_ cos _θ_ _ds_, where θ is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-Resnick-24) that is ![Image 15: {\displaystyle W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {s} =Fs\cos \theta .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f14d27e0f49e195993daf06d71b65dfff36b10b5)

When a force component is perpendicular to the displacement of the object (such as when a body moves in a circular path under a [central force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_force "Central force")), no work is done, since the cosine of 90° is zero.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-walker-19) Thus, no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit (this is ideal, as all orbits are slightly elliptical). Also, no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force, such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifuge.

### Work done by a variable force

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Work done by a variable force")]

Calculating the work as "force times straight path segment" would only apply in the most simple of circumstances, as noted above. If force is changing, or if the body is moving along a curved path, possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid, then only the path of the application point of the force is relevant for the work done, and only the component of the force parallel to the application point [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") is doing work (positive work when in the same direction, and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity). This component of force can be described by the scalar quantity called _scalar tangential component_ (_F_ cos(_θ_), where θ is the angle between the force and the velocity). And then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows:

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Force-distance-diagram.svg/250px-Force-distance-diagram.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Force-distance-diagram.svg)

[Area under the curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_under_the_curve "Area under the curve") gives work done by F(x).

_Work done by a variable force is the line integral of its scalar tangential component along the path of its application point._

If the force varies (e.g. compressing a spring) we need to use calculus to find the work done. If the force as a variable of **x** is given by **F**(**x**), then the work done by the force along the x-axis from **x**1 to **x**2 is:

![Image 17: {\displaystyle W=\lim _{\Delta \mathbf {x} \to 0}\sum _{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}\mathbf {F(x)} \Delta \mathbf {x} =\int _{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}\mathbf {F(x)} d\mathbf {x} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad796c2a1ea2936ac1395da70f846d3abd8b9d18)

Thus, the work done for a variable force can be expressed as a [definite integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_integral "Definite integral") of force over displacement.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-25)

If the displacement as a variable of time is given by ∆**x**(t), then work done by the variable force from t 1 to t 2 is:

![Image 18: {\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {F} (t)\cdot \mathbf {v} (t)dt=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}P(t)dt.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ce9a9935838284020baaf5ab2ba96f24453238ca)
Thus, the work done for a variable force can be expressed as a definite integral of [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics) "Power (physics)") over time.

### Torque and rotation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Torque and rotation")]

A [force couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couple_(mechanics) "Couple (mechanics)") results from equal and opposite forces, acting on two different points of a rigid body. The sum (resultant) of these forces may cancel, but their effect on the body is the couple or torque **T**. The work of the torque is calculated as ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \delta W=\mathbf {T} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\omega }}\,dt,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/afc0fa6c868b74b713e7ca73faff73ee52aa89da) where the **T** ⋅ _**ω**_ is the power over the instant _dt_. The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the rigid body yields the work, ![Image 20: {\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {T} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\omega }}\,dt.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8241dbf14cabd8e06e55fcf01722b13e273d1239) This integral is computed along the trajectory of the rigid body with an angular velocity _**ω**_ that varies with time, and is therefore said to be _path dependent_.

If the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction, then it takes the form, ![Image 21: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\dot {\phi }}\mathbf {S} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/630f101188b8dcfd75a20673987a40ca0326a3b4) where ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) is the angle of rotation about the constant unit vector **S**. In this case, the work of the torque becomes, ![Image 23: {\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {T} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\omega }}\,dt=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {T} \cdot \mathbf {S} {\frac {d\phi }{dt}}dt=\int _{C}\mathbf {T} \cdot \mathbf {S} \,d\phi ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/08c92bf2fef89f86d461368a7b138a3d669dcddc) where _C_ is the trajectory from ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \phi (t_{1})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a6dcdb8c90f4fde4032fe0be7502b86b993328f5) to ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \phi (t_{2})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ea998c4e24018529cfd2134466189545dbeea34). This integral depends on the rotational trajectory ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \phi (t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/23781b983d21d78467b65e7e32b9e7bc05d625f8), and is therefore path-dependent.

If the torque ![Image 27: {\displaystyle \tau }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38a7dcde9730ef0853809fefc18d88771f95206c) is aligned with the angular velocity vector so that, [![Image 28: {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} =\tau \mathbf {S} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30b72ae28f4a7b461e35030e877fefe7eda7489f)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q48103) and both the torque and angular velocity are constant, then the work takes the form,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-Young-2)![Image 29: {\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\tau {\dot {\phi }}\,dt=\tau (\phi _{2}-\phi _{1}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/21f14349459a1f7d9356fed47582e80ed141bdc2)

A force of constant magnitude and perpendicular to the lever arm

This result can be understood more simply by considering the torque as arising from a force of constant magnitude _F_, being applied perpendicularly to a lever arm at a distance ![Image 31: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538), as shown in the figure. This force will act through the distance along the circular arc ![Image 32: {\displaystyle l=s=r\phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01d3a8ccdf3723ca3bc3fadfda54fbef7a25c023), so the work done is ![Image 33: {\displaystyle W=Fs=Fr\phi .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/355e2ef762e06b29d51d93290865421f53ac1798) Introduce the torque _τ_ = _Fr_, to obtain ![Image 34: {\displaystyle W=Fr\phi =\tau \phi ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c8369efe7b4f97ad2afb02e0fb60e305d7457804) as presented above.

Notice that only the component of torque in the direction of the angular velocity vector contributes to the work.

Work and potential energy
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Work and potential energy")]

The scalar product of a force **F** and the velocity **v** of its point of application defines the [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics) "Power (physics)") input to a system at an instant of time. Integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application, _C_ = **x**(_t_), defines the work input to the system by the force.

Therefore, the [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_work "Mechanical work") done by a force **F** on an object that travels along a curve _C_ is given by the [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral"): ![Image 35: {\displaystyle W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {x} =\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} dt,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad41ea906a31472351d54b4d3a6c1644fef82757) where _dx_(_t_) defines the trajectory _C_ and **v** is the velocity along this trajectory. In general this integral requires that the path along which the velocity is defined, so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependent.

The time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous power, ![Image 36: {\displaystyle {\frac {dW}{dt}}=P(t)=\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f66dfa886e6b38066ef4a832dd1d3cdaf51d758f)

If the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force, by the [gradient theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_theorem "Gradient theorem"), defines a potential function which is evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application. This means that there is a potential function _U_(**x**), that can be evaluated at the two points **x**(_t_ 1) and **x**(_t_ 2) to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points. It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is ![Image 37: {\displaystyle W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {x} =\int _{\mathbf {x} (t_{1})}^{\mathbf {x} (t_{2})}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {x} =U(\mathbf {x} (t_{1}))-U(\mathbf {x} (t_{2})).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8d905f560f0b933af6c093e432c493d1b0318daf)

The function _U_(**x**) is called the [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy") associated with the applied force. The force derived from such a potential function is said to be [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force "Conservative force"). Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces.

In this case, the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") of work yields [![Image 38: {\displaystyle \nabla W=-\nabla U=-\left({\frac {\partial U}{\partial x}},{\frac {\partial U}{\partial y}},{\frac {\partial U}{\partial z}}\right)=\mathbf {F} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/992dd2e43776610739af8c23ec67b3856c2e8d4c)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q11402) and the force **F** is said to be "derivable from a potential."[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-26)

Because the potential U defines a force **F** at every point **x** in space, the set of forces is called a [force field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(physics) "Force field (physics)"). The power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work, or potential, in the direction of the velocity **V** of the body, that is [![Image 39: {\displaystyle P(t)=-\nabla U\cdot \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39cdfc586392f80d5ef3b7de7d2989289b475e9e)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q25342)

[![Image 40](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Work_of_gravity_F_dot_d_equals_mgh.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Work_of_gravity_F_dot_d_equals_mgh.JPG)

Gravity _F_ = _mg_ does work _W_ = _mgh_ along any descending path

In the absence of other forces, gravity results in a constant downward acceleration of every freely moving object. Near Earth's surface the acceleration due to gravity is _g_ = 9.8 m⋅s−2 and the gravitational force on an object of mass _m_ is **F**g = _m_**g**. It is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") of the object.

If an object with weight _mg_ is displaced upwards or downwards a vertical distance _y_ 2 − _y_ 1, the work _W_ done on the object is: ![Image 41: {\displaystyle W=F_{g}(y_{2}-y_{1})=F_{g}\Delta y=mg\Delta y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b7e5b98f03cbe3578c21760d80edc9e4b277dfdc) where _F g_ is weight (pounds in imperial units, and newtons in SI units), and Δ _y_ is the change in height _y_. Notice that the work done by gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the object. The presence of friction does not affect the work done on the object by its weight.

#### Gravity in 3D space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Gravity in 3D space")]

The force of gravity exerted by a mass M on another mass m is given by ![Image 42: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =-{\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}=-{\frac {GMm}{r^{3}}}\mathbf {r} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4737d4b91184725b7e94b1b1aa49276a396eb6d) where **r** is the position vector from M to m and **r̂** is the unit vector in the direction of **r**.

Let the mass m move at the velocity **v**; then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position **r**(_t_ 1) to **r**(_t_ 2) is given by ![Image 43: {\displaystyle W=-\int _{\mathbf {r} (t_{1})}^{\mathbf {r} (t_{2})}{\frac {GMm}{r^{3}}}\mathbf {r} \cdot d\mathbf {r} =-\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\frac {GMm}{r^{3}}}\mathbf {r} \cdot \mathbf {v} \,dt.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b3be5bae571f2ae04285631a40816e371c185f7d) Notice that the position and velocity of the mass m are given by ![Image 44: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =r\mathbf {e} _{r},\qquad \mathbf {v} ={\frac {d\mathbf {r} }{dt}}={\dot {r}}\mathbf {e} _{r}+r{\dot {\theta }}\mathbf {e} _{t},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f73b6c9cb5d76c660236e3c1c86c65ffe57697d9) where **e**_r_ and **e**_t_ are the radial and tangential unit vectors directed relative to the vector from M to m, and we use the fact that ![Image 45: {\displaystyle d\mathbf {e} _{r}/dt={\dot {\theta }}\mathbf {e} _{t}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/475a7bc4105ad6c62ca2d880af6936e73186067a) Use this to simplify the formula for work of gravity to, ![Image 46: {\displaystyle W=-\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\frac {GmM}{r^{3}}}(r\mathbf {e} _{r})\cdot \left({\dot {r}}\mathbf {e} _{r}+r{\dot {\theta }}\mathbf {e} _{t}\right)dt=-\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\frac {GmM}{r^{3}}}r{\dot {r}}dt={\frac {GMm}{r(t_{2})}}-{\frac {GMm}{r(t_{1})}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ac439499279b8e642d41ded4740159dbe1e6928) This calculation uses the fact that ![Image 47: {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}r^{-1}=-r^{-2}{\dot {r}}=-{\frac {\dot {r}}{r^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68f74984cb177d2d1be704437e3b93467b37cf36) The function ![Image 48: {\displaystyle U=-{\frac {GMm}{r}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e4ba4c6266dadc7bda4935bf42846bd225e4ed1) is the gravitational potential function, also known as [gravitational potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential_energy "Gravitational potential energy"). The negative sign follows the convention that work is gained from a loss of potential energy.

Forces in springs assembled in parallel

Consider a spring that exerts a horizontal force **F** = (−_kx_, 0, 0) that is proportional to its deflection in the _x_ direction independent of how a body moves. The work of this spring on a body moving along the space with the curve **X**(_t_) = (_x_(_t_), _y_(_t_), _z_(_t_)), is calculated using its velocity, **v** = (_v_ x, _v_ y, _v_ z), to obtain ![Image 50: {\displaystyle W=\int _{0}^{t}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} dt=-\int _{0}^{t}kxv_{x}dt=-{\frac {1}{2}}kx^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ae7e7a0e814645c626066f3f2ce845cb0697bc81) For convenience, consider contact with the spring occurs at _t_ = 0, then the integral of the product of the distance x and the x-velocity, _xv_ x _dt_, over time t is ⁠1/2⁠_x_ 2. The work is the product of the distance times the spring force, which is also dependent on distance; hence the _x_ 2 result.

The work ![Image 51: {\displaystyle W}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54a9c4c547f4d6111f81946cad242b18298d70b7) done by a body of gas on its surroundings is: ![Image 52: {\displaystyle W=\int _{a}^{b}P\,dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c346817bc06ef7caec483ab7455606d05009860) where P is pressure, V is volume, and a and b are initial and final volumes.

Work–energy principle
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Work–energy principle")]

The principle of work and [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") (also known as the **work–energy principle**) states that _the work done by all forces acting on a particle (the work of the resultant force) equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle._[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-27) That is, the work _W_ done by the [resultant force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resultant_force "Resultant force") on a [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle") equals the change in the particle's kinetic energy ![Image 53: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ce71f608d367b0bb170515bcdb0cf74f7c6dcf73),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-Young-2)![Image 54: {\displaystyle W=\Delta E_{\text{k}}={\frac {1}{2}}mv_{2}^{2}-{\frac {1}{2}}mv_{1}^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd15b6b12dd6c8b8e37a4a03caaa40702523e6c4) where ![Image 55: {\displaystyle v_{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/98d33f5d498d528bd8c10edc8ac8c34347f32b3a) and ![Image 56: {\displaystyle v_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eb04c423c2cb809c30cac725befa14ffbf4c85f3) are the [speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed") of the particle before and after the work is done, and m is its [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass").

The derivation of the _work–energy principle_ begins with [Newton's second law of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law_of_motion "Newton's second law of motion") and the resultant force on a particle. Computation of the scalar product of the force with the velocity of the particle evaluates the instantaneous power added to the system.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-28) (Constraints define the direction of movement of the particle by ensuring there is no component of velocity in the direction of the constraint force. This also means the constraint forces do not add to the instantaneous power.) The time integral of this scalar equation yields work from the instantaneous power, and kinetic energy from the scalar product of acceleration with velocity. The fact that the work–energy principle eliminates the constraint forces underlies [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-29)

This section focuses on the work–energy principle as it applies to particle dynamics. In more general systems work can change the [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy") of a mechanical device, the thermal energy in a thermal system, or the [electrical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_energy "Electrical energy") in an electrical device. Work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another.

### Derivation for a particle moving along a straight line

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Derivation for a particle moving along a straight line")]

In the case the [resultant force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resultant_force "Resultant force")**F** is constant in both magnitude and direction, and parallel to the velocity of the particle, the particle is moving with constant acceleration _a_ along a straight line.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#cite_note-30) The relation between the net force and the acceleration is given by the equation _F_ = _ma_ ([Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law "Newton's second law")), and the particle [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)")s can be expressed by the equation ![Image 57: {\displaystyle s={\frac {v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}}{2a}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b53737c9a970c27853de621935e7a4635018fd4) which follows from ![Image 58: {\displaystyle v_{2}^{2}=v_{1}^{2}+2as}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6564ed829a2fb73bb9e9cd3a2b978665d23801f4) (see [Equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion "Equations of motion")).

The work of the net force is calculated as the product of its magnitude and the particle displacement. Substituting the above equations, one obtains: ![Image 59: {\displaystyle W=Fs=mas=ma{\frac {v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}}{2a}}={\frac {1}{2}}mv_{2}^{2}-{\frac {1}{2}}mv_{1}^{2}=\Delta E_{\text{k}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39336e38bdb0dd6e3b3e434a9cf3244ada453ade)

Other derivation: ![Image 60: {\displaystyle W=Fs=mas=m{\frac {v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}}{2s}}s={\frac {1}{2}}mv_{2}^{2}-{\frac {1}{2}}mv_{1}^{2}=\Delta E_{\text{k}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/730095b0ac730ccb71926128d853c1be3a51c285)

In the general case of rectilinear motion, when the net force **F** is not constant in magnitude, but is constant in direction, and parallel to the velocity of the particle, the work must be integrated along the path of the particle: ![Image 61: {\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} dt=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}F\,v\,dt=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}ma\,v\,dt=m\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}v\,{\frac {dv}{dt}}\,dt=m\int _{v_{1}}^{v_{2}}v\,dv={\tfrac {1}{2}}m\left(v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06e2910100f46f4d2774c3cfca4710c9b057a309)

### General derivation of the work–energy principle for a particle

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: General derivation of the work–energy principle for a particle")]

For any net force acting on a particle moving along any curvilinear path, it can be demonstrated that its work equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle by a simple derivation analogous to the equation above. It is known as **the work–energy principle**: ![Image 62: {\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} dt=m\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {v} dt={\frac {m}{2}}\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\frac {dv^{2}}{dt}}\,dt={\frac {m}{2}}\int _{v_{1}^{2}}^{v_{2}^{2}}dv^{2}={\frac {mv_{2}^{2}}{2}}-{\frac {mv_{1}^{2}}{2}}=\Delta E_{\text{k}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e957d837642873e498ca1ce161aff619de2212e)

The identity ![Image 63: {\textstyle \mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {v} ={\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {dv^{2}}{dt}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd2750c20f340add6f838880b7c49e51470a9fcc) requires some algebra. From the identity ![Image 64: {\textstyle v^{2}=\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dd8a3af513a73d4e14a652906b9a465bd2dc78d1) and definition ![Image 65: {\textstyle \mathbf {a} ={\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97a6ba6b4a6a710467141d55b931377d91a6fb4b) it follows ![Image 66: {\displaystyle {\frac {dv^{2}}{dt}}={\frac {d(\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {v} )}{dt}}={\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}\cdot \mathbf {v} +\mathbf {v} \cdot {\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}=2{\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}\cdot \mathbf {v} =2\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {v} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0239e9088c061a5877cd5b110332083d2f552c26)

The remaining part of the above derivation is just simple calculus, same as in the preceding rectilinear case.

### Derivation for a particle in constrained movement

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Derivation for a particle in constrained movement")]

In particle dynamics, a formula equating work applied to a system to its change in kinetic energy is obtained as a first integral of [Newton's second law of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion"). It is useful to notice that the resultant force used in Newton's laws can be separated into forces that are applied to the particle and forces imposed by constraints on the movement of the particle. Remarkably, the work of a constraint force is zero, therefore only the work of the applied forces need be considered in the work–energy principle.

To see this, consider a particle P that follows the trajectory **X**(_t_) with a force **F** acting on it. Isolate the particle from its environment to expose constraint forces **R**, then Newton's Law takes the form ![Image 67: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} +\mathbf {R} =m{\ddot {\mathbf {X} }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8c62f7a4f5084fa2fc19729d1067f80bf0bc2957) where m is the mass of the particle.

Note that n dots above a vector indicates its nth [time derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_derivative "Time derivative"). The [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_product "Scalar product") of each side of Newton's law with the velocity vector yields ![Image 68: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}=m{\ddot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/28373471328c2dcf276b694462b4a7959a329c08) because the constraint forces are perpendicular to the particle velocity. Integrate this equation along its trajectory from the point **X**(_t_ 1) to the point **X**(_t_ 2) to obtain ![Image 69: {\displaystyle \int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {F} \cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}dt=m\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\ddot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}dt.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/89a8547be94819c5b9ee8d4a7bea1260cca0129e)

The left side of this equation is the work of the applied force as it acts on the particle along the trajectory from time _t_ 1 to time _t_ 2. This can also be written as ![Image 70: {\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {F} \cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}dt=\int _{\mathbf {X} (t_{1})}^{\mathbf {X} (t_{2})}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {X} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3907b3bc1acc361fd355c76e388ae36ea31dc08b) This integral is computed along the trajectory **X**(_t_) of the particle and is therefore path dependent.

The right side of the first integral of Newton's equations can be simplified using the following identity ![Image 71: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {d}{dt}}({\dot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }})={\ddot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33b9e72f9617e1c6fec1094924889c60dd514c28) (see [product rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule "Product rule") for derivation). Now it is integrated explicitly to obtain the change in kinetic energy, ![Image 72: {\displaystyle \Delta K=m\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\ddot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}dt={\frac {m}{2}}\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\frac {d}{dt}}({\dot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }})dt={\frac {m}{2}}{\dot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}(t_{2})-{\frac {m}{2}}{\dot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}(t_{1})={\frac {1}{2}}m\Delta \mathbf {v} ^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e66808063c4a31017415a51f1ee8a6c8276e2973) where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity, ![Image 73: {\displaystyle K={\frac {m}{2}}{\dot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}={\frac {1}{2}}m{\mathbf {v} ^{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d48e5c6ec2251d5f80fea040511daeb6fdcc265)

#### Tangential and normal components

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Tangential and normal components")]

It is useful to resolve the velocity and acceleration vectors into tangential and normal components along the trajectory **X**(_t_), such that ![Image 74: {\displaystyle {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}=v\mathbf {T} \quad {\text{and}}\quad {\ddot {\mathbf {X} }}={\dot {v}}\mathbf {T} +v^{2}\kappa \mathbf {N} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6fe9936631c57e939c852de6a48043771b7bf94) where ![Image 75: {\displaystyle v=|{\dot {\mathbf {X} }}|={\sqrt {{\dot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/497eeaf3496febf1f7563692fc070d89bbf6442c) Then, the [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_product "Scalar product") of velocity with acceleration in Newton's second law takes the form ![Image 76: {\displaystyle \Delta K=m\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\dot {v}}v\,dt={\frac {m}{2}}\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\frac {d}{dt}}v^{2}\,dt={\frac {m}{2}}v^{2}(t_{2})-{\frac {m}{2}}v^{2}(t_{1}),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ee00b1666c6648b3c39cf478c0f01ec0c9714c8) where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity, ![Image 77: {\displaystyle K={\frac {m}{2}}v^{2}={\frac {m}{2}}{\dot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/501492d3610f9075d69db4fce889438d6aa673cc)

The result is the work–energy principle for particle dynamics, ![Image 78: {\displaystyle W=\Delta K.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e84ac5fe80d334fa1c83987c6552d659459c2c0e) This derivation can be generalized to arbitrary rigid body systems.

### Moving in a straight line (skid to a stop)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Moving in a straight line (skid to a stop)")]

Consider the case of a vehicle moving along a straight horizontal trajectory under the action of a driving force and gravity that sum to **F**. The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road define **R**, and we have ![Image 79: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} +\mathbf {R} =m{\ddot {\mathbf {X} }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c1e89fbfe7c74133802580327c00a2a78bc96945) For convenience let the trajectory be along the X-axis, so **X** = (_d_, 0) and the velocity is **V** = (_v_, 0), then **R** ⋅ **V** = 0, and **F** ⋅ **V** = _F_ x _v_, where _F_ x is the component of **F** along the X-axis, so ![Image 80: {\displaystyle F_{x}v=m{\dot {v}}v.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/98d67ac1d0acb5f16e2cd5761b74780ded8ea771) Integration of both sides yields ![Image 81: {\displaystyle \int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}F_{x}vdt={\frac {m}{2}}v^{2}(t_{2})-{\frac {m}{2}}v^{2}(t_{1}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/63dc83b0c381be0abe86e19df8acb04c67b6b0c8) If _F_ x is constant along the trajectory, then the integral of velocity is distance, so ![Image 82: {\displaystyle F_{x}(d(t_{2})-d(t_{1}))={\frac {m}{2}}v^{2}(t_{2})-{\frac {m}{2}}v^{2}(t_{1}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4276b02ad41bb585b8e05cad7b9caf9c3891265c)

As an example consider a car skidding to a stop, where _k_ is the coefficient of friction and _w_ is the weight of the car. Then the force along the trajectory is _F_ x = −_kw_. The velocity _v_ of the car can be determined from the length s of the skid using the work–energy principle, ![Image 83: {\displaystyle kws={\frac {w}{2g}}v^{2},\quad {\text{or}}\quad v={\sqrt {2ksg}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a96311ba7ce1623082dedb685003aae87d3231d6) This formula uses the fact that the mass of the vehicle is _m_ = _w_/_g_.

### Coasting down an inclined surface (gravity racing)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Coasting down an inclined surface (gravity racing)")]

Consider the case of a vehicle that starts at rest and coasts down an inclined surface (such as mountain road), the work–energy principle helps compute the minimum distance that the vehicle travels to reach a velocity _V_, of say 60 mph (88 fps). Rolling resistance and air drag will slow the vehicle down so the actual distance will be greater than if these forces are neglected.

Let the trajectory of the vehicle following the road be **X**(_t_) which is a curve in three-dimensional space. The force acting on the vehicle that pushes it down the road is the constant force of gravity **F** = (0, 0, _w_), while the force of the road on the vehicle is the constraint force **R**. Newton's second law yields, ![Image 86: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} +\mathbf {R} =m{\ddot {\mathbf {X} }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c1e89fbfe7c74133802580327c00a2a78bc96945) The [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_product "Scalar product") of this equation with the velocity, **V** = (_v_ x, _v_ y, _v_ z), yields ![Image 87: {\displaystyle wv_{z}=m{\dot {V}}V,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f74d9ec2f6c1d2a2c9cd7c92b443ac9b7c139655) where _V_ is the magnitude of **V**. The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road cancel from this equation because **R** ⋅ **V** = 0, which means they do no work. Integrate both sides to obtain ![Image 88: {\displaystyle \int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}wv_{z}dt={\frac {m}{2}}V^{2}(t_{2})-{\frac {m}{2}}V^{2}(t_{1}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20dbcd590bed1f4abe3a61a18287a39e8ba5c05c) The weight force _w_ is constant along the trajectory and the integral of the vertical velocity is the vertical distance, therefore, ![Image 89: {\displaystyle w\Delta z={\frac {m}{2}}V^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/223dbabd00e0b68861221b9e62cd7f0d481cbd9a) Recall that V(_t_ 1)=0. Notice that this result does not depend on the shape of the road followed by the vehicle.

In order to determine the distance along the road assume the downgrade is 6%, which is a steep road. This means the altitude decreases 6 feet for every 100 feet traveled—for angles this small the sin and tan functions are approximately equal. Therefore, the distance s in feet down a 6% grade to reach the velocity V is at least ![Image 90: {\displaystyle s={\frac {\Delta z}{0.06}}=8.3{\frac {V^{2}}{g}},\quad {\text{or}}\quad s=8.3{\frac {88^{2}}{32.2}}\approx 2000\mathrm {ft} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7101676a2f2d45510e904de9caafa1342ace377b) This formula uses the fact that the weight of the vehicle is _w_ = _mg_.

Work of forces acting on a rigid body
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Work_(physics)&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Work of forces acting on a rigid body")]

The work of forces acting at various points on a single rigid body can be calculated from the work of a [resultant force and torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resultant_force "Resultant force"). To see this, let the forces **F**1, **F**2, ..., **F**n act on the points **X**1, **X**2, ..., **X**_n_ in a rigid body.

The trajectories of **X**_i_, _i_ = 1, ..., _n_ are defined by the movement of the rigid body. This movement is given by the set of rotations [_A_(_t_)] and the trajectory **d**(_t_) of a reference point in the body. Let the coordinates **x**_i_ _i_ = 1, ..., _n_ define these points in the moving rigid body's [reference frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system")_M_, so that the trajectories traced in the fixed frame _F_ are given by ![Image 91: {\displaystyle \mathbf {X} _{i}(t)=[A(t)]\mathbf {x} _{i}+\mathbf {d} (t)\quad i=1,\ldots ,n.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/007f113cb9f2c64f292276ef03331e590deddaca)

The velocity of the points **X**_i_ along their trajectories are ![Image 92: {\displaystyle \mathbf {V} _{i}={\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times (\mathbf {X} _{i}-\mathbf {d} )+{\dot {\mathbf {d} }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/237ce1ddf7f8eaf77781f48d2fc278366a80e77e) where _**ω**_ is the angular velocity vector obtained from the skew symmetric matrix ![Image 93: {\displaystyle [\Omega ]={\dot {A}}A^{\mathsf {T}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f944ca8607581db78ecdfff09726268f85986c90) known as the angular velocity matrix.

The small amount of work by the forces over the small displacements _δ_**r**_i_ can be determined by approximating the displacement by _δ_**r** = **v**_δt_ so ![Image 94: {\displaystyle \delta W=\mathbf {F} _{1}\cdot \mathbf {V} _{1}\delta t+\mathbf {F} _{2}\cdot \mathbf {V} _{2}\delta t+\ldots +\mathbf {F} _{n}\cdot \mathbf {V} _{n}\delta t}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74f789481eaff3c7ba6de27d86fec0c190fa146a) or ![Image 95: {\displaystyle \delta W=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} _{i}\cdot ({\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times (\mathbf {X} _{i}-\mathbf {d} )+{\dot {\mathbf {d} }})\delta t.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a55eac4883556f9fd7848e722a51d73fd5bc3a21)

This formula can be rewritten to obtain ![Image 96: {\displaystyle \delta W=\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} _{i}\right)\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {d} }}\delta t+\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left(\mathbf {X} _{i}-\mathbf {d} \right)\times \mathbf {F} _{i}\right)\cdot {\boldsymbol {\omega }}\delta t=\left(\mathbf {F} \cdot {\dot {\mathbf {d} }}+\mathbf {T} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\omega }}\right)\delta t,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b61985a21a75980cc0bd026fee7539a018812e2) where **F** and **T** are the [resultant force and torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resultant_force "Resultant force") applied at the reference point **d** of the moving frame _M_ in the rigid body.
