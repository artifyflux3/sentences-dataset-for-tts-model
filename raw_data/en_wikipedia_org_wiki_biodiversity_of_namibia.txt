Namibia's endangered species include the wild dog , black rhino , oribi and puku .

Endangered species [ edit ] Namibia has many endangered species within its national parks and wildlife resorts. The puku antelope is limited to about 100 individuals along the Chobe River in Botswana and the Linyati marshes in Namibia. The black rhino and white rhino have suffered the most from poaching and are on the verge of extinction. If there had been no effort to save them in the last 20 years they most likely would have disappeared. While both species occur naturally in Namibia, in many of the reserves they have been reintroduced. The country also has the largest population in southern Africa of cheetahs not contained within national parks. There are over twenty species of antelope ranging from the largest, the eland , to the smallest, the Damara dik-dik . The gemsbok , a striking antelope with long symmetrical horns and distinctive black and white markings, is featured on the Namibian coat of arms. Namibia also harbours a wealth of small mammals including mongoose , jackal as well as the less common antbear and honey badger , both solitary and nocturnal.

National parks and nature reserves [ edit ] Main article: Communal wildlife conservancies in Namibia Namibia's parks and reserves range from the open bush of the centre and the north where wildlife is relatively plentiful, to the barren and inhospitable coastal strip with its huge sand dunes. The three main tourist attractions for wildlife in Namibia are Etosha National Park , Waterberg National Park and Cape Cross Seal Reserve .
