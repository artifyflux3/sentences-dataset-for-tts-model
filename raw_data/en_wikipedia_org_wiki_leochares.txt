Works [ edit ] Diana of Versailles Leochares worked at the construction of the Mausoleum of Mausolos at Halicarnassus , one of the " Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ". The Diana of Versailles is a Roman copy of his original ( c.

325 BC ). He is also thought to be the creator of the celebrated Apollo Belvedere , of which a Roman copy is currently housed in Vatican City .

Of his portrait-statues, the most celebrated were those of Philip , Alexander , Amyntas III , Olympias , and Eurydice I , which were made of ivory and gold, and were placed in the Philippeion , a circular building in the Altis at Olympia , erected by Philip II of Macedon in celebration of his victory at Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) .
