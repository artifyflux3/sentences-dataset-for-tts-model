It traces it historical origins to 1831 when Westbrook Seminary opened on what is now the UNE Portland Campus.

UNE is the largest private university in the state of Maine [ 7 ] and the largest educator of healthcare professionals for Maine.

[ 8 ] It is organized into five colleges that combine to offer more than 70 undergraduate, graduate, online, and professional degrees. The university is classified among "R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity." [ 9 ] History [ edit ] In 1939, a boys-only high school and junior college called the College Séraphique was founded in Biddeford by Father Decary and the Franciscan friar of St. Andre's parish.

[ 1 ] In 1952, the school changed its name to St. Francis College and began granting bachelor's degrees with state approval in 1953.

[ 1 ] The high school program was phased out by 1961, and the college was first accredited in 1966.

[ 1 ] [ 10 ] The school became co-educational for the first time in 1967, and the Franciscans withdrew from the administration of the college in 1974.

[ 1 ] To survive dropping enrollment, St. Francis College entered into an agreement with the New England Foundation for Osteopathic Medicine in 1978 to establish the New England College of Osteopathic Medicine on the same campus, and in 1979 the two together became the University of New England (the merger would not be fully complete until a 1987 vote by the College of Osteopathic Medicine corporation).

[ 1 ] [ 11 ] In 1996, Westbrook College merged with the University of New England. The merger took place under the terms of the original 1831 Westbrook charter, and the combined institutions became Westbrook College before changing the name back to the University of New England.

[ 12 ] In October 2020, the University of New England received a gift of $30 million from the Harold Alfond Foundation as part of a major investment in eight Maine institutions for the purpose of growing the state’s workforce and economy and supporting quality health care. The grant will support the construction of a new facility for the relocation of the University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine from the Biddeford Campus to the Portland Campus, the establishment of a new Institute for Interprofessional Education and Practice, and the acceleration of high-growth undergraduate and graduate programs on the Biddeford Campus to meet student demand and workforce needs, such as aquaculture, entrepreneurship, criminal justice, sports media communication, and others.

[ 13 ] James D. Herbert serves as UNE's sixth president. His tenure began on July 1, 2017, immediately following the 11-year tenure of Danielle N. Ripich .

[ 14 ] Campuses [ edit ] UNE offers three campuses that provide students with a range of learning environments. The university's two campuses in coastal Maine, USA, house undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs, while its Tangier Campus provides a semester-abroad opportunity in Morocco.

[ 15 ] Biddeford Campus [ edit ] The Biddeford Campus covers 540 acres (220 ha), with 0.75 miles (1.21 km) of ocean frontage where the Saco River flows into the Atlantic Ocean.

[ 16 ] The 26 buildings on the campus include the Harold Alfond Center for Health Sciences, the Pickus Center for Biomedical Research, and the Marine Science Center.

The Harold Alfond Center for Health Sciences houses Maine's only medical school : The University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine .

[ 17 ] UNE's Biddeford Campus is also home to the George and Barbara Bush Center, which houses material chronicling the Bush legacy in Maine, including memorabilia on loan from the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library at Texas A & M University . The Center includes a replica of the Oval Office during Bush's term in the White House and a statue of the former president. Each year, UNE hosts an annual lecture at its Biddeford Campus that was often attended by the former president and his family.

[ 18 ] In September 2017, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell visited UNE's Biddeford Campus to deliver the Bush Lecture.

[ 19 ] The UNE Biddeford Campus also includes the Harold Alfond Forum, which offers 105,000 square-feet (9,800 m2) of athletic and learning space, including: an NHL-size ice hockey rink with 900 seats, a basketball court with 1,200 seats, classrooms, a fitness center, and multi-purpose indoor practice courts that are also used for performances and lectures.

[ 20 ] A $10 million gift from the Harold Alfond Foundation facilitated the building's construction and the development of associated programming.

[ 21 ] UNE also owns Ram Island , off the coast of the Biddeford Campus, which serves as a field station for student and faculty researchers.

[ 22 ] Portland Campus [ edit ] Main article: Westbrook College Historic District Ludcke Auditorium, Portland Campus The UNE Portland Campus, located on Stevens Avenue , houses the university's Westbrook College of Health Professions and the College of Dental Medicine. The College of Dental Medicine, which is housed in the $14.5 million Oral Health Center, graduated its first class in 2017.

[ 23 ] It is Maine's only dental college.

[ 24 ] Other features of the UNE Portland Campus include the Art Gallery, the Maine Women Writers Collection, Alumni Hall , and the Center for Global Humanities. Alumni Hall is the oldest building on campus, dating to an original opening in 1834; its most recent renovation was completed in 2016.

[ 25 ] The Center for Global Humanities hosts scholars from around the globe for public lectures. Past lectures have featured Noam Chomsky , [ 26 ] Sherwin Nuland , [ 27 ] and Bill McKibben [ 28 ] as speakers.

Tangier Campus [ edit ] In January 2014, UNE opened a campus in Tangier, Morocco , within the campus of the American School of Tangier . The UNE campus consists of two buildings—one for academic programming and the other for student and staff housing. It also includes an outdoor court colored UNE blue.

[ 29 ] While studying in Morocco, UNE students take excursions to Casablanca , Fez , Marrakesh , and a UNE satellite program in Seville , Spain.

[ 30 ] The UNE Tangier Campus also hosts the Tangier Global Forum, a public lecture series designed to facilitate discussion of issues facing the global community. On May 12, 2017, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell visited the UNE Tangier Campus to present a lecture titled "Is Peace Possible in the Middle East?" [ 31 ] Academics [ edit ] UNE offers more than 70 undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs.

[ 32 ] The university also has Maine's only medical school and Maine's only dental school.

[ 33 ] Westbrook College of Health Professions [ edit ] The UNE Westbrook College of Health Professions prepares students for careers in the healthcare fields. Students participate in clinical simulations, inter-professional learning experiences, service learning, and other experiences that enable them to transition smoothly into the workforce upon graduation. Programs included are Pharmacy, Physician Assistant, Physical Therapy, Social Work, Occupational Therapy, and Nurse Anesthesia.

[ 34 ] The Westbrook College of Health Professions confers undergraduate degrees including a B.S. in Applied Exercise Science, B.S. in Dental Hygiene, and B.S. in Nursing; as well as graduate and doctorate degrees such as Master of Science in Athletic Training (M.S.A.T.), Master of Science in Occupational Therapy (M.S.O.T.), Master of Science in Physician Assistant (M.S.P.A.), Master of Science in Social Work (M.S.W.), Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), and Doctor of Physical Therapy (D.P.T.).

Its graduates constitute 25 percent of primary care physicians practicing in rural parts of Maine, and 10 percent of practicing physicians in the state.

[ 17 ] [ 36 ] Founded in 1978, it is accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) and the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.
