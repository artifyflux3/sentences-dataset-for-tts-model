[ 1 ] While the range of potential historical sources has expanded to include many non-documentary sources, nevertheless "the study of history has nearly always been based squarely on what the historian can read in documents or hear from informants".

[ 2 ] Historical sources are usually divided into primary and secondary, though some historians also refer to tertiary sources.

Types [ edit ] Primary source [ edit ] Main article: Primary source In the study of history as an academic discipline, a "primary source" (also called an "original source") is a first hand account of events by someone who lived through them. "Primary sources were made during the historical period that is being investigated." [ 3 ] Secondary source [ edit ] Main article: Secondary source In scholarship , a secondary source [ 4 ] [ 5 ] is a document or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere.

A secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. In a secondary source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format.  Secondary sources involve generalization , analysis ,  interpretation, or evaluation of the original information.

Tertiary source [ edit ] Main article: Tertiary source A tertiary source is an index or textual consolidation of already published primary and secondary sources [ 6 ] that does not provide additional interpretations or analysis of the sources.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Some tertiary sources can be used as an aid to find key (seminal) sources, key terms, general common knowledge [ 9 ] and established mainstream science on a topic. The exact definition of tertiary varies by academic field .
