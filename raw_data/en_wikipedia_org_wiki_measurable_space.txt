In mathematics , a measurable space or Borel space [ 1 ] is a basic object in measure theory . It consists of a set and a σ-algebra , which defines the subsets that will be measured.

It captures and generalises intuitive notions such as length, area, and volume with a set X {\displaystyle X} of 'points' in the space, but regions of the space are the elements of the σ-algebra , since the intuitive measures are not usually defined for points. The algebra also captures the relationships that might be expected of regions: that a region can be defined as an intersection of other regions, a union of other regions, or the space with the exception of another region.

Definition [ edit ] Consider a set X {\displaystyle X} and a σ-algebra F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} on X .

{\displaystyle X.} Then the tuple ( X , F ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {F}})} is called a measurable space.

[ 2 ] The elements of F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} are called measurable sets within the measurable space.

Note that in contrast to a measure space , no measure is needed for a measurable space.

Example [ edit ] Look at the set: X = { 1 , 2 , 3 } .

{\displaystyle X=\{1,2,3\}.} One possible σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra would be: F 1 = { X , ∅ ∅ } .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}_{1}=\{X,\varnothing \}.} Then ( X , F 1 ) {\displaystyle \left(X,{\mathcal {F}}_{1}\right)} is a measurable space. Another possible σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra would be the power set on X {\displaystyle X} : F 2 = P ( X ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}_{2}={\mathcal {P}}(X).} With this, a second measurable space on the set X {\displaystyle X} is given by ( X , F 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \left(X,{\mathcal {F}}_{2}\right).} Common measurable spaces [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} is finite or countably infinite, the σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra is most often the power set on X , {\displaystyle X,} so F = P ( X ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}={\mathcal {P}}(X).} This leads to the measurable space ( X , P ( X ) ) .

{\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {P}}(X)).} If X {\displaystyle X} is a topological space , the σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra is most commonly the Borel σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra B , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}},} so F = B ( X ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}={\mathcal {B}}(X).} This leads to the measurable space ( X , B ( X ) ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {B}}(X))} that is common for all topological spaces such as the real numbers R .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} .} Ambiguity with Borel spaces [ edit ] The term Borel space is used for different types of measurable spaces. It can refer to any measurable space, so it is a synonym for a measurable space as defined above [ 1 ] a measurable space that is Borel isomorphic to a measurable subset of the real numbers (again with the Borel σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra) [ 3 ] Families F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} of sets over Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } v t e Is necessarily true of F : : {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\colon } or, is F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} closed under: Directed by ⊇ ⊇ {\displaystyle \,\supseteq } A ∩ ∩ B {\displaystyle A\cap B} A ∪ ∪ B {\displaystyle A\cup B} B ∖ ∖ A {\displaystyle B\setminus A} Ω Ω ∖ ∖ A {\displaystyle \Omega \setminus A} A 1 ∩ ∩ A 2 ∩ ∩ ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap \cdots } A 1 ∪ ∪ A 2 ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup \cdots } Ω Ω ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle \Omega \in {\mathcal {F}}} ∅ ∅ ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle \varnothing \in {\mathcal {F}}} F.I.P.

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}.} A semialgebra is a semiring where every complement Ω Ω ∖ ∖ A {\displaystyle \Omega \setminus A} is equal to a finite disjoint union of sets in F .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}.} A , B , A 1 , A 2 , … … {\displaystyle A,B,A_{1},A_{2},\ldots } are arbitrary elements of F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} and it is assumed that F ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ .
