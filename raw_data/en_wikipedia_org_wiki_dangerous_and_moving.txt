and the English-language equivalent of the album Lyudi Invalidy ( "People with disabilities" ). The album was first released on 5 October 2005 in Japan then on 10 October in the UK, 11 October in North America, and in Europe and Latin America, on 14 October. As of January 2010 the album sold 93,000 copies in the United States and had peaked at number 131 on Billboard 200 .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Production [ edit ] Production on Dangerous and Moving spanned from Los Angeles to London and Moscow. There were two notable recording sessions with the record's producer, Sergio Galoyan . The first took place in Moscow between 4 and 20 August 2004 with just Lena, producing songs like "Cosmos", "Sacrifice" (one demo featuring Claire Guy) and demos "All My Love" (an English counterpart to "Вся моя любовь"), "I Know", "One Love" and "You". The second recording session took place from 17 January to 18 April 2005 in Los Angeles with "Sacrifice", "Perfect Enemy" and the demo of "We Shout" (titled "Reach Out") also sung by Lena. Yulia was not present during the recording sessions due to her pregnancy.

[ 7 ] Other demo versions of the songs are available online, such as "All About Us" (performed by the Veronicas ), "Sacrifice" (with both Yulia and Lena), "Perfect Enemy" (recorded by Claire Guy and sometimes referred to as "Wrap It Up"), and "Обезьянка ноль".

Although Sting , Dave Stewart , Richard Carpenter , the Veronicas and Claire Guy did work on the album, they did not actually meet the girls for production. Sergio Galoyan became a liaison for the production. However, Richard Carpenter did meet the girls after the recording of the album at their video shoot for the single Friend or Foe . The video was shot on location at Bronson Cave in Hollywood, directed by James Cox, while the executive producer was Grant Cihlar for 1171 Production Group. According to the booklet, the album was recorded at eight different recording studios. The album cover photography and design was made by their own music group, TA Music.

Differences from Lyudi Invalidy [ edit ] Lyudi Invalidy and Dangerous and Moving effectively have eight tracks in common, either in the form of being the same track or being English/Russian-counterparts: "Люди инвалиды" / "Dangerous and Moving" (49-second intro) "All About Us" "Loves Me Not" "Обезьянка ноль" (an English version, "Null and Void", exists [ 8 ] but was not included; it was later released in " The Best ") "Космос" / "Cosmos (Outer Space)" "Ничья" / "We Shout" "Новая модель" / "Perfect Enemy" "Люди инвалиды" / "Dangerous and Moving" (full version) Three tracks from Lyudi Invalidy do not have counterparts on Dangerous and Moving : "Ты согласна" "Вся моя любовь" (An English version, "All My Love", exists [ 9 ] in demo form with only Lena singing but was not recorded with both girls) "Что не хватает" Four tracks from Dangerous and Moving do not have counterparts on Lyudi Invalidy : "Friend or Foe" "Gomenasai" "Craving" "Sacrifice" The tracks that the two albums have in common were all reordered, with only tracks 1 and 4 being the same between the two; however, the full versions of "Люди инвалиды" / "Dangerous and Moving" are the final tracks of both albums (track 11 on Lyudi Invalidy and track 12 on Dangerous and Moving ) On this album, "Loves Me Not" has different music than the version on the Russian album counterpart Люди-инвалиды. Among other differences, the Lyudi Invalidy version features 29 seconds of instrumentals before the lyrics start, while the Dangerous and Moving version skips straight to the lyrics; and the Dangerous and Moving version features roaring guitars during the chorus, which are absent from the Lyudi Invalidy version.

The girls sing an extra verse in "Cosmos" after the second chorus; in "Космос", this is an instrumental break with no lyrics.

Critical reception [ edit ] Professional ratings Aggregate scores Source Rating Metacritic 53/100 [ 10 ] Review scores Source Rating AllMusic [ 11 ] BBC (Positive) [ 12 ] The Boston Phoenix [ 13 ] The Guardian [ 14 ] IndieLondon (Positive) [ 15 ] Popmatters [ 16 ] Rolling Stone [ 17 ] SputnikMusic [ 18 ] Stylus Magazine B+ [ 19 ] Dangerous and Moving was met with "mixed or average" reviews from critics. At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 53 based on 10 reviews.

[ 10 ] In a review for AllMusic , critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: "Since the beats are monotonous, since the songs are insipid and forgettable, since the girls not only can't sing but have no on-record charisma, since there's no sense of style and, most importantly, sense of fun to this whole enterprise, Dangerous and Moving is the worst kind of pop music: the kind that is better to theorize about than to listen to" [ 11 ] At Rolling Stone , Barry Walters said: "Although spunky cuties Julia Volkova and Lena Katina have improved their English-pronunciation skills, the hooks they're handed this second time around are decidedly duller, and the limitations of their vocal abilities are exaggerated, not concealed, by the bluntly simplistic tunes." [ 17 ] Commercial performance [ edit ] The album was initially released on 5 October 2005 in Japan , where it peaked at number ten, a worse result than the first album 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane , which debuted at number one on the Japanese chart in 2003.

[ 20 ] In fact, the latter had sold over 500,000 copies in Japan in its first week of release alone, while Dangerous and Moving only managed to sell 23,000 copies in its first week.

[ 20 ] In Taiwan , Dangerous and Moving reached number one on the Western Albums Chart, [ 21 ] and number four on the Combined Album Chart, dropping out of the top twenty after four weeks. As of December 2005, the album has sold 15,000 copies there, and was certified gold by Recording Industry Foundation in Taiwan .

[ 22 ] On 10 October 2005, the album was released in the UK , on 11 October in North America and on 14 October in Europe and Latin America . In Germany , the album reached number twelve in the album chart and remained there for six weeks. In Italy , the album spent three weeks in the top twenty, entering at number eighteen and peaking at number fifteen.

[ 23 ] In France , the album stayed in the chart for twenty-three weeks, selling around 70,000 copies in 2005.

[ 24 ] In most of the remaining European countries, the album reached at least the top forty.

In the United States, the album placed at number 131 on the Billboard 200 , with a total of 93,000 certified units in the country.

[ 4 ] In the UK the album spent only one week in the Official Albums Chart , peaking at number seventy-eight on 22 October 2005.
