For example, that every equivalence relation is symmetric, but not necessarily antisymmetric, is indicated by Y in the "Symmetric" column and ✗ in the "Antisymmetric" column, respectively.

All definitions tacitly require the homogeneous relation R {\displaystyle R} be transitive : for all a , b , c , {\displaystyle a,b,c,} if a R b {\displaystyle aRb} and b R c {\displaystyle bRc} then a R c .

{\displaystyle aRc.} A term's definition may require additional properties that are not listed in this table.

A symmetric relation is a type of binary relation . Formally, a binary relation R over a set X is symmetric if: [ 1 ] ∀ ∀ a , b ∈ ∈ X ( a R b ⇔ ⇔ b R a ) , {\displaystyle \forall a,b\in X(aRb\Leftrightarrow bRa),} where the notation aRb means that ( a , b ) ∈ R .

An example is the relation "is equal to", because if a = b is true then b = a is also true. If R T represents the converse of R , then R is symmetric if and only if R = R T .

[ 2 ] Symmetry, along with reflexivity and transitivity , are the three defining properties of an equivalence relation .

[ 1 ] Examples [ edit ] In mathematics [ edit ] "is equal to" ( equality ) (whereas "is less than" is not symmetric) "is comparable to", for elements of a partially ordered set "... and ... are odd": Outside mathematics [ edit ] "is married to" (in most legal systems) "is a fully biological sibling of" "is a homophone of" "is a co-worker of" "is a teammate of" Relationship to asymmetric and antisymmetric relations [ edit ] Symmetric and antisymmetric relations By definition, a nonempty relation cannot be both symmetric and asymmetric (where if a is related to b , then b cannot be related to a (in the same way)). However, a relation can be neither symmetric nor asymmetric, which is the case for "is less than or equal to" and "preys on").

Symmetric and antisymmetric (where the only way a can be related to b and b be related to a is if a = b ) are actually independent of each other, as these examples show.

Mathematical examples Symmetric Not symmetric Antisymmetric equality divides , less than or equal to Not antisymmetric congruence in modular arithmetic // (integer division), most nontrivial permutations Non-mathematical examples Symmetric Not symmetric Antisymmetric is the same person as, and is married is the plural of Not antisymmetric is a full biological sibling of preys on Properties [ edit ] A symmetric and transitive relation is always quasireflexive .

[ a ] One way to count the symmetric relations on n elements, that in their binary matrix representation the upper right triangle determines the relation fully, and it can be arbitrary given, thus there are as many symmetric relations as n × n binary upper triangle matrices, 2 n ( n +1)/2 .

Notes [ edit ] ^ If xRy , the yRx by symmetry, hence xRx by transitivity. The proof of xRy ⇒ yRy is similar.
