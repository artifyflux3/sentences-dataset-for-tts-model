Its intensity is estimated to have been T5 on the TORRO scale , equating to F2 on the Fujita scale .

Meteorological synopsis [ edit ] On the morning of 7 December, the UK was under the influence of a strong Atlantic Ocean low pressure system , which was named Ulrike , [ 1 ] bringing unstable weather conditions to much of the UK, and the south in particular. At approximately 07:30 GMT, a small band of thunderstorms initialised over Cornwall moving east-northeast across the country. By approximately 10:00 am, the squall line had reached Salisbury , where a drop in humidity was recorded, which may have resulted in an increase of atmospheric pressure behind the squall, causing it to accelerate forward. This increased motion in combination with a change in wind direction ahead of the storm may have initialised the rotation of the mesocyclone in one of the now strong storm cells, resulting in the touchdown of the T5 tornado in Kensal Rise, London, at 11 am.

[ 2 ] Aftermath [ edit ] The London Fire Brigade and structural surveyors assessed the damage and structural safety of affected properties. In the meantime, several hundred people were displaced from their homes until they had been declared safe for their occupants to return.

Brent London Borough Council announced that none of the affected properties were likely to be demolished, though a total of 29 homes were declared as unfit for habitation due to the damage caused by the tornado.
