This current results from the movement of water from the West Wind Drift as it rounds Cape Horn . It takes its name from the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ). This cold current mixes with the tropical Brazil Current in the Argentine Sea (see Brazil–Falkland Confluence ), giving it its temperate climate.

[ 1 ] The current is an equatorward flowing current that carries cold and relatively fresh subantarctic water.  The Falkland Current is a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current .  It transports between 60 and 90 Sverdrups of water with speeds ranging from a half a meter to a meter per second.  Hydrographic data in this area is very scarce and thus various hydrographic variables have a great deal of error. The Falkland Current is not a surface current like the Brazil Current but it extends all the way to the sea-floor. Typical temperatures for the current are around 6 °C, with a salinity of 33.5–34.5 psu.
