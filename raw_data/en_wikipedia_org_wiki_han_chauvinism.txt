Han chauvinism is an ideology centered around the belief in the supremacy of the Han Chinese people and the view that Han Chinese culture is unique or more civilized than other cultures. Han chauvinists believe that the current influence from the West has downgraded the development of China's own cultural customs, and in response, it has become instrumental in leading the increasingly traditionalist movement.

[ 1 ] The constitution of the People's Republic of China officially opposes "Han chauvinism" and " local ethnic chauvinism ".

History [ edit ] Mao Zedong first criticized Han chauvinism in 1938 and these criticisms continued throughout his rule.

[ 2 ] For example, Mao's 1956 speech On the Ten Major Relationships emphasizes the need to oppose Han chauvinism.

[ 3 ] The Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s notions of China as a multicultural state have been subjected to criticism by the western media.

[ 4 ] Many policies have been made to give privileges to minority ethnicities, leading to legal inequality.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] CCP former leader Deng Xiaoping also criticized Han chauvinism.

[ 2 ] The current CCP general secretary Xi Jinping has officially criticized Han chauvinism.

[ 7 ] However, the Chinese Dream , a core concept of Xi is believed by some to have Han-centric dimensions.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In ethnic relations [ edit ] Further information: Racism in China Although the current Chinese government has largely attempted to promote the idea of a multiethnic nationalism instead of a singular ethnic nationalism , individuals have pointed about the lack of an agreed-upon definition of Chinese nationalism may have impacted on China's political decision with regard to other non-Han people and non-Chinese nations.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 1 ] [ 13 ] [ needs update ] Tibetans [ edit ] Further information: Sinicization of Tibet and Human rights in Tibet Since the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China , controversy has existed because of the view that Tibet was historically a feudal region that practiced serfdom/slavery until communist influence in the region liberated the Tibetans.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Some academics have described relations with Tibetans as a form of Han settler colonialism .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Xinjiang [ edit ] Further information: Xinjiang conflict and Persecution of Uyghurs in China Since 1758, the region of Xinjiang has issues with government policy, which further extend to ethnic relations.

[ 21 ] Han and Hui people often live closer to Uyghurs, and stereotypes were developed.

[ 22 ] Mongols [ edit ] Further information: 2020 Inner Mongolia protests Mongols have been perceived to be better integrated into society than Uyghurs and Tibetans.

[ 23 ] However, there were ethnic tensions and stereotypes.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] Relationship to Chinese nationalism [ edit ] Han nationalism and Chinese nationalism (as well as Han Chinese chauvinism or Chinese chauvinism) are different in terms of ideology, with the latter frequently focusing on a more multiethnic form of nationalism .

[ 26 ] There were a significant and large group of proponents of a multiethnic form of Chinese nationalism along with other scholars as well.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] The multifaceted image of Han Chinese nationalism further developed during the buildup to modern Chinese statehood.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Han Chinese nationalism also played a part in World War II, when the Second Sino-Japanese War occurred, where the Han Chinese people frequently suffered, and fought, against the Japanese.
