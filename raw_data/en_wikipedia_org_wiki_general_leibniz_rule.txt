It states that if f {\displaystyle f} and g {\displaystyle g} are n -times differentiable functions , then the product f g {\displaystyle fg} is also n -times differentiable and its n -th derivative is given by ( f g ) ( n ) = ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( n k ) f ( n − − k ) g ( k ) , {\displaystyle (fg)^{(n)}=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{n \choose k}f^{(n-k)}g^{(k)},} where ( n k ) = n !

k !

( n − − k ) !

{\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}} is the binomial coefficient and f ( j ) {\displaystyle f^{(j)}} denotes the j th derivative of f (and in particular f ( 0 ) = f {\displaystyle f^{(0)}=f} ).

The rule can be proven by using the product rule and mathematical induction .

Second derivative [ edit ] If, for example, n = 2 , the rule gives an expression for the second derivative of a product of two functions: ( f g ) ″ ( x ) = ∑ ∑ k = 0 2 ( 2 k ) f ( 2 − − k ) ( x ) g ( k ) ( x ) = f ″ ( x ) g ( x ) + 2 f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) + f ( x ) g ″ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle (fg)''(x)=\sum \limits _{k=0}^{2}{{\binom {2}{k}}f^{(2-k)}(x)g^{(k)}(x)}=f''(x)g(x)+2f'(x)g'(x)+f(x)g''(x).} More than two factors [ edit ] The formula can be generalized to the product of m differentiable functions f 1 ,..., f m .

( f 1 f 2 ⋯ ⋯ f m ) ( n ) = ∑ ∑ k 1 + k 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + k m = n ( n k 1 , k 2 , … … , k m ) ∏ ∏ 1 ≤ ≤ t ≤ ≤ m f t ( k t ) , {\displaystyle \left(f_{1}f_{2}\cdots f_{m}\right)^{(n)}=\sum _{k_{1}+k_{2}+\cdots +k_{m}=n}{n \choose k_{1},k_{2},\ldots ,k_{m}}\prod _{1\leq t\leq m}f_{t}^{(k_{t})}\,,} where the sum extends over all m -tuples ( k 1 ,..., k m ) of non-negative integers with ∑ ∑ t = 1 m k t = n , {\textstyle \sum _{t=1}^{m}k_{t}=n,} and ( n k 1 , k 2 , … … , k m ) = n !

k 1 !

k 2 !

⋯ ⋯ k m !

{\displaystyle {n \choose k_{1},k_{2},\ldots ,k_{m}}={\frac {n!}{k_{1}!\,k_{2}!\cdots k_{m}!}}} are the multinomial coefficients . This is akin to the multinomial formula from algebra.

Proof [ edit ] The proof of the general Leibniz rule [ 2 ] : 68–69 proceeds by induction.  Let f {\displaystyle f} and g {\displaystyle g} be n {\displaystyle n} -times differentiable functions.  The base case when n = 1 {\displaystyle n=1} claims that: ( f g ) ′ = f ′ g + f g ′ , {\displaystyle (fg)'=f'g+fg',} which is the usual product rule and is known to be true.  Next, assume that the statement holds for a fixed n ≥ ≥ 1 , {\displaystyle n\geq 1,} that is, that ( f g ) ( n ) = ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( n k ) f ( n − − k ) g ( k ) .

{\displaystyle (fg)^{(n)}=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n-k)}g^{(k)}.} Then, ( f g ) ( n + 1 ) = [ ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( n k ) f ( n − − k ) g ( k ) ] ′ = ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( n k ) f ( n + 1 − − k ) g ( k ) + ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( n k ) f ( n − − k ) g ( k + 1 ) = ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( n k ) f ( n + 1 − − k ) g ( k ) + ∑ ∑ k = 1 n + 1 ( n k − − 1 ) f ( n + 1 − − k ) g ( k ) = ( n 0 ) f ( n + 1 ) g ( 0 ) + ∑ ∑ k = 1 n ( n k ) f ( n + 1 − − k ) g ( k ) + ∑ ∑ k = 1 n ( n k − − 1 ) f ( n + 1 − − k ) g ( k ) + ( n n ) f ( 0 ) g ( n + 1 ) = ( n + 1 0 ) f ( n + 1 ) g ( 0 ) + ( ∑ ∑ k = 1 n [ ( n k − − 1 ) + ( n k ) ] f ( n + 1 − − k ) g ( k ) ) + ( n + 1 n + 1 ) f ( 0 ) g ( n + 1 ) = ( n + 1 0 ) f ( n + 1 ) g ( 0 ) + ∑ ∑ k = 1 n ( n + 1 k ) f ( n + 1 − − k ) g ( k ) + ( n + 1 n + 1 ) f ( 0 ) g ( n + 1 ) = ∑ ∑ k = 0 n + 1 ( n + 1 k ) f ( n + 1 − − k ) g ( k ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(fg)^{(n+1)}&=\left[\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n-k)}g^{(k)}\right]'\\&=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}+\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n-k)}g^{(k+1)}\\&=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}+\sum _{k=1}^{n+1}{\binom {n}{k-1}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}\\&={\binom {n}{0}}f^{(n+1)}g^{(0)}+\sum _{k=1}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}+\sum _{k=1}^{n}{\binom {n}{k-1}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}+{\binom {n}{n}}f^{(0)}g^{(n+1)}\\&={\binom {n+1}{0}}f^{(n+1)}g^{(0)}+\left(\sum _{k=1}^{n}\left[{\binom {n}{k-1}}+{\binom {n}{k}}\right]f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}\right)+{\binom {n+1}{n+1}}f^{(0)}g^{(n+1)}\\&={\binom {n+1}{0}}f^{(n+1)}g^{(0)}+\sum _{k=1}^{n}{\binom {n+1}{k}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}+{\binom {n+1}{n+1}}f^{(0)}g^{(n+1)}\\&=\sum _{k=0}^{n+1}{\binom {n+1}{k}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}.\end{aligned}}} And so the statement holds for n + 1 {\displaystyle n+1} , and the proof is complete.

Relationship to the binomial theorem [ edit ] The Leibniz rule bears a strong resemblance to the binomial theorem , and in fact the binomial theorem can be proven directly from the Leibniz rule by taking f ( x ) = e a x {\displaystyle f(x)=e^{ax}} and g ( x ) = e b x , {\displaystyle g(x)=e^{bx},} which gives ( a + b ) n e ( a + b ) x = e ( a + b ) x ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( n k ) a n − − k b k , {\displaystyle (a+b)^{n}e^{(a+b)x}=e^{(a+b)x}\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}a^{n-k}b^{k},} and then dividing both sides by e ( a + b ) x .

{\displaystyle e^{(a+b)x}.} [ 2 ] : 69 Multivariable calculus [ edit ] With the multi-index notation for partial derivatives of functions of several variables, the Leibniz rule states more generally: ∂ ∂ α α ( f g ) = ∑ ∑ β β : β β ≤ ≤ α α ( α α β β ) ( ∂ ∂ β β f ) ( ∂ ∂ α α − − β β g ) .

{\displaystyle \partial ^{\alpha }(fg)=\sum _{\beta \,:\,\beta \leq \alpha }{\alpha  \choose \beta }(\partial ^{\beta }f)(\partial ^{\alpha -\beta }g).} This formula can be used to derive a formula that computes the symbol of the composition of differential operators. In fact, let P and Q be differential operators (with coefficients that are differentiable sufficiently many times) and R = P ∘ ∘ Q .

{\displaystyle R=P\circ Q.} Since R is also a differential operator, the symbol of R is given by: R ( x , ξ ξ ) = e − − ⟨ ⟨ x , ξ ξ ⟩ ⟩ R ( e ⟨ ⟨ x , ξ ξ ⟩ ⟩ ) .

{\displaystyle R(x,\xi )=e^{-{\langle x,\xi \rangle }}R(e^{\langle x,\xi \rangle }).} A direct computation now gives: R ( x , ξ ξ ) = ∑ ∑ α α 1 α α !

( ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ξ ξ ) α α P ( x , ξ ξ ) ( ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x ) α α Q ( x , ξ ξ ) .

{\displaystyle R(x,\xi )=\sum _{\alpha }{1 \over \alpha !}\left({\partial  \over \partial \xi }\right)^{\alpha }P(x,\xi )\left({\partial  \over \partial x}\right)^{\alpha }Q(x,\xi ).} This formula is usually known as the Leibniz formula. It is used to define the composition in the space of symbols, thereby inducing the ring structure.
