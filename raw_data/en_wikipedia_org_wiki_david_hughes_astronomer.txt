Hughes (7 November 1941 – 6 June 2022) [ 1 ] was a British astronomer who was professor of astronomy at the University of Sheffield , where he worked from 1965 to 2007.

[ 2 ] Hughes published over 200 research papers on asteroids , comets , meteorites and meteoroids . He wrote on the history of astronomy, the origin of the Solar System and the impact threat to planet Earth.

[ 3 ] Early life [ edit ] Hughes was born in East Retford , Nottinghamshire , and educated at Mundella School (now Nottingham Emmanuel School), Birmingham University (1959–1962), where he gained a degree in physics, [ 4 ] and Oxford University (1962–1965, New College and the University Observatory), where he was awarded a D.Phil.

in solar astrophysics.

Professional career [ edit ] Hughes became an assistant lecturer at Sheffield after leaving Oxford.

[ 4 ] Beyond his research, his teaching specialised in the history of astronomy, solar and planetary studies and geophysics. He was one of a small group of staff who established astronomy as a separate degree subject within Sheffield University's Physics department (now Physics and Astronomy). He progressed to a chair (professorship) and was given an emeritus chair on retirement.

Public outreach [ edit ] Hughes often appeared on TV, most notably with the live coverage of the ESA Giotto space mission to Halley's Comet . He also appeared on Christmas day TV, between the Queen's address and a Queen concert , discussing his interpretation of the biblical Christmas story. This was based on his book The Star of Bethlehem : an astronomer's confirmation , Walker, Pocket, Dent, Corgi, 1979.
