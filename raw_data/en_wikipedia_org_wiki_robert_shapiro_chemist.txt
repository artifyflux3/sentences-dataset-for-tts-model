Woodward Not to be confused with chemist Robert H. Shapiro who discovered the Shapiro reaction .

Robert Shapiro (28 November 1935 – 15 June 2011 [ 1 ] ) was professor emeritus of chemistry at New York University . He is best known for his work on the origin of life , having written two books on the topic: Origins, a Skeptic’s Guide to the Creation of Life on Earth (1986) and Planetary Dreams (1999). He opposed the RNA world hypothesis , and held that the spontaneous emergence of a molecule as complicated as RNA is highly unlikely. Instead, he proposed that life arose from some self-sustaining and compartmentalized reaction of simple molecules: "metabolism first" instead of "RNA first". This reaction would have to be able to reproduce and evolve, eventually leading to RNA. He claimed that in this view life is a normal consequence of the laws of nature and potentially quite common in the universe.
