' National Academy of the Sciences ' ), or more formally L'Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze detta dei XL , and also called the Accademia dei XL ( lit.

' Academy of the Forty ' ), is Italy 's national academy of science. Its offices are located within the Villino Rosso, at the corner of via L. Spallanzani and via Siracusa, Villa Torlonia , Rome .

The academy promotes progress in mathematics , physics , and natural sciences ; organizes meetings; publishes journals; establishes consultative committees for governmental agencies; and awards scientific prizes.

The academy contains 40 fellows and a variable number of "fellows in excess" who are age 70 and above, and who have been fellows for at least five years. It also contains 25 foreign members.

History [ edit ] The academy was founded in 1782 in Verona as the Società Italiana , comprising 40 scientists from various parts of Italy. The idea of forming an academy comprising the leading Italian scientists was put forward in 1766 by the mathematician Antonio Maria Lorgna . By 1781 he had received the support of Alessandro Volta , Lazzaro Spallanzani , Ruggero Giuseppe Boscovich and others. In the following year the academy was created as the Società Italiana , with forty members representing the most important Italian scientists of the period.
