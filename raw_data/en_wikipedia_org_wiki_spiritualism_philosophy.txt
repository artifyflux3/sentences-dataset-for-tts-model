This article is about the philosophical position. For other uses of spiritualism, see Spiritualism (disambiguation) .

In philosophy , spiritualism [ a ] is the concept, shared by a wide variety of systems of thought, that there is an immaterial reality that cannot be perceived by the senses.

[ 3 ] This includes philosophies that postulate a personal God , the immortality of the soul , or the immortality of the intellect or will, as well as any systems of thought that assume a universal mind or cosmic forces lying beyond the reach of purely materialistic interpretations.

[ 3 ] Generally, any philosophical position, be it dualism , monism , atheism , theism , pantheism , idealism or any other, is compatible with spiritualism as long as it allows for a reality beyond matter.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Theism is an example of a dualist spiritualist philosophy, while pantheism is an example of monist spiritualism.

A particular form of spiritualism, frequently called neo-spiritualism, is that formulated by the French philosopher Jules Lachelier (CE 1834-1918), who was the teacher of the French philosophers Emile Boutroux (CE 1845-1921) and Henri Bergson (CE 1859-1941), both of whom are often also considered to exemplify neo-spiritualism. Lachelier advocated a form of spiritual realism whereby the spirit and spontaneity of humans provided an alternative to both idealism and materialism.
