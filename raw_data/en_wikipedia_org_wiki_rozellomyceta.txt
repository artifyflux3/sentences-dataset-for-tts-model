Bahram, M. Döring, Schigel, T.W. May, M. Ryberg & Abarenkov Synonyms Opishophagea Galindo et al. 2023 Rozellomyceta is a subkingdom in the kingdom Fungi . In the consensus accepted by fungus researchers as of 2024, it contains only the Rozellomycota , which in turn contains Microsporidia as a class.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] An earlier view by fungus researchers divides it into two phyla, the Rozellomycota and Microsporidia as a phylum.

[ 3 ] A more fitting name for Microsporidia as a phylum could be Microsporidiomycota Benny 2007 . This is no longer done because "recent phylogenies indicate that Microsporidia are deeply nested within Rozellomycota".

[ 2 ] Protistologists do not agree with the assignment of this subkingdom as fungi, because they subscribe to a narrow view of fungi as an osmotropic-only lineage (the eumycota ), while this clade is largely phagotrophic. They believe that this clade should be the responsibility of protozoologists.

[ 1 ] Under older protist classification, the included taxa are sometimes classified under the subkingdom Sarcomastigota within the kingdom Protozoa instead, [ 4 ] although Sarcomastigota is considered paraphyletic .

[ 5 ] Under another style of protist classification, this group belongs in Opisthosporidia . This too is paraphyletic.

[ 6 ] Protists that have accepted the current phylogeny proposes the name Opishophagea for what they call "Rosalida + Microsporidia".
