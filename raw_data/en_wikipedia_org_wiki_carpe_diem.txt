A [sundial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial "Sundial") inscribed _carpe diem_

**_Carpe diem_** () is a [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin")[aphorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism "Aphorism"), usually translated "seize the day", taken from book 1 of the Roman poet [Horace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace "Horace")'s work _[Odes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odes\_(Horace) "Odes (Horace)")_ (23 BC).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem#cite_note-1)

_Carpe_ is the [second-person singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person "Grammatical person")[present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_tense "Present tense")[active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_voice "Active voice")[imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood "Imperative mood") of _[carpō](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/carpo#Latin "wikt:carpo")_ "pick or pluck" used by [Horace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace "Horace") to mean "enjoy, seize, use, make use of".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem#cite_note-2)_Diem_ is the accusative of _[dies](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dies#Latin "wikt:dies")_ "day". A more literal translation of _carpe diem_ would thus be "pluck the day [as it is ripe]"—that is, enjoy the moment. It has been argued by various authors that this interpretation is closer to Horace's original meaning.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem#cite_note-3) Latin scholar and [Saint Joseph's University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph%27s_University "Saint Joseph's University") professor, Maria S. Marsilio points out, _carpe diem_ is a [horticultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticultural "Horticultural") metaphor that, particularly seen in the context of the poem, is more accurately translated as "plucking the day", evoking the plucking and gathering of ripening fruits or flowers, enjoying a moment that is rooted in the sensory experience of nature.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem#cite_note-4)

Text from _[Odes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odes\_(Horace) "Odes (Horace)")_[1.11](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/la:Carmina_(Horatius)/Liber_I/Carmen_XI "s:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber I/Carmen XI"):

Tu ne quaesieris, scire nefas, quem mihi, quem tibi

 finem di dederint, Leuconoe, nec Babylonios

 temptaris numeros. ut melius, quidquid erit, pati.

 seu pluris hiemes seu tribuit Iuppiter ultimam,

 quae nunc oppositis debilitat pumicibus mare

 Tyrrhenum. Sapias, vina liques et spatio brevi

 spem longam reseces. dum loquimur, fugerit invida

 aetas: **carpe diem**, quam minimum credula postero.Ask not ('tis forbidden knowledge), what our destined term of years,

 Mine and yours; nor scan the tables of your [Babylonish seers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astrology "Babylonian astrology").

 Better far to bear the future, my Leuconoe, like the past,

 Whether [Jove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jove "Jove") has many winters yet to give, or this our last;

 This, that makes the [Tyrrhene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrhenian_Sea "Tyrrhenian Sea")[billows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_wave "Wind wave") spend their strength against the shore.

 Strain your wine and prove your wisdom; life is short; should hope be more?

 In the moment of our talking, envious time has ebb'd away.

**Seize the present**; trust tomorrow e'en as little as you may.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem#cite_note-5)

### In ancient literature

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carpe_diem&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: In ancient literature")]

Perhaps the first written expression of the concept is the advice given by [Siduri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siduri "Siduri") to [Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh "Gilgamesh") in [Mesopotamian mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamian_mythology "Mesopotamian mythology"), telling him to forgo his mourning and embrace life, although some scholars see it as simply urging Gilgamesh to abandon his mourning, "reversing the liminal rituals of mourning and returning to the normal and normative behaviors of Mesopotamian society."[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem#cite_note-7)

In [Horace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace "Horace"), the phrase is part of the longer _carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero_, which is often translated as "Seize the day, put very little trust in tomorrow (the future)". The ode says that the future is unforeseen and that one should not leave to chance future happenings, but rather one should do all one can today to make one's own future better. This phrase is usually understood against Horace's [Epicurean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurean "Epicurean") background.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem#cite_note-8)

[_Gather Ye Rosebuds While Ye May_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gather_Ye_Rosebuds_While_Ye_May_(Waterhouse_painting_1909) "Gather Ye Rosebuds While Ye May (Waterhouse painting 1909)"), by [John William Waterhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Waterhouse "John William Waterhouse")

_Collige, virgo, rosas_ ("gather, girl, the roses") appears at the end of the poem "De rosis nascentibus"[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem#cite_note-9) ("Of growing roses", also called _Idyllium de rosis_) attributed to [Ausonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausonius "Ausonius") or [Virgil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil "Virgil"). It encourages youth to enjoy life before it is too late; compare "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may" from [Robert Herrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Herrick_(poet) "Robert Herrick (poet)")'s 1648 poem "[To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Virgins,_to_Make_Much_of_Time "To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time")".

"De Brevitate Vitae" ("On the Shortness of Life"), often referred to as "[Gaudeamus igitur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaudeamus_igitur "Gaudeamus igitur")", (Let us rejoice) is a popular academic [commercium song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercium_song "Commercium song"), on taking joy in student life, with the knowledge that one will someday die. It is [medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval "Medieval") Latin, dating to 1287.

Related but distinct is the expression _[memento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento\_mori "Memento mori")_ (remember that you are mortal) which carries some of the same connotation as _carpe diem_. For Horace, mindfulness of our own mortality is key in making us realize the importance of the moment. "Remember that you are mortal, so seize the day." Over time the phrase _memento mori_ also came to be associated with penitence, as suggested in many _[vanitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanitas "Vanitas")_ paintings. Today many people will take the two phrases as representing almost opposite approaches, with _carpe diem_ urging us to savour life and _memento mori_ urging us to resist its allure. This is not the original sense of the _memento mori_ phrase as used by Horace.

The song "[Carpe Diem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_Diem_(Joker_Out_song) "Carpe Diem (Joker Out song)")" by [Joker Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_Out "Joker Out") was used to represent [Slovenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest_2023 "Slovenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem#cite_note-20)
