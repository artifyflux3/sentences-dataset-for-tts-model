The original definition of an Am star was one in which the star shows "an apparent surface underabundance of Ca (and/or Sc ) and/or an apparent overabundance of the Fe group and heavier elements".

[ 1 ] The unusual relative abundances cause the spectral type assessed from the Calcium K lines to be systematically earlier than one assessed from other metallic lines.  Typically, a spectral type judged solely from hydrogen lines is intermediate.  This leads to two or three spectral types being given.  For example, Sirius has been given a spectral type of kA0hA0VmA1, indicating that it is A0 when judged by the Calcium k line, A0V when judged by its hydrogen lines, and A1 when judged by the lines of heavy metals.

[ 2 ] There are other formats, such as A0mA1Va, again for Sirius.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The chemical abnormalities are due to some elements which absorb more light being pushed towards the surface, while others sink under the force of gravity .  This effect takes place only if the star has low rotational velocity.

[ 5 ] Normally, A-type stars rotate quickly. Most Am stars form part of a binary system in which the rotation of the stars has been slowed by tidal braking .

[ 5 ] The best-known metallic-line star is Sirius (α Canis Majoris). The following table lists some metallic-line stars in order of descending apparent visual magnitude .

List [ edit ] Name [ 6 ] Bayer or other designation Apparent visual magnitude [ 6 ] Sirius A α Canis Majoris A −1.47 Castor Ba α Geminorum Ba 2.96 α Volantis 4.00 Acubens A [ 7 ] α Cancri A 4.26 Kurhah [ 8 ] ξ Cephei 4.29 θ 1 Crucis 4.30 π Virginis [ 9 ] 4.64 μ Aurigae 4.88 2 Ursae Majoris 5.46 τ 3 Gruis 5.72 WW Aurigae [ 10 ] 5.82 IK Pegasi 6.08 δ Delphini and ρ Puppis [ edit ] A small number of Am stars show unusually late spectral types and particularly strong luminosity effects.  Although Am stars in general show abnormal luminosity effects, stars such as ρ Puppis are believed to be more evolved and more luminous than most Am stars, lying above the main sequence .  Am stars and δ Scuti variables lie in approximately the same location on the H–R diagram , but it is rare for a star to be both an Am star and a δ Scuti variable.  ρ Puppis is one example and δ Delphini is another.

[ 2 ] Several authors have referred to a class of stars known as δ Delphini stars, Am stars but with relatively little difference between the calcium and other metallic lines. They have also been compared to the δ Scuti stars.  Later studies showed that the group was somewhat inhomogeneous, possibly coincidental, and recommended dropping use of the δ Delphini class in favour of a narrower class of ρ Puppis stars with relatively high luminosity and late spectral types.

[ 2 ] [ 11 ] However, there is still sometimes confusion, for example with ρ Puppis stars being considered to all be δ Scuti variables.
