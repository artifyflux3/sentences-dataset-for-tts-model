Thailand [ i ] is a country in Southeast Asia , located on the Indochinese Peninsula . It is officially known as the Kingdom of Thailand [ ii ] and historically Siam until 1939.

[ iii ] With a population of almost 66 million, it spans 513,115 square kilometres (198,115 sq mi). Thailand is bordered to the northwest by Myanmar , to the northeast and east by Laos , to the southeast by Cambodia , to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia , and to the southwest by the Andaman Sea ; it also shares maritime borders with Vietnam to the southeast and Indonesia and India to the southwest.

Bangkok is the state capital and largest city .

Thai peoples migrated from Southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 6th to 11th centuries.

Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon , Khmer Empire , and Malay states ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang , Sukhothai , Lan Na , and Ayutthaya , which also rivalled each other. European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, which became a regional power by the end of the 15th century. Ayutthaya reached its peak during the 18th century, until it was destroyed in the Burmese–Siamese War .

King Taksin the Great quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom (1767–1782), of which he was the only king. He was succeeded in 1782 by Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I), the first monarch of the current Chakri dynasty . Throughout the era of Western imperialism in Asia , Siam remained the only state in the region to avoid colonisation by foreign powers, although it was often forced to make territorial , trade, and legal concessions in unequal treaties.

[ 11 ] The Siamese system of government was centralised and transformed into a modern unitary absolute monarchy during the 1868–1910 reign of Chulalongkorn (Rama V). 
In World War I , Siam sided with the Allies , a political decision made in order to amend the unequal treaties. Following a bloodless revolution in 1932, it became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to Thailand, becoming an ally of Japan in World War II . In the late 1950s, a military coup under Sarit Thanarat revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. During the Cold War , Thailand became a major non-NATO ally of the United States and played an anti-communist role in the region as a member of SEATO , which was disbanded in 1977.

Apart from a brief period of parliamentary democracy in the mid-1970s and 1990s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule . Since the 2000s, the country has been in continual political conflict between supporters and opponents of twice-elected Prime Minister of Thailand Thaksin Shinawatra , which resulted in two coups (in 2006 and 2014 ), along with the establishment of its current constitution , a nominally democratic government after the 2019 Thai general election , and large pro-democracy protests in 2020–2021 , which included unprecedented demands to reform the monarchy. Since 2019, it has been nominally a parliamentary constitutional monarchy ; in practice, however, structural advantages in the constitution have ensured the military's continued influence in politics.

[ 12 ] Thailand is a middle power in global affairs and a founding member of ASEAN . It has the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia and the 23rd-largest in the world by PPP , and it ranks 29th by nominal GDP . Thailand is classified as a newly industrialised economy , with manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism as leading sectors.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Etymology Thailand [ i ] was known by outsiders before 1939 as Siam .

[ iii ] According to George Cœdès , the word Thai ( ไทย ) means 'free man' in the Thai language, "differentiating the Thai from the natives encompassed in Thai society as serfs".

[ 15 ] : 197 According to Chit Phumisak , Thai ( ไท ) simply means 'people' or 'human being'; his investigation shows that some rural areas used the word "Thai" instead of the usual Thai word khon ( คน ) for people.

[ 16 ] According to Michel Ferlus , the ethnonyms Thai-Tai (or Thay-Tay) would have evolved from the etymon *k(ə)ri: 'human being'.

[ iv ] [ 18 ] Thais often refer to their country using the polite form prathet Thai ( Thai : ประเทศไทย ). They also use the more colloquial term mueang Thai ( Thai : เมืองไทย ) or simply Thai; the word mueang , archaically referring to a city-state , is commonly used to refer to a city or town as the centre of a region.

Ratcha Anachak Thai ( Thai : ราชอาณาจักรไทย ) means 'kingdom of Thailand' or 'kingdom of Thai'.

Etymologically, its components are: ratcha ( Sanskrit : राजन् , rājan , 'king, royal, realm'), ana- ( Pali āṇā 'authority, command, power', itself from the Sanskrit आज्ञा , ājñā , of the same meaning), and -chak (from Sanskrit चक्र cakra- 'wheel', a symbol of power and rule).

The Thai National Anthem ( Thai : เพลงชาติ ), written by Luang Saranupraphan during the patriotic 1930s, refers to the Thai nation as prathet Thai ( Thai : ประเทศไทย ). The first line of the national anthem is: prathet thai ruam lueat nuea chat chuea thai ( Thai : ประเทศไทยรวมเลือดเนื้อชาติเชื้อไทย ), 'Thailand is founded on blood and flesh'.

[ 19 ] The former name Siam may have originated from Sanskrit श्याम ( śyāma , 'dark') [ 16 ] or Mon ရာမည ( rhmañña , 'stranger'), probably the same root as Shan and Assam .

[ 20 ] The word Śyâma is possibly not the true origin, but a pre-designed deviation from its proper, original meaning.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Another theory is the name derives from the Chinese calling this region 'Xian'.

[ v ] [ 23 ] : 8 The ancient Khmers used the word Siam to refer to people settled in the west Chao Phraya River valley surrounding the ancient city of Nakhon Pathom in the present-day central Thailand ; it may probably originate from the name of Lord Krishna , which also called Shyam , as in the Wat Sri Chum Inscription , dated 13th century CE, mentions Phra Maha Thera Sri Sattha [ th ] came to restore Phra Pathommachedi at the city of Lord Krishna (Nakhon Pathom) in the early era of the Sukhothai Kingdom .

[ 24 ] SPPM Mongkut Rex Siamensium , King Mongkut 's signature The signature of King Mongkut (r. 1851–1868) reads SPPM ( Somdet Phra Poramenthra Maha ) Mongkut Rex Siamensium (Mongkut, King of the Siamese). This usage of the name in the country's first international treaty gave the name Siam official status, until 24 June 1939 when it was changed to Thailand .

( February 2024 ) Prehistory and origins Main article: Prehistoric Thailand See also: History of Thailand and Tai peoples There is evidence of continuous human habitation in present-day Thailand from 20,000 years ago to the present day.

[ 26 ] : 4 The earliest evidence of rice growing is dated at 2,000 BCE.

[ 27 ] : 4 Areas comprising what is now Thailand participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research. The trading network existed for 3,000 years, between 2000 BCE to 1000 CE.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Bronze appeared c.

1,250 –1,000 BCE.

[ 27 ] : 4 The site of Ban Chiang in northeast Thailand currently ranks as the earliest known centre of copper and bronze production in Southeast Asia.

[ 32 ] Iron appeared around 500 BCE.

[ 27 ] : 5 The Kingdom of Funan was the first and most powerful Southeast Asian kingdom at the time (2nd century BCE).

[ 26 ] : 5 The Mon people established the principalities of Dvaravati and Kingdom of Hariphunchai in the 6th century. The Khmer people established the Khmer empire , centred in Angkor , in the 9th century.

[ 26 ] : 7 Tambralinga , a Malay state controlling trade through the Malacca Strait , rose in the 10th century.

[ 26 ] : 5 The Indochina peninsula was heavily influenced by the culture and religions of India from the time of the Kingdom of Funan to that of the Khmer Empire.

[ 33 ] The Thai people are of the Tai ethnic group , characterised by common linguistic roots.

[ 34 ] : 2 Chinese chronicles first mention the Tai peoples in the 6th century BCE. While there are many assumptions regarding the origin of Tai peoples, David K. Wyatt , a historian of Thailand, argued that their ancestors who at present inhabit Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and China came from the Điện Biên Phủ area between the 5th and the 8th century.

[ 34 ] : 6 Thai people began migrating into present-day Thailand gradually from the 6th to 11th century, which Mon and Khmer people occupied at the time.

[ 35 ] Thus Thai culture was influenced by Indian, Mon, and Khmer cultures.

[ 36 ] : 203 Tai people intermixed with various ethnic and cultural groups in the region, resulting in many groups of present-day Thai people.

[ vi ] Genetic evidences suggested that ethnolinguistics could not accurately predict the origins of the Thais.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Sujit Wongthes argued that Thai is not a race or ethnicity but a culture group.

[ 40 ] According to French historian George Cœdès , "The Thai first enter history of Farther India in the eleventh century with the mention of Syam slaves or prisoners of war in Champa epigraphy", and "in the twelfth century, the bas-reliefs of Angkor Wat " where "a group of warriors" are described as Syam , [ 15 ] : 190–191, 194–195 though Cham accounts do not indicate the origins of Syam or what ethnic group they belonged to.

[ 41 ] The origins and ethnicity of the Syam remain unclear, with some literature suggesting that Syam refers to the Shan people , the Bru people , or the Brau people .

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] However, mainland Southeast Asian sources from before the fourteenth century primarily used the word Syam as an ethnonym , referring to those who belonged to a separate cultural category different from the Khmer, Cham, Bagan, or Mon. This contrasts with the Chinese sources, where Xian was used as a toponym .

[ 41 ] Early Tai confederate cities: (691 BCE – 13th century CE) See also: Initial states of Thailand and Lan Na Map showing geographic distribution of Kra–Dai linguistic family . Arrows represent general pattern of the migration of Tai-speaking tribes along the rivers and over the lower passes.

[ 27 ] : 27 Lan Na kingdom during the reign of Tilokaraj ( r.

1441–1487) Theoretically, Tai-Kadai -speaking people formed as early as the 12th century BCE in the middle of the Yangtze basin . Some groups later migrated south to Guangxi .

[ 43 ] However, after several bloody centuries against Chinese influence in Guangxi between 333 BCE and the 11th century, hundreds of thousands of Tais were killed, [ 44 ] : 5 [ 45 ] : 193, 239–249 thus, Tai people began to move southwestward along the rivers and over the lower passes into the mountain north of Southeast Asia and river valleys in present-day Assam of India .

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] Some evidence indicates that the ancestors of Tai people migrated en masse southwestwards out of Yunnan only after the 1253 Mongol invasion of Dali ; however, it is not generally accepted.

[ 48 ] : 38 Tais defeated indigenous tribes and emerged as the new power in the new region. As a result, several Tai city-states were established, scattered from Điện Biên Phủ in present-day northwestern Vietnam and highland Southeast Asia to northeastern India .

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] According to the Simhanavati legend given in several chronicles, the first Tai city-state in northern Thailand, Singhanavati , was founded around the 7th century.

[ 52 ] : 5, 9 However, several modern geology and archaeology studies found that its centre, Yonok Nahaphan, dates from 691 BCE–545 CE; [ 52 ] : 7 [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] this roughly coincides with the establishment of Shan States , another Tai's federated principalities in the present-day northeast Myanmar .

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] as well as Muang Sua ( Luang Prabang ) in the east.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] After Singhanavati was submerged below Chiang Saen Lake due to an earthquake in 545, [ 53 ] [ 55 ] [ 62 ] the survivors then founded a new seat at Wieng–Prueksha [ th ] . The kingdom lasted for another 93 years.

[ 63 ] In addition to Singhanavati , another northern principality probably related to the Tai people, Ngoenyang , was established as the successor of Singhanavati in 638 by Lavachakkaraj [ th ] , also centred in Wieng–Prueksha [ th ] (present-day Mae Sai District , Chiang Rai ).

[ 23 ] : 8 Its seat was moved to Chiang Mai in 1262 by King Mangrai , which considered the foundation of the Lan Na kingdom. Mangrai unified the surrounding area and also created a network of states through political alliances to the east and north of the Mekong . His dynasty would rule the kingdom continuously for the next two centuries.

[ 23 ] : 8 Lan Na expanded its territory southward and annexed the Mon Hariphunchai of Dvaravati in 1292.

[ 64 ] : 208 In the late tenth century, Tai people began to migrate further south to the present-day upper central Thailand .

[ 65 ] : 46–9, 83–6 Around the 1100s period, several cities in this area, such as Songkwae, Sawankhalok, and Chakangrao, were ruled by the Tai people, and they eventually launched several battles against the pre-existing Mon of Lavo , who had been falling under Chenla and Khmer influences since the 7th century, thus bringing the establishment of the Tai people's independent state, Sukhothai Kingdom , in the upper Chao Phraya River valley in 1238.

[ 34 ] : 52–3 The earliest conflict between Tai people and the preexisting ethnics was recorded in the mid-4th century when the ruler of Singhanavati , Pangkharat [ th ] , forcibly lost the seat at Yonok to King Khom from Umongasela (present-day Fang ). He then fled to Vieng Si Tuang ( เวียงศรีทวง ; present-day Wiang Phang Kham, Mae Sai district ) but had to send tributes to Yonok annually until his son, Phrom , took back Yonok and expelled King Khom from Umongasela.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] Phrom also marched the troops south to occupy Chakangrao from the enemy as well as founding the city of Songkwae .

[ 66 ] Some historians suggest that Lavo 's capital, Lopburi , was once seized by Phrom .

[ 66 ] In contrast, Tai people instead established relationships with Siamese Mon via royal intermarriages .

[ 65 ] : 46–9, 83–6 Mon and Lavo Kingdoms: (5th century CE – 13th century CE) See also: Mon people , Thai people , Mon kingdoms , and Lavo Kingdom Political entities of the Mon people around the 6th–7th centuries Map of settlements of Dvaravati culture from the 6th to 9th centuries As is generally known, the present-day Thai people were previously called Siamese before the country was renamed Thailand in the mid-20th century.

[ 16 ] Several genetic studies published in the 21st century suggest that the so-called Siamese people (central Thai) might have had Mon origins since their genetic profiles are more closely related to the Mon people in Myanmar than the Tais of southern China , [ 37 ] and they probably later became Tais via cultural diffusion after the arriving of Tai people from the north around the 8th–10th centuries.

[ 51 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] This is also reflected in the language since over half of the vocabulary in the central Thai language is derived from or borrowed from the Mon language , as well as Pali and Sanskrit .

[ 69 ] [ 71 ] Moreover, the Jinakalamali chronicle of Tai's Lan Na also called the southern region occupied by the Mon Haripuñjaya of Dvaravati as Shyam Pradesh ( lit.

' the land of Siam people ' ), which indicates that the ancient Siamese and the Mon people in central Thailand were probably the same ethnolinguistic group.

[ 72 ] The earliest evidence to mention the Siam people are stone inscriptions found in Angkor Borei of Funan (K.557 and K.600), dated 661 CE, the slave's name is mentioned as "Ku Sayam" meaning "Sayam female slaves" (Ku is a prefix used to refer to female slaves in the pre-Angkorian era), and the Takéo inscriptions (K.79) written in 682 during the reign of Bhavavarman II of Chenla also mention Siam Nobel: Sāraṇnoya Poña Sayam , which was transcribed into English as: the rice field that was given to the poña (noble rank) who was called Sayam (Siam) .

[ 73 ] The Song Huiyao Jigao (960–1279) indicate Siamese people settled in the west central Thailand and their state was called Xiān guó ( Chinese : 暹國 ), while the eastern plain belonged to the Mon of Lavo ( Chinese : 羅渦國 ), [ 74 ] who later fell under the Chenla and Khmer hegemony around the 7th–9th centuries.

[ 75 ] Those Mon political entities, which also included Haripuñjaya in the north and several city-states in the northeast , are collectively called Dvaravati .

However, the states of Siamese Mon and Lavo were later merged via the royal intermarriage and became Ayutthaya Kingdom in the mid-14th century, [ 74 ] while the southwestern Isan principalities, centred in Phanom Rung and Phimai , later pledged allegiance to Siamese's Ayutthaya during the reign of Borommarachathirat II ( r.

1424–1448).

[ 76 ] The remaining principal city-states in Isan region became Lan Xang around 1353 after the twin cities of Muang Sua ( Luang Prabang ) and Vieng Chan Vieng Kham ( Vientiane ) became independent following the death of the Sukhothai king Ram Khamhaeng .

[ 77 ] : 51 According to the Wat Kud Tae inscription (K.1105), dated c. 7th century, during the period that the eastern Mon entity, Lavo , was strongly influenced by the Chenla , the Siamese Mon in the west also established a royal intermarriage with Chenla as Sri Chakatham, prince of Sambhuka (ศามภูกะ, in the present-day Ratchaburi province ), married to a princess of Isanavarman I , and two mandalas then became an ally.

[ 78 ] After Chenla sieged Funan and moved the centre to Angkor , both Siamese Mon and the Angkorian eventually marched the troops to attack Vijaya of Champa in 1201 during the reign of Jayavarman VII , as recorded in the Cho-Dinh inscription (C.3).

[ 79 ] Sukhothai Kingdom (1238 CE – 14th century CE) Main article: Sukhothai Kingdom Sukhothai Kingdom Sukhothai and neighbours, end of 13th century CE Phra Achana, Wat Si Chum, Sukhothai Historical Park The ruins of Wat Mahathat, Sukhothai Historical Park After the decline of the Khmer Empire and Kingdom of Pagan in the early 13th century, various states thrived in their place. The domains of Tai people existed from the northeast of present-day India to the north of present-day Laos and to the Malay Peninsula .

[ 34 ] : 38–9 During the 13th century, Tai people had already settled in the core land of Dvaravati and Lavo Kingdom to Nakhon Si Thammarat in the south. There are, however, no records detailing the arrival of the Tais.

[ 34 ] : 50–1 Around 1240, Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao , a local Tai ruler, rallied the people to rebel against the Khmer. He later crowned himself the first king of Sukhothai Kingdom in 1238.

[ 34 ] : 52–3 Mainstream Thai historians count Sukhothai as the first kingdom of Thai people. Sukhothai expanded furthest during the reign of Ram Khamhaeng ( r.

1279–1298 ). However, it was mostly a network of local lords who swore fealty to Sukhothai, not directly controlled by it.

[ 34 ] : 55–56 He is believed have invented Thai script and Thai ceramics were an important export in his era. Sukhothai embraced Theravada Buddhism in the reign of Maha Thammaracha I (1347–1368).

1665 , by Johannes Vingboons According to the most widely accepted version of its origin, the Ayutthaya Kingdom rose from the earlier, nearby Lavo Kingdom and Suvarnabhumi with Uthong as its first king. Ayutthaya was a patchwork of self-governing principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the King of Ayutthaya under the mandala system .

[ 80 ] : 355 Its initial expansion was through conquest and political marriage.

Before the end of the 15th century, Ayutthaya invaded the Khmer Empire three times and sacked its capital Angkor .

[ 81 ] : 26 Ayutthaya then became a regional power in place of the Khmer. Constant interference of Sukhothai effectively made it a vassal state of Ayutthaya and it was finally incorporated into the kingdom.

Borommatrailokkanat brought about bureaucratic reforms which lasted into the 20th century and created a system of social hierarchy called sakdina , where male commoners were conscripted as corvée labourers for six months a year.

[ 83 ] The Portuguese were followed in the 17th century by the French, Dutch, and English. Rivalry for supremacy over Chiang Mai and the Mon people pitted Ayutthaya against the Burmese Kingdom. Several wars with its ruling Taungoo dynasty starting in the 1540s in the reign of Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung were ultimately ended with the capture of the capital in 1570 .

[ 82 ] : 146–7 Then a brief period of vassalage to Burma until Naresuan proclaimed independence in 1584 followed.

[ 23 ] : 11 Ayutthaya sought to improve relations with European powers for many successive reigns. The kingdom especially prospered during cosmopolitan Narai 's reign (1656–1688), when some European travellers regarded Ayutthaya as an Asian great power, alongside China and India.

[ 27 ] : ix However, growing French influence later in his reign was met with nationalist sentiment and eventually led to the Siamese revolution of 1688 .

[ 82 ] : 185–6 Despite the revolution, overall relations remained stable, with French missionaries still actively preaching Christianity.

[ 82 ] : 186 After a bloody period of dynastic struggle, Ayutthaya entered what has been called the Siamese " golden age ", a relatively peaceful episode in the second quarter of the 18th century where art , literature , and learning flourished. There were seldom foreign wars, apart from conflict with the Nguyễn lords for control of Cambodia starting around 1715. The last fifty years of the kingdom witnessed bloody succession crises, where there were purges of court officials and able generals for many consecutive reigns. In 1765, a combined 40,000-strong force of Burmese armies invaded it from the north and west.

[ 84 ] : 250 The Burmese under the new Alaungpaya dynasty quickly rose to become a new local power by 1759. After a 14-month siege, the capital city's walls fell and the city was burned in April 1767.

[ 85 ] : 218 Thonburi Kingdom (1767–1782) Main article: Thonburi Kingdom Taksin the Great enthroned himself as a Thai king in 1767.

The capital and many of its territories lay in chaos after the war. The former capital was occupied by the Burmese garrison army and five local leaders declared themselves overlords, including the lords of Sakwangburi, Phitsanulok , Pimai , Chanthaburi , and Nakhon Si Thammarat .

Chao Tak , a capable military leader, proceeded to make himself a lord by right of conquest , beginning with the legendary sack of Chanthaburi . Based at Chanthaburi, Chao Tak raised troops and resources, and sent a fleet up the Chao Phraya to take the fort of Thonburi . In the same year, Chao Tak was able to retake Ayutthaya from the Burmese only seven months after the fall of the city.

[ 86 ] Chao Tak then crowned himself as Taksin and proclaimed Thonburi as temporary capital in the same year. He also quickly subdued the other warlords. His forces engaged in wars with Burma, Laos, and Cambodia, which successfully drove the Burmese out of Lan Na in 1775, [ 82 ] : 225 captured Vientiane in 1778 [ 82 ] : 227–8 and tried to install a pro-Thai king in Cambodia in the 1770s. In his final years there was a coup, supposedly caused by his "insanity", and eventually Taksin and his sons were executed by his longtime companion General Chao Phraya Chakri (the future Rama I). He was the first king of the ruling Chakri dynasty and founder of the Rattanakosin Kingdom on 6 April 1782.

He also created suzerainty over large portions of Laos and Cambodia.

[ 82 ] : 285–6 Bangkok also waged several wars with Vietnam , where Siam successfully regained hegemony over Cambodia.

[ 82 ] : 290–2 From the late 19th century, Siam tried to rule the ethnic groups in the realm as colonies.

[ 82 ] : 308 In the reign of Mongkut (1851–1868), who recognised the potential threat Western powers posed to Siam, his court contacted the British government directly to defuse tensions.

[ 82 ] : 311 A British mission led by Sir John Bowring , Governor of Hong Kong , led to the signing of the Bowring Treaty , the first of many unequal treaties with Western countries. This, however, brought trade and economic development to Siam.

[ 90 ] The unexpected death of Mongkut from malaria led to the reign of underage King Chulalongkorn , with Somdet Chaophraya Sri Suriwongse (Chuang Bunnag) acting as regent.

[ 82 ] : 327 Chulalongkorn ( r.

[ 82 ] : 404 In 1917, Siam joined the First World War on the side of the Allies .

[ 82 ] : 407 In the aftermath, Siam had a seat at the Paris Peace Conference and gained freedom of taxation and the revocation of extraterritoriality.

[ 82 ] : 408 Military Dictatorship Era (1932–1975) Main articles: Thailand in World War II and History of Thailand (1932–1973) A period of wasteful spending by King Vajiravudh followed by the Great Depression brought economic hardships on Thailand, with sharply falling rice prices, a significant reduction in public spending, eroded confidence in the monarchy, and discontent among aristocratic supporters all contributing to the destabilization of the Chakri dynasty . These conditions spurred on the bloodless Siamese revolution of 1932 , in which the Khana Ratsadon movement forced King Prajadhipok to sign the country's first constitution, thereby ending centuries of feudal and absolute monarchy .

[ 26 ] : 25 Power was partially ceded to a democratic government, but it would not last a year before the rise of significant military influence in Thai political affairs.

In 1933, Prime Minister Phraya Mano led a counter-revolutionary rebellion to reinstate an absolute monarchy under Prajadhipok.

[ 82 ] : 446–8 This was soon followed by a military coup that installed Phraya Phahon - a leader of the 1932 revolution - as Prime Minister. Prajadhipok's conflict with the government eventually led to his abdication, and the new military-led government selected Switzerland -raised Ananda Mahidol to be the new king.

[ 82 ] : 448–9 The armed wing of Khana Ratsadon gradually came to dominate Siamese politics. Military strongman Plaek Phibunsongkhram , often known as "Phibun", became premier in 1938 and launched a campaign of political repression that saw the execution of both Monarchists and pro-democracy Liberals .

[ 82 ] : 457 His government adopted Thai nationalist , pro- Westernisation , anti-royalist, Irredentist , anti-Chinese and anti-French policies.

[ 26 ] : 28 In 1939, Phibun changed the country's name from from "Siam" to "Thailand". This coincided with the rise of fascist ideology in Thailand, with the name change reflecting policies that prioritized the needs of ethnic Thais over those of minorities like the Thai Chinese . Phibun was an admirer of Benito Mussolini , and he imposed twelve Thai cultural mandates requiring citizens to obey nationalist norms such as saluting the flag, knowing the national anthem, speaking only Thai, and wearing Western clothing.

In October 1940, months after fall of France to Nazi Germany , Phibun launched an opportunistic invasion of French Indochinese territories lost to the French Empire during the reign of King Chulalongkorn . The invasion was a success, with Thailand additionally gaining some Lao and Cambodian territories.

[ 82 ] : 462 Japan, which had also been invading French Indochinese territories, brokered a ceasefire that forced France to give up several territories to Thailand.

On 8 December 1941, the Japanese Empire launched an invasion of Thailand , and fierce fighting broke out in Southern Thailand before Phibun ordered an armistice and joined the Axis powers just five hours later. Japan was granted free passage through Thai territory, and on 21 December Thailand and Japan signed a military alliance, with a secret protocol wherein the Japanese government agreed to help Thailand gain further territories throughout southeast Asia.

[ 93 ] The Thai government then declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom.

[ 82 ] : 465 The United Kingdom, whose colony Malaya was under immediate threat from Thai forces, responded in kind, but the United States refused to declare war and ignored Thailand's declaration.

[ 94 ] : 66 The Free Thai Movement was launched both in Thailand and abroad to oppose the Thai government and Japanese occupation.

[ 82 ] : 465–6 After the war ended in 1945, Phibun was ousted and Thailand signed formal agreements to end the state of war with the Allies . In June 1946, King Ananda was found dead under mysterious circumstances, and his younger brother Bhumibol Adulyadej ascended to the throne.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej addresses a joint session of the United States Congress , 1960.

This period of Liberal rule was brief, with Phibun launching another military coup to take power in 1947. In his second term as Prime Minister, Phibun pursued an alliance with the United States by undertaking a campaign of domestic anti-communism , aiding the US invasion of Korea , and helping to establish the US-aligned Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in 1954.

[ 82 ] : 493 Following a tour of Europe and the US in 1955 where he was impressed by democratic practices like freedom of speech , Phibun began to democratize Thai politics by allowing new political parties and trade unions to form, opening public forums, granting amnesty to former political opponents, and preparing Thailand for its first free elections . However, these practices likely aroused opposition to Phibun's dictatorial legacy, and the US supported his final ouster in 1957.

[ 95 ] Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat took power by coup in 1957, and he proceeded to reverse Phibun's democratic reforms and ban the Khana Ratsadon party from politics. His rule from 1959–1963 was autocratic; he built his legitimacy around the god-like status of the monarch and by channelling the government and public's loyalty to the king.

[ 82 ] : 511 Though Phibun had been criticized for his close relationship to the United States, Sarit also aligned himself with them and militarily supported the United States invasion of Vietnam in 1961, leading a simultaneous campaign of anti-communist mass killings in Thailand that continued under his successor Thanom Kittikachorn .

[ 82 ] : 523 The Sarit and Thanom periods coincided with significant modernisation and Westernisation of Thai society. Rapid urbanisation occurred as the rural populace sought work in growing cities like Bangkok . Economic development and education enabled the rise of an urban middle class.

[ 82 ] : 534 The growth of this economy based on wage labour rather than subsistence agriculture resulted in increased class consciousness and sympathies to the Communist Party of Thailand , [ 82 ] : 528 while university-educated students formed movements against the military dictatorship. In October 1973, a popular uprising against the Thanom government began to bring about an end to Thailand's military regime.

[ 82 ] : 541–3 In response to mass killings of protesters, King Adulyadej installed Sanya Dharmasakti as Prime Minister, marking the first time that the king had intervened in Thai politics directly since 1932.

[ 96 ] The aftermath of the event marked a short-lived parliamentary democracy, [ 96 ] often called the "era when democracy blossomed" (ยุคประชาธิปไตยเบ่งบาน).

[ citation needed ] Transition to Democracy Main articles: History of Thailand (1973–2001) and History of Thailand (2001–present) See also: South Thailand insurgency A post-uprising period of unrest and instability, as well as fear of a communist takeover after the fall of Saigon in 1975, culminated in the Thammasat University massacre in October 1976.

[ 82 ] : 548–9 A coup d'état on that day brought Thailand a new ultra-right government, which cracked down on media outlets, officials, and intellectuals, and engendered a communist insurgency . Another coup the following year installed a more moderate government, which offered amnesty to some communist fighters in 1978.

[ 97 ] Riding on a wave of right-wing sentiments fueled by the Indochina refugee crisis , Vietnamese border raids , and economic hardship, military strongman Prem Tinsulanonda was appointed Prime Minister from in 1980. Following negotiations with Prem, the communists abandoned the insurgency by 1983. Prem's premiership was dubbed " semi-democracy " because the Parliament was composed of all elected House and all appointed Senate. The 1980s also saw increasing intervention in politics by the monarch, who foiled two coups in attempts against Prem in 1981 and 1985 . In 1988, Thailand saw its first freely elected prime minister since 1976.

Chatichai Choonhavan ruled for 3 years before being overthrown in a coup that ushered in two years of military rule under the National Peace Keeping Council .

[ 98 ] One of the coup leaders, Suchinda Kraprayoon, was nominated as prime minister the majority coalition government after the 1992 general election . This caused a popular demonstration in Bangkok, which ended with a bloody military crackdown .

[ 99 ] The king intervened in the event, granting amnesty to the belligerents and forcing the resignation of Suchinda.

[ 100 ] The 1997 Asian financial crisis originated in Thailand and ended the country's 40 years of uninterrupted economic growth.

[ 101 ] : 3 Chavalit Yongchaiyudh 's government took an IMF loan to support the recovery.

[ 102 ] The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami hit the country, mostly in the south, claiming around 5,400 lives in Phuket , Phang Nga , Ranong , Krabi , Trang , and Satun , with thousands still missing.

[ 103 ] The populist Thai Rak Thai party , led by prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra , governed from 2001 until 2006. His policies were successful in reducing rural poverty [ 104 ] and providing universal healthcare .

[ 105 ] However, Thaksin was viewed as a corrupt populist who was destroying the middle class in order to favour himself and the rural poor. He also faced criticism over his response to the South Thailand insurgency which escalated starting from 2004. Additionally, his recommendations to the rural poor directly conflicted with King Bhumibol's recommendations, drawing the ire of royalists, a powerful faction in Thailand. In response, the royalists made up a story about how Thaksin and his "advisors gathered in Finland to plot the overthrow of the monarchy".

Meanwhile, massive protests against Thaksin led by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) started in his second term as prime minister. Eventually, the monarchy and the military agree to oust the leader. In this case, the military first sought permission from the king to oust Thaksin, the permission was denied. But then, the king rejected Thaksin's choice to lead the army, allowing a military leader to be put into power who wanted the coup.

1 Then, the army dissolved Thaksin's party with a coup d'état in 2006 and banned over a hundred of its executives from politics. After the coup, a military government was installed which lasted a year.

[ 106 ] [ 107 ] United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship , Red Shirts, protest in 2010 Coming back to democracy was a process that took very active participation of the people. The people frequently stormed government buildings and the military threatened yet another coup.

[ 106 ] Finally, in 2007, a civilian government led by the Thaksin-allied People's Power Party (PPP) was elected .

Another protest led by PAD ended with the dissolution of PPP, and the Democrat Party led a coalition government in its place. The pro-Thaksin United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) protested both in 2009 and in 2010 , the latter of which ended with a violent military crackdown causing more than 70 civilian deaths.

[ 108 ] After the general election of 2011 , the populist Pheu Thai Party won a majority.

Yingluck Shinawatra , Thaksin's younger sister, became prime minister. The People's Democratic Reform Committee organised another anti-Shinawatra protest [ 109 ] after the ruling party proposed an amnesty bill which would benefit Thaksin.

[ 110 ] Yingluck dissolved parliament and a general election was scheduled, but was invalidated by the Constitutional Court . The crisis ended with another coup d'état in 2014 .

[ 111 ] The ensuing National Council for Peace and Order , a military junta led by General Prayut Chan-o-cha , led the country until 2019. Civil and political rights were restricted, and the country saw a surge in lèse-majesté cases. Political opponents and dissenters were sent to "attitude adjustment" camps; [ 112 ] this was described by academics as showing the rise of fascism.

[ 113 ] Bhumibol, the longest-reigning Thai king, died in 2016 , and his son Vajiralongkorn ascended to the throne. The referendum and adoption of Thailand's current constitution happened under the junta's rule.

[ vii ] The junta also bound future governments to a 20-year national strategy 'road map' it laid down, effectively locking the country into military-guided democracy .

[ 115 ] In 2019, the junta agreed to schedule a general election in March .

[ 112 ] Prayut continued his premiership with the support of Palang Pracharath Party -coalition in the House and junta-appointed Senate, amid allegations of election fraud.

[ 116 ] The 2020–21 pro-democracy protests were triggered by increasing royal prerogative , democratic and economic regression from the Royal Thai Armed Forces supported by the monarchy in the wake of the coup d'état in 2014 , dissolution of the pro-democracy Future Forward Party , distrust in the 2019 general election and the current political system, forced disappearance and deaths of political activists including Wanchalearm Satsaksit , and political corruption scandals, [ 117 ] [ 118 ] which brought forward unprecedented demands to reform the monarchy [ 119 ] and the highest sense of republicanism in the country.

[ 120 ] In May 2023, Thailand's reformist opposition, the progressive Move Forward Party (MFP) and the populist Pheu Thai Party , won the general election , meaning the royalist-military parties that supported Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha lost power.

[ 121 ] On 22 August 2023, Srettha Thavisin of the populist Pheu Thai party, became Thailand's new prime minister, while the Pheu Thai party's billionaire figurehead Thaksin Shinawatra returned to Thailand after years in self-imposed exile.

[ 122 ] Thavisin was later dismissed from his prime ministerial role on 14 August 2024 by the Constitutional Court for his "gross ethics violations".

[ 123 ] Geography Main article: Geography of Thailand Ko Tarutao , Satun Totalling 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), Thailand is the 50th-largest country by total area.

[ 1 ] Thailand comprises several distinct geographic regions, partly corresponding to the provincial groups. The north of the country is the mountainous area of the Thai highlands , with the highest point being Doi Inthanon in the Thanon Thong Chai Range at 2,565 metres (8,415 ft) above sea level. The northeast, Isan , consists of the Khorat Plateau , bordered to the east by the Mekong River . The centre of the country is dominated by the predominantly flat Chao Phraya river valley, which runs into the Gulf of Thailand . Southern Thailand consists of the narrow Kra Isthmus that widens into the Malay Peninsula .

The Chao Phraya and the Mekong River are the indispensable water courses of rural Thailand. Industrial scale production of crops use both rivers and their tributaries. The Gulf of Thailand covers 320,000 square kilometres (124,000 sq mi) and is fed by the Chao Phraya, Mae Klong , Bang Pakong , and Tapi Rivers. It contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow waters along the coasts in the southern region and the Kra Isthmus. The eastern shore of the Gulf of Thailand has the kingdom's premier deepwater port in Sattahip and its busiest commercial port, Laem Chabang .

Phuket , Krabi , Ranong , Phang Nga and Trang , and their islands, all lay along the coasts of the Andaman Sea .

[ 128 ] National parks in Thailand are defined as an area that contains natural resources of ecological importance or unique beauty, or flora and fauna of special importance . Thailand's protected areas include 156 national parks, 58 wildlife sanctuaries, 67 non-hunting areas, and 120 forest parks. They cover almost 31 per cent of the kingdom's territory.

[ 129 ] The parks are administered by the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department (DNP) of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE).

Thailand has a mediocre but improving performance in the global Environmental Performance Index (EPI), with an overall ranking of 91 out of 180 countries in 2016. The environmental areas where Thailand performs worst (i.e., highest-ranking) are air quality (167), environmental effects of the agricultural industry (106), and the climate and energy sector (93), the later mainly because of a high CO 2 emission per kWh produced. Thailand performs best (i.e., lowest-ranking) in water resource management (66), with some major improvements expected for the future, and sanitation (68).

[ 130 ] [ 131 ] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.00/10, ranking it 88th globally out of 172 countries.

[ 132 ] The population of elephants, the country's national symbol , has fallen from 100,000 in 1850 to an estimated 2,000.

[ 128 ] Poachers have long hunted elephants for ivory and hides, and now increasingly for meat .

[ 133 ] Young elephants are often captured for use in tourist attractions or as work animals, where there have been claims of mistreatment.

[ 134 ] In 1989, the government banned the use of elephants for logging , leading many elephant owners to move their domesticated animals to the tourism industry.

[ 135 ] Poaching of protected species remains a major problem.

Tigers , leopards , and other large cats are hunted for their pelts. Many are farmed or hunted for their meat, which supposedly has medicinal properties. Although such trade is illegal, the well-known Bangkok market Chatuchak is still known for the sale of endangered species.

[ 136 ] The practice of keeping wild animals as pets affects species such as Asiatic black bear , Malayan sun bear , white-handed lar , pileated gibbon , and binturong .

[ 137 ] Politics and government Main article: Politics of Thailand Further information: Constitutions of Thailand , Government of Thailand , and Elections in Thailand Vajiralongkorn King of Thailand since 13 October 2016 Paetongtarn Shinawatra Prime Minister of Thailand since 16 August 2024 Prior to 1932, Thai kings were feudal or absolute monarchs . During Sukhothai Kingdom , the king was seen as a Dharmaraja or 'king who rules in accordance with Dharma '. The system of government was a network of tributaries ruled by local lords. Modern absolute monarchy and statehood was established by Chulalongkorn when he transformed the decentralised protectorate system into a unitary state. On 24 June 1932, Khana Ratsadon (People's Party) carried out a bloodless revolution which marked the beginning of constitutional monarchy .

Thailand has had 20 constitutions and charters since 1932, including the latest and current 2017 Constitution. All constitutions state that the politics is conducted within the framework of a constitutional monarchy, but the de facto form of government has ranged from military dictatorship to electoral democracy.

[ 138 ] [ 139 ] Thailand's current form of government is part democracy and part dictatorship; many terms are used to describe it.

[ viii ] Thailand has had the fourth-most coups in the world.

[ 145 ] "Uniformed or ex-military men have led Thailand for 55 of the 83 years" between 1932 and 2009.

[ 146 ] Most recently, the military junta self-titled as the National Council for Peace and Order ruled the country between 2014 and 2019.

Sappaya-Sapasathan , the current Parliament House of Thailand Government is separated into three branches: The legislative branch: the National Assembly is composed of the Senate , the 200-member indirectly elected upper house and House of Representatives , the elected 500-member lower house . Its most recent election is the 2023 general election . The coalition led by Pheu Thai Party currently holds the majority. The 2024 Thai Senate election was the first senate election held under the current constitution in the process criticized as "the most complicated election in the world".

[ 147 ] The senate is allegedly dominated by Bhumjaithai Party -affiliated senators.

[ 148 ] The executive branch consisting of the Prime Minister of Thailand , the head of government , and other cabinet members of up to 35 people. The Prime Minister was elected by the House of Representatives. The current constitution mandates that prime ministers are to be considered from candidates nominated by political parties before the election. The current prime minister is Paetongtarn Shinawatra , a member of the Pheu Thai Party.

The judiciary is supposed to be independent of the executive and the legislative branches, although judicial rulings are suspected of being based on political considerations rather than on existing law.

[ 149 ] Military and bureaucratic aristocrats fully controlled political parties between 1946 and the 1980s.

[ 150 ] : 16 Most parties in Thailand are short-lived.

[ 151 ] : 246 Between 1992 and 2006, Thailand had a two-party system .

[ 151 ] : 245 Later constitutions created a multi-party system where a single party cannot gain a majority in the house.

A hereditary monarch serves as Thailand's head of state . The current King of Thailand is Vajiralongkorn (Rama X), who has reigned since October 2016. The powers of the king are limited by the constitution and he is primarily a symbolic figurehead. However, the monarch still occasionally intervenes in Thai politics, as all constitutions pave the way for customary royal rulings. Some academics outside Thailand, including Duncan McCargo and Federico Ferrara, noted extraconstitutional role of the monarch through a " network monarchy " behind the political scenes.

[ 152 ] The monarchy is protected by the severe lèse majesté law , even though the people's attitude towards the institution varies from one reign to another.

[ 153 ] [ 154 ] The kings are protected by lèse-majesté laws which allow critics to be jailed for three to fifteen years.

[ 155 ] After the coup d'état in 2014 , Thailand had the highest number of lèse-majesté prisoners in the nation's history.

[ 156 ] [ 157 ] Human rights in Thailand has been rated not free on the Freedom House Index since 2014.

[ 158 ] On August 7, 2024, Thailand's Constitutional Court banned the victors of the 2023 parliamentary elections , the Move Forward Party and all of its leaders from politics for its proposal to reform the lèse-majesté law, arguing it posed a threat to the constitutional order.

[ 159 ] The Economist criticised the move as an example of " lawfare " and pointed to the dissolution of its predecessor party, Future Forward in 2020, as the latest example of how an "alliance of conservative forces in Thailand—including monarchists, the army and a handful of business tycoons—has sought to suppress opposition".

[ 159 ] [ 160 ] On the Freedom in the World 2024 Report for Thailand, their status improved from not free to partly free due to competitive parliamentary elections and the formation of a new governing coalition by what had been a major opposition party, though unelected senators ensured that the party with the most votes was excluded.

[ 161 ] Administrative divisions Main articles: Organization of the government of Thailand , Provinces of Thailand , and Administrative Divisions of Thailand See also: Regions of Thailand Thailand is a unitary state ; the administrative services of the executive branch are divided into three levels by National Government Organisation Act, BE 2534 (1991): central, provincial and local. Thailand is composed of 76 provinces ( จังหวัด , changwat ), [ 162 ] which are first-level administrative divisions . There are also two specially governed districts: the capital Bangkok and Pattaya . Bangkok is at provincial level and thus often counted as a province.

[ 163 ] Each province is divided into districts ( อำเภอ , amphoe ) and the districts are further divided into sub-districts ( ตำบล , tambons ). The name of each province's capital city ( เมือง , mueang) is the same as that of the province. For example, the capital of Chiang Mai Province ( Changwat Chiang Mai ) is Mueang Chiang Mai or Chiang Mai . All provincial governors and district chiefs, which are administrators of provinces and districts respectively, are appointed by the central government.

[ 164 ] Thailand's provinces are sometimes grouped into four to six regions, depending on the source.

A clickable map of Thailand exhibiting its provinces A clickable map of Thailand exhibiting its provinces Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of Thailand King Bhumibol Adulyadej in a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama , 18 November 2012 Siam's and Thailand's way of conducting foreign relations has long been described as "bamboo bending with the wind", of policies that are "always solidly rooted, but flexible enough to bend whichever way the wind blows in order to survive", [ 165 ] or adaptable and pragmatic. In order to secure independence, it sought to pit one great power against the others so that it would be dominated by none.

[ 166 ] During the Cold War , Thailand sought to prevent the spread of communism so it joined the United States, including participating in SEATO alliance, sending expeditions to Korea and Vietnam, and offering the US to use its base. Thailand is one of the five founding members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), initially to safeguard against communism. The end of Vietnam War was a turning point in Thai foreign policy and afterwards it sought to improve relations with Communist China and its now-Communist neighbours. Thailand remains an active member of ASEAN and seek to project its influence in it. Thailand has developed increasingly close ties with other members, with progressing regional co-operation in economic, trade, banking, political, and cultural matters.

[ 167 ] In the 2000s, Thailand had taken an active role on the international stage and participated fully in international and regional organisations. It is a major non-NATO ally and Priority Watch List Special 301 Report of the United States. When East Timor gained independence from Indonesia, Thailand contributed troops to the international peacekeeping effort.

[ 168 ] As part of its effort to increase international ties, Thailand had reached out to such regional organisations as the Organization of American States (OAS) [ 169 ] and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

[ 170 ] During Thaksin Shinawatra 's premiership, negotiations for several free trade agreements with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US were initiated. Thaksin sought to position Thailand as a regional leader, initiating various development projects in poorer neighbouring countries. More controversially, he established close, friendly ties with the Burmese dictatorship.

[ 171 ] Thailand joined the US-led invasion of Iraq , sending a humanitarian contingent until September 2004.

[ 172 ] Thailand also had contributed troops to reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan .

[ 173 ] In April 2009, the 2008–2013 Cambodian–Thai border crisis brought troops on territory immediately adjacent to the 900-year-old ruins of Cambodia's Preah Vihear Hindu temple near the border.

[ 174 ] [ 175 ] After the 2014 coup, Thailand leaned more towards China.

[ 176 ] Growing Chinese influence and capital inflow caused some members of parliament to raise the concern about "economic colony" under China after many concessions.

[ 177 ] During the Israel-Gaza war in 2023, at first Thailand's prime minister stated that his government strongly condemns the attack against Israel and extends its deepest condolences to the government and the people of Israel [ 178 ] but the government later changed its position and announced that Thailand adopted a neutral stance in this conflict.

[ 179 ] 28 Thai nationals were killed in this conflict.

They are subjected to varying lengths of active service depending on the duration of reserve training as Territorial Defence Student and their level of education. Those who have completed three years or more of reserve training will be exempted entirely. The practice has long been criticized, as some media question its efficacy and value.

[ 189 ] [ 190 ] It is alleged that conscripts end up as servants to senior officers [ 191 ] or clerks in military cooperative shops.

[ 192 ] [ 193 ] In a report issued in March 2020, Amnesty International charged that Thai military conscripts face institutionalised abuse systematically hushed up by military authorities.

[ 194 ] Critics observed that Thai military's main objective is to deal with internal rather than external threats.

[ 195 ] Internal Security Operations Command is called the political arm of the Thai military, which has overlapping social and political functions with civilian bureaucracy. It also has anti-democracy mission.

[ 195 ] The military is also notorious for numerous corruption incidents, such as accusation of human trafficking , [ 196 ] and nepotism in promotion of high-ranking officers.

[ 197 ] The military is deeply entrenched in politics. Most recently, the appointed senators include more than 100 active and retired military.

[ 198 ] Thailand is the 75th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 Global Peace Index .

[ 199 ] Economy Main article: Economy of Thailand Economic indicators Nominal GDP ฿14.53 trillion (2016) [ 200 ] GDP growth 3.9% (2017) [ 201 ] Headline inflation 0.7% (2017) [ 201 ] Core inflation 0.6% (2017) [ 201 ] Employment-to-population ratio 68.0% (2017) [ 202 ] : 29 Unemployment 1.2% (2017) [ 201 ] Total public debt ฿6.37 trillion ( Dec.

The economy of Thailand is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP). Thailand exports over US$105 billion worth of goods and services annually.

[ 1 ] Major exports include cars, computers, electrical appliances, rice , textiles and footwear, fishery products, rubber, and jewellery.

[ 1 ] Thailand is an emerging economy and is considered a newly industrialised country . Thailand had a 2017 GDP of US$1.236 trillion (on a purchasing power parity basis).

[ 205 ] Thailand is the second largest economy in Southeast Asia after Indonesia. Thailand ranks midway in the wealth spread in Southeast Asia as it is the fourth richest nation according to GDP per capita, after Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia.

Thailand functions as an anchor economy for the neighbouring developing economies of Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia. In the third quarter of 2014, the unemployment rate in Thailand stood at 0.84% according to Thailand's National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB).

[ 206 ] In 2017, the Thai economy grew an inflation-adjusted 3.9%, up from 3.3% in 2016, marking its fastest expansion since 2012.

[ 207 ] High public spending, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic , prompted the authorities to raise Thailand's public debt ceiling from 60% to 70% of GDP.

[ 208 ] As of 2024 [update] , Thailand struggles with low productivity, poor education, high household debt, low private investment and slow economic growth, [ 209 ] [ 210 ] with an economic research group forecasted an annual GDP growth of below 2% in the next decades without structural reforms.

[ 211 ] Income and wealth disparities Development of real GDP per capita, 1890 to 2018 Thais have median wealth per one adult person of $1,469 in 2016, [ 212 ] : 98 increasing from $605 in 2010.

[ 212 ] : 34 In 2016, Thailand was ranked 87th in Human Development Index , and 70th in the inequality-adjusted HDI .

[ 213 ] In 2017, Thailand's median household income was ฿26,946 per month.

[ 214 ] : 1 Top quintile households had a 45.0% share of all income, while bottom quintile households had 7.1%.

[ 214 ] : 4 There were 26.9 million persons who had the bottom 40% of income earning less than ฿5,344 per person per month.

[ 215 ] : 5 During the 2013–2014 Thai political crisis , a survey found that anti-government PDRC mostly (32%) had a monthly income of more than ฿50,000, while pro-government UDD mostly (27%) had between ฿10,000 and ฿20,000.

[ 216 ] : 7 In 2014, Credit Suisse reported that Thailand was the world's third most unequal country, behind Russia and India.

[ 217 ] The top 10% richest held 79% of the country's assets.

[ 217 ] The top 1% held 58% of the assets.

[ 217 ] The 50 richest Thai families had a total net worth accounting to 30% of GDP.

[ 217 ] Bank of Thailand reported that during 2006–16, Thailand's top 5% largest companies had 85% of all corporate revenue in the nation, and only 6% of the country's companies were in export industries, which made up 60% of the country's GDP.

[ 218 ] In 2016, 5.81 million people lived in poverty, or 11.6 million people (17.2% of population) if "near poor" is included.

[ 215 ] : 1 The proportion of the poor relative to total population in each region was 12.96% in the Northeast, 12.35% in the South, and 9.83% in the North.

[ 215 ] : 2 In 2017, there were 14 million people who applied for social welfare (yearly income of less than ฿100,000 was required).

[ 219 ] In 2016, there were estimated 30,000 homeless persons in the country.

[ 220 ] Exports and manufacturing The economy of Thailand is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of gross domestic products (GDPs). Major exports include cars, computers, electrical appliances, rice , textiles and footwear, fishery products, rubber, and jewellery.

[ 1 ] In 2022, Thailand's export of goods is worth roughly US$290 billion while its import worth roughly US$305 billion.

[ 221 ] Substantial industries include electric appliances, components, computer components, and vehicles. Thailand's recovery from the 1997–1998 Asian financial crisis depended mainly on exports, among various other factors. As of 2012 [update] , the Thai automotive industry was the largest in Southeast Asia and the 9th largest in the world .

[ 222 ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] The Thailand industry has an annual output of near 1.5 million vehicles, mostly commercial vehicles.

[ 224 ] Most of the vehicles built in Thailand are developed and licensed by foreign producers, mainly Japanese and American. The Thai car industry takes advantage of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) to find a market for many of its products. Eight manufacturers, five Japanese, two US, and Tata of India, produce pick-up trucks in Thailand.

[ 225 ] As of 2012, due to its favourable taxation for 2-door pick-ups at only 3–12% against 17–50% for passenger cars, Thailand was the second largest consumer of pick-up trucks in the world, after the US.

[ 226 ] In 2014, pick-ups accounted for 42% of all new vehicle sales in Thailand.

[ 225 ] Tourism Further information: Tourism in Thailand Wat Arun , Bangkok , is among the best-known Thailand's landmarks.

Tourism makes up about 6% of the country's economy. Prior to the pandemic, Thailand was the world's eighth most visited country according to the World Tourism rankings compiled by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation . In 2019, Thailand received 39.8 million international tourists, ahead of United Kingdom and Germany [ 227 ] and was the fourth highest in international tourism earning 60.5 billion US dollars .

Thailand was the most visited country in Southeast Asia in 2013, according to the World Tourism Organisation. Estimates of tourism receipts directly contributing to the Thai GDP of 12 trillion baht range from 9 per cent (1 trillion baht) (2013) to 16 per cent.

[ 228 ] When including the indirect effects of tourism, it is said to account for 20.2 per cent (2.4 trillion baht) of Thailand's GDP.

[ 229 ] : 1 Asian tourists primarily visit Thailand for Bangkok and the historical, natural, and cultural sights in its vicinity. Western tourists not only visit Bangkok and surrounding areas; many travel to the southern beaches and islands. The north is the chief destination for trekking and adventure travel with its diverse ethnic minority groups and forested mountains. The region hosting the fewest tourists is Isan . To accommodate foreign visitors, a separate tourism police with offices were set up in the major tourist areas and an emergency telephone number.

[ 230 ] Thailand ranks as the worlds fifth largest medical tourism destination in spending, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council , attracting over 2.5 million visitors in 2018, [ 231 ] and is number one in Asia.

[ 232 ] The country is popular for the growing practice of sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and cosmetic surgery. In 2010–2012, more than 90% of medical tourists travelled to Thailand for SRS.

[ 233 ] Prostitution in Thailand and sex tourism also form a de facto part of the economy. Campaigns promote Thailand as exotic to attract tourists.

[ 234 ] One estimate published in 2003 placed the trade at US$4.3 billion per year or about 3% of the Thai economy.

[ 235 ] It is believed that at least 10% of tourist dollars are spent on the sex trade.

[ 236 ] Agriculture and natural resources Further information: Agriculture in Thailand Thailand has long been one of the largest rice exporters in the world . Forty-nine per cent of Thailand's labour force is employed in agriculture.

[ 237 ] Forty-nine per cent of Thailand's labour force is employed in agriculture .

[ 237 ] This is down from 70% in 1980.

[ 237 ] Rice is the most important crop in the country and Thailand had long been the world's leading exporter of rice, until recently falling behind both India and Vietnam.

[ 238 ] Thailand has the highest percentage of arable land, 27.25%, of any state in the Greater Mekong Subregion .

[ 239 ] About 55% of the arable land area is used for rice production.

[ 240 ] Agriculture has been experiencing a transition from labour-intensive and transitional methods to a more industrialised and competitive sector.

[ 237 ] Between 1962 and 1983, the agricultural sector grew by 4.1% per year on average and continued to grow at 2.2% between 1983 and 2007.

[ 237 ] The relative contribution of agriculture to GDP has declined while exports of goods and services have increased.

Furthermore, access to biocapacity in Thailand is lower than world average. In 2016, Thailand had 1.2 global hectares [ 241 ] of biocapacity per person within its territory, a little less than world average of 1.6 global hectares per person.

[ 242 ] In contrast, in 2016, they used 2.5 global hectares of biocapacity—their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use about twice as much biocapacity as Thailand contains, resulting in a deficit.

[ 241 ] Informal economy The Train Night Market in Bangkok In 2012, it was estimated that informal workers comprised 62.6% of the Thai workforce. The Ministry of Labour defines informal workers to be individuals who work in informal economies and do not have employee status under a given country's Labour Protection Act (LPA). The informal sector in Thailand has grown significantly over the past 60 years over the course of Thailand's gradual transition from an agriculture-based economy to becoming more industrialised and service-oriented.

[ 243 ] Between 1993 and 1995, ten per cent of the Thai labour force moved from the agricultural sector to urban and industrial jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector. It is estimated that between 1988 and 1995, the number of factory workers in the country doubled from two to four million, as Thailand's GDP tripled.

[ 244 ] While the Asian financial crisis that followed in 1997 hit the Thai economy hard, the industrial sector continued to expand under widespread deregulation, as Thailand was mandated to adopt a range of structural adjustment reforms upon receiving funding from the IMF and World Bank. These reforms implemented an agenda of increased privatisation and trade liberalisation in the country, and decreased federal subsidisation of public goods and utilities, agricultural price supports, and regulations on fair wages and labour conditions.

[ 245 ] [ full citation needed ] Many migrant farmers took jobs in sweatshops and factories with few labour regulations and often exploitative conditions.

[ 246 ] Those that could not find formal factory work, including illegal migrants and the families of rural Thai migrants, are under the regulation imposed by the structural adjustment programmes. Scholars argue that the economic consequences and social costs of Thailand's labour reforms in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis fell on individuals and families rather than the state.

[ 245 ] Songkran Festival, Chiang Mai 's ancient city wall Informal labour in entertainment, nightlife, and the sex industry face additional vulnerabilities, including recruitment into circles of sexual exploitation and human trafficking.

[ 243 ] A 2012 study found that 64% of informal workers had not completed education beyond primary school. Many informal workers are also migrants, only some of which have legal status in the country. The informal labour sector is also not recognised under the Labour Protection Act (LPA). Thai social security policies fail to protect against workplace accidents and unemployment and retirement insurance. Many informal workers are not legally contracted for their employment, and many do not make a living wage.

[ 243 ] Tens of thousands of migrants from neighboring countries face exploitation in a few industries, [ 247 ] especially in fishing where slave-like conditions have been reported.

[ 248 ] Science and technology Thailand ranked 41st in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

[ 249 ] The Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation and its agencies oversees the development of science, technology, and research in Thailand. According to the National Research Council of Thailand, the country devoted 1.1% of its GDP to the research and development of science in 2019, with over 166,788 research and development personnel in full-time equivalent that year.

[ 250 ] [ 251 ] Infrastructure Transportation Main articles: Transport in Thailand and List of airports in Thailand The BTS Skytrain is an elevated rapid transit system in Bangkok.

The State Railway of Thailand (SRT) operates all of Thailand's national rail lines.

Krung Thep Aphiwat Central Terminal and Bangkok (Hua Lamphong) are the main termini of intercity routes. Phahonyothin and ICD Lat Krabang are the main freight terminals. As of 2025 [update] SRT had 4,507 km (2,801 mi) of track, all of it meter gauge . Nearly all is single-track (2702.1 km), although some important sections around Bangkok are double (1,234.9 km or 767.3 mi) or triple-tracked (107 km or 66 mi), and there are plans to extend this.

[ 252 ] [ 253 ] Rail transport in Bangkok includes long-distance services. There are four rapid transit rail systems in the capital: the BTS Skytrain , MRT , SRT Red Lines , and the Airport Rail Link .

[ 254 ] In Bangkok, there were two failed rapid rail projects Lavalin Skytrain and Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System , before Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region was endorsed by the cabinet on 27 September 1994 and implemented from 1995 to the present.

[ 255 ] Thailand has 390,000 kilometres (240,000 miles) of highways.

[ 260 ] Energy Further information: Energy in Thailand 75% of Thailand's electrical generation is powered by natural gas in 2014.

[ 261 ] Coal-fired power plants produce an additional 20% of electricity, with the remainder coming from biomass, hydro, and biogas.

[ 261 ] Compared to other ASEAN's countries, Thailand is the largest importer of gas in weight.

[ 262 ] : 17 In 2022, Thailand's oil and gas production dropped by 19% and 17%, respectively.

[ 263 ] [ 262 ] : 8 The government, in 2018, has developed an Alternative Energy Development Plan 2018–2037 (AEDP 2018). The plan defines goals for the increase of renewable energy to almost 30,000 MW by 2037.

[ 264 ] [ 265 ] Demographics Main article: Demographics of Thailand Ethnic groups
of Thailand (2015 estimate by The World Factbook ) [ 1 ] Thai (97.5%) Burmese (1.30%) other (1.10%) unspecified (0.10%) Thailand has an estimated population of 65.97 million in 2024.

[ 3 ] Thailand's first census in 1909 found the population to be 8.2 million.

[ 266 ] Thailand's population is largely rural, concentrated in the rice-growing areas of the central, northeastern, and northern regions. About 44.2% of Thailand's population lived in urban areas as of 2010 [update] , slowly increasing from 29.4% in the 1990 census and 31.1% in the 2000 census.

[ 267 ] Thailand's government-sponsored family planning programme resulted in a dramatic decline in population growth from 3.1% in 1960 to around 0.4% today. In 1970, an average of 5.7 people lived in a Thai household; in 2022, the average Thai household size was 3 people.

[ 268 ] Now, more than 20% of its population is aged over 60 and has a low birth rate, posing economic challenges.

[ 269 ] The sex ratio between male and female is 1.05, with Thailand having slightly more males.

[ 270 ] Thailand's total fertility rate declined to 1.0 in 2024.

[ 271 ] This ranks Thailand among countries with ultra-low fertility rates.

[ 271 ] Ethnic groups Further information: Ethnic groups in Thailand Hill tribes girls in the Northeast of Thailand As of 2010, Thai people make up the majority of Thailand's population (95.9%). The remaining 4.1% of the population are Burmese (2.0%), others (1.3%), and unspecified (0.9%).

[ 1 ] According to genetic research, the present-day Thai people were divided into three groups: the northern group (Khon Mueang) are closely related to the Tai ethnic groups in southern China , the northeastern group ( Isan people ) are mixed Tai and several Austroasiatic -speaking ethnic groups, while the central and southern groups (formerly called Siamese) strongly share genetic profiles with the Mon people .

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] According to the Royal Thai Government's 2011 Country Report to the UN Committee responsible for the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , available from the Department of Rights and Liberties Promotion of the Thai Ministry of Justice, : 3 62 ethnic communities are officially recognised in Thailand. Twenty million Central Thai (together with approximately 650,000 Khorat Thai ) made up approximately 20,650,000 (34.1 per cent) of the state's population of 60,544,937 [ 272 ] at the time of completion of the Mahidol University Ethnolinguistic Maps of Thailand data (1997).

[ 273 ] The 2011 Thailand Country Report provides population numbers for mountain peoples ('hill tribes') and ethnic communities in the Northeast and is explicit about its main reliance on the Mahidol University Ethnolinguistic Maps of Thailand data.

[ 273 ] Thus, though over 3.288 million people in the Northeast alone could not be categorised, the population and percentages of other ethnic communities c.

1997 are known for all of Thailand and constitute minimum populations. In descending order, the largest (equal to or greater than 400,000) are a) 15,080,000 Lao (24.9 per cent) consisting of the Thai Lao (14 million) and other smaller Lao groups, namely the Thai Loei (400–500,000), Lao Lom (350,000), Lao Wiang/Klang (200,000), Lao Khrang (90,000), Lao Ngaew (30,000), and Lao Ti (10,000); b) six million Khon Muang (9.9 per cent, also called Northern Thais); c) 4.5 million Pak Tai (7.5 per cent, also called Southern Thais); d) 1.4 million Khmer Leu (2.3 per cent, also called Northern Khmer); e) 900,000 Malay (1.5%); f) 500,000 Nyaw (0.8 per cent); g) 470,000 Phu Thai (0.8 per cent); h) 400,000 Kuy/Kuay (also known as Suay) (0.7 per cent), and i) 350,000 Karen (0.6 per cent).

: 7–13 Thai Chinese , including those of significant Chinese origins, are 14% of the population, while Thais with partial Chinese ancestry comprise up to 40% of the population.

[ 274 ] Thai Malays also represent 3% of the Thai population's heritage, with the remainder consisting of Mons , Khmers , and various " hill tribes ".

[ citation needed ] Increasing numbers of migrants from neighbouring Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia, as well as from Nepal and India, have pushed the total number of non-national residents to around 3.5 million as of 2009 [update] , up from an estimated 2 million in 2008.

[ 278 ] The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the Thai alphabet , an abugida script that evolved from the Khmer alphabet .

[ 279 ] Sixty-two languages were recognised by the Royal Thai Government.

[ 280 ] For the purposes of the national census, four dialects of Thai exist; these partly coincide with regional designations, such as Southern Thai and Northern Thai .

[ 278 ] The largest of Thailand's minority languages is the Lao dialect of Isan spoken in the northeastern provinces. In the far south, Kelantan-Pattani Malay is the primary language of Malay Muslims. Varieties of Chinese are also spoken by the large Thai Chinese population, with the Teochew dialect best-represented. Numerous tribal languages are also spoken, including many Austroasiatic languages such as Mon , Khmer , and Mlabri ; Austronesian languages such as Cham , Moken and Urak Lawoi' ; Sino-Tibetan languages like Lawa , Akha , and Karen ; and other Tai languages such as Phu Thai , and Saek .

Hmong is a member of the Hmong–Mien languages , which is now regarded as a language family of its own.

[ 281 ] [ 278 ] Religion Main article: Religion in Thailand Religion in Thailand (2018) [ 2 ] Buddhism (93.5%) Islam (5.37%) Christianity (1.13%) Other (0.04%) The country's most prevalent religion is Theravada Buddhism, which is an integral part of Thai identity and culture. Active participation in Buddhism is among the highest in the world. Thailand has the second-largest number of Buddhists in the world after China.

[ 282 ] According to the 2018 National Statistical Office data, 93.46% of the country's population self-identified as Buddhists.

Christians represented 1.13% of the population in 2018, with the remaining population consisting of Hindus and Sikhs , who live mostly in the country's cities. There is also a small Jewish community in Thailand dating back to the 17th century.

[ 283 ] The constitution does not name an official state religion, and provides for freedom of religion. There have been no widespread reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.

[ 284 ] Thai law officially recognises five religious groups: Buddhists, Muslims, Brahmin-Hindus, Sikhs, and Christians.

[ 285 ] However, some laws are inspired from Buddhist practices, such as banning alcohol sales on religious holidays.

[ 286 ] Education Main article: Education in Thailand Chulalongkorn University , established in 1917, is the oldest university in Thailand.

In 1995, as minister of education, Sukavich Rangsitpollaid let out his plans for educational reform in Thailand.

[ 287 ] The reform was considered a landmark movement after nearly 100 years of education under the previous system.

[ 288 ] Thailand's youth literacy rate was 98.1% in 2015.

[ 289 ] Education is provided by a school system of kindergartens, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools, numerous vocational colleges, and universities. Education is compulsory up to and including age 14, while the government is mandated to provide free education through to age 17. Issues concerning university entrance have been in constant upheaval for a number of years. The country is also one of the few that still mandates uniform up to the university years, which is still a subject of ongoing debate.

[ 290 ] In 2013, the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology announced that 27,231 schools would receive classroom-level access to high-speed internet .

[ 291 ] However, the country's educational infrastructure was still underprepared for online teaching, as smaller and more remote schools were particularly hindered by COVID-19 restrictions.

[ 292 ] The number of higher education institutions in Thailand has grown over the past decades to 156 officially. The two top-ranking universities in Thailand are Chulalongkorn University and Mahidol University .

[ 293 ] Thai universities' research output is still relatively low, even though the country's journal publications increased by 20% between 2011 and 2016.

[ 294 ] Thailand has the second highest number of English-medium private international schools in Southeast Asian Nations .

[ 295 ] Cram schools are especially popular for university entrance exams.

[ 296 ] Students in ethnic minority areas score consistently lower in standardised national and international tests.

[ 297 ] [ 298 ] [ 299 ] This is likely due to unequal allocation of educational resources, weak teacher training, poverty, and low Thai language skill, the language of the tests.

[ 297 ] [ 300 ] [ 301 ] As of 2020 [update] , Thailand was ranked 89th out of 100 countries globally for English proficiency.

[ 302 ] Thailand is the third most popular study destination in ASEAN. The number of international degree students in Thailand increased by 9.7 times between 1999 and 2012, from 1,882 to 20,309 students. Most of international students come from neighbor countries [ 295 ] like China, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam.

[ 303 ] Health Main articles: Health in Thailand , Healthcare in Thailand , and Hospitals in Thailand Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, the oldest and largest hospital in Thailand Thailand ranks world's sixth, and Asia's first in the 2019 Global Health Security Index of global health security capabilities in 195 countries, [ 304 ] making it the only developing country on the world's top ten. Thailand had 62 hospitals accredited by Joint Commission International .

[ 305 ] In 2002, Bumrungrad became the first hospital in Asia to meet the standard.

[ 306 ] Health and medical care is overseen by the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), with total national expenditures on health amounting to 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2009.

[ 310 ] Culture Main article: Culture of Thailand Thai women wearing sabai , Jim Thompson House Thai culture and traditions incorporate influences from India, China, Cambodia, and the rest of Southeast Asia. Thailand's national religion, Theravada Buddhism , is central to modern Thai identity .

Thai Buddhism has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from Hinduism , animism , as well as ancestor worship. The official calendar in Thailand is based on the Eastern version of the Buddhist Era (BE). Thai identity today is a social construct of the Phibun regime in the 1940s.

[ 311 ] [ 312 ] [ 313 ] Several ethnic groups mediated change between their traditional local culture, national Thai, and global cultural influences.

[ 315 ] Art Main article: Thai art Scene from the Ramakien depicted on a mural at Wat Phra Kaew The origins of Thai art were influenced by Buddhist art and by scenes from the Indian epics. Traditional Thai sculpture almost exclusively depicts images of the Buddha , being very similar with the other styles from Southeast Asia . Traditional Thai paintings usually consist of book illustrations, and painted ornamentation of buildings such as palaces and temples .

Thai art was influenced by indigenous civilisations of the Mon and other civilisations. By the Sukothai and Ayutthaya periods, Thai had developed into its own unique style and was later further influenced by the other Asian styles, mostly by Sri Lankan and Chinese . Thai sculpture and painting, and the royal courts provided patronage, erecting temples and other religious shrines as acts of merit or to commemorate important events.

[ 317 ] Traditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two dimensions without perspective . The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of composition is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century. Monk artist Khrua In Khong is well known as the first artist to introduce linear perspective to Thai traditional art.

[ 318 ] The most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the Jataka stories, episodes from the life of the Buddha , the Buddhist heavens and hells , themes derived from the Thai versions of the Ramayana and Mahabharata , and scenes of daily life. Some of the scenes are influenced by Thai folklore instead of following strict Buddhist iconography .

Lilit Yuan Phai is a narrative poem describing the war between King Borommatrailokkanat of Ayutthaya and Prince Tilokaraj of Lan Na . One literary work is Kap He Ruea , composed by Prince Thammathibet in the nirat tradition. Traditionally, the verse is sung during the royal barge procession [ 323 ] and has been the model for subsequent poets to emulate. The same prince also composed the greatly admired Kap Ho Khlong on the Visit to Than Thongdaeng and Kap Ho Khlong Nirat Phrabat .

[ 324 ] The Thonburi period produced Ramakien , a verse drama contributed by King Taksin the Great .

During the 18th century Rattanakosin period, which still fought with the Burmese, many of the early Rattanakosin works dealt with war and military strategy. Some examples are Nirat Rop Phama Thi Tha Din Daeng , Phleng Yao Rop Phama Thi Nakhon Si Thammarat . There were also verse recitals with musical accompaniment, such as Mahori telling the story of Kaki and Sepha , relating the story of Khun Chang Khun Phaen . Other recitals include Sri Thanonchai .
