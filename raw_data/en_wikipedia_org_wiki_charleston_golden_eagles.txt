The Golden Eagles compete as members of the Mountain East Conference for all varsity sports except men's volleyball. Charleston was a founding member of the Mountain East following the 2013 demise of the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference , of which Charleston had been a member since 1924. Prior to 1978, the university was called Morris Harvey College. Charleston's main rivals are the West Virginia State University Yellow Jackets .

History [ edit ] In June 2012, UC was one of nine members of the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) that announced their plans to leave to form a new Division II conference. Two months later, the new conference was unveiled as the MEC, with UC as one of 12 charter members.

[ 1 ] The school's newest sport is men's volleyball, which played its first season as a varsity program in spring 2015. Since men's volleyball has a combined national championship for Division I and Division II schools, UC competes as an effective Division I member in that sport; it spent its first season as an independent before joining the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association for the 2016 season and beyond.

[ 3 ] In 2005, UC entered into a partnership with the local school board to refurbish the school board–owned Laidley Field , which was renamed University of Charleston Stadium . The campus also boasts new or renovated softball, football, baseball, and soccer fields, and competes in 18 Division II sports.
