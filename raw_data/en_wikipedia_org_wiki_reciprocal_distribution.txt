It is characterised by its probability density function , within the support of the distribution, being proportional to the reciprocal of the variable.

The reciprocal distribution is an example of an inverse distribution , and the reciprocal (inverse) of a random variable with a reciprocal distribution itself has a reciprocal distribution.

Definition [ edit ] The probability density function (pdf) of the reciprocal distribution is f ( x ; a , b ) = 1 x [ ln ⁡ ⁡ ( b ) − − ln ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) ] for a ≤ ≤ x ≤ ≤ b and a > 0.

{\displaystyle f(x;a,b)={\frac {1}{x[\ln(b)-\ln(a)]}}\quad {\text{ for }}a\leq x\leq b{\text{ and }}a>0.} Here, a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are the parameters of the distribution, which are the lower and upper bounds of the support , and ln {\displaystyle \ln } is the natural log . The cumulative distribution function is F ( x ; a , b ) = ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) − − ln ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) ln ⁡ ⁡ ( b ) − − ln ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) for a ≤ ≤ x ≤ ≤ b .

{\displaystyle F(x;a,b)={\frac {\ln(x)-\ln(a)}{\ln(b)-\ln(a)}}\quad {\text{ for }}a\leq x\leq b.} Characterization [ edit ] Relationship between the log-uniform and the uniform distribution [ edit ] Histogram and log-histogram of random deviates from the reciprocal distribution A positive random variable X is log-uniformly distributed if the logarithm of X is uniform distributed, ln ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) ∼ ∼ U ( ln ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) , ln ⁡ ⁡ ( b ) ) .

{\displaystyle \ln(X)\sim {\mathcal {U}}(\ln(a),\ln(b)).} This relationship is true regardless of the base of the logarithmic or exponential function. If log a ⁡ ⁡ ( Y ) {\displaystyle \log _{a}(Y)} is uniform distributed, then so is log b ⁡ ⁡ ( Y ) {\displaystyle \log _{b}(Y)} , for any two positive numbers a , b ≠ ≠ 1 {\displaystyle a,b\neq 1} . Likewise, if e X {\displaystyle e^{X}} is log-uniform distributed, then so is a X {\displaystyle a^{X}} , where 0 < a ≠ ≠ 1 {\displaystyle 0<a\neq 1} .

Applications [ edit ] The reciprocal distribution is of considerable importance in numerical analysis , because a computer ’s arithmetic operations, in particular, repeated multiplications and/or divisions, transform mantissas with initial arbitrary distributions into the reciprocal distribution as a limiting distribution.
