Steele Prize Scientific career Institutions Steklov Institute of Mathematics Doctoral advisor Yuri Burago Sergei Vladimirovich Ivanov (Сергей Владимирович Иванов; born 31 May 1972) is a leading Russian mathematician working in differential geometry and mathematical physics.

Education and career [ edit ] For each of the three years, 1987, 1988, and 1989, Ivanov won a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad .

[ 1 ] He studied at the Saint Petersburg State University , where he received his Ph.D. ( Candidate of Sciences ) with advisor Yuri Burago .

[ 2 ] Ivanov has worked for many years at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics . There in 2009 he habilitated ( Doktor nauk ).

In 2014, he received, jointly with Yuri Burago and Dmitri Burago , the Leroy P. Steele Prize for their book A course in metric geometry published by the American Mathematical Society in 2001.

In addition to his research on differential geometry, Ivanov also works on informatics .

In 2010, in Hyderabad he was an invited speaker with talk Volume comparison via boundary distances at the International Congress of Mathematicians .

[ 3 ] In December 2011, he was elected a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences .
