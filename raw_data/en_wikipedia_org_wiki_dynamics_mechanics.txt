In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), **dynamics** or **classical dynamics**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)#cite_note-3) is the study of [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_(physics) "Force (physics)") and their effect on [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion "Motion"). It is a branch of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), along with _[statics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics "Statics")_ and _[kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics")_. The _fundamental principle of dynamics_ is linked to [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law "Newton's second law").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)#cite_note-z988-4)

Movement of each of the components of the Boulton & Watt Steam Engine (1784) can be described by a set of equations of kinematics and kinetics.

In the [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") science of dynamics, [rigid-body dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body_dynamics "Rigid body dynamics") studies the movement of [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system "Physical system") of interconnected [bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object "Physical object") under the action of external [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force"). The assumption that the bodies are _[rigid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid\_body "Rigid body")_ (i.e. they do not [deform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(physics) "Deformation (physics)") under the action of applied forces) simplifies analysis, by reducing the parameters that describe the configuration of the system to the translation and rotation of [reference frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference") attached to each body.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)#cite_note-6) This excludes bodies that display [fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid"), highly [elastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics) "Elasticity (physics)"), and [plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticity_(physics) "Plasticity (physics)") behavior.

The dynamics of a rigid body system is described by the laws of [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics") and by the application of Newton's second law ([kinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion")) or their derivative form, [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics"). The solution of these equations of motion provides a description of the position, the motion and the acceleration of the individual components of the system, and overall the system itself, as a [function of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-variant_system "Time-variant system"). The formulation and solution of rigid body dynamics is an important tool in the computer simulation of [mechanical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_system "Mechanical system").

Computer generated animation of fluid in a tube flowing past a cylinder, showing the [shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_shedding "Vortex shedding") of a series of [vortices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex "Vortex") in the flow behind it, called a [von Kármán vortex street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_vortex_street "Von Kármán vortex street"). The [streamlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamlines,_streaklines,_and_pathlines "Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines") show the direction of the fluid flow, and the color gradient shows the pressure at each point, from blue to green, yellow, and red indicating increasing pressure

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [physical chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry "Physical chemistry") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics") is a subdiscipline of [fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics "Fluid mechanics") that describes the flow of [fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid") – [liquids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid "Liquid") and [gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas"). It has several subdisciplines, including _[aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics")_ (the study of air and other gases in motion) and _hydrodynamics_ (the study of water and other liquids in motion). Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") and [moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(physics) "Moment (physics)") on [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft "Aircraft"), determining the [mass flow rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_flow_rate "Mass flow rate") of [petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum "Petroleum") through [pipelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport "Pipeline transport"), [predicting weather patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting "Weather forecasting"), understanding [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula") in [interstellar space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_space "Interstellar space"), understanding large scale [geophysical flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical_fluid_dynamics "Geophysical fluid dynamics") involving oceans/atmosphere and [modelling fission weapon detonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_design "Nuclear weapon design").

Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these [practical disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_disciplines "Practical disciplines")—that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from [flow measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_measurement "Flow measurement") and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves the calculation of various properties of the fluid, such as [flow velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_velocity "Flow velocity"), [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure"), [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density"), and [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"), as functions of space and time.

Before the twentieth century, "hydrodynamics" was synonymous with fluid dynamics. This is still reflected in names of some fluid dynamics topics, like [magnetohydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics "Magnetohydrodynamics") and [hydrodynamic stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodynamic_stability "Hydrodynamic stability"), both of which can also be applied to gases.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)#cite_note-7)
