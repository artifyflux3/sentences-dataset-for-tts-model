[ 1 ] V-statistics are closely related to U-statistics [ 2 ] [ 3 ] (U for " unbiased ") introduced by Wassily Hoeffding in 1948.

[ 4 ] A V-statistic is a statistical function (of a sample) defined by a particular statistical functional of a probability distribution.

Statistical functions [ edit ] Statistics that can be represented as functionals T ( F n ) {\displaystyle T(F_{n})} of the empirical distribution function ( F n ) {\displaystyle (F_{n})} are called statistical functionals .

[ 5 ] Differentiability of the functional T plays a key role in the von Mises approach; thus von Mises considers differentiable statistical functionals .

[ 1 ] Examples of statistical functions [ edit ] The k -th central moment is the functional T ( F ) = ∫ ∫ ( x − − μ μ ) k d F ( x ) {\displaystyle T(F)=\int (x-\mu )^{k}\,dF(x)} , where μ μ = E [ X ] {\displaystyle \mu =E[X]} is the expected value of X . The associated statistical function is the sample k -th central moment, T n = m k = T ( F n ) = 1 n ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ( x i − − x ¯ ¯ ) k .

{\displaystyle T_{n}=m_{k}=T(F_{n})={\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\overline {x}})^{k}.} The chi-squared goodness-of-fit statistic is a statistical function T ( F n ), corresponding to the statistical functional T ( F ) = ∑ ∑ i = 1 k ( ∫ ∫ A i d F − − p i ) 2 p i , {\displaystyle T(F)=\sum _{i=1}^{k}{\frac {(\int _{A_{i}}\,dF-p_{i})^{2}}{p_{i}}},} where A i are the k cells and p i are the specified probabilities of the cells under the null hypothesis.

The Cramér–von-Mises and Anderson–Darling goodness-of-fit statistics are based on the functional T ( F ) = ∫ ∫ ( F ( x ) − − F 0 ( x ) ) 2 w ( x ; F 0 ) d F 0 ( x ) , {\displaystyle T(F)=\int (F(x)-F_{0}(x))^{2}\,w(x;F_{0})\,dF_{0}(x),} where w ( x ; F 0 ) is a specified weight function and F 0 is a specified null distribution. If w is the identity function then T ( F n ) is the well known Cramér–von-Mises goodness-of-fit statistic; if w ( x ; F 0 ) = [ F 0 ( x ) ( 1 − − F 0 ( x ) ) ] − − 1 {\displaystyle w(x;F_{0})=[F_{0}(x)(1-F_{0}(x))]^{-1}} then T ( F n ) is the Anderson–Darling statistic.

Representation as a V-statistic [ edit ] Suppose x 1 , ..., x n is a sample. In typical applications the statistical function has a representation as the V-statistic V m n = 1 n m ∑ ∑ i 1 = 1 n ⋯ ⋯ ∑ ∑ i m = 1 n h ( x i 1 , x i 2 , … … , x i m ) , {\displaystyle V_{mn}={\frac {1}{n^{m}}}\sum _{i_{1}=1}^{n}\cdots \sum _{i_{m}=1}^{n}h(x_{i_{1}},x_{i_{2}},\dots ,x_{i_{m}}),} where h is a symmetric kernel function. Serfling [ 6 ] discusses how to find the kernel in practice.

V mn is called a V-statistic of degree m .

A symmetric kernel of degree 2 is a function h ( x , y ), such that h ( x , y ) = h ( y , x ) for all x and y in the domain of h. For samples x 1 , ..., x n , the corresponding V-statistic is defined V 2 , n = 1 n 2 ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∑ ∑ j = 1 n h ( x i , x j ) .

{\displaystyle V_{2,n}={\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}\sum _{j=1}^{n}h(x_{i},x_{j}).} Example of a V-statistic [ edit ] An example of a degree-2 V-statistic is the second central moment m 2 .

If h ( x , y ) = ( x − y ) 2 /2, the corresponding V-statistic is V 2 , n = 1 n 2 ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∑ ∑ j = 1 n 1 2 ( x i − − x j ) 2 = 1 n ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ( x i − − x ¯ ¯ ) 2 , {\displaystyle V_{2,n}={\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}\sum _{j=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{2}}(x_{i}-x_{j})^{2}={\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})^{2},} which is the maximum likelihood estimator of variance . With the same kernel, the corresponding U-statistic is the (unbiased) sample variance: s 2 = ( n 2 ) − − 1 ∑ ∑ i < j 1 2 ( x i − − x j ) 2 = 1 n − − 1 ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ( x i − − x ¯ ¯ ) 2 {\displaystyle s^{2}={n \choose 2}^{-1}\sum _{i<j}{\frac {1}{2}}(x_{i}-x_{j})^{2}={\frac {1}{n-1}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})^{2}} .

Asymptotic distribution [ edit ] In examples 1–3, the asymptotic distribution of the statistic is different: in (1) it is normal , in (2) it is chi-squared , and in (3) it is a weighted sum of chi-squared variables.

Von Mises' approach is a unifying theory that covers all of the cases above.

[ 1 ] Informally, the type of asymptotic distribution of a statistical function depends on the order of "degeneracy," which is determined by which term is the first non-vanishing term in the Taylor expansion of the functional T . In case it is the linear term, the limit distribution is normal; otherwise higher order types of distributions arise (under suitable conditions such that a central limit theorem holds).

There are a hierarchy of cases parallel to asymptotic theory of U-statistics .

[ 7 ] Let A ( m ) be the property defined by: A ( m ): Var( h ( X 1 , ..., X k )) = 0 for k < m , and Var( h ( X 1 , ..., X k )) > 0  for k = m ; n m /2 R mn tends to zero (in probability). ( R mn is the remainder term in the Taylor series for T .) Case m = 1 (Non-degenerate kernel): If A (1) is true, the statistic is a sample mean and the Central Limit Theorem implies that T(F n ) is asymptotically normal .

In the variance example (4), m 2 is asymptotically normal with mean σ σ 2 {\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}} and variance ( μ μ 4 − − σ σ 4 ) / n {\displaystyle (\mu _{4}-\sigma ^{4})/n} , where μ μ 4 = E ( X − − E ( X ) ) 4 {\displaystyle \mu _{4}=E(X-E(X))^{4}} .

Case m = 2 (Degenerate kernel): Suppose A (2) is true, and E [ h 2 ( X 1 , X 2 ) ] < ∞ ∞ , E | h ( X 1 , X 1 ) | < ∞ ∞ , {\displaystyle E[h^{2}(X_{1},X_{2})]<\infty ,\,E|h(X_{1},X_{1})|<\infty ,} and E [ h ( x , X 1 ) ] ≡ ≡ 0 {\displaystyle E[h(x,X_{1})]\equiv 0} . Then nV 2,n converges in distribution to a weighted sum of independent chi-squared variables: n V 2 , n ⟶ ⟶ d ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ λ λ k Z k 2 , {\displaystyle nV_{2,n}{\stackrel {d}{\longrightarrow }}\sum _{k=1}^{\infty }\lambda _{k}Z_{k}^{2},} where Z k {\displaystyle Z_{k}} are independent standard normal variables and λ λ k {\displaystyle \lambda _{k}} are constants that depend on the distribution F and the functional T . In this case the asymptotic distribution is called a quadratic form of centered Gaussian random variables . The statistic V 2, n is called a degenerate kernel V-statistic . The V-statistic associated with the Cramer–von Mises functional [ 1 ] (Example 3) is an example of a degenerate kernel V-statistic.
