[ 1 ] He led the first Cartel des Gauches . Under the Fourth Republic , he served as President of the National Assembly until 1954. A historian by occupation, Herriot was elected to the Académie Française 's eighth seat in 1946.

[ 2 ] He served as Mayor of Lyon for more than 45 years, from 1905 until his death, except for a brief period from 1940 to 1945, when he saw his movements variously restricted for opposing the Vichy regime .

Life [ edit ] Herriot was born at Troyes , France on 5 July 1872. As Mayor of Lyon , Herriot improved relations between municipal government and local unions, increased public assistance funds, and began an urban renewal programme, [ 3 ] amongst other measures. He died in Lyon on 26 March 1957.

[ 1 ] He went through a Deathbed conversion to Catholicism with Cardinal Pierre-Marie Gerlier , and was buried at the Loyasse Cemetery "with church ritual".

Herriot denied accounts of the famine and said that Soviet Ukraine was "like a garden in full bloom".

[ 5 ] Furthermore, he announced to the press that there was no famine in Ukraine, that he did not see any trace of hunger, and that the allegations of starving millions were being spread by adversaries of the Soviet Union.  "When one believes that the Ukraine is devastated by famine, allow me to shrug my shoulders", he declared.  The 13 September 1933 issue of Pravda was able to write that Herriot "categorically contradicted the lies of the bourgeoisie press in connection with a famine in the USSR."
