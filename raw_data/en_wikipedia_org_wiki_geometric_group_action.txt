Definition [ edit ] In geometric group theory, a geometry is any proper , geodesic metric space .  An action of a finitely-generated group G on a geometry X is geometric if it satisfies the following conditions: Each element of G acts as an isometry of X .

The action is cocompact , i.e. the quotient space X / G is a compact space .

The action is properly discontinuous , with each point having a finite stabilizer .

Uniqueness [ edit ] If a group G acts geometrically upon two geometries X and Y , then X and Y are quasi-isometric .  Since any group acts geometrically on its own Cayley graph , any space on which G acts geometrically is quasi-isometric to the Cayley graph of G .

Examples [ edit ] Cannon's conjecture states that any hyperbolic group with a 2-sphere at infinity acts geometrically on hyperbolic 3-space.
