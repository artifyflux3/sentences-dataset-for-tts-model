Contrary to its name, it is not a direct generalization of the Riemann mapping theorem , but instead a result concerning quasiconformal mappings and solutions of the Beltrami equation . The result was prefigured by earlier results of Charles Morrey from 1938 on quasi-linear elliptic partial differential equations .

The theorem of Ahlfors and Bers states that if μ is a bounded measurable function on C with ‖ ‖ μ μ ‖ ‖ ∞ ∞ < 1 {\displaystyle \|\mu \|_{\infty }<1} , then there is a
unique solution f of the Beltrami equation ∂ ∂ z ¯ ¯ f ( z ) = μ μ ( z ) ∂ ∂ z f ( z ) {\displaystyle \partial _{\overline {z}}f(z)=\mu (z)\partial _{z}f(z)} for which f is a quasiconformal homeomorphism of C fixing the points 0, 1 and ∞. A similar result is true with C replaced by the unit disk D . Their proof used the Beurling transform , a singular integral operator .
