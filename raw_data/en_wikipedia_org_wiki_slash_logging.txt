[ 1 ] Slash generated during logging operations may increase fire hazard, and some North American states have passed laws requiring the treatment of logging slash.

[ 2 ] Logging slash can be chipped and used (for example) in the production of electricity or heat in cogeneration power-plants, [ 3 ] or simply burned onsite.

[ 4 ] Where logging takes place on soft ground , loggers can use the branches and tops of trees as part of the timber-harvesting process to provide a track for forest machines .

[ 5 ] Using slash in this manner reduces ground damage.
