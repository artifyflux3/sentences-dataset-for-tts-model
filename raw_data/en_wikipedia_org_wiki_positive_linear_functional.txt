{\displaystyle f(v)\geq 0.} In other words, a positive linear functional is guaranteed to take nonnegative values for positive elements. The significance of positive linear functionals lies in results such as Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem .

When V {\displaystyle V} is a complex vector space, it is assumed that for all v ≥ ≥ 0 , {\displaystyle v\geq 0,} f ( v ) {\displaystyle f(v)} is real. As in the case when V {\displaystyle V} is a C*-algebra with its partially ordered subspace of self-adjoint elements, sometimes a partial order is placed on only a subspace W ⊆ ⊆ V , {\displaystyle W\subseteq V,} and the partial order does not extend to all of V , {\displaystyle V,} in which case the positive elements of V {\displaystyle V} are the positive elements of W , {\displaystyle W,} by abuse of notation. This implies that for a C*-algebra, a positive linear functional sends any x ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle x\in V} equal to s ∗ ∗ s {\displaystyle s^{\ast }s} for some s ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle s\in V} to a real number, which is equal to its complex conjugate, and therefore all positive linear functionals preserve the self-adjointness of such x .

{\displaystyle x.} This property is exploited in the GNS construction to relate positive linear functionals on a C*-algebra to inner products .

Sufficient conditions for continuity of all positive linear functionals [ edit ] There is a comparatively large class of ordered topological vector spaces on which every positive linear form is necessarily continuous.

[ 1 ] This includes all topological vector lattices that are sequentially complete .

[ 1 ] Theorem Let X {\displaystyle X} be an Ordered topological vector space with positive cone C ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle C\subseteq X} and let B ⊆ ⊆ P ( X ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}(X)} denote the family of all bounded subsets of X .

{\displaystyle X.} Then each of the following conditions is sufficient to guarantee that every positive linear functional on X {\displaystyle X} is continuous: C {\displaystyle C} has non-empty topological interior (in X {\displaystyle X} ).

[ 1 ] X {\displaystyle X} is complete and metrizable and X = C − − C .

{\displaystyle X=C-C.} [ 1 ] X {\displaystyle X} is bornological and C {\displaystyle C} is a semi-complete strict B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} -cone in X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 1 ] X {\displaystyle X} is the inductive limit of a family ( X α α ) α α ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle \left(X_{\alpha }\right)_{\alpha \in A}} of ordered Fréchet spaces with respect to a family of positive linear maps where X α α = C α α − − C α α {\displaystyle X_{\alpha }=C_{\alpha }-C_{\alpha }} for all α α ∈ ∈ A , {\displaystyle \alpha \in A,} where C α α {\displaystyle C_{\alpha }} is the positive cone of X α α .

{\displaystyle X_{\alpha }.} [ 1 ] Continuous positive extensions [ edit ] The following theorem is due to H. Bauer and independently, to Namioka.

[ 1 ] Theorem : [ 1 ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be an ordered topological vector space (TVS) with positive cone C , {\displaystyle C,} let M {\displaystyle M} be a vector subspace of E , {\displaystyle E,} and let f {\displaystyle f} be a linear form on M .

{\displaystyle M.} Then f {\displaystyle f} has an extension to a continuous positive linear form on X {\displaystyle X} if and only if there exists some convex neighborhood U {\displaystyle U} of 0 {\displaystyle 0} in X {\displaystyle X} such that Re ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} f} is bounded above on M ∩ ∩ ( U − − C ) .

{\displaystyle M\cap (U-C).} Corollary : [ 1 ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be an ordered topological vector space with positive cone C , {\displaystyle C,} let M {\displaystyle M} be a vector subspace of E .

{\displaystyle E.} If C ∩ ∩ M {\displaystyle C\cap M} contains an interior point of C {\displaystyle C} then every continuous positive linear form on M {\displaystyle M} has an extension to a continuous positive linear form on X .

{\displaystyle X.} Corollary : [ 1 ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be an ordered vector space with positive cone C , {\displaystyle C,} let M {\displaystyle M} be a vector subspace of E , {\displaystyle E,} and let f {\displaystyle f} be a linear form on M .

{\displaystyle M.} Then f {\displaystyle f} has an extension to a positive linear form on X {\displaystyle X} if and only if there exists some convex absorbing subset W {\displaystyle W} in X {\displaystyle X} containing the origin of X {\displaystyle X} such that Re ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} f} is bounded above on M ∩ ∩ ( W − − C ) .

{\displaystyle M\cap (W-C).} Proof: It suffices to endow X {\displaystyle X} with the finest locally convex topology making W {\displaystyle W} into a neighborhood of 0 ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle 0\in X.} Examples [ edit ] Consider, as an example of V , {\displaystyle V,} the C*-algebra of complex square matrices with the positive elements being the positive-definite matrices . The trace function defined on this C*-algebra is a positive functional, as the eigenvalues of any positive-definite matrix are positive, and so its trace is positive.

Consider the Riesz space C c ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {C} _{\mathrm {c} }(X)} of all continuous complex-valued functions of compact support on a locally compact Hausdorff space X .

{\displaystyle X.} Consider a Borel regular measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on X , {\displaystyle X,} and a functional ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } defined by ψ ψ ( f ) = ∫ ∫ X f ( x ) d μ μ ( x ) for all f ∈ ∈ C c ( X ) .

{\displaystyle \psi (f)=\int _{X}f(x)d\mu (x)\quad {\text{ for all }}f\in \mathrm {C} _{\mathrm {c} }(X).} Then, this functional is positive (the integral of any positive function is a positive number). Moreover, any positive functional on this space has this form, as follows from the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem .

Positive linear functionals (C*-algebras) [ edit ] Let M {\displaystyle M} be a C*-algebra (more generally, an operator system in a C*-algebra A {\displaystyle A} ) with identity 1.

{\displaystyle 1.} Let M + {\displaystyle M^{+}} denote the set of positive elements in M .

{\displaystyle M.} A linear functional ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } on M {\displaystyle M} is said to be positive if ρ ρ ( a ) ≥ ≥ 0 , {\displaystyle \rho (a)\geq 0,} for all a ∈ ∈ M + .

{\displaystyle a\in M^{+}.} Theorem.

A linear functional ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } on M {\displaystyle M} is positive if and only if ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is bounded and ‖ ‖ ρ ρ ‖ ‖ = ρ ρ ( 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \|\rho \|=\rho (1).} [ 2 ] Cauchy–Schwarz inequality [ edit ] If ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is a positive linear functional on a C*-algebra A , {\displaystyle A,} then one may define a semidefinite sesquilinear form on A {\displaystyle A} by ⟨ ⟨ a , b ⟩ ⟩ = ρ ρ ( b ∗ ∗ a ) .

{\displaystyle \langle a,b\rangle =\rho (b^{\ast }a).} Thus from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality we have | ρ ρ ( b ∗ ∗ a ) | 2 ≤ ≤ ρ ρ ( a ∗ ∗ a ) ⋅ ⋅ ρ ρ ( b ∗ ∗ b ) .

{\displaystyle \left|\rho (b^{\ast }a)\right|^{2}\leq \rho (a^{\ast }a)\cdot \rho (b^{\ast }b).} Applications to economics [ edit ] Given a space C {\displaystyle C} , a price system can be viewed as a continuous, positive, linear functional on C {\displaystyle C} .
