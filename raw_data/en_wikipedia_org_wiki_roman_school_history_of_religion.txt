In the history of religions , the Roman School is a methodology that emerged after World War II and was prominent in Italy throughout the 1950s. It was a competitor to the French structuralist approach.

One of its main characteristics was the ambition to study religion from a neutral or politically aloof perspective. It began with Raffaele Pettazzoni , who had been one of the first academics to propose a historical approach to the study of religion. One of its most influential contributors was Angelo Brelich , whose works on rituals and initiation have had a lasting impact. Other prominent disciples of the Roman School include Dario Sabbatucci and Giulia Piccaluga .

[ 1 ] The school and its body of work have been examined by later scholars including Giampiera Arrigoni [ 2 ] and Marcello Massenzio .
