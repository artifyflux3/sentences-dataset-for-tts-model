Headquarters Manchester , UK Region served Manchester Greater Manchester Membership 400 Official language English Activities Research Publications Lectures Events Collections Library Archives President (98th) Peter Wright Website www.manliphil.ac.uk The Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society , popularly known as the Lit. & Phil.

, is one of the oldest learned societies in the United Kingdom and second oldest provincial learned society (after the Spalding Gentlemen's Society ).

Prominent members have included Robert Owen , [ 1 ] John Dalton , James Prescott Joule , Sir William Fairbairn , Tom Kilburn , Peter Mark Roget , Sir Ernest Rutherford , Alan Turing , Sir Joseph Whitworth and Dorothy Hodgkin .

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] Dorothy Hodgkin, Dalton Medallist John Dalton by Thomas Phillips , National Portrait Gallery, London (1835) It was established in February 1781, as the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, [ 3 ] by Thomas Percival , Thomas Barnes , Thomas Henry , Thomas Butterworth Bayley and others.

[ 4 ] The first formal meeting of the society took place on 14 March 1781. Meetings were held in a back room of Cross Street Chapel until December 1799, after which the society moved into its own premises in George Street.

[ 5 ] John Dalton conducted his experiments at these premises.

The Society's original premises on George Street were destroyed during the Manchester Blitz (around January 1941), at which time its library comprised more than 50,000 volumes as well as historic artefacts, portraits, and archives.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Its replacement (built in the 1960s) was constructed using high alumina cement (referred to as having "concrete cancer") and was demolished in the 1980s. It became a registered charity (No. 235313) in 1964.

[ 8 ] Membership is open to anyone aged over 16 years and lectures are held both in person at venues in Manchester City Centre, and (since 2020) online.  There are on average 30 lectures each season and non-members are welcome to attend. The society has more than 400 members.

[ 8 ] The Society can be contacted via their website.

Activities [ edit ] The Society organises a range of lectures, including the Wilde , Joule and Dalton Lectures and three lectures annually specifically for Young People. The most prestigious lectures are the Percival Lecture and the Manchester Lecture, and in some years the most distinguished speakers are presented with the Dalton Medal . Since the local universities ceased offering extra-curricular courses the Lit. & Phil. has seen an increase in both membership and in the attendance of non-members at lectures.

[ 9 ] Members [ edit ] Notable Members, in addition to those above, have included the Nobel Laureates , Sir Robert Robinson , Sir Norman Haworth , and Niels Bohr , as well as Chaim Weizmann , Hans Geiger , Sir William Roberts , Lyon, Lord Playfair , William Gaskell , Sir William de Wiveleslie Abney , Charles William Sutton , Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth , Joseph Jordan , Henry Moseley , Sir Adolphus William Ward , Stanley Jevons , James Prince Lee , Sir Edward Leader Williams , William Axon , Sir Henry Hoyle Howorth , Samuel Greg , Sir Edward Frankland , Samuel Hibbert-Ware and Moses Tyson .

Honorary Members have included Stephen Hawking , William Thomson, Lord Kelvin , Robert Bunsen , Sergey Kapitsa , Dmitri Mendeleev , Sir Cyril Hinshelwood , Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw , Jöns Jacob Berzelius and John Mercer .

[ 10 ] The Manchester Memoirs has been published continuously since the first edition.

It contains the transactions of the society (most notably the text of many recent lectures) and is distributed to members and to similar institutions and libraries throughout the world by subscription. Copies are also available for purchase by non-members.

[ 11 ] Dalton Medal [ edit ] Named in honour of the Society's longest-serving President, the scientist John Dalton , the Dalton Medal is a distinction rarely bestowed and is the Society’s highest award. It is given to those who have made a distinguished contribution to science.

Since 1898 the medal has been awarded on only fifteen occasions: all recipients have been Fellows of the Royal Society and many have been Nobel Laureates .

Several medallists have had Manchester and University of Manchester /Owens College connections with the Departments of Physics and Astronomy , Chemistry and Engineering .

So far, only one woman has been a recipient of this medal.
