In other words, the set itself is finite, and all of its elements are finite sets, recursively all the way down to the empty set .

Formal definition [ edit ] A recursive definition of well-founded hereditarily finite sets is as follows: Base case : The empty set is a hereditarily finite set.

Recursion rule : If a 1 , … … a k {\displaystyle a_{1},\dots a_{k}} are hereditarily finite, then so is { a 1 , … … a k } {\displaystyle \{a_{1},\dots a_{k}\}} .

Only sets that can be built by a finite number of applications of these two rules are hereditarily finite.

Representation [ edit ] This class of sets is naturally ranked by the number of bracket pairs necessary to represent the sets: { } {\displaystyle \{\}} (i.e.

∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } , the Neumann ordinal "0") { { } } {\displaystyle \{\{\}\}} (i.e.

{ ∅ ∅ } {\displaystyle \{\emptyset \}} or { 0 } {\displaystyle \{0\}} , the Neumann ordinal "1") { { { } } } {\displaystyle \{\{\{\}\}\}} { { { { } } } } {\displaystyle \{\{\{\{\}\}\}\}} and then also { { } , { { } } } {\displaystyle \{\{\},\{\{\}\}\}} (i.e.

{ 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle \{0,1\}} , the Neumann ordinal "2"), { { { { { } } } } } {\displaystyle \{\{\{\{\{\}\}\}\}\}} , { { { } , { { } } } } {\displaystyle \{\{\{\},\{\{\}\}\}\}} as well as { { } , { { { } } } } {\displaystyle \{\{\},\{\{\{\}\}\}\}} , ... sets represented with 6 {\displaystyle 6} bracket pairs, e.g.

{ { { { { { } } } } } } {\displaystyle \{\{\{\{\{\{\}\}\}\}\}\}} . There are six such sets ... sets represented with 7 {\displaystyle 7} bracket pairs, e.g.

{ { { { { { { } } } } } } } {\displaystyle \{\{\{\{\{\{\{\}\}\}\}\}\}\}} . There are twelve such sets ... sets represented with 8 {\displaystyle 8} bracket pairs, e.g.

{ { { { { { { { } } } } } } } } {\displaystyle \{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}} or { { } , { { } } , { { } , { { } } } } {\displaystyle \{\{\},\{\{\}\},\{\{\},\{\{\}\}\}\}} (i.e.

{ 0 , 1 , 2 } {\displaystyle \{0,1,2\}} , the Neumann ordinal "3") ... etc.

In this way, the number of sets with n {\displaystyle n} bracket pairs is [ 1 ] 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 25, 52, 113, 247, 548, 1226, 2770, 6299, 14426, ...

Discussion [ edit ] The set { { } , { { { } } } } {\displaystyle \{\{\},\{\{\{\}\}\}\}} is an example for such a hereditarily finite set and so is the empty set { } {\displaystyle \{\}} , as noted. 
On the other hand, the sets { 7 , N , π π } {\displaystyle \{7,{\mathbb {N} },\pi \}} or { 3 , { N } } {\displaystyle \{3,\{{\mathbb {N} }\}\}} are examples of finite sets that are not hereditarily finite. For example, the first cannot be hereditarily finite since it contains at least one infinite set as an element, when N = { 0 , 1 , 2 , … … } {\displaystyle {\mathbb {N} }=\{0,1,2,\dots \}} .

The class of all hereditarily finite sets is denoted by H ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle H_{\aleph _{0}}} , meaning that the cardinality of each member is smaller than ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}} . (Analogously, the class of hereditarily countable sets is denoted by H ℵ ℵ 1 {\displaystyle H_{\aleph _{1}}} .)
It can also be denoted by V ω ω {\displaystyle V_{\omega }} , which denotes the ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } th stage of the von Neumann universe .

[ 2 ] H ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle H_{\aleph _{0}}} is in bijective correspondence with ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}} .
A theory which proves it to be a set also proves it to be countable .

Models [ edit ] Ackermann coding [ edit ] In 1937, Wilhelm Ackermann introduced an encoding of hereditarily finite sets as natural numbers.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] It is defined by a function f : : H ℵ ℵ 0 → → ω ω {\displaystyle f\colon H_{\aleph _{0}}\to \omega } that maps each hereditarily finite set to a natural number, given by the following recursive definition: f ( a ) = ∑ ∑ b ∈ ∈ a 2 f ( b ) {\displaystyle \displaystyle f(a)=\sum _{b\in a}2^{f(b)}} For example, the empty set { } {\displaystyle \{\}} contains no members, and is therefore mapped to an empty sum , that is, the number zero . On the other hand, a set with distinct members a , b , c , … … {\displaystyle a,b,c,\dots } is mapped to 2 f ( a ) + 2 f ( b ) + 2 f ( c ) + … … {\displaystyle 2^{f(a)}+2^{f(b)}+2^{f(c)}+\ldots } .

The inverse is given by f − − 1 : : ω ω → → H ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle \displaystyle f^{-1}\colon \omega \to H_{\aleph _{0}}} f − − 1 ( i ) = { f − − 1 ( j ) ∣ ∣ BIT ( i , j ) = 1 } {\displaystyle \displaystyle f^{-1}(i)=\{f^{-1}(j)\mid {\text{BIT}}(i,j)=1\}} where BIT denotes the BIT predicate .

The Ackermann coding can be used to construct a model of finitary set theory in the natural numbers. More precisely, ( N , BIT ⊤ ⊤ ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {N} ,{\text{BIT}}^{\top })} (where BIT ⊤ ⊤ {\displaystyle {\text{BIT}}^{\top }} is the converse relation of BIT {\displaystyle {\text{BIT}}} , swapping its two arguments) models Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ZF without the axiom of infinity . Here, each natural number models a set, and the BIT {\displaystyle {\text{BIT}}} relation models the membership relation between sets.

Graph models [ edit ] The class H ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle H_{\aleph _{0}}} can be seen to be in exact correspondence with a class of rooted trees , namely those without non-trivial symmetries (i.e. the only automorphism is the identity): 
The root vertex corresponds to the top level bracket { … … } {\displaystyle \{\dots \}} and each edge leads to an element (another such set) that can act as a root vertex in its own right. No automorphism of this graph exist, corresponding to the fact that equal branches are identified (e.g.

{ t , t , s } = { t , s } {\displaystyle \{t,t,s\}=\{t,s\}} , trivializing the permutation of the two subgraphs of shape t {\displaystyle t} ).
This graph model enables an implementation of ZF without infinity as data types and thus an interpretation of set theory in expressive type theories .

Graph models exist for ZF and also set theories different from Zermelo set theory, such as non-well founded theories. Such models have more intricate edge structure.

In graph theory , the graph whose vertices correspond to hereditarily finite sets and edges correspond to set membership is the Rado graph or random graph.

Axiomatizations [ edit ] Theories of finite sets [ edit ] In the common axiomatic set theory approaches, the empty set { } {\displaystyle \{\}} also represents the first von Neumann ordinal number , denoted 0 {\displaystyle 0} . All finite von Neumann ordinals are indeed hereditarily finite and, thus, so is the class of sets representing the natural numbers. In other words, H ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle H_{\aleph _{0}}} includes each element in the standard model of natural numbers and so a set theory expressing H ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle H_{\aleph _{0}}} must necessarily contain them as well.

Now note that Robinson arithmetic can already be interpreted in ST , the very small sub-theory of Zermelo set theory Z − with its axioms given by Extensionality , Empty Set and Adjunction . All of H ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle H_{\aleph _{0}}} has a constructive axiomatization involving these axioms and e.g.

Set induction and Replacement .

Axiomatically characterizing the theory of hereditarily finite sets, the negation of the axiom of infinity may be added. As the theory validates the other axioms of Z F {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZF}}} , this establishes that the axiom of infinity is not a consequence of these other Z F {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZF}}} axioms.

ZF [ edit ] V 4 {\displaystyle ~V_{4}~} represented with circles in place of curly brackets The hereditarily finite sets are a subclass of the Von Neumann universe . Here, the class of all well-founded hereditarily finite sets is denoted V ω ω {\displaystyle V_{\omega }} . Note that this is also a set in this context.

If we denote by ℘ ℘ ( S ) {\displaystyle \wp (S)} the power set of S {\displaystyle S} , and by V 0 {\displaystyle V_{0}} the empty set, then V ω ω {\displaystyle V_{\omega }} can be obtained by setting V i + 1 = ℘ ℘ ( V i ) {\displaystyle V_{i+1}=\wp (V_{i})} for each integer i ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle i\geq 0} . Thus, V ω ω {\displaystyle V_{\omega }} can be expressed as V ω ω = ⋃ ⋃ k = 0 ∞ ∞ V k {\displaystyle \displaystyle V_{\omega }=\bigcup _{k=0}^{\infty }V_{k}} and all its elements are finite.

This formulation shows, again, that there are only countably many hereditarily finite sets: V n {\displaystyle V_{n}} is finite for any finite n {\displaystyle n} , its cardinality is 2 ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ( n − − 1 ) {\displaystyle 2\uparrow \uparrow (n-1)} in Knuth's up-arrow notation (a tower of n − − 1 {\displaystyle n-1} powers of two), and the union of countably many finite sets is countable.

Equivalently, a set is hereditarily finite if and only if its transitive closure is finite.

The set of all (well-founded) hereditarily finite sets (which is infinite, and not hereditarily finite itself) is written V ω ω {\displaystyle V_{\omega }} to show its place in the von Neumann hierarchy of pure sets.
