In the Matsubara formalism , the basic idea (due to Felix Bloch [ 1 ] ) is that the expectation values of operators in a canonical ensemble ⟨ ⟨ A ⟩ ⟩ = Tr [ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − β β H ) A ] Tr [ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − β β H ) ] {\displaystyle \langle A\rangle ={\frac {{\mbox{Tr}}\,[\exp(-\beta H)A]}{{\mbox{Tr}}\,[\exp(-\beta H)]}}} may be written as expectation values in ordinary quantum field theory [ 2 ] where the configuration is evolved by an imaginary time τ τ = i t ( 0 ≤ ≤ τ τ ≤ ≤ β β ) {\displaystyle \tau =it(0\leq \tau \leq \beta )} . One can therefore switch to a spacetime with Euclidean signature , where the above trace (Tr) leads to the requirement that all bosonic and fermionic fields be periodic and antiperiodic, respectively, with respect to the Euclidean time direction with periodicity β β = 1 / ( k T ) {\displaystyle \beta =1/(kT)} (we are assuming natural units ℏ ℏ = 1 {\displaystyle \hbar =1} ). This allows one to perform calculations with the same tools as in ordinary quantum field theory, such as functional integrals and Feynman diagrams , but with compact Euclidean time. Note that the definition of normal ordering has to be altered.

[ 3 ] In momentum space , this leads to the replacement of continuous frequencies by discrete imaginary (Matsubara) frequencies v n = n / β β {\displaystyle v_{n}=n/\beta } and, through the de Broglie relation , to a discretized thermal energy spectrum E n = 2 n π π k T {\displaystyle E_{n}=2n\pi kT} . This has been shown to be a useful tool in studying the behavior of quantum field theories at finite temperature.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] It has been generalized to theories with gauge invariance and was a central tool in the study of a conjectured deconfining phase transition of Yang–Mills theory .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] In this Euclidean field theory, real-time observables can be retrieved by analytic continuation .

[ 10 ] The Feynman rules for gauge theories in the Euclidean time formalism, were derived by C. W. Bernard.

[ 8 ] The Matsubara formalism, also referred to as imaginary time formalism, can be extended to systems with thermal variations.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] In this approach, the variation in the temperature is recast as a variation in the Euclidean metric. Analysis of the partition function leads to an equivalence between thermal variations and the curvature of the Euclidean space .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The alternative to the use of fictitious imaginary times is to use a real-time formalism which come in two forms.

[ 13 ] A path-ordered approach to real-time formalisms includes the Schwinger–Keldysh formalism and more modern variants.

[ 14 ] The latter involves replacing a straight time contour from (large negative) real initial time t i {\displaystyle t_{i}} to t i − − i β β {\displaystyle t_{i}-i\beta } by one that first runs to (large positive) real time t f {\displaystyle t_{f}} and then suitably back to t i − − i β β {\displaystyle t_{i}-i\beta } .

[ 15 ] In fact all that is needed is one section running along the real time axis, as the route to the end point, t i − − i β β {\displaystyle t_{i}-i\beta } , is less important.

[ 16 ] The piecewise composition of the resulting complex time contour leads to a doubling of fields and more complicated Feynman rules, but obviates the need of analytic continuations of the imaginary-time formalism. The alternative approach to real-time formalisms is an operator based approach using Bogoliubov transformations , known as thermo field dynamics .

[ 13 ] [ 17 ] As well as Feynman diagrams and perturbation theory, other techniques such as dispersion relations and the finite temperature analog of Cutkosky rules can also be used in the real time formulation.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] An alternative approach which is of interest to mathematical physics is to work with KMS states .
