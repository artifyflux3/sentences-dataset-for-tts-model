Hydrogen technologies are applicable for many uses.

Some hydrogen technologies are carbon neutral and could have a role in preventing climate change and a possible future hydrogen economy . Hydrogen is a chemical widely used in various applications including ammonia production, oil refining and energy.

[ 1 ] The most common methods for producing hydrogen on an industrial scale are: Steam reforming , oil reforming , coal gasification , water electrolysis .

[ 2 ] Hydrogen is not a primary energy source , because it is not naturally occurring as a fuel .  It is, however, widely regarded as an ideal energy storage medium, due to the ease with which electricity can convert water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis and can be converted back to electrical power using a fuel cell or hydrogen turbine.

[ 3 ] There are a wide number of different types of fuel and electrolysis cells.

[ 4 ] The potential environmental impact depends primarily on the methods used to generate hydrogen as a fuel.
