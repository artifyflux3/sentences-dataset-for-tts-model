c.

87 BC ) was a Peripatetic philosopher [ 1 ] who lived in the 1st century BC. According to Philodemus , he was a pupil of Antiochus of Ascalon (or possibly his brother Aristus ).

[ 2 ] Strabo , a later contemporary, relates a story [ 3 ] where both Ariston and Eudorus , a contemporary of his, had claimed to have written a work on the Nile River , but that the two works were so nearly identical that the authors charged each other with plagiarism .

[ 4 ] Who was right is not said, though Strabo seems to be inclined to think that Eudorus was the guilty party.
