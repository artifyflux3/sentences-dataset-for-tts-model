A child bites into a watermelon , experiencing mouthfeel sensations such as juiciness Mouthfeel refers to the physical sensations in the mouth caused by food or drink , making it distinct from taste . It is a fundamental sensory attribute which, along with taste and smell , determines the overall flavor of a food item.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Mouthfeel is also sometimes referred to as texture .

[ 2 ] It is used in many areas related to the testing and evaluating of foodstuffs, such as wine-tasting and food rheology .

[ 3 ] It is evaluated from initial perception on the palate to first bite , through chewing to swallowing and aftertaste . In wine-tasting, for example, mouthfeel is usually used with a modifier (big, sweet, tannic, chewy, etc.) to the general sensation of the wine in the mouth.

[ 4 ] Research indicates texture and mouthfeel can also influence satiety with the effect of viscosity most significant.

[ 5 ] Mouthfeel is often related to a product's water activity —hard or crisp products having lower water activities and soft products having intermediate to high water activities.

Graininess: The degree to which a sample contains small grainy particles Gumminess : The energy required to disintegrate a semi-solid food to a state ready for swallowing Hardness: The force required to deform the product to a given distance, i.e., force to compress between molars, bite through with incisors, compress between tongue and palate Heaviness: The weight of product perceived when first placed on tongue Juiciness Moisture absorption: The amount of saliva absorbed by product Moisture release: The amount of wetness/juiciness released from sample Mouthcoating: The type and degree of coating in the mouth after mastication (for example, fat / oil ) [ 8 ] Roughness: The degree of abrasiveness of product's surface perceived by the tongue Slipperiness: The degree to which the product slides over the tongue Smoothness: The absence of any particles, lumps, bumps, etc., in the product Tenderness : The opposite of hardness; ease of chewing Uniformity: The degree to which the sample is even throughout or the homogeneity of the sample Uniformity of bite: The evenness of force throughout the bite Uniformity of chew: The degree to which the chewing characteristics of the product are even throughout mastication Viscosity : The force required to draw a liquid from a spoon over the tongue Wetness: The amount of moisture perceived on product's surface See also [ edit ] Food Psychorheology Umami Wine tasting Q. texture References [ edit ] ^ Mouritsen, Ole G.; Styrbæk, Klavs (2017).
