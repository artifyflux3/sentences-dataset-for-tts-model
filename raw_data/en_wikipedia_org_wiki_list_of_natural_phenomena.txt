A natural phenomenon is an observable event which is not man-made. Examples include: sunrise , weather , fog , thunder , tornadoes ; biological processes , decomposition , germination ; physical processes , wave propagation , erosion ; tidal flow , and natural disasters such as electromagnetic pulses , volcanic eruptions , hurricanes and earthquakes .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] History [ edit ] Over many intervals of time, natural phenomena have been observed by a series of countless events as a feature created by nature.

Physical phenomena [ edit ] The act of: Freezing Boiling Gravity Magnetism Gallery [ edit ] Crystal in VCGS furnace Liquid hydrogen bubble chamber photograph of an anti-proton colliding with a proton Children notice an effect of static electricity Chemical phenomena [ edit ] Oxidation Fire Rusting Biological phenomena [ edit ] Metabolism Catabolism Anabolism Decomposition – by which organic substances are broken down into a much simpler form of matter Fermentation – converts sugar to acids, gases and/or alcohol .

Growth Birth Death Population decrease Gallery [ edit ] Decomposition :a decaying peach over a period of six days. Each frame is approximately 12 hours apart, as the fruit shrivels and becomes covered with mold .

The temperature can be discerned from the color of the blackbody .

Meteorological phenomena [ edit ] See also: Atmospheric phenomenon , Glossary of meteorology , and List of severe weather phenomena Violent meteorological phenomena are called storms . Regular, cyclical phenomena include seasons and atmospheric circulation .

climate change is often semi-regular.
