Work [ edit ] Zwiebach was born in Peru to a Jewish family and studied electrical engineering at the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería in Peru, graduating in 1977.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He subsequently attended graduate school in physics at the California Institute of Technology . He obtained his Ph.D. in 1983, working under the supervision of Murray Gell-Mann . He then held postdoctoral positions at the University of California, Berkeley , and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At MIT, he became an assistant professor of physics in 1987, and a permanent member of the faculty in 1994.

[ 3 ] He is one of the world's leading experts in string field theory . He wrote the textbook A First Course in String Theory (2004, ISBN 0-521-83143-1 ), meant for undergraduates.
