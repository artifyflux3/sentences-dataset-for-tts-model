Sunlight shining through clouds , giving rise to crepuscular rays over Lake Hāwea , New Zealand Crepuscular rays , sometimes colloquially referred to as god rays , are sunbeams that originate when the Sun appears to be just above or below a layer of clouds, during the twilight period.

[ 1 ] Crepuscular rays are noticeable when the contrast between light and dark is most obvious. Crepuscular comes from the Latin word crepusculum , meaning "twilight".

[ 2 ] Crepuscular rays usually appear orange because the path through the atmosphere at dawn and dusk passes through up to 40 times as much air as rays from a high Sun at noon .

Particles in the air scatter short- wavelength light (blue and green) through Rayleigh scattering much more strongly than longer-wavelength yellow and red light.

Crepuscular rays appear as divergent beams emanating from a distant source, inspite of the rays from the Sun being parallel when they arrive, because of perspective . The point from which the divergent rays appear to emerge from is really a vanishing point for parallel rays of sunlight.

[ 3 ] Loosely, the term crepuscular rays is sometimes extended to the general phenomenon of rays of sunlight that appear to converge at a point in the sky, irrespective of time of day.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] A rare related phenomenon are anticrepuscular rays which can appear at the same time (and coloration) as crepuscular rays but in the opposite direction of the setting sun (east rather than west).
