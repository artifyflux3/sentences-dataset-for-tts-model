Scholastic provides book fair products to schools, which then conduct the book fairs. Schools can elect to receive books, supplies and equipment or a portion of the proceeds from the book fair.

[ 37 ] In the United States, during fiscal 2024, revenue from the book fairs channel ($541.6 million) accounted for more than half of the company's revenue in the "Total Children's Book Publishing and Distribution" segment ($955.2 million), [ 38 ] and schools earned over $200 million in proceeds in cash and incentive credits.

[ 39 ] In October 2023, Scholastic created a separate category for books dealing with "race, LGBTQ and other issues related to diversity", allowing schools to opt out of carrying these types of books. Scholastic defended the move, citing legislation in multiple states seeking to ban books dealing with LGBTQ issues or race .

[ 40 ] After public backlash from educators, authors, and free speech advocacy groups, Scholastic reversed course, saying the new category will be discontinued, writing: "It is unsettling that the current divisive landscape in the U.S. is creating an environment that could deny any child access to books, or that teachers could be penalized for creating access to all stories for their students".

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] Scholastic Book Fairs have been criticized for spurring unnecessary purchases, highlighting economic inequality among students, and disruption of school activities and facilities.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] Book clubs [ edit ] Scholastic book clubs are offered at schools in many countries. Typically, teachers administer the program to the students in their own classes, but in some cases, the program is administered by a central contact for the entire school. Within Scholastic, Reading Clubs is a separate unit (compared to, e.g., Education). Reading clubs are arranged by age/grade.

[ 45 ] Book club operators receive "Classroom Funds" redeemable only for Scholastic Corporation products.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] 2025 data breach [ edit ] In January 2025, claims of a data breach affecting Scholastic came from a " furry " hacker identified as "Parasocial." [ 49 ] The breach affected an estimated 8 million customers consisting of names, email addresses, phone numbers, and home addresses. The breach was provided to Have I Been Pwned?

in an effort to inform customers.
