Rostam Gorgani was the court physician of two of the rulers of the Deccan sultanates , Malik Ahmad Shah I (1490–1510) and Burhan Shah I (1510–1553), in the city of Ahmadnagar in the Deccan Plateau , India . His name indicates he was from Gorgan , Golestan , Iran .

He composed several medical treatises in Persian , the most extensive being the Zakhirai-Nizamshahi (Supplies of Nizamshah), his encyclopaedia of material medica which he compiled at the request of Sultan Nizam-Shah and named after him. Only two copies survive, one at the Manuscript Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan , and the other at the National Library of Medicine of the United States .
