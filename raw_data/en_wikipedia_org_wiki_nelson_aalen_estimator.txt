[ 1 ] It is used in survival theory , reliability engineering and life insurance to estimate the cumulative number of expected events. An "event" can be the failure of a non-repairable component, the death of a human being, or any occurrence for which the experimental unit remains in the "failed" state (e.g., death) from the point at which it changed on. The estimator is given by H ~ ~ ( t ) = ∑ ∑ t i ≤ ≤ t d i n i , {\displaystyle {\tilde {H}}(t)=\sum _{t_{i}\leq t}{\frac {d_{i}}{n_{i}}},} with d i {\displaystyle d_{i}} the number of events at time t i {\displaystyle t_{i}} and n i {\displaystyle n_{i}} the total individuals at risk at t i {\displaystyle t_{i}} .

[ 2 ] The curvature of the Nelson–Aalen estimator gives an idea of the hazard rate shape. A concave shape is an indicator for infant mortality while a convex shape indicates wear out mortality .

It can be used for example when testing the homogeneity of Poisson processes .

[ 3 ] It was constructed by Wayne Nelson and Odd Aalen .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The Nelson-Aalen estimator is directly related to the Kaplan-Meier estimator and both maximize the empirical likelihood .
