( October 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , a projection is a mapping from a set to itself—or an endomorphism of a mathematical structure —that is idempotent , that is, equals its composition with itself. The image of a point or a subset ⁠ S {\displaystyle S} ⁠ under a projection is called the projection of ⁠ S {\displaystyle S} ⁠ .

An everyday example of a projection is the casting of shadows onto a plane (sheet of paper): the projection of a point is its shadow on the sheet of paper, and the projection (shadow) of a point on the sheet of paper is that point itself (idempotency). The shadow of a three-dimensional sphere is a disk.  Originally, the notion of projection was introduced in Euclidean geometry to denote the projection of the three-dimensional Euclidean space onto a plane in it, like the shadow example. The two main projections of this kind are: The projection from a point onto a plane or central projection : If C is a point, called the center of projection , then the projection of a point P different from C onto a plane that does not contain C is the intersection of the line CP with the plane. The points P such that the line CP is parallel to the plane does not have any image by the projection, but one often says that they project to a point at infinity of the plane (see Projective geometry for a formalization of this terminology). The projection of the point C itself is not defined.

The projection parallel to a direction D , onto a plane or parallel projection : The image of a point P is the intersection of the plane with the line parallel to D passing through P . See Affine space § Projection for an accurate definition, generalized to any dimension.

[ citation needed ] The concept of projection in mathematics is a very old one, and most likely has its roots in the phenomenon of the shadows cast by real-world objects on the ground. This rudimentary idea was refined and abstracted, first in a geometric context and later in other branches of mathematics. Over time different versions of the concept developed, but today, in a sufficiently abstract setting, we can unify these variations.

[ citation needed ] In cartography , a map projection is a map of a part of the surface of the Earth onto a plane, which, in some cases, but not always, is the restriction of a projection in the above meaning. The 3D projections are also at the basis of the theory of perspective .

[ citation needed ] The need for unifying the two kinds of projections and of defining the image by a central projection of any point different of the center of projection are at the origin of projective geometry .

Definition [ edit ] The commutativity of this diagram is the universality of the projection π , for any map f and set X .

Generally, a mapping where the domain and codomain are the same set (or mathematical structure ) is a projection if the mapping is idempotent , which means that a projection is equal to its composition with itself. A projection may also refer to a mapping which has a right inverse . Both notions are strongly related, as follows. Let p be an idempotent mapping from a set A into itself (thus p ∘ p = p ) and B = p ( A ) be the image of p . If we denote by π the map p viewed as a map from A onto B and by i the injection of B into A (so that p = i ∘ π ), then we have π ∘ i = Id B (so that π has a right inverse). Conversely, if π has a right inverse i , then π ∘ i = Id B implies that i ∘ π ∘ i ∘ π = i ∘ Id B ∘ π = i ∘ π ; that is, p = i ∘ π is idempotent.

[ citation needed ] Applications [ edit ] The original notion of projection has been extended or generalized to various mathematical situations, frequently, but not always, related to geometry, for example: In set theory : An operation typified by the j - th projection map , written proj j , that takes an element x = ( x 1 , ..., x j , ..., x n ) of the Cartesian product X 1 × ⋯ × X j × ⋯ × X n to the value proj j ( x ) = x j .

[ 1 ] This map is always surjective and, when each space X k has a topology , this map is also continuous and open .

[ 2 ] A mapping that takes an element to its equivalence class under a given equivalence relation is known as the canonical projection .

[ 3 ] The evaluation map sends a function f to the value f ( x ) for a fixed x .  The space of functions Y X can be identified with the Cartesian product ∏ ∏ i ∈ ∈ X Y {\textstyle \prod _{i\in X}Y} , and the evaluation map is a projection map from the Cartesian product.

[ citation needed ] For relational databases and query languages , the projection is a unary operation written as Π Π a 1 , … … , a n ( R ) {\displaystyle \Pi _{a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}}(R)} where a 1 , … … , a n {\displaystyle a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}} is a set of attribute names. The result of such projection is defined as the set that is obtained when all tuples in R are restricted to the set { a 1 , … … , a n } {\displaystyle \{a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}\}} .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ verification needed ] R is a database-relation .

[ citation needed ] In spherical geometry , projection of a sphere upon a plane was used by Ptolemy (~150) in his Planisphaerium .

[ 7 ] The method is called stereographic projection and uses a plane tangent to a sphere and a pole C diametrically opposite the point of tangency.  Any point P on the sphere besides C determines a line CP intersecting the plane at the projected point for P .

[ 8 ] The correspondence makes the sphere a one-point compactification for the plane when a point at infinity is included to correspond to C , which otherwise has no projection on the plane. A common instance is the complex plane where the compactification corresponds to the Riemann sphere . Alternatively, a hemisphere is frequently projected onto a plane using the gnomonic projection .

[ citation needed ] In linear algebra , a linear transformation that remains unchanged if applied twice: p ( u ) = p ( p ( u )) . In other words, an idempotent operator.  For example, the mapping that takes a point ( x , y , z ) in three dimensions to the point ( x , y , 0) is a projection. This type of projection naturally generalizes to any number of dimensions n for the domain and k ≤ n for the codomain of the mapping.  See Orthogonal projection , Projection (linear algebra) .  In the case of orthogonal projections, the space admits a decomposition as a product, and the projection operator is a projection in that sense as well.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ verification needed ] In functional analysis and quantum mechanics , a specific kind of projection is used in the construction of projection-valued measures . In their sense, a projection is a self-adjoint idempotent linear operator.

In differential topology , any fiber bundle includes a projection map as part of its definition.  Locally at least this map looks like a projection map in the sense of the product topology and is therefore open and surjective.

[ citation needed ] In topology , a retraction is a continuous map r : X → X which restricts to the identity map on its image.

[ 11 ] This satisfies a similar idempotency condition r 2 = r and can be considered a generalization of the projection map.  The image of a retraction is called a retract of the original space. A retraction which is homotopic to the identity is known as a deformation retraction .  This term is also used in category theory to refer to any split epimorphism.

[ citation needed ] The scalar projection (or resolute) of one vector onto another.

In category theory , the above notion of Cartesian product of sets can be generalized to arbitrary categories .  The product of some objects has a canonical projection morphism to each factor.  Special cases include the projection from the Cartesian product of sets , the product topology of topological spaces (which is always surjective and open ), or from the direct product of groups , etc.  Although these morphisms are often epimorphisms and even surjective, they do not have to be.
