In probability theory and statistics , the binomial distribution with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments , each asking a yes–no question , and each with its own Boolean -valued outcome : success (with probability p ) or failure (with probability q = 1 − p ). A single success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli trial or Bernoulli experiment, and a sequence of outcomes is called a Bernoulli process ; for a single trial, i.e., n = 1 , the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution . The binomial distribution is the basis for the binomial test of statistical significance .

[ 1 ] The binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size N . If the sampling is carried out without replacement, the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a hypergeometric distribution , not a binomial one.  However, for N much larger than n , the binomial distribution remains a good approximation, and is widely used.

Definitions [ edit ] Probability mass function [ edit ] If the random variable X follows the binomial distribution with parameters n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} } (a natural number ) and p ∈ [0, 1] , we write X ~ B ( n , p ) . The probability of getting exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials (with the same rate p ) is given by the probability mass function : f ( k , n , p ) = Pr ( X = k ) = ( n k ) p k ( 1 − − p ) n − − k {\displaystyle f(k,n,p)=\Pr(X=k)={\binom {n}{k}}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}} for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n , where ( n k ) = n !

k !

( n − − k ) !

{\displaystyle {\binom {n}{k}}={\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}} is the binomial coefficient . The formula can be understood as follows: p k q n − k is the probability of obtaining the sequence of n independent Bernoulli trials in which k trials are "successes" and the remaining n − k trials result in "failure". Since the trials are independent with probabilities remaining constant between them, any sequence of n trials with k successes (and n − k failures) has the same probability of being achieved (regardless of positions of successes within the sequence). There are ( n k ) {\textstyle {\binom {n}{k}}} such sequences, since the binomial coefficient ( n k ) {\textstyle {\binom {n}{k}}} counts the number of ways to choose the positions of the k successes among the n trials. The binomial distribution is concerned with the probability of obtaining any of these sequences, meaning the probability of obtaining one of them ( p k q n − k ) must be added ( n k ) {\textstyle {\binom {n}{k}}} times, hence Pr ( X = k ) = ( n k ) p k ( 1 − − p ) n − − k {\textstyle \Pr(X=k)={\binom {n}{k}}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}} .

In creating reference tables for binomial distribution probability, usually, the table is filled in up to n /2 values. This is because for k > n /2 , the probability can be calculated by its complement as f ( k , n , p ) = f ( n − − k , n , 1 − − p ) .

{\displaystyle f(k,n,p)=f(n-k,n,1-p).} Looking at the expression f ( k , n , p ) as a function of k , there is a k value that maximizes it. This k value can be found by calculating f ( k + 1 , n , p ) f ( k , n , p ) = ( n − − k ) p ( k + 1 ) ( 1 − − p ) {\displaystyle {\frac {f(k+1,n,p)}{f(k,n,p)}}={\frac {(n-k)p}{(k+1)(1-p)}}} and comparing it to 1. There is always an integer M that satisfies [ 2 ] ( n + 1 ) p − − 1 ≤ ≤ M < ( n + 1 ) p .

{\displaystyle (n+1)p-1\leq M<(n+1)p.} f ( k , n , p ) is monotone increasing for k < M and monotone decreasing for k > M , with the exception of the case where ( n + 1) p is an integer. In this case, there are two values for which f is maximal: ( n + 1) p and ( n + 1) p − 1 .

M is the most probable outcome (that is, the most likely, although this can still be unlikely overall) of the Bernoulli trials and is called the mode .

Equivalently, M − p < np ≤ M + 1 − p . Taking the floor function , we obtain M = floor( np ) .

[ note 1 ] Example [ edit ] Suppose a biased coin comes up heads with probability 0.3 when tossed. The probability of seeing exactly 4 heads in 6 tosses is f ( 4 , 6 , 0.3 ) = ( 6 4 ) 0.3 4 ( 1 − − 0.3 ) 6 − − 4 = 0.059535.

{\displaystyle f(4,6,0.3)={\binom {6}{4}}0.3^{4}(1-0.3)^{6-4}=0.059535.} Cumulative distribution function [ edit ] The cumulative distribution function can be expressed as: F ( k ; n , p ) = Pr ( X ≤ ≤ k ) = ∑ ∑ i = 0 ⌊ ⌊ k ⌋ ⌋ ( n i ) p i ( 1 − − p ) n − − i , {\displaystyle F(k;n,p)=\Pr(X\leq k)=\sum _{i=0}^{\lfloor k\rfloor }{n \choose i}p^{i}(1-p)^{n-i},} where ⌊ ⌊ k ⌋ ⌋ {\displaystyle \lfloor k\rfloor } is the "floor" under k , i.e. the greatest integer less than or equal to k .

It can also be represented in terms of the regularized incomplete beta function , as follows: [ 3 ] F ( k ; n , p ) = Pr ( X ≤ ≤ k ) = I 1 − − p ( n − − k , k + 1 ) = ( n − − k ) ( n k ) ∫ ∫ 0 1 − − p t n − − k − − 1 ( 1 − − t ) k d t , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F(k;n,p)&=\Pr(X\leq k)\\&=I_{1-p}(n-k,k+1)\\&=(n-k){n \choose k}\int _{0}^{1-p}t^{n-k-1}(1-t)^{k}\,dt,\end{aligned}}} which is equivalent to the cumulative distribution functions of the beta distribution and of the F -distribution : [ 4 ] F ( k ; n , p ) = F beta-distribution ( x = 1 − − p ; α α = n − − k , β β = k + 1 ) {\displaystyle F(k;n,p)=F_{\text{beta-distribution}}\left(x=1-p;\alpha =n-k,\beta =k+1\right)} F ( k ; n , p ) = F F -distribution ( x = 1 − − p p k + 1 n − − k ; d 1 = 2 ( n − − k ) , d 2 = 2 ( k + 1 ) ) .

{\displaystyle F(k;n,p)=F_{F{\text{-distribution}}}\left(x={\frac {1-p}{p}}{\frac {k+1}{n-k}};d_{1}=2(n-k),d_{2}=2(k+1)\right).} Some closed-form bounds for the cumulative distribution function are given below .

Properties [ edit ] Expected value and variance [ edit ] If X ~ B ( n , p ) , that is, X is a binomially distributed random variable, n being the total number of experiments and p the probability of each experiment yielding a successful result, then the expected value of X is: [ 5 ] E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] = n p .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [X]=np.} This follows from the linearity of the expected value along with the fact that X is the sum of n identical Bernoulli random variables, each with expected value p .  In other words, if X 1 , … … , X n {\displaystyle X_{1},\ldots ,X_{n}} are identical (and independent) Bernoulli random variables with parameter p , then X = X 1 + ... + X n and E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] = E ⁡ ⁡ [ X 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + X n ] = E ⁡ ⁡ [ X 1 ] + ⋯ ⋯ + E ⁡ ⁡ [ X n ] = p + ⋯ ⋯ + p = n p .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [X]=\operatorname {E} [X_{1}+\cdots +X_{n}]=\operatorname {E} [X_{1}]+\cdots +\operatorname {E} [X_{n}]=p+\cdots +p=np.} The variance is: Var ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) = n p q = n p ( 1 − − p ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Var} (X)=npq=np(1-p).} This similarly follows from the fact that the variance of a sum of independent random variables is the sum of the variances.

Higher moments [ edit ] The first 6 central moments , defined as μ μ c = E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] ) c ] {\displaystyle \mu _{c}=\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\operatorname {E} [X])^{c}\right]} , are given by μ μ 1 = 0 , μ μ 2 = n p ( 1 − − p ) , μ μ 3 = n p ( 1 − − p ) ( 1 − − 2 p ) , μ μ 4 = n p ( 1 − − p ) [ 1 + ( 3 n − − 6 ) p ( 1 − − p ) ] , μ μ 5 = n p ( 1 − − p ) ( 1 − − 2 p ) [ 1 + ( 10 n − − 12 ) p ( 1 − − p ) ] , μ μ 6 = n p ( 1 − − p ) [ 1 − − 30 p ( 1 − − p ) [ 1 − − 4 p ( 1 − − p ) ] + 5 n p ( 1 − − p ) [ 5 − − 26 p ( 1 − − p ) ] + 15 n 2 p 2 ( 1 − − p ) 2 ] .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu _{1}&=0,\\\mu _{2}&=np\left(1-p\right),\\\mu _{3}&=np\left(1-p\right)\left(1-2p\right),\\\mu _{4}&=np\left(1-p\right)\left[1+\left(3n-6\right)p\left(1-p\right)\right],\\\mu _{5}&=np\left(1-p\right)\left(1-2p\right)\left[1+\left(10n-12\right)p\left(1-p\right)\right],\\\mu _{6}&=np\left(1-p\right)\left[1-30p\left(1-p\right)\left[1-4p(1-p)\right]+5np\left(1-p\right)\left[5-26p\left(1-p\right)\right]+15n^{2}p^{2}\left(1-p\right)^{2}\right].\end{aligned}}} The non-central moments satisfy E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] = n p , E ⁡ ⁡ [ X 2 ] = n p ( 1 − − p ) + n 2 p 2 , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\operatorname {E} [X]&=np,\\\operatorname {E} [X^{2}]&=np(1-p)+n^{2}p^{2},\end{aligned}}} and in general [ 6 ] [ 7 ] E ⁡ ⁡ [ X c ] = ∑ ∑ k = 0 c { c k } n k _ _ p k , {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [X^{c}]=\sum _{k=0}^{c}\left\{{c \atop k}\right\}n^{\underline {k}}p^{k},} where { c k } {\textstyle \left\{{c \atop k}\right\}} are the Stirling numbers of the second kind , and n k _ _ = n ( n − − 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( n − − k + 1 ) {\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}=n(n-1)\cdots (n-k+1)} is the k {\displaystyle k} -th falling power of n {\displaystyle n} .
A simple bound [ 8 ] follows by bounding the Binomial moments via the higher Poisson moments : E ⁡ ⁡ [ X c ] ≤ ≤ [ c ln ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 + c n p ) ] c ≤ ≤ ( n p ) c exp ⁡ ⁡ ( c 2 2 n p ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [X^{c}]\leq \left[{\frac {c}{\ln \left(1+{\frac {c}{np}}\right)}}\right]^{c}\leq (np)^{c}\exp \left({\frac {c^{2}}{2np}}\right).} This shows that if c = O ( n p ) {\displaystyle c=O({\sqrt {np}})} , then E ⁡ ⁡ [ X c ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [X^{c}]} is at most a constant factor away from E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] c {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [X]^{c}} Mode [ edit ] Usually the mode of a binomial B ( n , p ) distribution is equal to ⌊ ⌊ ( n + 1 ) p ⌋ ⌋ {\displaystyle \lfloor (n+1)p\rfloor } , where ⌊ ⌊ ⋅ ⋅ ⌋ ⌋ {\displaystyle \lfloor \cdot \rfloor } is the floor function . However, when ( n + 1) p is an integer and p is neither 0 nor 1, then the distribution has two modes: ( n + 1) p and ( n + 1) p − 1 . When p is equal to 0 or 1, the mode will be 0 and n correspondingly. These cases can be summarized as follows: mode = { ⌊ ⌊ ( n + 1 ) p ⌋ ⌋ if ( n + 1 ) p is 0 or a noninteger , ( n + 1 ) p and ( n + 1 ) p − − 1 if ( n + 1 ) p ∈ ∈ { 1 , … … , n } , n if ( n + 1 ) p = n + 1.

{\displaystyle {\text{mode}}={\begin{cases}\lfloor (n+1)\,p\rfloor &{\text{if }}(n+1)p{\text{ is 0 or a noninteger}},\\(n+1)\,p\ {\text{ and }}\ (n+1)\,p-1&{\text{if }}(n+1)p\in \{1,\dots ,n\},\\n&{\text{if }}(n+1)p=n+1.\end{cases}}} Proof: Let f ( k ) = ( n k ) p k q n − − k .

{\displaystyle f(k)={\binom {n}{k}}p^{k}q^{n-k}.} For p = 0 {\displaystyle p=0} only f ( 0 ) {\displaystyle f(0)} has a nonzero value with f ( 0 ) = 1 {\displaystyle f(0)=1} . For p = 1 {\displaystyle p=1} we find f ( n ) = 1 {\displaystyle f(n)=1} and f ( k ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(k)=0} for k ≠ ≠ n {\displaystyle k\neq n} . This proves that the mode is 0 for p = 0 {\displaystyle p=0} and n {\displaystyle n} for p = 1 {\displaystyle p=1} .

Let 0 < p < 1 {\displaystyle 0<p<1} . We find f ( k + 1 ) f ( k ) = ( n − − k ) p ( k + 1 ) ( 1 − − p ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {f(k+1)}{f(k)}}={\frac {(n-k)p}{(k+1)(1-p)}}.} From this follows k > ( n + 1 ) p − − 1 ⇒ ⇒ f ( k + 1 ) < f ( k ) k = ( n + 1 ) p − − 1 ⇒ ⇒ f ( k + 1 ) = f ( k ) k < ( n + 1 ) p − − 1 ⇒ ⇒ f ( k + 1 ) > f ( k ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}k>(n+1)p-1\Rightarrow f(k+1)<f(k)\\k=(n+1)p-1\Rightarrow f(k+1)=f(k)\\k<(n+1)p-1\Rightarrow f(k+1)>f(k)\end{aligned}}} So when ( n + 1 ) p − − 1 {\displaystyle (n+1)p-1} is an integer, then ( n + 1 ) p − − 1 {\displaystyle (n+1)p-1} and ( n + 1 ) p {\displaystyle (n+1)p} is a mode. In the case that ( n + 1 ) p − − 1 ∉ ∉ Z {\displaystyle (n+1)p-1\notin \mathbb {Z} } , then only ⌊ ⌊ ( n + 1 ) p − − 1 ⌋ ⌋ + 1 = ⌊ ⌊ ( n + 1 ) p ⌋ ⌋ {\displaystyle \lfloor (n+1)p-1\rfloor +1=\lfloor (n+1)p\rfloor } is a mode.

[ 9 ] Median [ edit ] In general, there is no single formula to find the median for a binomial distribution, and it may even be non-unique. However, several special results have been established: If np is an integer, then the mean, median, and mode coincide and equal np .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Any median m must lie within the interval ⌊ ⌊ n p ⌋ ⌋ ≤ ≤ m ≤ ≤ ⌈ ⌈ n p ⌉ ⌉ {\displaystyle \lfloor np\rfloor \leq m\leq \lceil np\rceil } .

[ 12 ] A median m cannot lie too far away from the mean: | m − − n p | ≤ ≤ min { ln ⁡ ⁡ 2 , max { p , 1 − − p } } {\displaystyle |m-np|\leq \min\{{\ln 2},\max\{p,1-p\}\}} .

[ 13 ] The median is unique and equal to m = round ( np ) when | m − np | ≤ min{ p , 1 − p } (except for the case when p = 1/2 and n is odd).

[ 12 ] When p is a rational number (with the exception of p = 1/2 \ and n odd) the median is unique.

[ 14 ] When p = 1 2 {\textstyle p={\tfrac {1}{2}}} and n is odd, any number m in the interval 1 2 ( n − − 1 ) ≤ ≤ m ≤ ≤ 1 2 ( n + 1 ) {\textstyle {\frac {1}{2}}\left(n-1\right)\leq m\leq {\frac {1}{2}}\left(n+1\right)} is a median of the binomial distribution. If p = 1 2 {\textstyle p={\tfrac {1}{2}}} and n is even, then m = n 2 {\textstyle m={\tfrac {n}{2}}} is the unique median.

Tail bounds [ edit ] For k ≤ np , upper bounds can be derived for the lower tail of the cumulative distribution function F ( k ; n , p ) = Pr ( X ≤ ≤ k ) {\displaystyle F(k;n,p)=\Pr(X\leq k)} , the probability that there are at most k successes. Since Pr ( X ≥ ≥ k ) = F ( n − − k ; n , 1 − − p ) {\displaystyle \Pr(X\geq k)=F(n-k;n,1-p)} , these bounds can also be seen as bounds for the upper tail of the cumulative distribution function for k ≥ np .

Hoeffding's inequality yields the simple bound F ( k ; n , p ) ≤ ≤ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − 2 n ( p − − k n ) 2 ) , {\displaystyle F(k;n,p)\leq \exp \left(-2n\left(p-{\frac {k}{n}}\right)^{2}\right),\!} which is however not very tight. In particular, for p = 1 , we have that F ( k ; n , p ) = 0 (for fixed k , n with k < n ), but Hoeffding's bound evaluates to a positive constant.

A sharper bound can be obtained from the Chernoff bound : [ 15 ] F ( k ; n , p ) ≤ ≤ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − n D ( k n ∥ ∥ p ) ) {\displaystyle F(k;n,p)\leq \exp \left(-nD{\left({\frac {k}{n}}\parallel p\right)}\right)} where D ( a ∥ p ) is the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between an a -coin and a p -coin (i.e. between the Bernoulli( a ) and Bernoulli( p ) distribution): D ( a ∥ ∥ p ) = ( a ) ln ⁡ ⁡ a p + ( 1 − − a ) ln ⁡ ⁡ 1 − − a 1 − − p .

{\displaystyle D(a\parallel p)=(a)\ln {\frac {a}{p}}+(1-a)\ln {\frac {1-a}{1-p}}.\!} Asymptotically, this bound is reasonably tight; see [ 15 ] for details.

One can also obtain lower bounds on the tail F ( k ; n , p ) , known as anti-concentration bounds. By approximating the binomial coefficient with Stirling's formula it can be shown that [ 16 ] F ( k ; n , p ) ≥ ≥ 1 8 n k n ( 1 − − k n ) exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − n D ( k n ∥ ∥ p ) ) , {\displaystyle F(k;n,p)\geq {\frac {1}{\sqrt {8n{\tfrac {k}{n}}(1-{\tfrac {k}{n}})}}}\exp \left(-nD{\left({\frac {k}{n}}\parallel p\right)}\right),} which implies the simpler but looser bound F ( k ; n , p ) ≥ ≥ 1 2 n exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − n D ( k n ∥ ∥ p ) ) .

{\displaystyle F(k;n,p)\geq {\frac {1}{\sqrt {2n}}}\exp \left(-nD\left({\frac {k}{n}}\parallel p\right)\right).} For p = 1/2 and k ≥ 3 n /8 for even n , it is possible to make the denominator constant: [ 17 ] F ( k ; n , 1 2 ) ≥ ≥ 1 15 exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − 16 n ( 1 2 − − k n ) 2 ) .

{\displaystyle F(k;n,{\tfrac {1}{2}})\geq {\frac {1}{15}}\exp \left(-16n\left({\frac {1}{2}}-{\frac {k}{n}}\right)^{2}\right).\!} Statistical inference [ edit ] Estimation of parameters [ edit ] See also: Beta distribution § Bayesian inference When n is known, the parameter p can be estimated using the proportion of successes: p ^ ^ = x n .

{\displaystyle {\widehat {p}}={\frac {x}{n}}.} This estimator is found using maximum likelihood estimator and also the method of moments . This estimator is unbiased and uniformly with minimum variance , proven using Lehmann–Scheffé theorem , since it is based on a minimal sufficient and complete statistic (i.e.: x ). It is also consistent both in probability and in MSE . This statistic is asymptotically normal thanks to the central limit theorem , because it is the same as taking the mean over Bernoulli samples.  It has a variance of Var ⁡ ⁡ ( p ^ ^ ) = p ( 1 − − p ) n {\displaystyle \operatorname {Var} ({\hat {p}})={\frac {p(1-p)}{n}}} , a property which is used in various ways, such as in Wald's confidence intervals .

A closed form Bayes estimator for p also exists when using the Beta distribution as a conjugate prior distribution . When using a general Beta ⁡ ⁡ ( α α , β β ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Beta} (\alpha ,\beta )} as a prior, the posterior mean estimator is: p ^ ^ b = x + α α n + α α + β β .

{\displaystyle {\widehat {p}}_{b}={\frac {x+\alpha }{n+\alpha +\beta }}.} The Bayes estimator is asymptotically efficient and as the sample size approaches infinity ( n → ∞ ), it approaches the MLE solution.

[ 18 ] The Bayes estimator is biased (how much depends on the priors), admissible and consistent in probability. Using the Bayesian estimator with the Beta distribution can be used with Thompson sampling .

For the special case of using the standard uniform distribution as a non-informative prior , Beta ⁡ ⁡ ( α α = 1 , β β = 1 ) = U ( 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Beta} (\alpha {=}1,\,\beta {=}1)=U(0,1)} , the posterior mean estimator becomes: p ^ ^ b = x + 1 n + 2 .

{\displaystyle {\widehat {p}}_{b}={\frac {x+1}{n+2}}.} (A posterior mode should just lead to the standard estimator.) This method is called the rule of succession , which was introduced in the 18th century by Pierre-Simon Laplace .

When relying on Jeffreys prior , the prior is Beta ⁡ ⁡ ( α α = 1 2 , β β = 1 2 ) {\textstyle \operatorname {Beta} (\alpha {=}{\tfrac {1}{2}},\,\beta {=}{\tfrac {1}{2}})} , [ 19 ] which leads to the estimator: p ^ ^ J e f f r e y s = x + 1 2 n + 1 .

{\displaystyle {\widehat {p}}_{Jeffreys}={\frac {x+{\frac {1}{2}}}{n+1}}.} When estimating p with very rare events and a small n (e.g.: if x = 0 ), then using the standard estimator leads to p ^ ^ = 0 , {\displaystyle {\widehat {p}}=0,} which sometimes is unrealistic and undesirable. In such cases there are various alternative estimators.

[ 20 ] One way is to use the Bayes estimator p ^ ^ b {\displaystyle {\widehat {p}}_{b}} , leading to: p ^ ^ b = 1 n + 2 .

{\displaystyle {\widehat {p}}_{b}={\frac {1}{n+2}}.} Another method is to use the upper bound of the confidence interval obtained using the rule of three : p ^ ^ rule of 3 = 3 n .

{\displaystyle {\widehat {p}}_{\text{rule of 3}}={\frac {3}{n}}.} Confidence intervals for the parameter p [ edit ] Main article: Binomial proportion confidence interval See also: Z-test § Comparing the Proportions of Two Binomials Even for quite large values of n , the actual distribution of the mean is significantly nonnormal.

[ 21 ] Because of this problem several methods to estimate confidence intervals have been proposed.

In the equations for confidence intervals below, the variables have the following meaning: n 1 is the number of successes out of n , the total number of trials p ^ ^ = n 1 n {\displaystyle {\widehat {p\,}}={\frac {n_{1}}{n}}} is the proportion of successes z {\displaystyle z} is the 1 − − 1 2 α α {\displaystyle 1-{\tfrac {1}{2}}\alpha } quantile of a standard normal distribution (i.e., probit ) corresponding to the target error rate α α {\displaystyle \alpha } . For example, for a 95% confidence level the error α α {\displaystyle \alpha } = 0.05, so 1 − − 1 2 α α {\displaystyle 1-{\tfrac {1}{2}}\alpha } = 0.975 and z {\displaystyle z} = 1.96.

{\displaystyle \sin ^{2}\left(\arcsin \left({\sqrt {\hat {p}}}\right)\pm {\frac {z}{2{\sqrt {n}}}}\right).} Wilson (score) method [ edit ] Main article: Binomial proportion confidence interval § Wilson score interval The notation in the formula below differs from the previous formulas in two respects: [ 26 ] Firstly, z x has a slightly different interpretation in the formula below: it has its ordinary meaning of 'the x th quantile of the standard normal distribution', rather than being a shorthand for 'the (1 − x ) th quantile'.

Secondly, this formula does not use a plus-minus to define the two bounds. Instead, one may use z = z α α / 2 {\displaystyle z=z_{\alpha /2}} to get the lower bound, or use z = z 1 − − α α / 2 {\displaystyle z=z_{1-\alpha /2}} to get the upper bound. For example: for a 95% confidence level the error α α {\displaystyle \alpha } = 0.05, so one gets the lower bound by using z = z α α / 2 = z 0.025 = − − 1.96 {\displaystyle z=z_{\alpha /2}=z_{0.025}=-1.96} , and one gets the upper bound by using z = z 1 − − α α / 2 = z 0.975 = 1.96 {\displaystyle z=z_{1-\alpha /2}=z_{0.975}=1.96} .

[ 21 ] ( Exact does not mean perfectly accurate;  rather, it indicates that the estimates will not be less conservative than the true value.) The Wald method, although commonly recommended in textbooks, is the most biased.

[ clarification needed ] Related distributions [ edit ] Sums of binomials [ edit ] If X ~ B( n , p ) and Y ~ B( m , p ) are independent binomial variables with the same probability p , then X + Y is again a binomial variable; its distribution is Z = X + Y ~ B( n + m , p ) : [ 28 ] P ⁡ ⁡ ( Z = k ) = ∑ ∑ i = 0 k [ ( n i ) p i ( 1 − − p ) n − − i ] [ ( m k − − i ) p k − − i ( 1 − − p ) m − − k + i ] = ( n + m k ) p k ( 1 − − p ) n + m − − k {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\operatorname {P} (Z=k)&=\sum _{i=0}^{k}\left[{\binom {n}{i}}p^{i}(1-p)^{n-i}\right]\left[{\binom {m}{k-i}}p^{k-i}(1-p)^{m-k+i}\right]\\&={\binom {n+m}{k}}p^{k}(1-p)^{n+m-k}\end{aligned}}} A Binomial distributed random variable X ~ B( n , p ) can be considered as the sum of n Bernoulli distributed random variables. So the sum of two Binomial distributed random variables X ~ B( n , p ) and Y ~ B( m , p ) is equivalent to the sum of n + m Bernoulli distributed random variables, which means Z = X + Y ~ B( n + m , p ) . This can also be proven directly using the addition rule.

However, if X and Y do not have the same probability p , then the variance of the sum will be smaller than the variance of a binomial variable distributed as B( n + m , p ) .

Poisson binomial distribution [ edit ] The binomial distribution is a special case of the Poisson binomial distribution , which is the distribution of a sum of n independent non-identical Bernoulli trials B( p i ) .

[ 29 ] Ratio of two binomial distributions [ edit ] This result was first derived by Katz and coauthors in 1978.

[ 30 ] Let X ~ B( n , p 1 ) and Y ~ B( m , p 2 ) be independent. Let T = ( X / n ) / ( Y / m ) .

Then log( T ) is approximately normally distributed with mean log( p 1 / p 2 ) and variance ((1/ p 1 ) − 1)/ n + ((1/ p 2 ) − 1)/ m .

Conditional binomials [ edit ] If X ~ B( n , p ) and Y | X ~ B( X , q ) (the conditional distribution of Y , given X ), then Y is a simple binomial random variable with distribution Y ~ B( n , pq ).

For example, imagine throwing n balls to a basket U X and taking the balls that hit and throwing them to another basket U Y . If p is the probability to hit U X then X ~ B( n , p ) is the number of balls that hit U X . If q is the probability to hit U Y then the number of balls that hit U Y is Y ~ B( X , q ) and therefore Y ~ B( n , pq ).

[Proof] Since X ∼ ∼ B ( n , p ) {\displaystyle X\sim B(n,p)} and Y ∼ ∼ B ( X , q ) {\displaystyle Y\sim B(X,q)} , by the law of total probability , Pr [ Y = m ] = ∑ ∑ k = m n Pr [ Y = m ∣ ∣ X = k ] Pr [ X = k ] = ∑ ∑ k = m n ( n k ) ( k m ) p k q m ( 1 − − p ) n − − k ( 1 − − q ) k − − m {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Pr[Y=m]&=\sum _{k=m}^{n}\Pr[Y=m\mid X=k]\Pr[X=k]\\[2pt]&=\sum _{k=m}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}{\binom {k}{m}}p^{k}q^{m}(1-p)^{n-k}(1-q)^{k-m}\end{aligned}}} Since ( n k ) ( k m ) = ( n m ) ( n − − m k − − m ) , {\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}{\tbinom {k}{m}}={\tbinom {n}{m}}{\tbinom {n-m}{k-m}},} the equation above can be expressed as Pr [ Y = m ] = ∑ ∑ k = m n ( n m ) ( n − − m k − − m ) p k q m ( 1 − − p ) n − − k ( 1 − − q ) k − − m {\displaystyle \Pr[Y=m]=\sum _{k=m}^{n}{\binom {n}{m}}{\binom {n-m}{k-m}}p^{k}q^{m}(1-p)^{n-k}(1-q)^{k-m}} Factoring p k = p m p k − − m {\displaystyle p^{k}=p^{m}p^{k-m}} and pulling all the terms that don't depend on k {\displaystyle k} out of the sum now yields Pr [ Y = m ] = ( n m ) p m q m ( ∑ ∑ k = m n ( n − − m k − − m ) p k − − m ( 1 − − p ) n − − k ( 1 − − q ) k − − m ) = ( n m ) ( p q ) m ( ∑ ∑ k = m n ( n − − m k − − m ) ( p ( 1 − − q ) ) k − − m ( 1 − − p ) n − − k ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Pr[Y=m]&={\binom {n}{m}}p^{m}q^{m}\left(\sum _{k=m}^{n}{\binom {n-m}{k-m}}p^{k-m}(1-p)^{n-k}(1-q)^{k-m}\right)\\[2pt]&={\binom {n}{m}}(pq)^{m}\left(\sum _{k=m}^{n}{\binom {n-m}{k-m}}\left(p(1-q)\right)^{k-m}(1-p)^{n-k}\right)\end{aligned}}} After substituting i = k − − m {\displaystyle i=k-m} in the expression above, we get Pr [ Y = m ] = ( n m ) ( p q ) m ( ∑ ∑ i = 0 n − − m ( n − − m i ) ( p − − p q ) i ( 1 − − p ) n − − m − − i ) {\displaystyle \Pr[Y=m]={\binom {n}{m}}(pq)^{m}\left(\sum _{i=0}^{n-m}{\binom {n-m}{i}}(p-pq)^{i}(1-p)^{n-m-i}\right)} Notice that the sum (in the parentheses) above equals ( p − − p q + 1 − − p ) n − − m {\displaystyle (p-pq+1-p)^{n-m}} by the binomial theorem . Substituting this in finally yields Pr [ Y = m ] = ( n m ) ( p q ) m ( p − − p q + 1 − − p ) n − − m = ( n m ) ( p q ) m ( 1 − − p q ) n − − m {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Pr[Y=m]&={\binom {n}{m}}(pq)^{m}(p-pq+1-p)^{n-m}\\[4pt]&={\binom {n}{m}}(pq)^{m}(1-pq)^{n-m}\end{aligned}}} and thus Y ∼ ∼ B ( n , p q ) {\displaystyle Y\sim B(n,pq)} as desired.

Bernoulli distribution [ edit ] The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution, where n = 1 . Symbolically, X ~ B(1, p ) has the same meaning as X ~ Bernoulli( p ) . Conversely, any binomial distribution, B( n , p ) , is the distribution of the sum of n independent Bernoulli trials , Bernoulli( p ) , each with the same probability p .

[ 31 ] Normal approximation [ edit ] See also: Binomial proportion confidence interval § Normal approximation interval Binomial probability mass function and normal probability density function approximation for n = 6 and p = 0.5 If n is large enough, then the skew of the distribution is not too great. In this case a reasonable approximation to B( n , p ) is given by the normal distribution N ( n p , n p ( 1 − − p ) ) , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}(np,\,np(1-p)),} and this basic approximation can be improved in a simple way by using a suitable continuity correction .
The basic approximation generally improves as n increases (at least 20) and is better when p is not near to 0 or 1.

[ 32 ] Various rules of thumb may be used to decide whether n is large enough, and p is far enough from the extremes of zero or one: One rule [ 32 ] is that for n > 5 the normal approximation is adequate if the absolute value of the skewness is strictly less than 0.3; that is, if | 1 − − 2 p | n p ( 1 − − p ) = 1 n | 1 − − p p − − p 1 − − p | < 0.3.

{\displaystyle {\frac {|1-2p|}{\sqrt {np(1-p)}}}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {n}}}\left|{\sqrt {\frac {1-p}{p}}}-{\sqrt {\frac {p}{1-p}}}\,\right|<0.3.} This can be made precise using the Berry–Esseen theorem .

A stronger rule states that the normal approximation is appropriate only if everything within 3 standard deviations of its mean is within the range of possible values; that is, only if μ μ ± ± 3 σ σ = n p ± ± 3 n p ( 1 − − p ) ∈ ∈ ( 0 , n ) .

{\displaystyle \mu \pm 3\sigma =np\pm 3{\sqrt {np(1-p)}}\in (0,n).} This 3-standard-deviation rule is equivalent to the following conditions, which also imply the first rule above.

n > 9 ( 1 − − p p ) and n > 9 ( p 1 − − p ) .

{\displaystyle n>9\left({\frac {1-p}{p}}\right)\quad {\text{and}}\quad n>9\left({\frac {p}{1-p}}\right).} [Proof] The rule n p ± ± 3 n p ( 1 − − p ) ∈ ∈ ( 0 , n ) {\displaystyle np\pm 3{\sqrt {np(1-p)}}\in (0,n)} is totally equivalent to request that n p − − 3 n p ( 1 − − p ) > 0 and n p + 3 n p ( 1 − − p ) < n .

{\displaystyle np-3{\sqrt {np(1-p)}}>0\quad {\text{and}}\quad np+3{\sqrt {np(1-p)}}<n.} Moving terms around yields: n p > 3 n p ( 1 − − p ) and n ( 1 − − p ) > 3 n p ( 1 − − p ) .

{\displaystyle np>3{\sqrt {np(1-p)}}\quad {\text{and}}\quad n(1-p)>3{\sqrt {np(1-p)}}.} Since 0 < p < 1 {\displaystyle 0<p<1} , we can apply the square power and divide by the respective factors n p 2 {\displaystyle np^{2}} and n ( 1 − − p ) 2 {\displaystyle n(1-p)^{2}} , to obtain the desired conditions: n > 9 ( 1 − − p p ) and n > 9 ( p 1 − − p ) .

{\displaystyle n>9\left({\frac {1-p}{p}}\right)\quad {\text{and}}\quad n>9\left({\frac {p}{1-p}}\right).} Notice that these conditions automatically imply that n > 9 {\displaystyle n>9} . On the other hand, apply again the square root and divide by 3, n 3 > 1 − − p p > 0 and n 3 > p 1 − − p > 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {n}}{3}}>{\sqrt {\frac {1-p}{p}}}>0\quad {\text{and}}\quad {\frac {\sqrt {n}}{3}}>{\sqrt {\frac {p}{1-p}}}>0.} Subtracting the second set of inequalities from the first one yields: n 3 > 1 − − p p − − p 1 − − p > − − n 3 ; {\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {n}}{3}}>{\sqrt {\frac {1-p}{p}}}-{\sqrt {\frac {p}{1-p}}}>-{\frac {\sqrt {n}}{3}};} and so, the desired first rule is satisfied, | 1 − − p p − − p 1 − − p | < n 3 .

{\displaystyle \left|{\sqrt {\frac {1-p}{p}}}-{\sqrt {\frac {p}{1-p}}}\,\right|<{\frac {\sqrt {n}}{3}}.} Another commonly used rule is that both values np and n (1 − p ) must be greater than [ 33 ] [ 34 ] or equal to 5. However, the specific number varies from source to source, and depends on how good an approximation one wants. In particular, if one uses 9 instead of 5, the rule implies the results stated in the previous paragraphs.

[Proof] Assume that both values n p {\displaystyle np} and n ( 1 − − p ) {\displaystyle n(1-p)} are greater than 9. Since 0 < p < 1 {\displaystyle 0<p<1} , we easily have that n p ≥ ≥ 9 > 9 ( 1 − − p ) and n ( 1 − − p ) ≥ ≥ 9 > 9 p .

{\displaystyle np\geq 9>9(1-p)\quad {\text{and}}\quad n(1-p)\geq 9>9p.} We only have to divide now by the respective factors p {\displaystyle p} and 1 − − p {\displaystyle 1-p} , to deduce the alternative form of the 3-standard-deviation rule: n > 9 ( 1 − − p p ) and n > 9 ( p 1 − − p ) .

{\displaystyle n>9\left({\frac {1-p}{p}}\right)\quad {\text{and}}\quad n>9\left({\frac {p}{1-p}}\right).} The following is an example of applying a continuity correction . Suppose one wishes to calculate Pr( X ≤ 8) for a binomial random variable X . If Y has a distribution given by the normal approximation, then Pr( X ≤ 8) is approximated by Pr( Y ≤ 8.5) . The addition of 0.5 is the continuity correction; the uncorrected normal approximation gives considerably less accurate results.

This approximation, known as de Moivre–Laplace theorem , is a huge time-saver when undertaking calculations by hand (exact calculations with large n are very onerous); historically, it was the first use of the normal distribution, introduced in Abraham de Moivre 's book The Doctrine of Chances in 1738. Nowadays, it can be seen as a consequence of the central limit theorem since B( n , p ) is a sum of n independent, identically distributed Bernoulli variables with parameter p . This fact is the basis of a hypothesis test , a "proportion z-test", for the value of p using x / n , the sample proportion and estimator of p , in a common test statistic .

[ 35 ] For example, suppose one randomly samples n people out of a large population and ask them whether they agree with a certain statement. The proportion of people who agree will of course depend on the sample. If groups of n people were sampled repeatedly and truly randomly, the proportions would follow an approximate normal distribution with mean equal to the true proportion p of agreement in the population and with standard deviation σ σ = p ( 1 − − p ) n {\displaystyle \sigma ={\sqrt {\frac {p(1-p)}{n}}}} Poisson approximation [ edit ] The binomial distribution converges towards the Poisson distribution as the number of trials goes to infinity while the product np converges to a finite limit. Therefore, the Poisson distribution with parameter λ = np can be used as an approximation to B( n , p ) of the binomial distribution if n is sufficiently large and p is sufficiently small.  According to rules of thumb, this approximation is good if n ≥ 20 and p ≤ 0.05 [ 36 ] such that np ≤ 1 , or if n > 50 and p < 0.1 such that np < 5 , [ 37 ] or if n ≥ 100 and np ≤ 10 .

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] Concerning the accuracy of Poisson approximation, see Novak, [ 40 ] ch. 4, and references therein.

Limiting distributions [ edit ] Poisson limit theorem : As n approaches ∞ and p approaches 0 with the product np held fixed, the Binomial( n , p ) distribution approaches the Poisson distribution with expected value λ = np .

[ 38 ] de Moivre–Laplace theorem : As n approaches ∞ while p remains fixed, the distribution of X − − n p n p ( 1 − − p ) {\displaystyle {\frac {X-np}{\sqrt {np(1-p)}}}} approaches the normal distribution with expected value 0 and variance 1. This result is sometimes loosely stated by saying that the distribution of X is asymptotically normal with expected value 0 and variance 1. This result is a specific case of the central limit theorem .

Beta distribution [ edit ] The binomial distribution and beta distribution are different views of the same model of repeated Bernoulli trials. The binomial distribution is the PMF of k successes given n independent events each with a probability p of success. 
Mathematically, when α = k + 1 and β = n − k + 1 , the beta distribution and the binomial distribution are related by [ clarification needed ] a factor of n + 1 : Beta ⁡ ⁡ ( p ; α α ; β β ) = ( n + 1 ) B ( k ; n ; p ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Beta} (p;\alpha ;\beta )=(n+1)B(k;n;p)} Beta distributions also provide a family of prior probability distributions for binomial distributions in Bayesian inference : [ 41 ] P ( p ; α α , β β ) = p α α − − 1 ( 1 − − p ) β β − − 1 Beta ⁡ ⁡ ( α α , β β ) .

{\displaystyle P(p;\alpha ,\beta )={\frac {p^{\alpha -1}(1-p)^{\beta -1}}{\operatorname {Beta} (\alpha ,\beta )}}.} Given a uniform prior, the posterior distribution for the probability of success p given n independent events with k observed successes is a beta distribution.

[ 42 ] Computational methods [ edit ] Random number generation [ edit ] Further information: Pseudo-random number sampling Methods for random number generation where the marginal distribution is a binomial distribution are well-established.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] One way to generate random variates samples from a binomial distribution is to use an inversion algorithm. To do so, one must calculate the probability that Pr( X = k ) for all values k from 0 through n . (These probabilities should sum to a value close to one, in order to encompass the entire sample space.) Then by using a pseudorandom number generator to generate samples uniformly between 0 and 1, one can transform the calculated samples into discrete numbers by using the probabilities calculated in the first step.

History [ edit ] This distribution was derived by Jacob Bernoulli . He considered the case where p = r /( r + s ) where p is the probability of success and r and s are positive integers.

Blaise Pascal had earlier considered the case where p = 1/2 , tabulating the corresponding binomial coefficients in what is now recognized as Pascal's triangle .
