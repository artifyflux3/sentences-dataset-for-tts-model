The term transavanguardia was coined by Italian art critic Achille Bonito Oliva , [ 1 ] originating in the "Aperto '80" at the Venice Biennale , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and literally means beyond the avant-garde .

This art movement responded to the explosion of conceptual art , which found many mediums of expression, by reviving painting and reintroducing emotion – especially joy – back into drawing, painting and sculpture.

[ 4 ] Transavantgarde marked a return to figurative art , as well as mythic imagery, which was rediscovered during the height of the movement.

[ 5 ] The artists revived figurative art and symbolism , which were less frequently used in movements after World War II like minimalism . The principal transavantgarde artists were Sandro Chia , Francesco Clemente , Enzo Cucchi , Mimmo Germanà , Nino Longobardi , Nicola De Maria and Mimmo Paladino .

[ 6 ] In 1982, works by Chia, Cucchi and Longobardi were included in the exhibition "Italian Art Now: An American Perspective" at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York .
