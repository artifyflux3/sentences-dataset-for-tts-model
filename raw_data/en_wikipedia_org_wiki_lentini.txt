History [ edit ] The city was founded by colonists from Naxos as Leontini in 729 BC, [ 4 ] which in its beginnings was a Chalcidian colony established five years earlier in Magna Graecia .

It is virtually the only Greek settlement in Sicily that is not located on the coast, founded around 10 km inland. The site, originally held by the Sicels , was seized by the Greeks owing to their command on the fertile plain in the north.

[ 4 ] The city was reduced to subject status in 494 BC by Hippocrates of Gela , [ 5 ] who made his ally Aenesidemus its tyrant.

[ 6 ] In 476 BC, Hieron of Syracuse moved the inhabitants from Catana and Naxos to Leontini.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Later on, the city of Leontini regained its independence.

[ 5 ] However, as a part of the inhabitants' efforts to retain their independence, they invoked more than once the interventions of Athens . It was mainly the eloquence of Gorgias of Leontini which led to the abortive Athenian expedition of 427 BC.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 422 BC, the Greek city-state of Syracuse supported the oligarchs against the people and received them as citizens, Leontini itself being forsaken. This led to a renewed, initially diplomatic, Athenian intervention. The exiles of Leontini joined the envoys of Segesta in persuading Athens to undertake the great Sicilian Expedition of 415 BC.

[ 4 ] After the failure of the Expedition, Leontini became subject to Syracuse once more.

[ 7 ] The city's independence was guaranteed by the treaty of 405 BC between Dionysius and the Carthaginians , but it was soon lost again. The city was finally stormed by Marcus Claudius Marcellus in 214 BC.

[ 4 ] In Roman times, it seemed to have been of little importance.

[ 5 ] It was destroyed by the Saracens in 847 AD, [ 5 ] and almost completely ruined by the earthquake of 1693 .

[ 5 ] The ancient city is described by Polybius as lying in a valley between two hills and facing north.

[ 7 ] On the western side of this valley, a river flowed with a row of houses on its western bank below the hill. At each end was a gate, the northern gate leading to the plain, the southern at the upper end, leading to Syracuse. On each side of the valley was an acropolis lying between precipitous hills with flat tops, over which buildings extended. The eastern hill still has the remains of a strongly fortified medieval castle, in which some writers are inclined (though wrongly) to recognise portions of the Greek masonry.

[ 4 ] Excavations were made in 1899 in one of the ravines in a Sicel necropolis of the third period; explorations in the various Greek cemeteries resulted in the discovery of some fine bronzes, notably a lebes .

[ 4 ] During World War II , Lentini was occupied by the forces of Benito Mussolini 's fascist government, though that government was deeply unpopular in Lentini as it was throughout most of Sicily.  By the time the Allied invasion of Sicily occurred through Operation Husky, Lentini was occupied by German troops from the Nazi Germany 's army.  Nazi Germany's troops occupied the town until the arrival of British troops (specifically the Parachute Regiment ) serving under Bernard Montgomery .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Geography [ edit ] Lentini is a municipality of 215.84 km² located 52 km northwest of the provincial capital, Syracuse. It is situated at an elevation of 53 meters above sea level on the first hill slopes at the southern edge of the Plain of Catania.

It is the ancient Leontinoi, one of the first Greek colonies in Sicily, and has significant archaeological remains. Not far from the town, to the northwest, lies the basin of the Lago di Lentini (better known as Biviere ), which was once completely drained and today has been restored at its old site. The sea ( Agnone Bagni ) is 12 km from the town centre.

The Lentini area's environment is mainly characterised by its numerous citrus groves. It is called the Città delle arance ("City of Oranges") due to its high production of Siciian blood orange . The 15th meridian east, the reference line for Central European Time (UTC+1), passes through the town.

Climate [ edit ] Lentini's climate is Mediterranean , with mild winters and hot summers. During the coldest months, the average temperature during the day is around 15 °C, while the warmest months see average daytime temperatures that reach 34 °C. In summer, temperatures reach 40 °C every year and temperatures over 45 °C are not unheard of.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Winter also encounters temperatures over 15 °C yearly, with temperatures over 20 °C also occurring, but less frequently. Occasionally, winter lows go down to 0 °C, but rarely go under 0 °C. Summer lows normally do not go under 17 °C but can occasionally go down to 15 °C. While the climate is relatively dry all year round, there is a marked difference between precipitation days in summer, that experiences rain very rarely, and in winter, where rain occurs more frequently.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Economy [ edit ] Lentini's primary sector is based on the cultivation of cereals , wheat , vegetables , fodder , vineyards , olive groves , citrus groves (orange orchards especially represent the area's main economic activity) a well as cattle , sheep , pig and goat ranching.

[ 16 ] The secondary economic sector is made up of companies operating in areas such as food , construction , engineering , electronics , plastic goods manufacturing , refined petroleum products , medical and surgical equipment , furniture , wood processing , stone and ore extraction .

[ 16 ] Notable among craft activities is terracotta workmanship.

[ 16 ] A strong commercial network supplements the tertiary sector . There are private broadcasting stations and television networks.

[ 16 ] The city is also known for the production of the blood orange , specifically the Tarocco , Moro , and Sanguinella cultivars .

[ 17 ] Sport [ edit ] Main article: SS Leonzio 1909 Lentini is home to the SS Leonzio 1909 football team and has its own city stadium.
