( January 2025 ) Night of the Living Dead (1968), one of the earliest examples of postmodern horror film Postmodern horror is a horror film related to the art and philosophy of postmodernism . Examples of this type of film include George A. Romero 's Night of the Living Dead , Tobe Hooper 's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre , John Carpenter 's slasher film Halloween , and Wes Craven's Scream .

Background [ edit ] Postmodern horror, which emerged in the 1960s, is defined by several key characteristics. These include the disruption of everyday life through violence, the crossing and violation of boundaries, and a critique of rationality as a reliable framework. It also rejects traditional narrative closure, instead offering open-ended or unresolved storytelling. Additionally, it creates a confined experience of fear for the audience, fostering a sense of immersion.

[ 1 ] Examples of this include the famous "rules of surviving a horror movie" speech from Wes Craven 's 1996 slasher film Scream and the self-aware characters (including the main protagonist) slowly realizing they're living the plot of one in the 1990 precursor There's Nothing Out There .
