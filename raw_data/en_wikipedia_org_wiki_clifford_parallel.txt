The concept was first studied by William Kingdon Clifford in elliptic space and appears only in spaces of at least three dimensions . Since parallel lines have the property of equidistance, the term "parallel" was appropriated from Euclidean geometry , although the "lines" of elliptic geometry are geodesic curves and, unlike the lines of Euclidean geometry , are of finite length.

The algebra of quaternions provides a descriptive geometry of elliptic space in which Clifford parallelism is made explicit.

Clifford bundle is a topological construction based on Clifford parallel pointed out by Heinz Hopf (1931) [ 1 ] Introduction [ edit ] Two Clifford parallel great circles on the 3-sphere spanned by a twisted annulus . They have a common center point in 4-dimensional Euclidean space , and could lie in completely orthogonal rotation planes.

The lines on 1 in elliptic space are described by versors with a fixed axis r : [ 2 ] { e a r : 0 ≤ ≤ a < π π } {\displaystyle \lbrace e^{ar}:\ 0\leq a<\pi \rbrace } For an arbitrary point u in elliptic space, two Clifford parallels to this line pass through u .
The right Clifford parallel is { u e a r : 0 ≤ ≤ a < π π } , {\displaystyle \lbrace ue^{ar}:\ 0\leq a<\pi \rbrace ,} and the left Clifford parallel is { e a r u : 0 ≤ ≤ a < π π } .

{\displaystyle \lbrace e^{ar}u:\ 0\leq a<\pi \rbrace .} Generalized Clifford parallelism [ edit ] Clifford's original definition was of curved parallel lines, but the concept generalizes to Clifford parallel objects of more than one dimension.

[ 3 ] In 4-dimensional Euclidean space Clifford parallel objects of 1, 2, 3 or 4 dimensions are related by isoclinic rotations . Clifford parallelism and isoclinic rotations are closely related aspects of the SO(4) symmetries which characterize the regular 4-polytopes .

Clifford surfaces [ edit ] Rotating a line about another, to which it is Clifford parallel, creates a Clifford surface.

The Clifford parallels through points on the surface all lie in the surface. A Clifford surface is thus a ruled surface since every point is on two lines, each contained in the surface.

Given two square roots of minus one in the quaternions , written r and s , the Clifford surface through them is given by [ 2 ] [ 4 ] { e a r e b s : 0 ≤ ≤ a , b < π π } .

{\displaystyle \lbrace e^{ar}e^{bs}:\ 0\leq a,b<\pi \rbrace .} History [ edit ] Clifford parallels were first described in 1873 by the English mathematician William Kingdon Clifford .

[ 5 ] In 1900 Guido Fubini wrote his doctoral thesis on Clifford's parallelism in elliptic spaces .

[ 6 ] In 1931 Heinz Hopf used Clifford parallels to construct the Hopf map .

[ 1 ] In 2016 Hans Havlicek showed that there is a one-to-one correspondence between Clifford parallelisms and planes external to the Klein quadric .
