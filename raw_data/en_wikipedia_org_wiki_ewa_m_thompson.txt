Thompson ) Polish-American Slavist (born 1937) Ewa M. Thompson Born Ewa Majewska 1937 Kaunas , Lithuania Alma mater University of Warsaw Vanderbilt University [ 1 ] Known for Imperial Knowledge: Russian Literature and Colonialism Scientific career Fields Slavic studies Ewa M. Thompson (born Ewa Majewska ; 1937 in Kaunas ) is a Polish-American Slavist at Rice University .  One of the areas of her research concerns imperial motives in Russian literature .

[ 2 ] She was the editor of the Sarmatian Review .

Post-colonialism [ edit ] Thompson's book Imperial Knowledge: Russian Literature and Colonialism was published in Polish in 2000. In it, she strongly asserted the need for revising textual practices around Russian literature that had legitimized colonial practices more brutal than what she called "canonical" colonial practices legitimated in British and French literature. She linked the silence about Russian hegemony about Central European colonies and colonial practices with a Western fascination with Russia, and subsequently with the Soviet Union . Although the book did not initially receive much recognition, it has been rediscovered and reinvigorated following the publication of Slavist Clare Cavanagh 's works.
