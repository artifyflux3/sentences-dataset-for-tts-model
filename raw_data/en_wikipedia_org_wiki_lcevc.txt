[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Concept [ edit ] LCEVC specifies an enhancement layer which, when combined with a base video encoded with a separate codec, produces an enhanced video stream. The base layer is decodable by a hardware decoder, and the enhancement layer is suitable for software processing implementation with sustainable power consumption.

[ further explanation needed ] The enhancement layer provides improved features to existing codecs, such as compression capability extension and lower encoding/decoding complexity, for live streaming or broadcasting applications.

[ 3 ] LCEVC leverages a base video codec (e.g., AVC , HEVC , VP9 , AV1 , EVC or VVC ) and employs an efficient low-complexity enhancement that adds up to two layers of encoded residuals, along with normative signalled up-sampling methods, that correct artifacts produced by the base video codec and add detail and sharpness for the final output video.

[ 4 ] It provides additional compression efficiency to any existing or future video codec and reduces the processing complexity of encoding and decoding.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] LCEVC can be implemented with software updates for encoders and decoders, and was designed to leverage available hardware acceleration for graphics processing.

[ 7 ] Availability [ edit ] It is possible for licensed users of the V-NOVA P+ codec to encode LCEVC files.

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] In October 2018, MPEG issued a set of requirements for a new video coding standard and a Call for Proposals for Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] At IBC 2019 a preliminary implementation for encoding and decoding the forthcoming MPEG-5 Part 2 LCEVC was demonstrated.

[ 10 ] October 2020 at the 132nd MPEG meeting, LCEVC is completed reaching Final Draft stage.

[ 11 ] In April 2021, MPEG Video validated the Verification Test of LCEVC (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding) standard (ISO/IEC 23094-2). Test results tended to indicate an overall benefit also when using LCEVC to enhance AVC , HEVC , EVC and VVC .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] In May 2021, V-NOVA LCEVC Licensing Terms were announced for Entertainment Video Services. It is a software development kit and a wide range of reference integrations that add MPEG-5 Part 2 LCEVC (ISO/IEC 23094-2) encoding and decoding to any existing video delivery workflow.

V-NOVA LCEVC is an implementation of MPEG-5 Part 2 LCEVC, the codec-agnostic (ISO/IEC) enhancement standard capable of providing higher quality at up to 40% lower bitrates than codecs used natively.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] As per Jan Ozer's report, LCEVC Technology entitled LCEVC x264 Report: Live Sports & eGames, ABR Ladder.

[ 16 ] In January 2022, SBTVD Forum approved a selection of technologies for SBTVD 3.0 which include MPEG-5 LCEVC, V-NOVA & Harmonic 's submission.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] In January 2022, ISO/IEC published a set of tests and procedures to verify whether bitstreams and decoders meet normative requirements specified in the MPEG-5 LCEVC part 2 standard in order for implementers of LCEVC to be able to test the functioning and verify the conformance of their implementations.

[ 19 ] Stefano Battista, Guido Meardi , Simone Ferrara, Lorenzo Ciccarelli, Massimo Conti and Simone Orcioni are the co-authors of Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC) Standard.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Current schedule [ edit ] October 2018: 	Call for Proposals March 2019: 	Evaluation of the proposals received and first draft of the standard October 2019: 	Ballot issued for Committee Draft April 2020: 	Ballot issued for Draft International Standard October 2020: 	Completion of final standard [ 22 ] Publishing of standard ( ISO/IEC 23094–2) [ 23 ] License [ edit ] Licensing is free of cost per decoder or encoder, but broadcaster or encoder-side use of enhancement layers is subject to fees.

[ 24 ] LCEVC is proprietary to V-Nova and subject to V-Nova's proprietary licence . Therefore, distribution of any pre-compiled subsystem is strictly prohibited , even between group companies .

[ 25 ] Software support [ edit ] FFmpeg version 7.1 [ 26 ] officially supports decoding using official external library: LCEVCdec.

[ 27 ] GStreamer supports LCEVC since version 1.26 released on March 11, 2025.
