Propositional variables are the basic building-blocks of propositional formulas , used in propositional logic and higher-order logics .

Uses [ edit ] Formulas in logic are typically built up recursively from some propositional variables, some number of logical connectives , and some logical quantifiers . Propositional variables are the atomic formulas of propositional logic, and are often denoted using capital roman letters such as P {\displaystyle P} , Q {\displaystyle Q} and R {\displaystyle R} .

[ 2 ] Example In a given propositional logic, a formula can be defined as follows: Every propositional variable is a formula.

Given a formula X , the negation ¬X is a formula.

Given two formulas X and Y , and a binary connective b (such as the logical conjunction ∧), the expression (X b Y) is a formula. (Note the parentheses.) Through this construction, all of the formulas of propositional logic can be built up from propositional variables as a basic unit. Propositional variables should not be confused with the metavariables , which appear in the typical axioms of propositional calculus ; the latter effectively range over well-formed formulae, and are often denoted using lower-case greek letters such as α α {\displaystyle \alpha } , β β {\displaystyle \beta } and γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } .

Predicate logic [ edit ] Propositional variables with no object variables such as x and y attached to predicate letters such as P x and x R y , having instead individual constants a , b , ..attached to predicate letters are propositional constants P a , a R b . These propositional constants are atomic propositions, not containing propositional operators.

The internal structure of propositional variables contains predicate letters such as P and Q, in association with bound individual variables (e.g., x, y ), individual constants such as a and b ( singular terms from a domain of discourse D), ultimately taking a form such as P a , a R b .(or with parenthesis, P ( 11 ) {\displaystyle P(11)} and R ( 1 , 3 ) {\displaystyle R(1,3)} ).

[ 3 ] Propositional logic is sometimes called zeroth-order logic due to not considering the internal structure in contrast with first-order logic which analyzes the internal structure of the atomic sentences.
