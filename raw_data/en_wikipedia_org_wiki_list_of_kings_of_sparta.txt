Sparta was unusual among the Greek city-states in that it maintained its kingship past the Archaic age . It was even more unusual in that it had two kings simultaneously , who were called the archagetai , [ 1 ] [ n 1 ] coming from two separate lines . According to tradition, the two lines, the Agiads ( Ἀγιάδαι , Agiadai ) and Eurypontids ( Εὐρυποντίδαι , Eurypontidai ), were respectively descended from the twins Eurysthenes and Procles , the descendants of Heracles , who supposedly conquered Sparta two generations after the Trojan War . The dynasties themselves, however, were named after the twins' grandsons, the kings Agis I and Eurypon, respectively. The Agiad line was regarded as being senior to the Eurypontid line.

[ 3 ] Although there are lists of earlier purported kings of Sparta, there is little evidence for the existence of any before the mid-sixth century BC.

Spartan kings received a recurring posthumous hero cult like that of the similarly Doric kings of Cyrene .

[ 4 ] The kings' firstborn sons, as heirs-apparent, were the only Spartan boys expressly exempt from the Agoge ; however, they were allowed to take part if they so wished, and this endowed them with increased prestige when they ascended the throne.

Legendary kings of Sparta [ edit ] Ancient Greeks named males after their fathers, producing a patronymic with the suffix -id- ; for example, the sons of Atreus were the Atreids. For royal houses, the patronymic was formed from the name of the founder or of an early significant figure of a dynasty. A ruling family might thus have a number of dynastic names; for example, Agis I named the Agiads, but he was a Heraclid and so were his descendants.

If the descent was not known or was scantily known, the Greeks made a few standard assumptions based on their cultural ideology. Agiad people were treated as a tribe, presumed to have descended from an ancestor bearing its name. He must have been a king, who founded a dynasty of his name. That mythologizing extended even to place names. They were presumed to have been named after kings and divinities. Kings often became divinities, in their religion.

Lelegids [ edit ] The Lelegid were the descendants of Lelex (a back-formation ), ancestor of the Leleges , an ancient tribe inhabiting the Eurotas valley before the Greeks, who, according to the mythological descent, amalgamated with the Greeks Year Lelegid Other notable information c.

1600 BC Lelex son of Poseidon or Helios , or he was said to be autochthonous c.

1575 BC Myles son of Lelex c.

1550 BC Eurotas son of Myles , father of Sparta Lacedaemonids [ edit ] The Lacedaemonids contain Greeks from the age of legend, now treated as being the Bronze Age in Greece. In the language of mythologic descent, the kingship passed from the Leleges to the Greeks.

The Heracleidae became ascendant in the Eurotas valley with the Dorians who, at least in legend, entered it during an invasion called the Return of the Heracleidae; driving out the Atreids and at least some of the Mycenaean population.
