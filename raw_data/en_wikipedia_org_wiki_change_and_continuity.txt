Historians have questioned whether the New Deal in the US is best seen as a decisive change or more as being a case of societal continuity in the context of American history .

( February 2021 ) Change and continuity is a classic dichotomy within the fields of history , historical sociology , and the social sciences more broadly. The question of change and continuity is considered a classic discussion in the study of historical developments.

[ 1 ] The dichotomy is used to discuss and evaluate the extent to which a historical development or event represents a decisive historical change or whether a situation remains largely unchanged. A good example of this discussion is the question of how much the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 represents an important change in European history . In a similar vein, historian Richard Kirkendall once questioned whether FDR 's New Deal represented "a radical innovation or a continuation of earlier themes in American life?" and posed the question of whether "historical interpretations of the New Deal [should] stress change or emphasize continuity?" [ 2 ] The issue here is if the New Deal marks something radically new ( change ) in US history or if the New Deal can be understood as a continuation ( continuity ) of tendencies in American history that were in place well before the 1930.

The dichotomy is important in relation to constructing, discussing, and evaluating historical periodizations . In terms of creating and discussing periodization (e.g.

the Enlightenment or the Victorian Era ,) the dichotomy can be used to assess when a period can be said to start and end, thus making the dichotomy important in relation to understanding historical chronology . Economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron has taken issue with the dichotomy, arguing that continuity "appears to mean no more than absence of change, i.e. stability." [ 3 ] German historian Reinhart Koselleck , however, has been said to challenge this dichotomy.
