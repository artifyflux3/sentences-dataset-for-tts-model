Griffiths . The book is considered a standard undergraduate textbook in the subject.

[ 1 ] Originally published by Pearson Education in 1995 with a second edition in 2005, Cambridge University Press (CUP) reprinted the second edition in 2017. In 2018, CUP released a third edition of the book with Darrell F. Schroeter as co-author; this edition is known as Griffiths and Schroeter .

Content (3rd edition) [ edit ] Part I: Theory Chapter 1: The Wave Function Chapter 2: Time-independent Schrödinger Equation Chapter 3: Formalism Chapter 4: Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions Chapter 5: Identical Particles Chapter 6: Symmetries and Conservation Laws Part II: Applications Chapter 7: Time-independent Perturbation Theory Chapter 8: The Variational Principle Chapter 9: The WKB Approximation Chapter 10: Scattering Chapter 11: Quantum Dynamics Chapter 12: Afterword Appendix: Linear Algebra Index Reception [ edit ] The book was reviewed by John R. Taylor , [ 2 ] among others.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It has also been recommended in other, more advanced, textbooks on the subject.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] According to physicists Yoni Kahn of Princeton University and Adam Anderson of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory , Griffiths' Introduction to Quantum Mechanics covers all materials needed for questions on quantum mechanics and atomic physics in the Physics Graduate Record Examinations (Physics GRE).
