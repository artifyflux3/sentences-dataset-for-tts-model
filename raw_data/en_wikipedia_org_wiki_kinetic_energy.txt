When they start rising, the kinetic energy begins to be converted to gravitational [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy"). The sum of kinetic and potential energy in the system remains constant, ignoring losses due to [rolling resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance "Rolling resistance") and [drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics) "Drag (physics)"). |

[Émilie du Châtelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89milie_du_Ch%C3%A2telet "Émilie du Châtelet") (1706–1749) was the first to publish the relation for kinetic energy ![Image 3: {\displaystyle E_{\text{kin}}\propto mv^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/167288255099338e01843213778f1f697d1a3a38), derived from the experimental observation of objects dropped into clay. (Portrait by [Maurice Quentin de La Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Quentin_de_La_Tour "Maurice Quentin de La Tour").)

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), the **kinetic energy** of an object is the form of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") that it possesses due to its [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-1)

In [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), the kinetic energy of a non-rotating object of [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass")_m_ traveling at a [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed")_v_ is ![Image 4: {\textstyle {\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/689701aed83c55c0c88edc47453833d1abeab74e).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-R&H-2)

The kinetic energy of an object is equal to the [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)"), or force ([F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force")) in the direction of motion times its displacement ([s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(geometry) "Displacement (geometry)")), needed to accelerate the object from [rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_(physics) "Rest (physics)") to its given speed. The same amount of work is done by the object when decelerating from its current [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed") to a state of rest.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-R&H-2)

The [SI unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") of energy is the [joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule "Joule"), while the [English unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Engineering_Units "English Engineering Units") of energy is the [foot-pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-pound "Foot-pound").

In [relativistic mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"), ![Image 5: {\textstyle {\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/689701aed83c55c0c88edc47453833d1abeab74e) is a good [approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation "Approximation") of kinetic energy only when _v_ is much less than the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light").

History and etymology
---------------------

The adjective _kinetic_ has its roots in the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") word κίνησις _kinesis_, meaning "motion". The dichotomy between kinetic energy and [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy") can be traced back to [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s concepts of [actuality and potentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuality_and_potentiality "Actuality and potentiality").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-3)

The principle of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") that _E_ ∝ _mv_ 2 is conserved was developed[_[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy\_dispute#Disputed\_statement "Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kinetic\_energy#Dubious "Talk:Kinetic energy")_] by [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz") and [Johann Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli "Johann Bernoulli"), who described kinetic energy as the _living force_ or _[vis viva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis\_viva "Vis viva")_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-4): 227 [Willem 's Gravesande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_%27s_Gravesande "Willem 's Gravesande") of the Netherlands provided experimental evidence of this relationship in 1722. By dropping weights from different heights into a block of clay, Gravesande determined that their penetration depth was proportional to the square of their impact speed. [Émilie du Châtelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89milie_du_Ch%C3%A2telet "Émilie du Châtelet") recognized the implications of the experiment and published an explanation.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-5)

The terms _kinetic energy_ and _work_ in their present scientific meanings date back to the mid-19th century. Early understandings of these ideas can be attributed to [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)"), who in his 1802 lecture to the Royal Society, was the first to use the term _energy_ to refer to kinetic energy in its modern sense, instead of _vis viva_. [Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard-Gustave_Coriolis "Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis") published in 1829 the paper titled _Du Calcul de l'Effet des Machines_ outlining the mathematics of kinetic energy. [William Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin "William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin"), later Lord Kelvin, is given the credit for coining the term "kinetic energy" c. 1849–1851.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-7)[William Rankine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rankine "William Rankine"), who had introduced the term "potential energy" in 1853, and the phrase "actual energy" to complement it,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-8) later cites [William Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin "William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin") and [Peter Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tait_(physicist) "Peter Tait (physicist)") as substituting the word "kinetic" for "actual".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-9)

Overview
--------

[Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") occurs in many forms, including [chemical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_energy "Chemical energy"), [thermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy "Thermal energy"), [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation"), [gravitational energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_energy "Gravitational energy"), [electric energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_energy "Electric energy"), [elastic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_energy "Elastic energy"), [nuclear energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy "Nuclear binding energy"), and [rest energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_energy "Rest energy"). These can be categorized in two main classes: [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy") and kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the movement energy of an object. Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-10)

Kinetic energy may be best understood by examples that demonstrate how it is transformed to and from other forms of energy. For example, a [cyclist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclist "Cyclist") transfers [chemical energy provided by food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_energy "Food energy") to the bicycle and cyclist's store of kinetic energy as they increase their speed. On a level surface, this speed can be maintained without further work, except to overcome [air resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics) "Drag (physics)") and [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction"). The chemical energy has been converted into kinetic energy, the energy of motion, but the process is not completely efficient and produces thermal energy within the cyclist.

The kinetic energy in the moving cyclist and the bicycle can be converted to other forms. For example, the cyclist could encounter a hill just high enough to coast up, so that the bicycle comes to a complete halt at the top. The kinetic energy has now largely been converted to gravitational potential energy that can be released by freewheeling down the other side of the hill. Since the bicycle lost some of its energy to friction, it never regains all of its speed without additional pedaling. The energy is not destroyed; it has only been converted to another form by friction. Alternatively, the cyclist could connect a [dynamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_dynamo "Bottle dynamo") to one of the wheels and generate some electrical energy on the descent. The bicycle would be traveling slower at the bottom of the hill than without the generator because some of the energy has been diverted into electrical energy. Another possibility would be for the cyclist to apply the brakes, in which case the kinetic energy would be dissipated through friction as [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat").

Like any physical quantity that is a function of velocity, the kinetic energy of an object depends on the relationship between the object and the observer's [frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference"). Thus, the kinetic energy of an object is not [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_invariance "Galilean invariance").

[Spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") use chemical energy to launch and gain considerable kinetic energy to reach [orbital velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed "Orbital speed"). In an entirely circular orbit, this kinetic energy remains constant because there is almost no friction in near-earth space. However, it becomes apparent at re-entry when some of the kinetic energy is converted to heat. If the orbit is [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit "Elliptic orbit") or [hyperbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_trajectory "Hyperbolic trajectory"), then throughout the orbit kinetic and [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy") are exchanged; kinetic energy is greatest and potential energy lowest at closest approach to the earth or other massive body, while potential energy is greatest and kinetic energy the lowest at maximum distance. Disregarding loss or gain however, the sum of the kinetic and potential energy remains constant.

Kinetic energy can be passed from one object to another. In the game of [billiards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiards "Billiards"), the player imposes kinetic energy on the cue ball by striking it with the cue stick. If the cue ball collides with another ball, it slows down dramatically, and the ball it hit accelerates as the kinetic energy is passed on to it. [Collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collisions "Collisions") in billiards are effectively [elastic collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision "Elastic collision"), in which kinetic energy is preserved. In [inelastic collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inelastic_collision "Inelastic collision"), kinetic energy is dissipated in various forms of energy, such as heat, sound and binding energy (breaking bound structures).

[Flywheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel "Flywheel") have been developed as a method of [energy storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage "Flywheel energy storage"). This illustrates that kinetic energy is also stored in rotational motion.

Several mathematical descriptions of kinetic energy exist that describe it in the appropriate physical situation. For objects and processes in common human experience, the formula ⁠1/2⁠mv 2 given by [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") is suitable. However, if the speed of the object is comparable to the speed of light, [relativistic effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") become significant and the relativistic formula is used. If the object is on the atomic or [sub-atomic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-atomic_scale "Sub-atomic scale"), [quantum mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanical "Quantum mechanical") effects are significant, and a quantum mechanical model must be employed.

Kinetic energy for non-relativistic velocity
--------------------------------------------

Treatments of kinetic energy depend upon the relative velocity of objects compared to the fixed [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"). Speeds experienced directly by humans are **non-relativisitic**; higher speeds require the [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity").

### Kinetic energy of rigid bodies

In [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), the kinetic energy of a _point object_ (an object so small that its mass can be assumed to exist at one point), or a non-rotating [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") depends on the [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") of the body as well as its [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed"). The kinetic energy is equal to half the [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication") of the mass and the square of the speed. In formula form:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3fe4395503647681d6282df4937207bf30bf5dd9)

where ![Image 7: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc) is the mass and ![Image 8: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) is the speed (magnitude of the velocity) of the body. In [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI") units, mass is measured in [kilograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram"), speed in [metres per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metres_per_second "Metres per second"), and the resulting kinetic energy is in [joules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule "Joule").

For example, one would calculate the kinetic energy of an 80 kg mass (about 180 lbs) traveling at 18 metres per second (about 40 mph, or 65 km/h) as

![Image 9: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}={\frac {1}{2}}\cdot 80\,{\text{kg}}\cdot \left(18\,{\text{m/s}}\right)^{2}=12,960\,{\text{J}}=12.96\,{\text{kJ}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1d3ea23e54bf7dde8e38eaef21876f7296091acb)

When a person throws a ball, the person does [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") on it to give it speed as it leaves the hand. The moving ball can then hit something and push it, doing work on what it hits. The kinetic energy of a moving object is equal to the work required to bring it from rest to that speed, or the work the object can do while being brought to rest: **net force × displacement = kinetic energy**, i.e.,

![Image 10: {\displaystyle Fs={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/69c392c47fce36ea6b3e831d61f125285e560f38)

Since the kinetic energy increases with the square of the speed, an object doubling its speed has four times as much kinetic energy. For example, a car traveling twice as fast as another requires four times as much distance to stop, assuming a constant braking force. As a consequence of this quadrupling, it takes four times the work to double the speed.

The kinetic energy of an object is related to its [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") by the equation: ![Image 11: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}={\frac {p^{2}}{2m}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/558732496342cbd68af16cafdeff4e390e9b56a2)

where:

*   ![Image 12: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36) is momentum
*   ![Image 13: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc) is mass of the body

For the _translational kinetic energy,_ that is the kinetic energy associated with [rectilinear motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectilinear_motion "Rectilinear motion"), of a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") with constant [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass")![Image 14: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc), whose [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") is moving in a straight line with speed ![Image 15: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597), as seen above is equal to

![Image 16: {\displaystyle E_{\text{t}}={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/67698b94624b9afd114a9ffca4c55353d9fe09a7)

where:

The kinetic energy of any entity depends on the reference frame in which it is measured. However, the total energy of an isolated system, i.e. one in which energy can neither enter nor leave, does not change over time in the reference frame in which it is measured. Thus, the chemical energy converted to kinetic energy by a rocket engine is divided differently between the rocket ship and its exhaust stream depending upon the chosen reference frame. This is called the [Oberth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect "Oberth effect"). But the total energy of the system, including kinetic energy, fuel chemical energy, heat, etc., is conserved over time, regardless of the choice of reference frame. Different observers moving with different reference frames would however disagree on the value of this conserved energy.

The kinetic energy of such systems depends on the choice of reference frame: the reference frame that gives the minimum value of that energy is the [center of momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_momentum "Center of momentum") frame, i.e. the reference frame in which the total momentum of the system is zero. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the [invariant mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass "Invariant mass") of the system as a whole.

#### Derivation

##### Without vector calculus

The work W done by a force _F_ on an object over a distance _s_ parallel to _F_ equals

![Image 17: {\displaystyle W=F\cdot s.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a970e400f46c95636a393346b1ae6f97f47d385c)

Using [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law "Newton's second law")

![Image 18: {\displaystyle F=ma}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ca4e42b7d6d66f52294364928cb5f7c590f514c)

with _m_ the mass and _a_ the [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration#Uniform_acceleration "Acceleration") of the object and

![Image 19: {\displaystyle s={\frac {at^{2}}{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc86011c2cedf6a5e2886d6e9dfd02a645eb7f33)

the distance traveled by the accelerated object in time _t_, we find with ![Image 20: {\displaystyle v=at}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ab8eed79a675337b2155d9be4004717b9e9a4c9) for the velocity _v_ of the object

![Image 21: {\displaystyle W=ma{\frac {at^{2}}{2}}={\frac {m(at)^{2}}{2}}={\frac {mv^{2}}{2}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/42b5e9ba4acc0734e1d53b862e2f5fa808b39780)

##### With vector calculus

The work done in accelerating a particle with mass _m_ during the infinitesimal time interval _dt_ is given by the dot product of _force_**F** and the infinitesimal _displacement_ _d_**x**

![Image 22: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {x} =\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} dt={\frac {d\mathbf {p} }{dt}}\cdot \mathbf {v} dt=\mathbf {v} \cdot d\mathbf {p} =\mathbf {v} \cdot d(m\mathbf {v} )\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e70c2eed00bb6c845e2237918874127228a2953)

where we have assumed the relationship **p**=_m_**v** and the validity of [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law "Newton's second law"). (However, also see the special relativistic derivation [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#Relativistic_kinetic_energy_of_rigid_bodies).)

Applying the [product rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule "Product rule") we see that:

![Image 23: {\displaystyle d(\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {v} )=(d\mathbf {v} )\cdot \mathbf {v} +\mathbf {v} \cdot (d\mathbf {v} )=2(\mathbf {v} \cdot d\mathbf {v} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02f09e02c1df7f87732a08473cf08c19c22308c9)

Therefore (assuming constant mass so that _dm_ = 0), we have

![Image 24: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} \cdot d(m\mathbf {v} )={\frac {m}{2}}d(\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {v} )={\frac {m}{2}}dv^{2}=d\left({\frac {mv^{2}}{2}}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8d91ba24815a4413f3d574735ea1194deb78b95c)

Since this is a [total differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_differential "Total differential") (that is, it only depends on the final state, not how the particle got there), we can integrate it and call the result kinetic energy:

![Image 25: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}=\int _{v_{1}}^{v_{2}}\mathbf {p} \cdot d\mathbf {v} =\int _{v_{1}}^{v_{2}}m\mathbf {v} \cdot d\mathbf {v} ={mv^{2} \over 2}{\bigg \vert }_{v_{1}}^{v_{2}}={1 \over 2}m(v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1225af9f18e1a6d6a4dae1dddf6cf2b61f52f280)

This equation states that the kinetic energy (_E_ k) is equal to the [integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") of the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") of the [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") (**p**) of a body and the [infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") change of the [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") (**v**) of the body. It is assumed that the body starts with no kinetic energy when it is at rest (motionless).

### Rotating bodies

If a rigid body Q is rotating about any line through the center of mass then it has [_rotational kinetic energy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_energy "Rotational energy") (![Image 26: {\displaystyle E_{\text{r}}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b569dd02f795addac571047a77bce131ad9dd5c2)) which is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of its moving parts, and is thus given by:

![Image 27: {\displaystyle E_{\text{r}}=\int _{Q}{\frac {v^{2}dm}{2}}=\int _{Q}{\frac {(r\omega )^{2}dm}{2}}={\frac {\omega ^{2}}{2}}\int _{Q}{r^{2}}dm={\frac {\omega ^{2}}{2}}I={\frac {1}{2}}I\omega ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0753180c8a737bd014d265c52cd4140b4d2f2c22)

where:

(In this equation the moment of [inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia "Inertia") must be taken about an axis through the center of mass and the rotation measured by ω must be around that axis; more general equations exist for systems where the object is subject to wobble due to its eccentric shape).

### Kinetic energy of systems

A system of bodies may have internal kinetic energy due to the relative motion of the bodies in the system. For example, in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") the planets and planetoids are orbiting the Sun. In a tank of gas, the molecules are moving in all directions. The kinetic energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies of the bodies it contains.

A macroscopic body that is stationary (i.e. a reference frame has been chosen to correspond to the body's [center of momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_momentum "Center of momentum")) may have various kinds of [internal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_energy "Internal energy") at the molecular or atomic level, which may be regarded as kinetic energy, due to molecular translation, rotation, and vibration, electron translation and spin, and nuclear spin. These all contribute to the body's mass, as provided by the special theory of relativity. When discussing movements of a macroscopic body, the kinetic energy referred to is usually that of the macroscopic movement only. However, all internal energies of all types contribute to a body's mass, inertia, and total energy.

### Fluid dynamics

In [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"), the kinetic energy per unit volume at each point in an incompressible fluid flow field is called the [dynamic pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pressure "Dynamic pressure") at that point.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-11)

![Image 28: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3fe4395503647681d6282df4937207bf30bf5dd9)

Dividing by V, the unit of volume:

![Image 29: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {E_{\text{k}}}{V}}&={\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {m}{V}}v^{2}\\q&={\frac {1}{2}}\rho v^{2}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f763ebdcdc434c2088d6fdb0fc813ce7ccce1483)

where ![Image 30: {\displaystyle q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06809d64fa7c817ffc7e323f85997f783dbdf71d) is the dynamic pressure, and ρ is the density of the incompressible fluid.

### Frame of reference

The speed, and thus the kinetic energy of a single object is frame-dependent (relative): it can take any non-negative value, by choosing a suitable [inertial frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference"). For example, a bullet passing an observer has kinetic energy in the reference frame of this observer. The same bullet is stationary to an observer moving with the same velocity as the bullet, and so has zero kinetic energy.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-12) By contrast, the total kinetic energy of a system of objects cannot be reduced to zero by a suitable choice of the inertial reference frame, unless all the objects have the same velocity. In any other case, the total kinetic energy has a non-zero minimum, as no inertial reference frame can be chosen in which all the objects are stationary. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the system's [invariant mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass "Invariant mass"), which is independent of the reference frame.

The total kinetic energy of a system depends on the [inertial frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference"): it is the sum of the total kinetic energy in a [center of momentum frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_momentum_frame "Center of momentum frame") and the kinetic energy the total mass would have if it were concentrated in the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass").

This may be simply shown: let ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \textstyle \mathbf {V} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2fce5593a61408934c8eda76759f756d4fe0a25c) be the relative velocity of the center of mass frame _i_ in the frame _k_. Since

![Image 32: {\displaystyle v^{2}=\left(v_{i}+V\right)^{2}=\left(\mathbf {v} _{i}+\mathbf {V} \right)\cdot \left(\mathbf {v} _{i}+\mathbf {V} \right)=\mathbf {v} _{i}\cdot \mathbf {v} _{i}+2\mathbf {v} _{i}\cdot \mathbf {V} +\mathbf {V} \cdot \mathbf {V} =v_{i}^{2}+2\mathbf {v} _{i}\cdot \mathbf {V} +V^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e5ddcb085de8b874425b03fab72413dde1d3742f)

Then,

![Image 33: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}=\int {\frac {v^{2}}{2}}dm=\int {\frac {v_{i}^{2}}{2}}dm+\mathbf {V} \cdot \int \mathbf {v} _{i}dm+{\frac {V^{2}}{2}}\int dm.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/13f2e14b365ca3eb167ef01b35069f49d17678b9)

However, let ![Image 34: {\textstyle \int {\frac {v_{i}^{2}}{2}}dm=E_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/75f0e76e8f9043ea5f8a1523f6d57bbdb5fcb84a) the kinetic energy in the center of mass frame, ![Image 35: {\textstyle \int \mathbf {v} _{i}dm}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bbd4ac48bc9617d1cb390495b92f42f235d6bb78) would be simply the total momentum that is by definition zero in the center of mass frame, and let the total mass: ![Image 36: {\textstyle \int dm=M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/96d04cc988fd6a5a14ddbebe108de01211f960bc). Substituting, we get:[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-13)

![Image 37: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}=E_{i}+{\frac {MV^{2}}{2}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cbf9570dcaba8fc06e0edd436a22caee1633d3ca)

Thus the kinetic energy of a system is lowest to center of momentum reference frames, i.e., frames of reference in which the center of mass is stationary (either the [center of mass frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass_frame "Center of mass frame") or any other [center of momentum frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_momentum_frame "Center of momentum frame")). In any different frame of reference, there is additional kinetic energy corresponding to the total mass moving at the speed of the center of mass. The kinetic energy of the system in the [center of momentum frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_momentum_frame "Center of momentum frame") is a quantity that is invariant (all observers see it to be the same).

### Rotation in systems

It sometimes is convenient to split the total kinetic energy of a body into the sum of the body's center-of-mass translational kinetic energy and the energy of rotation around the center of mass ([rotational energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_energy "Rotational energy")):

![Image 38: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}=E_{\text{t}}+E_{\text{r}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e95bdc6a6590681b52c13baaf88ceec68fbf3216)

where:

*   _E_ k is the total kinetic energy
*   _E_ t is the translational kinetic energy
*   _E_ r is the _rotational energy_ or _angular kinetic energy_ in the rest frame

Thus the kinetic energy of a tennis ball in flight is the kinetic energy due to its rotation, plus the kinetic energy due to its translation.

Relativistic kinetic energy
---------------------------

If a body's speed relative to an inertial frame is a significant fraction of the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), it is necessary to use relativistic mechanics to calculate its kinetic energy relative to that frame. In relativistic mechanics, energy combines with momentum in a way analogous to the combination of time and space into [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"). The energy component in the inertial frame can be expressed as:[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-TaylorWheeler-1992-14): 195 ![Image 39: {\displaystyle E=\gamma m,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49039c82ecf470567dfaa4970eee1e312f408945) where ![Image 40: {\textstyle \gamma =1/{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16a28ea842c016e78a603843b6bbbb136e0418e7) and ![Image 41: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc) is the object's [(rest) mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass "Invariant mass"), ![Image 42: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) speed, and _c_ the speed of light in vacuum. If the body is at rest in the inertial frame, ![Image 43: {\displaystyle v=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba3d414a23bf4ecfa36cdd039241efc60a5bd9e0) and ![Image 44: {\displaystyle \gamma =1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5682ebb86d6f024a15f4a2c1c7cb08412720bcaf), so ![Image 45: {\displaystyle E_{\textrm {rest}}=m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/061f655a2c49340b7eba37720ce58631cb022b66).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-TaylorWheeler-1992-14): 201  The rest energy of an object is its rest mass in units where ![Image 46: {\displaystyle c=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3e3467f9e219a5ea38a30da5c3a02c2c23f61a79). In [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") units, ![Image 47: {\displaystyle E_{\textrm {rest}}=mc^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d81bdb88d3ba0eea3cd78ac4acbc5ffbac5ee0c). The kinetic energy can then be defined as the total energy minus the rest energy:[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-TaylorWheeler-1992-14): 201 ![Image 48: {\displaystyle ({\textrm {kinetic}}\ {\textrm {energy}})=({\textrm {energy}})-({\textrm {rest}}\ {\textrm {energy}}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20f1ae059ebc51ad018933a3bc99594160e268e0)

Another way to describe the kinetic energy is to start with the total energy given by the [energy-momentum relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-momentum_relation "Energy-momentum relation"):

![Image 49: {\displaystyle E^{2}=(p{\textrm {c}})^{2}+\left(m{\textrm {c}}^{2}\right)^{2}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/de7d04f20373087bede06254d067fc44ce7470d0)

Here ![Image 50: {\displaystyle p=m\gamma v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b296776d9f129fec70e3696fc4fbc1255c3e287) is the relativistic expression for linear momentum, where ![Image 51: {\textstyle \gamma =1/{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16a28ea842c016e78a603843b6bbbb136e0418e7) and ![Image 52: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc) is the object's [(rest) mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass "Invariant mass"), ![Image 53: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) speed, and _c_ the speed of light in vacuum. Then kinetic energy is the [total relativistic energy minus the rest energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93momentum_relation#Connection_to_E_=_mc2 "Energy–momentum relation"): ![Image 54: {\displaystyle E_{K}=E-m_{0}c^{2}={\sqrt {(p{\textrm {c}})^{2}+\left(m{\textrm {c}}^{2}\right)^{2}}}-m_{0}c^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6892d598a9361f8c46e0e427f6966885e371653b)

At low speeds, the square root can be expanded and the rest energy drops out, giving the Newtonian kinetic energy.

[![Image 55](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/KEvsMOMENTUM.png/450px-KEvsMOMENTUM.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KEvsMOMENTUM.png)

 Log of relativistic kinetic energy versus log relativistic momentum, for many objects of vastly different scales. The intersections of the object lines with the bottom axis approaches the rest energy. At low kinetic energy the slope of the object lines reflect Newtonian mechanics. As the lines approach ![Image 56: {\displaystyle c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455) the slope bends at the lightspeed barrier.

### Low speed limit

The mathematical by-product of this calculation is the [mass–energy equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence "Mass–energy equivalence") formula, that mass and energy are essentially the same thing:[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-Einstein1922-15): 51 [[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-16): 121

![Image 57: {\displaystyle E_{\text{rest}}=mc^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3340ccc345e8d0c7408e11ac92ab3950333be9e0)

At a low speed (_v_ ≪ _c_), the relativistic kinetic energy is approximated well by the classical kinetic energy. To see this, apply the [binomial approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_approximation "Binomial approximation") or take the first two terms of the [Taylor expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_expansion "Taylor expansion") in powers of ![Image 58: {\displaystyle v^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4faa98a21ac8133ab466999288849492be28b3d1) for the reciprocal square root:[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-Einstein1922-15): 51

![Image 59: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}\approx mc^{2}\left(1+{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\right)-mc^{2}={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7c395e82a0ee909de937f8fa787d7503edcc67a4)

So, the total energy ![Image 60: {\displaystyle E_{k}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7587849b44d775263271e89499f4327eeac5dc81) can be partitioned into the rest mass energy plus the non-relativistic kinetic energy at low speeds.

When objects move at a speed much slower than light (e.g. in everyday phenomena on Earth), the first two terms of the series predominate. The next term in the Taylor series approximation

![Image 61: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}\approx mc^{2}\left(1+{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}+{\frac {3}{8}}{\frac {v^{4}}{c^{4}}}\right)-mc^{2}={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}+{\frac {3}{8}}m{\frac {v^{4}}{c^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b0eb384d3b48e0d9ed727f0e77afb8545feb9b73)

is small for low speeds. For example, for a speed of 10 km/s (22,000 mph) the correction to the non-relativistic kinetic energy is 0.0417 J/kg (on a non-relativistic kinetic energy of 50 MJ/kg) and for a speed of 100 km/s it is 417 J/kg (on a non-relativistic kinetic energy of 5 GJ/kg).

The relativistic relation between kinetic energy and momentum is given by

![Image 62: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}={\sqrt {p^{2}c^{2}+m^{2}c^{4}}}-mc^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd11e7bc315624e7d27ed2258de4afddcb4a44f8)

This can also be expanded as a [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series "Taylor series"), the first term of which is the simple expression from Newtonian mechanics:[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#cite_note-17)

![Image 63: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}\approx {\frac {p^{2}}{2m}}-{\frac {p^{4}}{8m^{3}c^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bcd1ecd7a0f9a3ee5ff1280d474dc946edd70ee2)
This suggests that the formulae for energy and momentum are not special and axiomatic, but concepts emerging from the equivalence of mass and energy and the principles of relativity.

### General relativity

Using the convention that

![Image 64: {\displaystyle g_{\alpha \beta }\,u^{\alpha }\,u^{\beta }\,=\,-c^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b80f85569fd2cc8427a40acc059cbc6a642ade1a)

where the [four-velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-velocity "Four-velocity") of a particle is

![Image 65: {\displaystyle u^{\alpha }\,=\,{\frac {dx^{\alpha }}{d\tau }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/590a832fa927b18c99c655612e1ed772fc8bb3cf)

and ![Image 66: {\displaystyle \tau }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38a7dcde9730ef0853809fefc18d88771f95206c) is the [proper time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time "Proper time") of the particle, there is also an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle in [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity").

If the particle has momentum

![Image 67: {\displaystyle p_{\beta }\,=\,m\,g_{\beta \alpha }\,u^{\alpha }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fac56f4780a74b03e504e3632ff8531a06ef108f)

as it passes by an observer with four-velocity _u_ obs, then the expression for total energy of the particle as observed (measured in a local inertial frame) is

![Image 68: {\displaystyle E\,=\,-\,p_{\beta }\,u_{\text{obs}}^{\beta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb06940c5dea9257a446738f54eae5025a9c43eb)

and the kinetic energy can be expressed as the total energy minus the rest energy:

![Image 69: {\displaystyle E_{k}\,=\,-\,p_{\beta }\,u_{\text{obs}}^{\beta }\,-\,m\,c^{2}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac20132d0de0d2f0081d627665ef7a1854eb04b6)

Consider the case of a metric that is diagonal and spatially isotropic (_g_ _tt_, _g_ _ss_, _g_ _ss_, _g_ _ss_). Since

![Image 70: {\displaystyle u^{\alpha }={\frac {dx^{\alpha }}{dt}}{\frac {dt}{d\tau }}=v^{\alpha }u^{t}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/58234444527ae29e2400ca87884f55959319e93d)

where _v_ α is the ordinary velocity measured w.r.t. the coordinate system, we get

![Image 71: {\displaystyle -c^{2}=g_{\alpha \beta }u^{\alpha }u^{\beta }=g_{tt}\left(u^{t}\right)^{2}+g_{ss}v^{2}\left(u^{t}\right)^{2}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/378a7fc27fcec901aea79e82941f34fe3b4097df)

Solving for _u_ t gives

![Image 72: {\displaystyle u^{t}=c{\sqrt {\frac {-1}{g_{tt}+g_{ss}v^{2}}}}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/84da52ec1237ff6751e671764fa2c4dc2a532d6f)

Thus for a stationary observer (_v_ = 0)

![Image 73: {\displaystyle u_{\text{obs}}^{t}=c{\sqrt {\frac {-1}{g_{tt}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e71ae55733c0f90e9a0b886ba99a7e08938bd375)

and thus the kinetic energy takes the form

![Image 74: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}=-mg_{tt}u^{t}u_{\text{obs}}^{t}-mc^{2}=mc^{2}{\sqrt {\frac {g_{tt}}{g_{tt}+g_{ss}v^{2}}}}-mc^{2}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45db3f8527096ca42e44be7c33d9f0abc27429db)

Factoring out the rest energy gives:

![Image 75: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}=mc^{2}\left({\sqrt {\frac {g_{tt}}{g_{tt}+g_{ss}v^{2}}}}-1\right)\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9608aecac2a83aff9e45831be8594de3a12da048)

This expression reduces to the special relativistic case for the flat-space metric where

![Image 76: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}g_{tt}&=-c^{2}\\g_{ss}&=1\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c9120c9858564101689d216ac5b9caf5b722d67)

In the Newtonian approximation to general relativity

![Image 77: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}g_{tt}&=-\left(c^{2}+2\Phi \right)\\g_{ss}&=1-{\frac {2\Phi }{c^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/135968cca6b455dfaf7a92d27386ae842ce36c19)

where Φ is the Newtonian [gravitational potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential "Gravitational potential"). This means clocks run slower and measuring rods are shorter near massive bodies.

Kinetic energy in quantum mechanics
-----------------------------------

In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), observables like kinetic energy are represented as [operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics) "Operator (physics)"). For one particle of mass _m_, the kinetic energy operator appears as a term in the [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics) "Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)") and is defined in terms of the more fundamental momentum operator ![Image 78: {\displaystyle {\hat {p}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8bd4c026f1b3413adc58b9b65e89e62bce92c85a). The kinetic energy operator in the [non-relativistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_quantum_mechanics#Non-relativistic_and_relativistic_Hamiltonians "Relativistic quantum mechanics") case can be written as

![Image 79: {\displaystyle {\hat {T}}={\frac {{\hat {p}}^{2}}{2m}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3c8b54fcc1e23ef7bdf7e0ef90ce2e39ed830ac7)

Notice that this can be obtained by replacing ![Image 80: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36) by ![Image 81: {\displaystyle {\hat {p}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8bd4c026f1b3413adc58b9b65e89e62bce92c85a) in the classical expression for kinetic energy in terms of [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"),

![Image 82: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}={\frac {p^{2}}{2m}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7041db2558d1e6e149508a392076a3eeea7fc1be)

In the [Schrödinger picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_picture "Schrödinger picture"), ![Image 83: {\displaystyle {\hat {p}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8bd4c026f1b3413adc58b9b65e89e62bce92c85a) takes the form ![Image 84: {\displaystyle -i\hbar \nabla }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7282d9d33646ecea0e5441adc5b48e535a703db6) where the derivative is taken with respect to position coordinates and hence

![Image 85: {\displaystyle {\hat {T}}=-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\nabla ^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/147dd6a27d8746092989005194552ba14cfa8077)

The expectation value of the electron kinetic energy, ![Image 86: {\displaystyle \left\langle {\hat {T}}\right\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/03d71a29760cb8580d1d9e2eede254da1534f744), for a system of _N_ electrons described by the [wavefunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function "Wave function")![Image 87: {\displaystyle \vert \psi \rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8addc466341daafbbf224730defba59505d1e760) is a sum of 1-electron operator expectation values:

![Image 88: {\displaystyle \left\langle {\hat {T}}\right\rangle =\left\langle \psi \left\vert \sum _{i=1}^{N}{\frac {-\hbar ^{2}}{2m_{\text{e}}}}\nabla _{i}^{2}\right\vert \psi \right\rangle =-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m_{\text{e}}}}\sum _{i=1}^{N}\left\langle \psi \left\vert \nabla _{i}^{2}\right\vert \psi \right\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa88e2c6bca46a10409fcf958dd865603028d9cb)

where ![Image 89: {\displaystyle m_{\text{e}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c45a5eb082ea4dafd3cb43ca39e033989e4a52eb) is the mass of the electron and ![Image 90: {\displaystyle \nabla _{i}^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/036dc2fbf8e2560ea75b0b67841cb36e83dfab1c) is the [Laplacian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian "Laplacian") operator acting upon the coordinates of the _i_ th electron and the summation runs over all electrons.

The [density functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory "Density functional theory") formalism of quantum mechanics requires knowledge of the electron density _only_, i.e., it formally does not require knowledge of the wavefunction. Given an electron density ![Image 91: {\displaystyle \rho (\mathbf {r} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77f477411625125978c0a18946bdfae2c1f13bcb), the exact N-electron kinetic energy functional is unknown; however, for the specific case of a 1-electron system, the kinetic energy can be written as

![Image 92: {\displaystyle T[\rho ]={\frac {1}{8}}\int {\frac {\nabla \rho (\mathbf {r} )\cdot \nabla \rho (\mathbf {r} )}{\rho (\mathbf {r} )}}d^{3}r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/25c6547c29b24c193b6dc8a0276e1e820cfb8da6)

where ![Image 93: {\displaystyle T[\rho ]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9f33f6be9ea929173b30036aae6d57718be7b9c) is known as the [von Weizsäcker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_von_Weizs%C3%A4cker "Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker") kinetic energy functional.
