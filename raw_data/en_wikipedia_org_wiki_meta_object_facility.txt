The Meta-Object Facility ( MOF ) is an Object Management Group (OMG) standard for model-driven engineering . Its purpose is to provide a type system for entities in the CORBA architecture and a set of interfaces through which those types can be created and manipulated.
MOF may be used for domain-driven software design and object-oriented modelling .

[ 1 ] : 15 Overview [ edit ] MOF was developed to provide a type system for use in the CORBA architecture, a set of schemas by which the structure, meaning and behaviour of objects could be defined, and a set of CORBA interfaces through which these schemas could be created, stored and manipulated.

[ 2 ] MOF is designed as a four-layered architecture. It provides a meta-meta model at the top layer, called the M3 layer. This M3-model is the language used by MOF to build metamodels, called M2-models. The most prominent example of a Layer 2 MOF model is the UML metamodel, the model that describes the UML itself. These M2-models describe elements of the M1-layer, and thus M1-models. These would be, for example, models written in UML. The last layer is the M0-layer or data layer. It is used to describe real-world objects.

Beyond the M3-model, MOF describes the means to create and manipulate models and metamodels by defining CORBA interfaces that describe those operations. Because of the similarities between the MOF M3-model and UML structure models, MOF metamodels are usually modeled as UML class diagrams.

File formats [ edit ] A conversion from MOF specification models (M3-, M2-, or M1-Layer) to W3C XML and XSD are specified by the XMI (ISO/IEC 19503) specification. XMI is an XML-based exchange format for models.

[ 1 ] : xi From MOF to Java™ there is the Java Metadata Interchange (JMI) specification by Java Community Process .

[ 1 ] : xi It also provides specs to make easier automatic CORBA IDL interfaces generation.

[ 1 ] : 3 Metamodeling architecture [ edit ] MOF is a closed metamodeling architecture; it defines an M3-model, which conforms to itself. MOF allows a strict meta-modeling architecture; every model element on every layer is strictly in correspondence with a model element of the layer above. MOF only provides a means to define the structure, or abstract syntax of a language or of data. For defining metamodels, MOF plays exactly the role that EBNF plays for defining programming language grammars. MOF is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) used to define metamodels, just as EBNF is a DSL for defining grammars. Similarly to EBNF, MOF could be defined in MOF.

In short, MOF uses the notion of MOF::Classes (not to be confused with UML::Classes ), as known from object orientation , to define concepts (model elements) on a metalayer. MOF may be used to define object-oriented metamodels (as UML for example) as well as non object-oriented metamodels (e.g. a Petri net or a Web Service metamodel).

As of May 2006, the OMG has defined two compliance points for MOF: EMOF for Essential MOF [ 1 ] CMOF for Complete MOF [ 1 ] In June 2006, a request for proposal was issued by OMG for a third variant, SMOF (Semantic MOF).

The variant ECore that has been defined in the Eclipse Modeling Framework is more or less aligned on OMG's EMOF.

Another related standard is OCL , which describes a formal language that can be used to define model constraints in terms of predicate logic .

QVT , which introduces means to query, view and transform MOF-based models, is a very important standard, approved in 2008.  See Model Transformation Language for further information.

International standard [ edit ] MOF is an international standard: MOF 2.4.2 ISO / IEC 19508:2014 Information technology — Object Management Group Meta Object Facility (MOF) Core MOF 1.4 ISO / IEC 19502:2005 Information technology — Meta Object Facility (MOF) MOF can be viewed as a standard to write metamodels , for example in order to model the abstract syntax of Domain Specific Languages .

Kermeta is an extension to MOF allowing executable actions to be attached to EMOF meta-models, hence making it possible to also model a DSL operational semantics and readily obtain an interpreter for it.

JMI defines a Java API for manipulating MOF models.

OMG's MOF is not to be confused with the Managed Object Format (MOF) defined by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) in section 6 of the Common Information Model (CIM) Infrastructure Specification, version 2.5.0.
