Norman Duncan Kemp Smith , FBA , FRSE (5 May 1872 – 3 September 1958) was a Scottish philosopher who was Professor of Psychology (1906–1914) and Philosophy (1914–1919) at Princeton University and was Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh (1919–1945).

[ 1 ] Smith is noted for his 1929 English translation of Immanuel Kant 's Critique of Pure Reason , which for a long time was considered the standard version.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Norman Smith was born on 5 May 1872 [ 4 ] in Dundee , Scotland, [ 5 ] the son of a cabinet-maker on the Nethergate.

[ 6 ] He was educated in Dundee and then studied mental philosophy at the University of St Andrews , graduating with an MA with first-class honours in 1893.

[ 7 ] He received his doctorate (PhD) in 1902.

Career [ edit ] Smith lectured in philosophy and psychology at Princeton University from 1906 to 1916, and at the University of Edinburgh from 1919 until his retirement in 1945.

[ citation needed ] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1921. His proposers were Ralph Allan Sampson , Thomas James Jehu , Charles Glover Barkla and Charles Sarolea .

[ 8 ] In 1932 he delivered the Adamson Lecture [ 9 ] of the Victoria University of Manchester .

In 1938 he moved to 14 Kilgraston Road in south Edinburgh, a house designed by Sir Robert Matthew .

[ 10 ] His translation of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is often used as the standard English version of the text.

A portrait by the Edinburgh artist Adam Bruce Thomson is held by the University of Edinburgh's Fine Art Collection.

[ 11 ] Kemp Smith died on 3 September 1958 in Edinburgh .
