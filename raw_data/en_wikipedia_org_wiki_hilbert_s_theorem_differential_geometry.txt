This theorem answers the question for the negative case of which surfaces in R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} can be obtained by isometrically immersing complete manifolds with constant curvature .

History [ edit ] Hilbert's theorem was first treated by David Hilbert in "Über Flächen von konstanter Krümmung" ( Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.

2 (1901), 87–99).

A different proof was given shortly after by E. Holmgren in "Sur les surfaces à courbure constante négative" (1902).

A far-leading generalization was obtained by Nikolai Efimov in 1975.

[ 1 ] Proof [ edit ] The proof of Hilbert's theorem is elaborate and requires several lemmas . The idea is to show the nonexistence of an isometric immersion φ φ = ψ ψ ∘ ∘ exp p : S ′ ⟶ ⟶ R 3 {\displaystyle \varphi =\psi \circ \exp _{p}:S'\longrightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{3}} of a plane S ′ {\displaystyle S'} to the real space R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} . This proof is basically the same as in Hilbert's paper, although based in the books of Do Carmo and Spivak .

Observations : In order to have a more manageable treatment, but without loss of generality , the curvature may be considered equal to minus one, K = − − 1 {\displaystyle K=-1} . There is no loss of generality, since it is being dealt with constant curvatures, and similarities of R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} multiply K {\displaystyle K} by a constant. The exponential map exp p : T p ( S ) ⟶ ⟶ S {\displaystyle \exp _{p}:T_{p}(S)\longrightarrow S} is a local diffeomorphism (in fact a covering map, by Cartan-Hadamard theorem), therefore, it induces an inner product in the tangent space of S {\displaystyle S} at p {\displaystyle p} : T p ( S ) {\displaystyle T_{p}(S)} . Furthermore, S ′ {\displaystyle S'} denotes the geometric surface T p ( S ) {\displaystyle T_{p}(S)} with this inner product. If ψ ψ : S ⟶ ⟶ R 3 {\displaystyle \psi :S\longrightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{3}} is an isometric immersion, the same holds for φ φ = ψ ψ ∘ ∘ exp o : S ′ ⟶ ⟶ R 3 {\displaystyle \varphi =\psi \circ \exp _{o}:S'\longrightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{3}} .

The first lemma is independent from the other ones, and will be used at the end as the counter statement to reject the results from the other lemmas.

Lemma 1 : The area of S ′ {\displaystyle S'} is infinite.

Proof's Sketch: The idea of the proof is to create a global isometry between H {\displaystyle H} and S ′ {\displaystyle S'} . Then, since H {\displaystyle H} has an infinite area, S ′ {\displaystyle S'} will have it too.

The fact that the hyperbolic plane H {\displaystyle H} has an infinite area comes by computing the surface integral with the corresponding coefficients of the First fundamental form . To obtain these ones, the hyperbolic plane can be defined as the plane with the following inner product around a point q ∈ ∈ R 2 {\displaystyle q\in \mathbb {R} ^{2}} with coordinates ( u , v ) {\displaystyle (u,v)} E = ⟨ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ u , ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ u ⟩ = 1 F = ⟨ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ u , ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ v ⟩ = ⟨ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ v , ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ u ⟩ = 0 G = ⟨ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ v , ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ v ⟩ = e u {\displaystyle E=\left\langle {\frac {\partial }{\partial u}},{\frac {\partial }{\partial u}}\right\rangle =1\qquad F=\left\langle {\frac {\partial }{\partial u}},{\frac {\partial }{\partial v}}\right\rangle =\left\langle {\frac {\partial }{\partial v}},{\frac {\partial }{\partial u}}\right\rangle =0\qquad G=\left\langle {\frac {\partial }{\partial v}},{\frac {\partial }{\partial v}}\right\rangle =e^{u}} Since the hyperbolic plane is unbounded, the limits of the integral are infinite , and the area can be calculated through ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ e u d u d v = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }e^{u}dudv=\infty } Next it is needed to create a map, which will show that the global information from the hyperbolic plane can be transfer to the surface S ′ {\displaystyle S'} , i.e. a global isometry.

φ φ : H → → S ′ {\displaystyle \varphi :H\rightarrow S'} will be the map, whose domain is the hyperbolic plane and image the 2-dimensional manifold S ′ {\displaystyle S'} , which carries the inner product from the surface S {\displaystyle S} with negative curvature.

φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } will be defined via the exponential map, its inverse, and a linear isometry between their tangent spaces, ψ ψ : T p ( H ) → → T p ′ ( S ′ ) {\displaystyle \psi :T_{p}(H)\rightarrow T_{p'}(S')} .

That is φ φ = exp p ′ ∘ ∘ ψ ψ ∘ ∘ exp p − − 1 {\displaystyle \varphi =\exp _{p'}\circ \psi \circ \exp _{p}^{-1}} , where p ∈ ∈ H , p ′ ∈ ∈ S ′ {\displaystyle p\in H,p'\in S'} . That is to say, the starting point p ∈ ∈ H {\displaystyle p\in H} goes to the tangent plane from H {\displaystyle H} through the inverse of the exponential map. Then travels from one tangent plane to the other through the isometry ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } , and then down to the surface S ′ {\displaystyle S'} with another exponential map.

The following step involves the use of polar coordinates , ( ρ ρ , θ θ ) {\displaystyle (\rho ,\theta )} and ( ρ ρ ′ , θ θ ′ ) {\displaystyle (\rho ',\theta ')} , around p {\displaystyle p} and p ′ {\displaystyle p'} respectively. The requirement will be that the axis are mapped to each other, that is θ θ = 0 {\displaystyle \theta =0} goes to θ θ ′ = 0 {\displaystyle \theta '=0} . Then φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } preserves the first fundamental form.

In a geodesic polar system, the Gaussian curvature K {\displaystyle K} can be expressed as K = − − ( G ) ρ ρ ρ ρ G {\displaystyle K=-{\frac {({\sqrt {G}})_{\rho \rho }}{\sqrt {G}}}} .

In addition K is constant and fulfills the following differential equation ( G ) ρ ρ ρ ρ + K ⋅ ⋅ G = 0 {\displaystyle ({\sqrt {G}})_{\rho \rho }+K\cdot {\sqrt {G}}=0} Since H {\displaystyle H} and S ′ {\displaystyle S'} have the same constant Gaussian curvature, then they are locally isometric ( Minding's Theorem ). That means that φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is a local isometry between H {\displaystyle H} and S ′ {\displaystyle S'} . Furthermore, from the Hadamard's theorem it follows that φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is also a covering map.

Since S ′ {\displaystyle S'} is simply connected, φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is a homeomorphism, and hence, a (global) isometry. Therefore, H {\displaystyle H} and S ′ {\displaystyle S'} are globally isometric, and because H {\displaystyle H} has an infinite area, then S ′ = T p ( S ) {\displaystyle S'=T_{p}(S)} has an infinite area, as well.

◻ ◻ {\displaystyle \square } Lemma 2 : For each p ∈ ∈ S ′ {\displaystyle p\in S'} exists a parametrization x : U ⊂ ⊂ R 2 ⟶ ⟶ S ′ , p ∈ ∈ x ( U ) {\displaystyle x:U\subset \mathbb {R} ^{2}\longrightarrow S',\qquad p\in x(U)} , such that the coordinate curves of x {\displaystyle x} are asymptotic curves of x ( U ) = V ′ {\displaystyle x(U)=V'} and form a Tchebyshef net.

Lemma 3 : Let V ′ ⊂ ⊂ S ′ {\displaystyle V'\subset S'} be a coordinate neighborhood of S ′ {\displaystyle S'} such that the coordinate curves are asymptotic curves in V ′ {\displaystyle V'} . Then the area A of any quadrilateral formed by the coordinate curves is smaller than 2 π π {\displaystyle 2\pi } .

The next goal is to show that x {\displaystyle x} is a parametrization of S ′ {\displaystyle S'} .

Lemma 4 : For a fixed t {\displaystyle t} , the curve x ( s , t ) , − − ∞ ∞ < s < + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle x(s,t),-\infty <s<+\infty } , is an asymptotic curve with s {\displaystyle s} as arc length.

The following 2 lemmas together with lemma 8 will demonstrate the existence of a parametrization x : R 2 ⟶ ⟶ S ′ {\displaystyle x:\mathbb {R} ^{2}\longrightarrow S'} Lemma 5 : x {\displaystyle x} is a local diffeomorphism.

Lemma 6 : x {\displaystyle x} is surjective .

Lemma 7 : On S ′ {\displaystyle S'} there are two differentiable linearly independent vector fields which are tangent to the asymptotic curves of S ′ {\displaystyle S'} .

Lemma 8 : x {\displaystyle x} is injective .

Proof of Hilbert's Theorem: First, it will be assumed that an isometric immersion from a complete surface S {\displaystyle S} with negative curvature exists: ψ ψ : S ⟶ ⟶ R 3 {\displaystyle \psi :S\longrightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{3}} As stated in the observations, the tangent plane T p ( S ) {\displaystyle T_{p}(S)} is endowed with the metric induced by the exponential map exp p : T p ( S ) ⟶ ⟶ S {\displaystyle \exp _{p}:T_{p}(S)\longrightarrow S} . Moreover, φ φ = ψ ψ ∘ ∘ exp p : S ′ ⟶ ⟶ R 3 {\displaystyle \varphi =\psi \circ \exp _{p}:S'\longrightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{3}} is an isometric immersion and Lemmas 5,6, and 8 show the existence of a parametrization x : R 2 ⟶ ⟶ S ′ {\displaystyle x:\mathbb {R} ^{2}\longrightarrow S'} of the whole S ′ {\displaystyle S'} , such that the coordinate curves of x {\displaystyle x} are the asymptotic curves of S ′ {\displaystyle S'} . This result was provided by Lemma 4. Therefore, S ′ {\displaystyle S'} can be covered by a union of "coordinate" quadrilaterals Q n {\displaystyle Q_{n}} with Q n ⊂ ⊂ Q n + 1 {\displaystyle Q_{n}\subset Q_{n+1}} . By Lemma 3, the area of each quadrilateral is smaller than 2 π π {\displaystyle 2\pi } . On the other hand, by Lemma 1, the area of S ′ {\displaystyle S'} is infinite, therefore has no bounds. This is a contradiction and the proof is concluded.
