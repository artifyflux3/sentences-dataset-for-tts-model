John L. Kelley Alexander Doniphan Wallace Gordon Thomas Whyburn (January 7, 1904, Lewisville, Texas – September 8, 1969, Charlottesville, Virginia ) was an American mathematician who worked on topology .

[ 1 ] Whyburn studied at the University of Texas, Austin , where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1925. Under the influence of his teacher Robert Lee Moore , Whyburn continued to study at Austin but changed to mathematics and earned a master's degree in mathematics in 1926 and then a PhD in 1927. After two years as an adjunct professor at U. of Texas, with the aid of a Guggenheim fellowship Whyburn spent the academic year 1929/1930 in Vienna with Hans Hahn and in Warsaw with Kuratowski and Sierpinski . After the fellowship expired, Whyburn became a professor at Johns Hopkins University .

From 1934, he was a professor at the University of Virginia , where he modernized the mathematics department and spent the rest of his career. He was chair of the department until his first heart attack in 1966; Edward J. McShane joined the department in 1935, and Gustav A. Hedlund was a member of the department from 1939 to 1948. In the academic year 1952/1953 Whyburn was a visiting professor at Stanford University . In 1953–54, he served as president of the American Mathematical Society .

Whyburn was awarded the Chauvenet Prize in 1938 for his paper "On the Structure of Continua", [ 2 ] and was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1951. His doctoral students include John L. Kelley and Alexander Doniphan Wallace .

[ 3 ] His brother William Marvin Whyburn (1901–1972) was a mathematics professor at UCLA and became known for his work on ordinary differential equations.
