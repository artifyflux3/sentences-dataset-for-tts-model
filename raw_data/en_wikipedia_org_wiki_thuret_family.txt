For other uses, see Thuret (disambiguation) .

The Thuret family of clockmakers established themselves as one of the outstanding craftsman-dynasties in 17th- and 18th-century Paris . Their clocks are signed "Thuret", and distinguishing which member of the Thuret family made a specific clock is sometimes an unrewarding effort.

History [ edit ] Isaac II Thuret (1630–1706), one of the first French clockmakers to make pendulum clocks , [ 1 ] held the royal appointment. His son Jacques III Thuret (1669–1738), was appointed clockmaker to Louis XIV of France in 1694. A perquisite of the royal appointment was the use of workshops in the Galeries du Louvre , where since the time of Henri IV , the outstanding artists, designers and craftsmen were granted workshop spaces, fostering cross-fertilisation among the arts. As one consequence there are numerous clocks by the Thuret dynasty in cases of rich tortoiseshell and brass marquetry designed by André Charles Boulle ; one such remarkable clock by Jacques Thuret or his father is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

[ 2 ] Another example, the Barometer Clock , is at the Frick Collection , also in New York.

[ 3 ] Jacques III Thuret married a daughter of the royal designer Jean Bérain the Elder , whose designs he assembled and published; his daughter Suzanne married the painter, draughtsman and engraver Charles François Silvestre .
