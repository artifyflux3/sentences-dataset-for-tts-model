The history of [loop quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity "Loop quantum gravity") spans more than three decades of intense research.

### Classical theories of gravitation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_loop_quantum_gravity&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Classical theories of gravitation")]

[General relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") is the theory of [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") published by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") in 1915. According to it, the force of gravity is a manifestation of the local geometry of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"). Mathematically, the theory is modelled after [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann")'s [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") geometry, but the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group "Lorentz group") of [spacetime symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_symmetries "Spacetime symmetries") (an essential ingredient of Einstein's own theory of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity")) replaces the group of rotational symmetries of space. (Later, loop quantum gravity inherited this geometric interpretation of gravity, and posits that a quantum theory of gravity is fundamentally a quantum theory of spacetime.)

In the 1920s, the French mathematician [Élie Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan") formulated Einstein's theory in the language of bundles and connections,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-1) a generalization of [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry") to which Cartan made important contributions. The so-called [Einstein–Cartan theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Cartan_theory "Einstein–Cartan theory") of gravity not only reformulated but also generalized general relativity, and allowed spacetimes with [torsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_tensor "Torsion tensor") as well as curvature. In Cartan's geometry of bundles, the concept of [parallel transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_transport "Parallel transport") is more fundamental than that of [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance"), the centerpiece of Riemannian geometry. A similar conceptual shift occurs between the invariant [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") of Einstein's general relativity and the parallel transport of Einstein–Cartan theory.

In 1971, physicist [Roger Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose "Roger Penrose") explored the idea of space arising from a quantum combinatorial structure.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-3) His investigations resulted in the development of [spin networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_network "Spin network"). Because this was a quantum theory of the rotational group and not the Lorentz group, Penrose went on to develop [twistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twistor_theory "Twistor theory").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-4)

### Loop quantum gravity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_loop_quantum_gravity&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Loop quantum gravity")]

In 1982, [Amitabha Sen](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amitabha_Sen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Amitabha Sen (page does not exist)") tried to formulate a Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity based on [spinorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor "Spinor") variables, where these variables are the left and right spinorial component equivalents of Einstein–Cartan connection of general relativity.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-5) Particularly, Sen discovered a new way to write down the two constraints of the [ADM Hamiltonian formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM_formalism "ADM formalism") of general relativity in terms of these spinorial connections. In his form, the constraints are simply conditions that the spinorial [Weyl curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_curvature "Weyl curvature") is trace free and symmetric. He also discovered the presence of new constraints which he suggested to be interpreted as the equivalent of Gauss constraint of [Yang–Mills field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_field "Yang–Mills field") theories. But Sen's work fell short of giving a full clear systematic theory and particularly failed to clearly discuss the conjugate momenta to the spinorial variables, its physical interpretation, and its relation to the metric (in his work he indicated this as some lambda variable).

In 1986–87, physicist [Abhay Ashtekar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhay_Ashtekar "Abhay Ashtekar") completed the project which Amitabha Sen began. He clearly identified the fundamental conjugate variables of spinorial gravity: The configuration variable is as a spinoral connection (a rule for parallel transport; technically, a [connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics) "Connection (mathematics)")) and the conjugate momentum variable is a coordinate frame (called a [vierbein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vierbein "Vierbein")) at each point.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-7) So these variable became what we know as [Ashtekar variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtekar_variables "Ashtekar variables"), a particular flavor of Einstein–Cartan theory with a complex connection. General relativity theory expressed in this way, made possible to pursue quantization of it using well-known techniques from [quantum gauge field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory").

The quantization of gravity in the Ashtekar formulation was based on [Wilson loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_loop "Wilson loop"), a technique developed by [Kenneth G. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_G._Wilson "Kenneth G. Wilson") in 1974[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-8) to study the strong-interaction regime of [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics") (QCD). It is interesting in this connection that Wilson loops were known to be ill-behaved in the case of standard quantum field theory on (flat) Minkowski space, and so did not provide a nonperturbative quantization of QCD. However, because the Ashtekar formulation was [background-independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background-independent "Background-independent"), it was possible to use Wilson loops as the basis for nonperturbative quantization of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity").

Due to efforts by Sen and Ashtekar, a setting in which the [Wheeler–DeWitt equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler%E2%80%93DeWitt_equation "Wheeler–DeWitt equation") was written in terms of a well-defined [Hamiltonian operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_operator "Hamiltonian operator") on a well-defined [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space") was obtained. This led to the construction of the first known exact solution, the so-called [Chern–Simons form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern%E2%80%93Simons_form "Chern–Simons form") or [Kodama state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodama_state "Kodama state"). The physical interpretation of this state remains obscure.

In 1988–90, [Carlo Rovelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rovelli "Carlo Rovelli") and [Lee Smolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Smolin "Lee Smolin") obtained an explicit basis of states of quantum geometry, which turned out to be labeled by Penrose's spin networks.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-10) In this context, spin networks arose as a generalization of Wilson loops necessary to deal with mutually intersecting loops. Mathematically, spin networks are related to group representation theory and can be used to construct [knot invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_invariant "Knot invariant") such as the [Jones polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_polynomial "Knot polynomial"). Loop quantum gravity (LQG) thus became related to topological quantum field theory and group representation theory.

In 1994, Rovelli and Smolin showed that the quantum [operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics) "Operator (physics)") of the theory associated to area and volume have a discrete spectrum.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-11) Work on the semi-classical limit, the [continuum limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_limit "Continuum limit"), and dynamics was intense after this, but progress was slower.

On the [semi-classical limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Semi-classical_limit&action=edit&redlink=1 "Semi-classical limit (page does not exist)") front, the goal is to obtain and study analogues of the [harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator "Harmonic oscillator") coherent states (candidates are known as [weave states](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Weave_state&action=edit&redlink=1 "Weave state (page does not exist)")).

### Hamiltonian dynamics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_loop_quantum_gravity&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Hamiltonian dynamics")]

LQG was initially formulated as a quantization of the Hamiltonian ADM formalism, according to which the Einstein equations are a collection of constraints (Gauss, Diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian). The kinematics are encoded in the Gauss and Diffeomorphism constraints, whose solution is the space spanned by the spin network basis. The problem is to define the Hamiltonian constraint as a [self-adjoint operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adjoint_operator "Self-adjoint operator") on the kinematical state space. The most promising work[_[according to whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] in this direction is [Thomas Thiemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Thiemann&action=edit&redlink=1 "Thomas Thiemann (page does not exist)")'s Phoenix Project.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-12)

Much of the recent[_[as of?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] work in LQG has been done in the [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance "Covariance") formulation of the theory, called "[spin foam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_foam "Spin foam") theory." The present version of the covariant dynamics is due to the convergent work of different groups, but it is commonly named after a paper by Jonathan Engle, Roberto Pereira and Carlo Rovelli in 2007–08.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-13) Heuristically, it would be expected that evolution between spin network states might be described by discrete combinatorial operations on the spin networks, which would then trace a two-dimensional skeleton of spacetime. This approach is related to [state-sum models](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=State-sum_model&action=edit&redlink=1 "State-sum model (page does not exist)") of statistical mechanics and topological quantum field theory such as the [Turaeev–Viro model](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turaeev%E2%80%93Viro_model&action=edit&redlink=1 "Turaeev–Viro model (page does not exist)") of 3D quantum gravity, and also to the [Regge calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regge_calculus "Regge calculus") approach to calculate the Feynman path integral of general relativity by discretizing spacetime.
