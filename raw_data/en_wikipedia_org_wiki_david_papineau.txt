[ 2 ] He works as Professor of Philosophy of Science at King's College London and the City University of New York Graduate Center , and previously taught for several years at Cambridge University , where he was a fellow of Robinson College .

Biography [ edit ] Papineau received a BSc in mathematics from the University of Natal and a BA and PhD in philosophy from the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Ian Hacking .

[ 1 ] He has worked in metaphysics , epistemology , and the philosophies of science , mind , and mathematics . His overall stance is naturalist and realist . He is one of the originators of the teleosemantic theory of mental representation , a solution to the problem of intentionality which derives the intentional content of our beliefs from their biological purpose. He is also a defender of the a posteriori physicalist solution to the mind–body problem .

[ 3 ] Papineau was elected president of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science for 1993–1995, of the Mind Association for 2009–2010, and of the Aristotelian Society for 2013–2014.

[ 4 ] His book Knowing the Score (2017) is written for a general readership and looks at a number of ways in which sporting issues cast light on long-standing philosophical problems.

[ 5 ] Papineau’s book The Metaphysics of Sensory Experience has been critiqued by philosopher Benj Hellie. Hellie instead argues in favor of a theory with the existence of qualia, and that all alternatives to qualia fail.
