The idea of an explicitly "organismic theory" dates at least back to the publication of Kurt Goldstein 's The organism: A holistic approach to biology derived from pathological data in man in 1934.  Organismic theories and the "organic" metaphor were inspired by organicist approaches in biology.  The most direct influence from inside psychology comes from Gestalt psychology .  This approach is often contrasted with mechanistic and reductionist perspectives in psychology.
