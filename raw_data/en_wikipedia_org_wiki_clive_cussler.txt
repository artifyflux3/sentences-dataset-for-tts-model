[ 1 ] His thriller novels, many featuring the character Dirk Pitt , have been listed on The New York Times fiction best-seller list more than 20 times. Cussler was the founder and chairman [ 2 ] of the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), which has discovered more than 60 shipwreck sites and numerous other notable underwater wrecks. He was the sole author or main author of more than 80 books. He often placed himself into his books as himself.

His novels have inspired various other works of fiction.

His group discovered the Hunley, which was the first submarine ever to see combat. The Hunley is now in Charleston, SC.

Early life [ edit ] Clive Cussler was born in Aurora, Illinois , the son of Eric Edward Cussler and Amy Adeline (née Hunnewell), [ 3 ] and grew up in Alhambra, California . His father was from Germany and his mother's ancestors were from England .

[ 4 ] In his memoir The Sea Hunters: True Adventures with Famous Shipwrecks , Cussler revealed that his father served in the Imperial German Army on the Western Front during World War I . Furthermore, one of Cussler's uncles served in the Imperial German Air Service and became a flying ace , shooting down 14 Allied aeroplanes .

[ 5 ] He was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout when he was 14 years old.

[ 6 ] He attended Pasadena City College [ 2 ] for two years and then enlisted in the United States Air Force during the Korean War .

[ 7 ] During his service with the Air Force, he was promoted to sergeant and worked as an aircraft mechanic and flight engineer for the Military Air Transport Service (MATS).

[ 8 ] Career [ edit ] After his discharge from the military, Cussler went to work for the advertising industry, first as a copywriter and later as a creative director for two of the nation's most successful advertising agencies.

[ 2 ] As part of his duties, Cussler produced radio and television commercials, many of which won international awards including an award at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.

[ 9 ] After the publication in 1996 of Cussler's first nonfiction work, The Sea Hunters , he was awarded a Doctor of Letters degree in 1997 by the Board of Governors of the State University of New York Maritime College who accepted the work in lieu of a Ph.D. thesis. This was the first time in the college's 123-year history that such a degree had been awarded.

[ 2 ] In 2002, Cussler was awarded the Naval Heritage Award from the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation for his efforts concerning marine exploration.

[ 10 ] Cussler was a fellow of the Explorers Club of New York, the Royal Geographical Society in London, and the American Society of Oceanographers .

[ 11 ] Literary career [ edit ] Clive Cussler began writing in 1965 when his wife took a job working nights for the local police department where they lived in California. After making dinner for the children and putting them to bed, he had no one to talk to and nothing much to do, so he decided to start writing.

[ 12 ] His most famous character is marine engineer, government agent and adventurer Dirk Pitt . The Dirk Pitt novels frequently have an alternative history premise—such as "what if Atlantis were real?" or "what if Abraham Lincoln wasn't assassinated but was kidnapped?" [ citation needed ] The first two Pitt novels, The Mediterranean Caper and Iceberg , were relatively conventional maritime thrillers. The third, Raise the Titanic!

, made Cussler's reputation and established the pattern that subsequent Pitt novels would follow: a blend of adventure and advanced technology, generally involving megalomaniacal villains, lost ships, beautiful women, and sunken treasure.

Cussler's novels almost always begin with a chapter set in the past. These contain none of the novel's main characters and often seem disconnected from the plot until the main characters discover a mystery or secret relating the events of the first chapter to the rest of the story. This is almost always in the form of a long-lost artifact that is important to the villain's or hero's objectives. Often in the first chapter, a ship or airplane carrying a top-secret, important, or dangerous cargo is lost and never found, until it is recovered by a modern character later in the book.

Cussler's novels, like those of Michael Crichton , are examples of techno-thrillers that do not use military plots and settings. Where Crichton strove for scrupulous realism, however, Cussler prefers fantastic spectacles and outlandish plot devices. The Pitt novels, in particular, have the improbable quality of the James Bond or Indiana Jones movies, while also sometimes borrowing from Alistair MacLean 's novels. Pitt himself is a super-hero reminiscent of Doc Savage and other characters from pulp magazines .

Cussler had seventeen consecutive titles listed on The New York Times fiction best seller list .

[ 7 ] In 2014, McFarland Publishing released The Clive Cussler Adventures: A Critical Review by Steven Philip Jones , the first critical review textbook of Cussler's novels.

[ 13 ] NUMA [ edit ] As an underwater explorer , Cussler discovered more than 60 shipwreck sites [ 14 ] and wrote non-fiction books about his findings. He was also the initiator of the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), a non-profit organization with the same name as the fictional government agency that employs Dirk Pitt.

Important finds by NUMA include: RMS Carpathia , the ship famed for being the first to come to the aid of RMS Titanic survivors.

CSS Manassas , the first ironclad of the civil war, formerly the icebreaker Enoch Train .

A visual and interactive depiction of Cussler's NUMA Foundation Expeditions has been made available as an extension of NUMA's original website that has since been deleted.

Finds formerly believed to be important include: Mary Celeste , the famed ghost ship that was found abandoned with cargo intact (the identification of this wreck as the Mary Celeste has since been placed into a state of question after one researcher disputed the claim's authenticity).

[ 15 ] Adaptations [ edit ] The first film adaptation of a Clive Cussler novel was Raise the Titanic!

(1980) featuring Richard Jordan as Dirk Pitt , Jason Robards as Admiral James Sandecker , David Selby as Gene Seagram, and Anne Archer as Dana Seagram.

Paramount Pictures released the movie Sahara on April 8, 2005, featuring Matthew McConaughey as Dirk Pitt , Steve Zahn as Al Giordino, William H. Macy as Admiral Sandecker, and Penélope Cruz as Eva Rojas. It grossed $122 million with $241 million in production and distribution expenses.

[ 16 ] Personal life [ edit ] Clive Cussler married Barbara Knight in 1955, and they remained married for nearly 50 years until her death in 2003.

[ 17 ] Together they had three children—Teri, Dirk , and Dayna —four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

He was an avid car collector of classic automobiles that are on display at the Cussler Museum [ 18 ] in Arvada, Colorado .  Clive Cussler was a part-time resident of both Arizona and Colorado.

[ 19 ] Cussler died at his home in Paradise Valley, Arizona , on February 24, 2020, at age 88 of undisclosed causes.

While appearing to be a decrepit freighter, it is actually a high-tech advanced ship used by an unnamed and mysterious "Corporation" under the leadership of Juan Cabrillo . The ship is run like a business, with its crew being shareholders, taking jobs for the CIA and other agencies to help stop crime and terrorism. The crew is adept at disguises, combat, computer hacking and more to aid them in their missions. Kurt Austin, Joe Zavala, and Dirk Pitt all make cameo appearances in the fourth volume, Skeleton Coast (Cabrillo speaks to Pitt on the telephone; and Austin and Zavala appear at the end).

They center around Isaac Bell, a brilliant investigator for the Van Dorn Detective Agency, which appears to be modeled after the real-life Pinkerton Agency. Like Pitt, Bell has an affinity for automobiles and is a crack shot. The first book reveals that Bell survives into 1950 with a wife and grown children. Though the setting is a century ago, the books still qualify as techno-thrillers, since they feature the advanced technology of that time such as private express trains, telegraphs, telephones, dreadnought battleships and early airplanes. Isaac Bell also is a principal character of the background story in the Fargo Adventures novel The Gray Ghost .
