Some software applications require normalized inputs and produce normalized outputs, which can be re-scaled to physical units when necessary.  Mathematical derivations are usually done in normalized units, relevant to a wide range of applications.

Examples of normalization [ edit ] A typical choice of characteristic frequency is the sampling rate ( f s {\displaystyle f_{s}} ) that is used to create the digital signal from a continuous one.  The normalized quantity, f ′ = f f s , {\displaystyle f'={\tfrac {f}{f_{s}}},} has the unit cycle per sample regardless of whether the original signal is a function of time or distance.  For example, when f {\displaystyle f} is expressed in Hz ( cycles per second ), f s {\displaystyle f_{s}} is expressed in samples per second .

[ 1 ] Some programs (such as MATLAB toolboxes) that design filters with real-valued coefficients prefer the Nyquist frequency ( f s / 2 ) {\displaystyle (f_{s}/2)} as the frequency reference, which changes the numeric range that represents frequencies of interest from [ 0 , 1 2 ] {\displaystyle \left[0,{\tfrac {1}{2}}\right]} cycle/sample to [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} half-cycle/sample .  Therefore, the normalized frequency unit is important when converting normalized results into physical units.

Example of plotting samples of a frequency distribution in the unit "bins", which are integer values. A scale factor of 0.7812 converts a bin number into the corresponding physical unit (hertz).

A common practice is to sample the frequency spectrum of the sampled data at frequency intervals of f s N , {\displaystyle {\tfrac {f_{s}}{N}},} for some arbitrary integer N {\displaystyle N} (see § Sampling the DTFT ).  The samples (sometimes called frequency bins ) are numbered consecutively, corresponding to a frequency normalization by f s N .

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {f_{s}}{N}}.} [ 2 ] : p.56 eq.(16) [ 3 ] The normalized Nyquist frequency is N 2 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {N}{2}}} with the unit ⁠ 1 / N ⁠ th cycle/sample .

Angular frequency , denoted by ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } and with the unit radians per second , can be similarly normalized. When ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is normalized with reference to the sampling rate as ω ω ′ = ω ω f s , {\displaystyle \omega '={\tfrac {\omega }{f_{s}}},} the normalized Nyquist angular frequency is π radians/sample .

The following table shows examples of normalized frequency for f = 1 {\displaystyle f=1} kHz , f s = 44100 {\displaystyle f_{s}=44100} samples/second (often denoted by 44.1 kHz ), and 4 normalization conventions: Quantity Numeric range Calculation Reverse f ′ = f f s {\displaystyle f'={\tfrac {f}{f_{s}}}} [ 0, ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ ] cycle/sample 1000 / 44100 = 0.02268 f = f ′ ⋅ ⋅ f s {\displaystyle f=f'\cdot f_{s}} f ′ = f f s / 2 {\displaystyle f'={\tfrac {f}{f_{s}/2}}} [0, 1] half-cycle/sample 1000 / 22050 = 0.04535 f = f ′ ⋅ ⋅ f s 2 {\displaystyle f=f'\cdot {\tfrac {f_{s}}{2}}} f ′ = f f s / N {\displaystyle f'={\tfrac {f}{f_{s}/N}}} [ 0, ⁠ N / 2 ⁠ ] bins 1000 × N / 44100 = 0.02268 N f = f ′ ⋅ ⋅ f s N {\displaystyle f=f'\cdot {\tfrac {f_{s}}{N}}} ω ω ′ = ω ω f s {\displaystyle \omega '={\tfrac {\omega }{f_{s}}}} [0, π ] radians/sample 1000 × 2π / 44100 = 0.14250 ω ω = ω ω ′ ⋅ ⋅ f s {\displaystyle \omega =\omega '\cdot f_{s}} See also [ edit ] Prototype filter References [ edit ] ^ Carlson, Gordon E.
