It states that  (i) all members of a mixed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) have the same payoff (Theorem 2), and (ii) that none of these can also be a pure ESS [ 1 ] (from their Theorem 3). The usefulness of the results comes from the fact that they can be used to directly find ESSes algebraically , rather than simulating the game and solving it by iteration .

The theorem was formulated by Tim Bishop and Chris Cannings at Sheffield University , who published it in 1978.

A review is given by John Maynard Smith in Evolution and the Theory of Games , with proof in the appendix.
