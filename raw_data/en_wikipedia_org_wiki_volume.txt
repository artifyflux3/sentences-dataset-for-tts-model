This cup measures volume in units of [cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_(unit) "Cup (unit)"), [fluid ounces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_ounce "Fluid ounce"), and [millilitres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millilitre "Millilitre"). |

**Volume** is a [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics) "Measure (mathematics)") of [regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_(mathematics) "Region (mathematics)") in [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-NIST-2022-2) It is often quantified numerically using [SI derived units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit "SI derived unit") (such as the [cubic metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_metre "Cubic metre") and [litre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre "Litre")) or by various [imperial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units "Imperial units") or [US customary units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units "United States customary units") (such as the [gallon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallon "Gallon"), [quart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quart "Quart"), [cubic inch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_inch "Cubic inch")). The definition of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length") and height (cubed) is interrelated with volume. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i.e., the amount of [fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid") (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces. By [metonymy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy "Metonymy"), the term "volume" sometimes is used to refer to the corresponding region (e.g., [bounding volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume "Bounding volume")).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-3)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-4)

In ancient times, volume was measured using similar-shaped natural containers. Later on, standardized containers were used. Some simple [three-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_dimensional "Three dimensional") shapes can have their volume easily calculated using [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic")[formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula "Formula"). Volumes of more complicated shapes can be calculated with [integral calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_calculus "Integral calculus") if a formula exists for the shape's boundary. [Zero-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-dimensional_space "Zero-dimensional space"), [one-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional_space "One-dimensional space") and [two-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional "Two-dimensional") objects have no volume; in [four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space "Four-dimensional space") and higher dimensions, an analogous concept to the normal volume is the hypervolume.

The precision of volume measurements in the ancient period usually ranges between 10–50 mL (0.3–2 US fl oz; 0.4–2 imp fl oz).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-Imhausen-2016-5): 8  The earliest evidence of volume calculation came from [ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") and [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia") as mathematical problems, approximating volume of simple shapes such as [cuboids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid "Cuboid"), [cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder "Cylinder"), [frustum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustum "Frustum") and [cones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone "Cone"). These math problems have been written in the [Moscow Mathematical Papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Mathematical_Papyrus "Moscow Mathematical Papyrus") (c. 1820 BCE). In the [Reisner Papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reisner_Papyrus "Reisner Papyrus"), ancient Egyptians have written concrete units of volume for grain and liquids, as well as a table of length, width, depth, and volume for blocks of material.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-Imhausen-2016-5): 116  The Egyptians use their units of length (the [cubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubit "Cubit"), [palm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_(unit) "Palm (unit)"), [digit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_(unit) "Digit (unit)")) to devise their units of volume, such as the volume cubit[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-Imhausen-2016-5): 117  or deny (1 cubit × 1 cubit × 1 cubit), volume palm (1 cubit × 1 cubit × 1 palm), and volume digit (1 cubit × 1 cubit × 1 digit).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-Imhausen-2016-5): 117

The last three books of [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements"), written in around 300 BCE, detailed the exact formulas for calculating the volume of [parallelepipeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelepiped "Parallelepiped"), cones, [pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid "Pyramid"), cylinders, and [spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"). The formula were determined by prior mathematicians by using a primitive form of [integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral"), by breaking the shapes into smaller and simpler pieces. A century later, [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") (c. 287 – 212 BCE) devised approximate volume formula of several shapes using the [method of exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion "Method of exhaustion") approach, meaning to derive solutions from previous known formulas from similar shapes. Primitive integration of shapes was also discovered independently by [Liu Hui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Hui "Liu Hui") in the 3rd century CE, [Zu Chongzhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_Chongzhi "Zu Chongzhi") in the 5th century CE, the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East") and [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India").

Archimedes also devised a way to calculate the volume of an irregular object, by submerging it underwater and measure the difference between the initial and final water volume. The water volume difference is the volume of the object. Though highly popularized, Archimedes probably does not submerge the golden crown to find its volume, and thus its density and purity, due to the extreme precision involved.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-6) Instead, he likely have devised a primitive form of a [hydrostatic balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_Balance "Hydrostatic Balance"). Here, the crown and a chunk of pure gold with a similar weight are put on both ends of a [weighing scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale "Weighing scale") submerged underwater, which will tip accordingly due to the [Archimedes' principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_principle "Archimedes' principle").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-7)

### Calculus and standardization of units

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Volume&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Calculus and standardization of units")]

Diagram showing how to measure volume using a graduated cylinder with [fluid dram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dram "Fluid dram") markings, 1926

In the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), many units for measuring volume were made, such as the [sester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sester "Sester"), [amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amber_(unit)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Amber (unit) (page does not exist)"), [coomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coomb_(unit) "Coomb (unit)"), and [seam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_(unit) "Seam (unit)"). The sheer quantity of such units motivated British kings to standardize them, culminated in the [Assize of Bread and Ale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assize_of_Bread_and_Ale "Assize of Bread and Ale") statute in 1258 by [Henry III of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_III_of_England "Henry III of England"). The statute standardized weight, length and volume as well as introduced the peny, ounce, pound, gallon and bushel.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-Imhausen-2016-5): 73–74  In 1618, the _[London Pharmacopoeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London\_Pharmacopoeia "London Pharmacopoeia")_ (medicine compound catalog) adopted the Roman gallon[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-RPS-2020-8) or _[congius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congius "Congius")_[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-9) as a basic unit of volume and gave a conversion table to the apothecaries' units of weight.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-RPS-2020-8) Around this time, volume measurements are becoming more precise and the uncertainty is narrowed to between 1–5 mL (0.03–0.2 US fl oz; 0.04–0.2 imp fl oz).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-Imhausen-2016-5): 8

Around the early 17th century, [Bonaventura Cavalieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonaventura_Cavalieri "Bonaventura Cavalieri") applied the philosophy of modern integral calculus to calculate the volume of any object. He devised [Cavalieri's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalieri%27s_principle "Cavalieri's principle"), which said that using thinner and thinner slices of the shape would make the resulting volume more and more accurate. This idea would then be later expanded by [Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat "Pierre de Fermat"), [John Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis "John Wallis"), [Isaac Barrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Barrow "Isaac Barrow"), [James Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gregory_(mathematician) "James Gregory (mathematician)"), [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz") and [Maria Gaetana Agnesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Gaetana_Agnesi "Maria Gaetana Agnesi") in the 17th and 18th centuries to form the modern integral calculus, which remains in use in the 21st century.

### Metrication and redefinitions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Volume&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Metrication and redefinitions")]

On 7 April 1795, the metric system was formally defined in French law using six units. Three of these are related to volume: the _[stère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A8re "Stère")_(1 m 3) for volume of firewood; the _[litre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre "Litre")_(1 dm 3) for volumes of liquid; and the _[gramme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram "Gram")_, for mass—defined as the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-10) Thirty years later in 1824, the [imperial gallon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_gallon "Imperial gallon") was defined to be the volume occupied by ten [pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass) "Pound (mass)") of water at 17°C (62°F). This definition was further refined until the United Kingdom's [Weights and Measures Act 1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weights_and_Measures_Act_1985 "Weights and Measures Act 1985"), which makes 1 imperial gallon precisely equal to 4.54609 litres with no use of water.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-11)

The 1960 redefinition of the metre from the [International Prototype Metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prototype_Metre "International Prototype Metre") to the orange-red [emission line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line "Spectral line") of [krypton-86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton-86 "Krypton-86") atoms unbounded the metre, cubic metre, and litre from physical objects. This also make the metre and metre-derived units of volume resilient to changes to the International Prototype Metre.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-12) The definition of the metre was redefined again in 1983 to use the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") and [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") (which is derived from the [caesium standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_standard "Caesium standard")) and [reworded for clarity in 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_revision_of_the_SI "2019 revision of the SI").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-13)

As a [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics) "Measure (mathematics)") of the [Euclidean three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"), volume cannot be physically measured as a negative value, similar to [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length") and [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area"). Like all continuous [monotonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function "Monotonic function") (order-preserving) measures, volumes of bodies can be compared against each other and thus can be ordered. Volume can also be added together and be decomposed indefinitely; the latter property is integral to [Cavalieri's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalieri%27s_principle "Cavalieri's principle") and to the [infinitesimal calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_calculus "Infinitesimal calculus") of three-dimensional bodies.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-14) A 'unit' of infinitesimally small volume in integral calculus is the [volume element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_element "Volume element"); this formulation is useful when working with different [coordinate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system"), spaces and [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold").

The oldest way to roughly measure a volume of an object is using the human body, such as using hand size and [pinches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_(action) "Pinch (action)"). However, the human body's variations make it extremely unreliable. A better way to measure volume is to use roughly consistent and durable [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container "Container") found in nature, such as [gourds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gourd "Gourd"), sheep or pig [stomachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach "Stomach"), and [bladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder "Urinary bladder"). Later on, as [metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy "Metallurgy") and [glass production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_production "Glass production") improved, small volumes nowadays are usually measured using standardized human-made containers. This method is common for measuring small volume of fluids or [granular materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_material "Granular material"), by using a [multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_(mathematics) "Multiple (mathematics)") or fraction of the container. For granular materials, the container is shaken or leveled off to form a roughly flat surface. This method is not the most accurate way to measure volume but is often used to measure [cooking ingredients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_ingredient "Cooking ingredient").

[Air displacement pipette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_displacement_pipette "Air displacement pipette") is used in [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") and [biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry") to measure volume of fluids at the microscopic scale.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-15) Calibrated [measuring cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_cup "Measuring cup") and [spoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_spoon "Measuring spoon") are adequate for cooking and daily life applications, however, they are not precise enough for [laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory "Laboratory"). There, volume of liquids is measured using [graduated cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduated_cylinder "Graduated cylinder"), [pipettes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipette "Pipette") and [volumetric flasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flask "Volumetric flask"). The largest of such calibrated containers are petroleum [storage tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_tank "Storage tank"), some can hold up to 1,000,000[bbl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)#Oil_barrel "Barrel (unit)") (160,000,000 L) of fluids. Even at this scale, by knowing petroleum's density and temperature, very precise volume measurement in these tanks can still be made.

For even larger volumes such as in a [reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir "Reservoir"), the container's volume is modeled by shapes and calculated using mathematics.

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Visualisation_litre_gram.svg/250px-Visualisation_litre_gram.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Visualisation_litre_gram.svg)

Some SI units of volume to scale and approximate corresponding mass of water

To ease calculations, a unit of volume is equal to the volume occupied by a [unit cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_cube "Unit cube") (with a side length of one). Because the volume occupies three dimensions, if the [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre") (m) is chosen as a unit of length, the corresponding unit of volume is the [cubic metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_metre "Cubic metre") (m 3). The cubic metre is also a [SI derived unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit "SI derived unit").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-16) Therefore, volume has a [unit dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis") of L 3.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-17)

The metric units of volume uses [metric prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix "Metric prefix"), strictly in [powers of ten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_10 "Power of 10"). When applying prefixes to units of volume, which are expressed in units of length cubed, the cube operators are applied to the unit of length including the prefix. An example of converting cubic centimetre to cubic metre is: 2.3 cm 3 = 2.3 (cm)3 = 2.3 (0.01 m)3 = 0.0000023 m 3 (five zeros).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-IBWM-2019-18): 143

Commonly used prefixes for cubed length units are the cubic millimetre (mm 3), cubic centimetre (cm 3), cubic decimetre (dm 3), cubic metre (m 3) and the cubic kilometre (km 3). The conversion between the prefix units are as follows: 1000 mm 3 = 1 cm 3, 1000 cm 3 = 1 dm 3, and 1000 dm 3 = 1 m 3.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-NIST-2022-2) The [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system "Metric system") also includes the [litre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre "Litre") (L) as a unit of volume, where 1 L = 1 dm 3 = 1000 cm 3 = 0.001 m 3.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-IBWM-2019-18): 145  For the litre unit, the commonly used prefixes are the millilitre (mL), centilitre (cL), and the litre (L), with 1000 mL = 1 L, 10 mL = 1 cL, 10 cL = 1 dL, and 10 dL = 1 L.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-NIST-2022-2)

Various other [imperial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units "Imperial units") or [U.S. customary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units "United States customary units") units of volume are also in use, including:

*   [cubic inch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_inch "Cubic inch"), [cubic foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_foot "Cubic foot"), [cubic yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_yard "Cubic yard"), [acre-foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre-foot "Acre-foot"), [cubic mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_mile "Cubic mile");
*   [minim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minim_(unit) "Minim (unit)"), [drachm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dram_(unit) "Dram (unit)"), [fluid ounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_ounce "Fluid ounce"), [pint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pint "Pint");

*   [cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_(unit) "Cord (unit)"), [peck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peck "Peck"), [bushel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushel "Bushel"), [hogshead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogshead "Hogshead").

### Capacity and volume

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Volume&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Capacity and volume")]

Capacity is the maximum amount of material that a container can hold, measured in volume or [weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight "Weight"). However, the contained volume does not need to fill towards the container's capacity, or vice versa. Containers can only hold a specific amount of physical volume, not weight (excluding practical concerns). For example, a 50,000 bbl (7,900,000 L) tank that can just hold 7,200 t (15,900,000 lb) of [fuel oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_oil "Fuel oil") will not be able to contain the same 7,200 t (15,900,000 lb) of [naphtha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphtha "Naphtha"), due to naphtha's lower density and thus larger volume.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-Treese-2018-19): 390–391

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Visual_proof_cone_volume.svg/250px-Visual_proof_cone_volume.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Visual_proof_cone_volume.svg)

[Proof without words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_without_words "Proof without words") that the volume of a cone is a third of a cylinder of equal diameter and height 
1.A cone and a cylinder have radius _r_ and height _h_.
2.The volume ratio is maintained when the height is scaled to _h'_= _r_ √π.
3.Decompose it into thin slices.
4.Using Cavalieri's principle, reshape each slice into a square of the same area.
5.The pyramid is replicated twice.
6.Combining them into a cube shows that the volume ratio is 1:3.

For many shapes such as the [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube"), [cuboid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid "Cuboid") and [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder "Cylinder"), they have an essentially the same volume calculation formula as one for the [prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(geometry) "Prism (geometry)"): the [base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(geometry) "Base (geometry)") of the shape multiplied by its [height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height "Height").

One of which is calculating the volume of [solids of revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution "Solid of revolution"), by rotating a [plane curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_curve "Plane curve") around a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") on the same plane. The washer or [disc integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_integration "Disc integration") method is used when integrating by an axis parallel to the axis of rotation. The general equation can be written as:![Image 7: {\displaystyle V=\pi \int _{a}^{b}\left|f(x)^{2}-g(x)^{2}\right|\,dx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/61aec72877438aad93cba66b581674b3e746f9e6)where ![Image 8: {\textstyle f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e0a982c6635ab3b98d9e12d5f5a8533359bcb38a) and ![Image 9: {\textstyle g(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b78b479cc1c1ccd06f8cdfd31223335921e5a5b) are the plane curve boundaries.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume#cite_note-RIT-2014-20): 1, 3  The [shell integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_integration "Shell integration") method is used when integrating by an axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation.
