[ 1 ] Allen was born at Subiaco, Perth the third child of James Bernard Allen (died 1912), a South Australian -born lecturer in physics at Perth Technical School , and his wife Alice Hooper, née Aitken, a New Zealand -born trained nurse. Cla (as he was known) was educated at the High School, Perth, Western Australia and the University of Western Australia (B.Sc., 1926; M.Sc., 1929; D.Sc., 1936). Allen was appointed to a research fellowship at the newly established Commonwealth Solar Observatory in 1926 at Mount Stromlo , Australian Capital Territory , becoming an assistant there in 1928.

[ 1 ] Allen observed the 1 October 1940 solar eclipse in South Africa and obtained important results on the solar corona , including measurements of its electron density which were to prove invaluable to radio astronomers.

[ 1 ] Allen accepted an invitation by Sir Harrie Massey in 1951 to become Perren professor of astronomy at University College, London , and director of the University of London Observatory , Mill Hill . Within a few years Allen had built up his observatory into one of the best astronomical departments in England. He published the first edition of Astrophysical Quantities in 1955, a compilation of numerical data of astrophysical interest. Universally known as "AQ", it is the most quoted book on the subject.
