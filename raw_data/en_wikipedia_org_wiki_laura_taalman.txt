Her mathematical research concerns knot theory and singular algebraic geometry ; she is a professor of mathematics at James Madison University .

Life [ edit ] Taalman earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1994.

[ 1 ] She completed her Ph.D. at Duke University in 2000; her dissertation, Monomial Generators for the Nash Sheaf of a Complete Resolution , was supervised by William L. Pardon.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] On finishing her doctorate, she joined the James Madison faculty; she has also worked as the mathematician-in-residence at the National Museum of Mathematics in 2014–2015.

3d printing [ edit ] 3D Printing and Mathematics models by Taalman In 2013–2014, after becoming head of the 3d printing lab at James Madison University, Taalman set out on a project of printing one 3d model per day. Her models have included subjects from mathematics including knots, fractals, and snap-together polyhedra.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Books [ edit ] With Peter Kohn, Taalman is the author of a textbook Calculus .

[ 5 ] She is also the author of a different text, Calculus I with Integrated Precalculus .

With Jason Rosenhouse (also a mathematics professor at James Madison University) she is the author of Taking Sudoku Seriously: The Mathematics Behind the World’s Most Popular Pencil Puzzle .

[ 6 ] She has also written a series of Sudoku puzzle books with Philip Riley.

[ 7 ] Awards and honors [ edit ] Taalman won the Trevor Evans Award of the Mathematical Association of America in 2003 for her work with Eugénie Hunsicker on the mathematics of modular architecture .

[ 8 ] In 2005, Taalman won the Henry L. Alder Award for Distinguished
Teaching by a Beginning College or
University Mathematics Faculty Member, given by the Mathematical Association of America .

[ 9 ] Her book Taking Sudoku Seriously was the 2012 winner of the PROSE Awards in the popular science and popular mathematics category.
