Moon earned bachelor's and master's degree in mechanical engineering from the Pratt Institute in 1962 and 1964, respectively, then completed doctoral studies in the same subject from at Cornell University .

[ 1 ] He later joined Cornell's faculty, succeeding Yih-Hsing Pao as chair of the Department of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from 1980 to 1987, then serving as director of  Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University until 1992.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Moon was also Joseph C. Ford Professor of Engineering, and awarded emeritus status upon retirement.

[ 1 ] Moon was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering in 1996, "[f]or experimental research in chaotic and nonlinear dynamics and development of superconducting levitation devices." [ 4 ] Selected books [ edit ] Moon, Francis C. (2004) [1987].
