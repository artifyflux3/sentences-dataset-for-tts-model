In Russia, the term " liberal " can refer to wide range of politicians, from the centre-right and proponents of shock therapy to left-liberals and progressives. The term "liberal democrats" is often used for members of the far-right nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia . There are Russian opposition and pro-government liberal political parties in Russia. Pro-government liberal politicians support Putin's policy in economics.

There are no liberal factions in Russian parliament at the moment.

Centre-left liberalism was represented in the State Duma of Russian parliament by the Russian United Democratic Party "Yabloko" (7.86% in 1993 election , 6.89% in 1995, 5.93% in 1999). Pro-government liberalism was represented by the Our Home – Russia (10.13% in 1995 election ), the liberal political party founded by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin .

Centre-right liberalism was represented by the pro-capitalist party Democratic Choice of Russia (15.51% in 1993) and its successor, the Union of Right Forces (8.52% in 1999 election ).
Yabloko and the Republican Party of Russia – People's Freedom Party are members of Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party .

[ 1 ] Yabloko is also a member of Liberal International . Since Vladimir Putin's rise to power in 2000, many liberal parties and politicians have been persecuted.

Liberalism in the Russian Federation [ edit ] History [ edit ] Liberalism emerged in Russia before the Russian Revolution and continued to develop among Constitutional Democrats such as Pavel Milyukov living in exile after 1917.

[ 2 ] After the fall of communism, several new liberal parties were formed, but only one of them Yabloko ( Yabloko – Rosiyskaya Demokraticheskaya Partiya , a member of Liberal International ) succeeded in becoming a relevant force. This is a left-of-center liberal party. The Union of Right Forces ( Soyuz Pravykh Sil , a member of International Democrat Union ) is a right-of-center liberal party. It can also be seen as a democratic conservative market party. In this scheme, the party is not included as liberal, being considered a democratic conservative party, but it can also be called liberal because of its pro- free-market and anti-authoritarianism stances. The so-called Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is not at all "liberal" – it is a nationalist , right-wing, populist party.
