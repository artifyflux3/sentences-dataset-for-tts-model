Built on the site of a group of buildings known from the 1890s until 1933 as the Berkeley Oval , [ 3 ] the college was renovated in 1998.  It is distinct for having two courtyards connected by an underground tunnel.

Dining Hall: The dining hall is named in honor of Joseph Fogg.

Buttery: Currently known as olo-Marvin’s.   Known in the 1980s and 1990s as the "Bagel Bar." Library: Also known as "Laz," study space named in honor of George Lazarus and Shelly Lazarus.

South Court Basement.

Multipurpose Room: A half-court space to play basketball, it is also frequently used for practicing yoga or student orchestra rehearsals. It can be reserved through the Head's Office.

North Court Basement: Home to The Thomas Mendenhall Common Room and the Samuel Hemingway Music Room.

The Swiss Room: A private dining room in the dining hall. Transplanted piece by piece from Switzerland , this 16th-century wooden room has been decorated with stained glass by G. Owen Bonawit and is considered priceless.  Access is restricted to fellows and Berkeley events.

The tunnel: An underground passageway connecting Berkeley's two grand courts, North Court and South Court, which are divided by a grassy area in front of Yale's main library, Sterling Memorial Library . It stands steps away from the Beinecke Library , the Bass Library , the Commons, and the Old Campus. The tunnel features a variety of student murals on the walls.

On the wall outside the Head's House that faces Sterling Memorial Library , there is a plaque stating that its location marks the house where Josiah Willard Gibbs lived.

The Head's House was named as the Swensen House in 2013 to honor Berkeley Fellow David Swensen's enormous contributions to Yale as the Chief Investment Officer.

Similar to other residential colleges, Berkeley has its own gym, seminar rooms, and other amenities.

Traditions [ edit ] Reverend George Berkeley by Alfred C. Hart Annual traditions include the Berkeley Birthday Dinner for fellows and seniors, Thunder Brunch, Lunar New Year's Feast, a snowball fight (which pits North Court against South Court), GLO (a blacklight party), and the Bishop Bash, which was founded in the spring of 2002 by Ben Reiter and Charles Finch under the guidance of the Head's Office.

Dining hall [ edit ] According to The Wall Street Journal , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Yale’s  Berkeley College has one of the best college dining halls in the country. It is the testing ground for an experimental organic food and sustainable produce and new menu items before they go on menus in the other dining halls. Up until 2009 it had a dining plan overseen by celebrity chef Alice Waters .l [ 6 ] Currently, the dining hall is seen by a local celebrity chef who started in 2014, thereby not rescinding its unique status. It still remains an immensely popular place to eat, largely due to its central location on campus. It also boosts some of the best food on campus.
