_**Hiding in the Mirror**_ is a popular science book by the theoretical physicist [Lawrence M. Krauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_M._Krauss "Lawrence M. Krauss"). The text was initially published on October 20, 2005 by [Viking Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Press "Viking Press"). This is his seventh non-fiction book.

The work draws on the works of scientists, mathematicians, artists, and writers to consider the cultural and scientific aspects of extra dimensions.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiding_in_the_Mirror#cite_note-1) The book explores popular theories about such topics as [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole"), life in other [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension"), and [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory").

A reviewer of _[Publishers Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishers\_Weekly "Publishers Weekly")_ mentioned "Physicist Krauss offers an erudite and well-crafted overview of the role multiple dimensions have played in the history of physics. This isn't an easy book, even with a writer as talented as Krauss (whom some will recognize as the author of _[The Physics of Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Physics\_of\_Star\_Trek "The Physics of Star Trek")_ and _[Beyond Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond\_Star\_Trek "Beyond Star Trek")_) serving as one's Virgil. Long on science and short on its connections with culture, the book is essentially an introduction to the physics and mathematics of extra dimensions with a few more or less disconnected chapters that touch on how these ideas show up in art and popular culture; there's more on [brane-world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_world "Brane world") and the [ekpyrotic universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekpyrotic_universe "Ekpyrotic universe") than on Plato's cave, whose inhabitants could not perceive reality in all its dimensions, or [Buckaroo Banzai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckaroo_Banzai "Buckaroo Banzai")."[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiding_in_the_Mirror#cite_note-2)
