Browne, M. Choptuik, E. Seidel, L. Smarr, P. Saylor, F. Saied, J. York, C. Evans, S. Shapiro, S. Teukolsky, G. Fox, J. Winicour, S. Finn, P. Laguna The Binary Black Hole Grand Challenge Alliance ( BBH Challenge Alliance ) was a scientific collaboration of international physics institutes and research groups dedicated to simulating the sources and predicting the waveforms for gravitational waves , in anticipation of gravitational radiation experiments such as LIGO .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] History [ edit ] The BBH Challenge Alliance was established in 1993.

[ 3 ] This was an alliance of numerical relativity groups engaged in a friendly competition to tackle the grand challenge of simulating binary black hole collisions for the purpose of understanding gravitational wave signatures that would be detected by experiments such as LIGO.
