For example, it is common in naive set theory to introduce a symbol ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } for the set that has no member. In the formal setting of first-order theories, this can be done by adding to the theory a new constant ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } and the new axiom ∀ ∀ x ( x ∉ ∉ ∅ ∅ ) {\displaystyle \forall x(x\notin \emptyset )} , meaning "for all x , x is not a member of ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } ". It can then be proved that doing so adds essentially nothing to the old theory, as should be expected from a definition. More precisely, the new theory is a conservative extension of the old one.

Definition of relation symbols [ edit ] Let T {\displaystyle T} be a first-order theory and ϕ ϕ ( x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle \phi (x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} a formula of T {\displaystyle T} such that x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} , ..., x n {\displaystyle x_{n}} are distinct and include the variables free in ϕ ϕ ( x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle \phi (x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} . Form a new first-order theory T ′ {\displaystyle T'} from T {\displaystyle T} by adding a new n {\displaystyle n} -ary relation symbol R {\displaystyle R} , the logical axioms featuring the symbol R {\displaystyle R} and the new axiom ∀ ∀ x 1 … … ∀ ∀ x n ( R ( x 1 , … … , x n ) ↔ ↔ ϕ ϕ ( x 1 , … … , x n ) ) {\displaystyle \forall x_{1}\dots \forall x_{n}(R(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})\leftrightarrow \phi (x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}))} , called the defining axiom of R {\displaystyle R} .

If ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } is a formula of T ′ {\displaystyle T'} , let ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi ^{\ast }} be the formula of T {\displaystyle T} obtained from ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } by replacing any occurrence of R ( t 1 , … … , t n ) {\displaystyle R(t_{1},\dots ,t_{n})} by ϕ ϕ ( t 1 , … … , t n ) {\displaystyle \phi (t_{1},\dots ,t_{n})} (changing the bound variables in ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } if necessary so that the variables occurring in the t i {\displaystyle t_{i}} are not bound in ϕ ϕ ( t 1 , … … , t n ) {\displaystyle \phi (t_{1},\dots ,t_{n})} ). Then the following hold: ψ ψ ↔ ↔ ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi \leftrightarrow \psi ^{\ast }} is provable in T ′ {\displaystyle T'} , and T ′ {\displaystyle T'} is a conservative extension of T {\displaystyle T} .

The fact that T ′ {\displaystyle T'} is a conservative extension of T {\displaystyle T} shows that the defining axiom of R {\displaystyle R} cannot be used to prove new theorems. The formula ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi ^{\ast }} is called a translation of ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } into T {\displaystyle T} . Semantically, the formula ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi ^{\ast }} has the same meaning as ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } , but the defined symbol R {\displaystyle R} has been eliminated.

Definition of function symbols [ edit ] Let T {\displaystyle T} be a first-order theory ( with equality ) and ϕ ϕ ( y , x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle \phi (y,x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} a formula of T {\displaystyle T} such that y {\displaystyle y} , x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} , ..., x n {\displaystyle x_{n}} are distinct and include the variables free in ϕ ϕ ( y , x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle \phi (y,x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} . Assume that we can prove ∀ ∀ x 1 … … ∀ ∀ x n ∃ ∃ !

y ϕ ϕ ( y , x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle \forall x_{1}\dots \forall x_{n}\exists !y\phi (y,x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} in T {\displaystyle T} , i.e. for all x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} , ..., x n {\displaystyle x_{n}} , there exists a unique y such that ϕ ϕ ( y , x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle \phi (y,x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} . Form a new first-order theory T ′ {\displaystyle T'} from T {\displaystyle T} by adding a new n {\displaystyle n} -ary function symbol f {\displaystyle f} , the logical axioms featuring the symbol f {\displaystyle f} and the new axiom ∀ ∀ x 1 … … ∀ ∀ x n ϕ ϕ ( f ( x 1 , … … , x n ) , x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle \forall x_{1}\dots \forall x_{n}\phi (f(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}),x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} , called the defining axiom of f {\displaystyle f} .

Let ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } be any atomic formula of T ′ {\displaystyle T'} . We define formula ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi ^{\ast }} of T {\displaystyle T} recursively as follows. If the new symbol f {\displaystyle f} does not occur in ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } , let ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi ^{\ast }} be ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } . Otherwise, choose an occurrence of f ( t 1 , … … , t n ) {\displaystyle f(t_{1},\dots ,t_{n})} in ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } such that f {\displaystyle f} does not occur in the terms t i {\displaystyle t_{i}} , and let χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } be obtained from ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } by replacing that occurrence by a new variable z {\displaystyle z} . Then since f {\displaystyle f} occurs in χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } one less time than in ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } , the formula χ χ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \chi ^{\ast }} has already been defined, and we let ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi ^{\ast }} be ∀ ∀ z ( ϕ ϕ ( z , t 1 , … … , t n ) → → χ χ ∗ ∗ ) {\displaystyle \forall z(\phi (z,t_{1},\dots ,t_{n})\rightarrow \chi ^{\ast })} (changing the bound variables in ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } if necessary so that the variables occurring in the t i {\displaystyle t_{i}} are not bound in ϕ ϕ ( z , t 1 , … … , t n ) {\displaystyle \phi (z,t_{1},\dots ,t_{n})} ). For a general formula ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } , the formula ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi ^{\ast }} is formed by replacing every occurrence of an atomic subformula χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } by χ χ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \chi ^{\ast }} . Then the following hold: ψ ψ ↔ ↔ ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi \leftrightarrow \psi ^{\ast }} is provable in T ′ {\displaystyle T'} , and T ′ {\displaystyle T'} is a conservative extension of T {\displaystyle T} .

The formula ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi ^{\ast }} is called a translation of ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } into T {\displaystyle T} . As in the case of relation symbols, the formula ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi ^{\ast }} has the same meaning as ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } , but the new symbol f {\displaystyle f} has been eliminated.

The construction of this paragraph also works for constants, which can be viewed as 0-ary function symbols.

Extensions by definitions [ edit ] A first-order theory T ′ {\displaystyle T'} obtained from T {\displaystyle T} by successive introductions of relation symbols and function symbols as above is called an extension by definitions of T {\displaystyle T} . Then T ′ {\displaystyle T'} is a conservative extension of T {\displaystyle T} , and for any formula ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } of T ′ {\displaystyle T'} we can form a formula ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi ^{\ast }} of T {\displaystyle T} , called a translation of ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } into T {\displaystyle T} , such that ψ ψ ↔ ↔ ψ ψ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \psi \leftrightarrow \psi ^{\ast }} is provable in T ′ {\displaystyle T'} . Such a formula is not unique, but any two of them can be proved to be equivalent in T .

In practice, an extension by definitions T ′ {\displaystyle T'} of T is not distinguished from the original theory T . In fact, the formulas of T ′ {\displaystyle T'} can be thought of as abbreviating their translations into T . The manipulation of these abbreviations as actual formulas is then justified by the fact that extensions by definitions are conservative.

Examples [ edit ] Traditionally, the first-order set theory ZF has = {\displaystyle =} (equality) and ∈ ∈ {\displaystyle \in } (membership) as its only primitive relation symbols, and no function symbols. In everyday mathematics, however, many other symbols are used such as the binary relation symbol ⊆ ⊆ {\displaystyle \subseteq } , the constant ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } , the unary function symbol P (the power set operation), etc. All of these symbols belong in fact to extensions by definitions of ZF.

Let T {\displaystyle T} be a first-order theory for groups in which the only primitive symbol is the binary product ×. In T , we can prove that there exists a unique element y such that x × y = y × x = x for every x . Therefore we can add to T a new constant e and the axiom ∀ ∀ x ( x × × e = x and e × × x = x ) {\displaystyle \forall x(x\times e=x{\text{ and }}e\times x=x)} , and what we obtain is an extension by definitions T ′ {\displaystyle T'} of T {\displaystyle T} . Then in T ′ {\displaystyle T'} we can prove that for every x , there exists a unique y such that x × y = y × x = e . Consequently, the first-order theory T ″ {\displaystyle T''} obtained from T ′ {\displaystyle T'} by adding a unary function symbol f {\displaystyle f} and the axiom ∀ ∀ x ( x × × f ( x ) = e and f ( x ) × × x = e ) {\displaystyle \forall x(x\times f(x)=e{\text{ and }}f(x)\times x=e)} is an extension by definitions of T {\displaystyle T} . Usually, f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is denoted x − − 1 {\displaystyle x^{-1}} .
