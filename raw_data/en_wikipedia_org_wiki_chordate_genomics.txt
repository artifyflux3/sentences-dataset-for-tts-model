The field depends on whole genome data (the entire DNA sequence ) of organisms. It uses comparisons of synteny blocks, chromosome translocation , and other genomic rearrangements to determine the evolutionary history of the clade, and to reconstruct the genome of the founding species.

Results [ edit ] Phylogeny [ edit ] The deep branching of chordate phylogeny has been clarified by chordate genomics.

[ 1 ] Chordate genomics demonstrates that the Lancelets are the most basal living clade within the chordates, while the Tunicates are the sister clade to the Craniata .

[ 2 ] Synteny [ edit ] A comparison of the genomes of the Lancelet Branchiostoma floridae ,  a fish , the chicken Gallus gallus , and humans Homo sapiens revealed extensive macro- synteny with little or no micro-synteny. That is, across the Chordate clade the same genes are found clustered near each other although the order of the genes within the clusters has been shuffled.

[ 3 ] There are 135 identifiable segments in the human genome which retain synteny with the ancestral chordate karyotype .

Synteny analysis indicates that there were 17 chromosomes in the last common ancestor to the Chordates.

[ 3 ] Genome Duplication [ edit ] Multiple lines of experimental evidence strongly suggest that twice in the lineage leading to the teleost fish the ancestral Chordate genome was duplicated.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] A comparison of the genomes of the Lancelet Branchiostoma floridae , the Tunicates Ciona intestinalis and Oikopleura dioica , the lamprey Petromyzon marinus , the fish Fugu rubripes and Gasterosteus aculeatus , the chicken Gallus gallus , and human Homo sapiens confirmed that two whole-genome duplications occurred in the early history of the Vertebrata clade.
