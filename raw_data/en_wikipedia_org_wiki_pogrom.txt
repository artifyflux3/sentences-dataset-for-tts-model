[ 1 ] The term entered the English language from Russian to describe late 19th- and early 20th-century attacks on Jews in the Russian Empire (mostly within the Pale of Settlement ). Retrospectively, similar attacks against Jews which occurred in other times and places were renamed pogroms.

[ 2 ] Sometimes the word is used to describe publicly sanctioned purgative attacks against non-Jewish groups. The characteristics of a pogrom vary widely, depending on the specific incident, at times leading to, or culminating in, massacres .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Significant pogroms in the Russian Empire included the Odessa pogroms , Warsaw pogrom (1881) , Kishinev pogrom (1903), Kiev pogrom (1905) , and Białystok pogrom (1906). After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, several pogroms occurred amidst the power struggles in Eastern Europe , including the Lwów pogrom (1918) and Kiev pogroms (1919) .
The most significant pogrom which occurred in Nazi Germany was the 1938 Kristallnacht . At least 91 Jews were killed, a further thirty thousand arrested and subsequently incarcerated in concentration camps , [ 10 ] a thousand synagogues burned, and over seven thousand Jewish businesses destroyed or damaged.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Notorious pogroms of World War II included the 1941 Farhud in Iraq, the July 1941 Iași pogrom in Romania – in which over 13,200 Jews were killed – as well as the Jedwabne pogrom in German-occupied Poland . Post-World War II pogroms included the 1945 Tripoli pogrom , the 1946 Kielce pogrom , the 1947 Aleppo pogrom , and the 1955 Istanbul pogrom .

This type of violence has also occurred to other ethnic and religious minorities. Examples include the 1984 Sikh massacre in which 3,000 Sikhs were killed [ 13 ] and the 2002 Gujarat pogrom against Indian Muslims.

[ 14 ] The word pogrom [ edit ] An early reference to a "pogrom" in The Times of London, December 1903. Together with The New York Times and the Hearst press , they took the lead in highlighting the pogrom in Kishinev (now Chişinău, Moldova ) and other cities in Russia.

[ 15 ] In May of the same year, The Times' Russian correspondent Dudley Disraeli Braham had been expelled from Russia.

[ 16 ] Main article: Definitions of pogrom Etymology [ edit ] First recorded in English in 1882, the Russian word pogróm ( погро́м , pronounced [pɐˈɡrom] ) is derived from the common prefix po- ( по- ) and the verb gromít' ( громи́ть , [ɡrɐˈmʲitʲ] ) meaning 'to destroy, wreak havoc, demolish violently'. The noun pogrom , which has a relatively short history, is used in English and many other languages as a loanword , possibly borrowed from Yiddish (where the word takes the form פאָגראָם ).

[ 17 ] Its modern widespread circulation began with the antisemitic violence in the Russian Empire in 1881–1883.

[ 18 ] Usage of the word [ edit ] The 1921 Tulsa race massacre , which destroyed the wealthiest black community in the United States, has been described as a pogrom.

[ 19 ] According to Encyclopædia Britannica , "the term is usually applied to attacks on Jews in the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [and] the first extensive pogroms followed the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881".

[ 1 ] The Wiley-Blackwell Dictionary of Modern European History Since 1789 states that pogroms "were antisemitic disturbances that periodically occurred within the tsarist empire." [ 3 ] However, the term is widely used to refer to many events which occurred prior to the Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire . Historian of Russian Jewry John Klier writes in Russians, Jews, and the Pogroms of 1881–1882 : "By the twentieth century, the word 'pogrom' had become a generic term in English for all forms of collective violence directed against Jews." [ 4 ] Abramson points out that "in mainstream usage the word has come to imply an act of antisemitism ", since while "Jews have not been the only group to suffer under this phenomenon ... historically Jews have been frequent victims of such violence." [ 20 ] The term is also used in reference to attacks on non-Jewish ethnic minorities, and accordingly, some scholars do not include antisemitism as the defining characteristic of pogroms . Reviewing the word's uses in scholarly literature, historian Werner Bergmann proposes that a pogrom should be "defined as a unilateral, nongovernmental form of collective violence that is initiated by the majority population against a largely defenseless minority ethnic group, and occurring when the majority expect the state to provide them [sic] with no assistance in overcoming a (perceived) threat from the minority".

[ 5 ] However, Bergmann adds that in Western usage, the word's "anti-Semitic overtones" have been retained.

[ 18 ] Historian David Engel supports this view, writing that while "there can be no logically or empirically compelling grounds for declaring that some particular episode does or does not merit the label [pogrom]," the majority of the incidents which are "habitually" described as pogroms took place in societies that were significantly divided by ethnicity or religion where the violence was committed by members of the higher-ranking group against members of a stereotyped lower-ranking group with which they expressed some complaint, and where the members of the higher-ranking group justified their acts of violence by claiming that the law of the land would not be used to prevent the alleged complaint.

[ 6 ] There is no universally accepted set of characteristics which define the term pogrom.

[ 6 ] [ 21 ] Klier writes that "when applied indiscriminately to events in Eastern Europe , the term can be misleading, the more so when it implies that 'pogroms' were regular events in the region and that they always shared common features." [ 4 ] Use of the term pogrom to refer to events in 1918–19 in Polish cities (including the Kielce pogrom , the Pinsk massacre and the Lwów pogrom ) was specifically avoided in the 1919 Morgenthau Report ; the word "excesses" was employed instead because the authors argued that the use of the term "pogrom" required a situation to be antisemitic rather than political in nature, which meant that it was inapplicable to the conditions which exist in a war zone.

[ 6 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Media use of the term pogrom to refer to the 1991 Crown Heights riot caused public controversy.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] In 2008, two separate attacks in the West Bank by Israeli Jewish settlers on Palestinian Arabs were characterized as pogroms by then Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert .

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Werner Bergmann suggests that all such incidents have a particularly unifying characteristic: "By the collective attribution of a threat, the pogrom differs from other forms of violence , such as lynchings , which are directed at individual members of a minority group, while the imbalance of power in favor of the rioters distinguishes pogroms from other forms of riots ( food riots , race riots or ' communal riots ' between evenly matched groups); and again, the low level of organization separates them from vigilantism , terrorism , massacre and genocide ".

[ 5 ] History of anti-Jewish pogroms [ edit ] The Hep-Hep riots in Würzburg , 1819. On the left, two peasant women are assaulting a Jewish man with a pitchfork and a broom. On the right, a man wearing spectacles, tails and a six-button waistcoat, "perhaps a pharmacist or a schoolteacher," [ 29 ] holds a Jewish man by the throat and is about to club him with a truncheon. The houses are being looted. A contemporary engraving by Johann Michael Voltz .

The first recorded anti-Jewish riots took place in Alexandria in the year 38 CE , followed by the more known riot of 66 CE . Other notable events took place in Europe during the Middle Ages . Jewish communities were targeted in 1189 and 1190 in England and throughout Europe during the Crusades and the Black Death of 1348–1350, including in Toulon , Erfurt , Basel , Aragon, Flanders [ 30 ] [ 31 ] and Strasbourg .

[ 32 ] Some 510 Jewish communities were destroyed during this period, [ 33 ] extending further to the Brussels massacre of 1370. On Holy Saturday of 1389, a riot began in Prague that led to the burning of the Jewish quarter, the killing of many Jews, and the suicide of many Jews trapped in the main synagogue; the number of dead was estimated at 400–500 men, women and children.

[ 34 ] Attacks against Jews also took place in Barcelona and other Spanish cities during the massacre of 1391 .

The brutal murders of Jews and Poles occurred during the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648–1657 in present-day Ukraine , then within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth .

[ 35 ] Modern historians give estimates of the scale of the murders by Khmelnytsky's Cossacks ranging between 40,000 and 100,000 men, women and children, [ b ] [ c ] or perhaps many more.

[ d ] However, these figures are contested as being too high, with the lowest estimates suggesting that 18,000–20,000 Jews died out of a total population of 40,000, many due to disease and famine.

[ 36 ] An outbreak of violence against Jews ( Hep-Hep riots ) occurred at the beginning of the 19th century in reaction to Jewish emancipation in the German Confederation .

[ 37 ] Pogroms in the Russian Empire [ edit ] Victims of a pogrom in Kishinev , Bessarabia, 1903 Further information: Pogroms in the Russian Empire The Russian Empire , which previously had very few Jews, acquired territories in the Russian Partition that contained large Jewish populations, during the military partitions of Poland in 1772, 1793 and 1795.

[ 38 ] In conquered territories, a new political entity called the Pale of Settlement was formed in 1791 by Catherine the Great . Most Jews from the former Commonwealth were allowed to reside only within the Pale, including families expelled by royal decree from St. Petersburg, Moscow and other large Russian cities.

[ 39 ] The 1821 Odessa pogroms marked the beginning of the 19th century pogroms in Tsarist Russia; there were four more such pogroms in Odessa before the end of the century.

[ 40 ] Following the assassination of Alexander II in 1881 by Narodnaya Volya , anti-Jewish events turned into a wave of over 200 pogroms by their modern definition, which lasted for several years.

[ 41 ] Jewish self-governing Kehillah were abolished by Tsar Nicholas I in 1844.

[ 42 ] There is some disagreement about the level of planning from the Tsarist authorities and the motives for the attacks.

[ 43 ] The first in 20th-century Russia was the Kishinev pogrom of 1903 in which 49 Jews were killed, hundreds wounded, 700 homes destroyed and 600 businesses pillaged.

[ 44 ] In the same year, pogroms took place in Gomel (Belarus), Smela , Feodosiya and Melitopol (Ukraine). Extreme savagery was typified by mutilations of the wounded.

[ 45 ] They were followed by the Zhitomir pogrom (with 29 killed), [ 46 ] and the Kiev pogrom of October 1905 resulting in a massacre of approximately 100 Jews.

[ 47 ] In three years between 1903 and 1906, about 660 pogroms were recorded in Ukraine and Bessarabia; half a dozen more in Belorussia, carried out with the Russian government's complicity, but no anti-Jewish pogroms were recorded in Poland.

[ 45 ] At about that time, the Jewish Labor Bund began organizing armed self-defense units ready to shoot back, and the pogroms subsided for a number of years.

[ 47 ] According to professor Colin Tatz , between 1881 and 1920 there were 1,326 pogroms in Ukraine ( see: Southwestern Krai parts of the Pale ) which took the lives of 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews, leaving half a million homeless.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] This violence across Eastern Europe prompted a wave of Jewish migration westward that totaled about 2.5 million people.

[ 50 ] Eastern Europe after World War I [ edit ] Map of pogroms in Ukraine between 1918 and 1920 per casualties Further information: Pogroms of the Russian Civil War Large-scale pogroms, which began in the Russian Empire several decades earlier, intensified during the period of the Russian Civil War in the aftermath of World War I. Professor Zvi Gitelman (in A Century of Ambivalence , originally published in 1988) estimated that only in 1918–1919 over 1,200 pogroms took place in Ukraine, thus amounting to the greatest slaughter of Jews in Eastern Europe since 1648.

[ 51 ] The Kiev pogroms of 1919 , according to Gitelman, were the first of a subsequent wave of pogroms in which between 30,000 and 70,000 Jews were massacred across Ukraine; although more recent assessments [ by whom?

] put the Jewish death toll at more than 100,000.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ verify ] Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his controversial 2002 book Two Hundred Years Together provided additional statistics from research conducted by Nahum Gergel (1887–1931), published in Yiddish in 1928 and English in 1951. Gergel counted 1,236 incidents of anti-Jewish violence between 1918 and 1921, and estimated that 887 mass pogroms occurred, the remainder being classified as "excesses" not assuming mass proportions.

[ 49 ] [ 54 ] Of all the pogroms accounted for in Gergel's research: About 40 percent were perpetrated by the Ukrainian People's Republic forces led by Symon Petliura . The Republic issued orders condemning pogroms, [ 55 ] but lacked authority to intervene.

[ 55 ] After May 1919 the Directory lost its role as a credible governing body; almost 75 percent of pogroms occurred between May and September of that year.

[ 56 ] Thousands of Jews were killed only for being Jewish, without any political affiliations.

[ 49 ] 25 percent by the Ukrainian Green Army and various Ukrainian nationalist gangs, 17 percent by the White Army , especially the forces of Anton Denikin , 8.5 percent of Gergel's total was attributed to pogroms carried out by men of the Red Army (more specifically Semyon Budenny 's First Cavalry, most of whose soldiers had previously served under Denikin).

[ 54 ] These pogroms were not, however, sanctioned by the Bolshevik leadership; the high command "vigorously condemned these pogroms and disarmed the guilty regiments", and the pogroms would soon be condemned by Mikhail Kalinin in a speech made at a military parade in Ukraine.

[ 54 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] Gergel's overall figures, which are generally considered conservative, are based on the testimony of witnesses and newspaper reports collected by the Mizrakh-Yidish Historiche Arkhiv which was first based in Kiev, then Berlin and later New York. The English version of Gergel's article was published in 1951 in the YIVO Annual of Jewish Social Science titled "The Pogroms in the Ukraine in 1918–1921".

[ 59 ] On 8 August 1919, during the Polish–Soviet War , Polish troops took over Minsk in Operation Minsk . They killed 31 Jews suspected of supporting the Bolshevist movement, beat and attacked many more, looted 377 Jewish-owned shops (aided by the local civilians) and ransacked many private homes.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] The "Morgenthau's report of October 1919 stated that there is no question that some of the Jewish leaders exaggerated these evils." [ 62 ] [ 63 ] According to Elissa Bemporad, the "violence endured by the Jewish population under the Poles encouraged popular support for the Red Army, as Jewish public opinion welcomed the establishment of the Belorussian SSR ." [ 64 ] After the First World War , during the localized armed conflicts of independence, 72 Jews were killed and 443 injured in the 1918 Lwów pogrom .

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] The following year, pogroms were reported by the New York Tribune in several cities in the newly established Second Polish Republic .

[ 70 ] Pogroms in Europe and the Americas before World War II [ edit ] Argentina 1919 [ edit ] In 1919, a pogrom occurred in Argentina , during the Tragic Week .

[ 71 ] It had an added element, as it was called to attack Jews and Catalans indiscriminately. The reasons are not clear, especially considering that, in the case of Buenos Aires , the Catalan colony, established mainly in the neighborhood of Montserrat, came from the foundation of the city, but could have been the result of the influence of Spanish nationalism , which at the time described Catalans as a Semitic ethnicity.

[ 72 ] Britain and Ireland [ edit ] A massacre of Armenians and Assyrians in the city of Adana , Ottoman Empire , April 1909 In the early 20th century, pogroms broke out elsewhere in the world as well. In 1904 in Ireland , the Limerick boycott caused several Jewish families to leave the town. During the 1911 Tredegar riot in Wales , Jewish homes and businesses were looted and burned over a period of a week, before the British Army was called in by the then Home Secretary Winston Churchill , who described the riot as a "pogrom".

[ 73 ] In the north of Ireland during the early 1920s, violent riots which were aimed at the expulsion of a religious group took place. In 1920, Lisburn and Belfast saw violence related to the Irish War of Independence and partition of Ireland . On 21 July 1920 in Belfast, Protestant Loyalists marched on the Harland and Wolff shipyards and forced over 11,000 Catholic and left-wing Protestant workers from their jobs.

[ 74 ] The sectarian rioting that followed resulted in about 20 deaths in just three days.

[ 75 ] These sectarian actions are often referred to as the Belfast Pogrom . In Lisburn, County Antrim, on 23–25 August 1920 Protestant loyalist crowds looted and burned practically every Catholic business in the town and attacked Catholic homes. About 1,000 people, a third of the town's Catholics, fled Lisburn.

[ 76 ] By the end of the first six months of 1922, hundreds of people had been killed in sectarian violence in newly formed Northern Ireland . On a per capita basis, four Roman Catholics were killed for every Protestant.

[ 77 ] In the worst incident of anti-Jewish violence in Britain during the interwar period, the "Pogrom of Mile End", that occurred in 1936, 200 Blackshirt youths ran amok in Stepney in the East End of London, smashing the windows of Jewish shops and homes and throwing an elderly man and young girl through a window. Though less serious, attacks on Jews were also reported in Manchester and Leeds in the north of England.

[ 78 ] Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe [ edit ] Main article: The Holocaust Iași pogrom in Romania , June 1941 The first pogrom in Nazi Germany was the Kristallnacht , often called Pogromnacht , in which at least 91 Jews were killed, a further 30,000 arrested and incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps , [ 10 ] over 1,000 synagogues burned, and over 7,000 Jewish businesses destroyed or damaged.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] During World War II , Nazi German death squads encouraged local populations in German-occupied Europe to commit pogroms against Jews. Brand new battalions of Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz (trained by SD agents) were mobilized from among the German minorities.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] A large number of pogroms occurred during the Holocaust at the hands of non-Germans.

[ 81 ] Perhaps the deadliest of these Holocaust-era pogroms was the Iași pogrom in Romania , perpetrated by Ion Antonescu , in which as many as 13,266 Jews were killed by Romanian citizens, police and military officials.

[ 82 ] On 1–2 June 1941, in the two-day Farhud pogrom in Iraq , perpetrated by Rashid Ali , Yunis al-Sabawi , and the al-Futuwa youth, "rioters murdered between 150 and 180 Jews, injured 600 others, and raped an undetermined number of women. They also looted some 1,500 stores and homes".

[ 83 ] [ 84 ] Also, 300–400 non-Jewish rioters were killed in the attempt to quell the violence.

[ 85 ] Jewish woman chased by men and youth armed with clubs during the Lviv pogroms , July 1941 In June–July 1941, encouraged by the Einsatzgruppen in the city of Lviv the Ukrainian People's Militia perpetrated two citywide pogroms in which around 6,000 Polish Jews were murdered, [ 86 ] in retribution for alleged collaboration with the Soviet NKVD . In Lithuania , some local police led by Algirdas Klimaitis and Lithuanian partisans – consisting of LAF units reinforced by 3,600 deserters from the 29th Lithuanian Territorial Corps of the Red Army [ 87 ] promulgated anti-Jewish pogroms in Kaunas along with occupying Nazis . On 25–26 June 1941, about 3,800 Jews were killed and synagogues and Jewish settlements burned.

[ 88 ] During the Jedwabne pogrom of July 1941, ethnic Poles burned at least 340 Jews in a barn ( Institute of National Remembrance ) in the presence of Nazi German Ordnungspolizei . The role of the German Einsatzgruppe B remains the subject of debate.

( August 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) After the end of World War II , a series of violent antisemitic incidents occurred against returning Jews throughout Europe , particularly in the Soviet-occupied East where Nazi propagandists had extensively promoted the notion of a Jewish-Communist conspiracy (see Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946 and Anti-Jewish violence in Eastern Europe, 1944–1946 ).

The violence was connected to the Ayodhya dispute and the demolition of the Babri Masjid . The burning of a train in Godhra on 27 February 2002, which caused the deaths of 58 Hindu pilgrims and karsevaks returning from Ayodhya , is cited as having instigated the violence.

[ 108 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] Following the initial riot incidents, there were further outbreaks of violence in Ahmedabad for three months; statewide, there were further outbreaks of violence against the minority Muslim population of Gujarat for the next year.

[ 118 ] The Huwara rampage in February 2023 [ edit ] Main article: Huwara rampage On 26 February, 2023, violent riots broke out from Israeli settlers in Huwara after two Israelis were shot and killed by  a Palestinian gunman there earlier that afternoon.

[ 119 ] The rioters killed one Palestinian, 37-year-old Sameh Aqtash, and wounded dozens, while torching houses and cars.

[ 120 ] Top Israeli general in the West Bank , Yehuda Fuchs , referred to the Israeli settlers' actions as a "pogrom": "The incident in Hawara was a pogrom carried out by outlaws," [ 121 ] [ 122 ] and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned "vigilantism".

[ 119 ] Journalist Gideon Levy wrote an editorial in Haaretz saying that Israel's military had failed to stop the violence stating: "whether out of apathy and complacency, or because they were very deliberately turning a blind eye." [ 123 ] A legal expert said that the rioters could face war crime charges if Israel did not conduct an investigation into the perpetrators.

[ 124 ] Jewish American documentary maker Simone Zimmerman also used the term pogrom to describe the attacks on Palestinians by Israeli settlers in Hawara in February 2023.

[ 125 ] Zimmerman described these attacks as being committed by settlers while the Israeli army stood by and let it happen.

[ 125 ] Hamas-initiated attacks on 7 October 2023 [ edit ] Main article: 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel On 7 October 2023, Hamas ' Al Qassam Brigades militant wing (based in the Gaza Strip ), and other groups and individuals incited to join them, [ 126 ] initiated an attack on Israel. In addition to the military, the attack also targeted civilian communities and resulted in the deaths of over 695 Israeli civilians, most of whom were Israeli Jews and some of whom were Arab Israelis .

[ 127 ] [ 128 ] In the attacks Al Qassam and other armed groups from Gaza also took approximately 250 people , many of which were non-Israelis hostage, including infants, elderly, and people who had already been severely injured.

[ 129 ] The 7 October attacks were described as a "pogrom" by Suzanne Rutland , who defined a pogrom as a government-approved attack on Jews and pointed out that the attacks were initiated by the Hamas, the governing authority of Gaza .

[ 130 ] Others who have described the 7 October attacks as a pogrom include then- UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron , and think tanks such as the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs .

[ 131 ] [ 132 ] An editorial by the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board referred to 7 October attacks as a pogrom.

[ 133 ] Survivors of October 7 have also described the attack on their kibbutzim as pogroms.

[ 134 ] Some historians have objected to the characterisation of 7 October as a pogrom, saying the events on 7 October do not resemble the original historical pogroms in Russia.

[ 135 ] [ 136 ] The Jerusalem Post described the 7 October attacks as "historically unique", as well as "foreseeable" and "expected".

[ 137 ] Judith Butler , controversially described the attacks as an "act of armed resistance".

[ 143 ] November 2024 Amsterdam riots [ edit ] The November 2024 Amsterdam riots preceding and following the AFC Ajax - Maccabi Tel Aviv football match were described by some as a "pogrom". Israeli diplomat Danny Danon stated that, "We are receiving very disturbing reports of extreme violence against Israelis and Jews on the streets of Holland. There is a pogrom currently taking place in Europe in 2024".

[ 144 ] The Mayor of Amsterdam later said that the word "pogrom" was inappropriate and that it had been misused as "propaganda".

[ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] In the weeks after the event, the initial media coverage was widely criticized for misrepresenting the event.

[ 148 ] [ 149 ] [ 150 ] Targets of the violence included Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, [ 151 ] an Arab taxi driver, [ 152 ] and pro-Palestinian protestors.

[ 153 ] In the run-up to the match, some Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were filmed pulling Palestinian flags from houses, making anti-Arab chants such as " Death to Arabs ", assaulting people, and vandalising local property.

[ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] [ 157 ] [ 158 ] Calls to target Israeli supporters were subsequently shared via social media.

Scholars have frequently labeled the Alexandrian events of 38 C.E. as the first pogrom [ citation needed ] in history and have often explained them in terms of an ante litteram explosion of anti-Semitism. This work [ The Alexandrian Riots ] deliberately avoids any words or expressions that in any way connect, explicitly or implicitly, the Alexandrian events of 38 C.E. to later events in modern or contemporary Jewish experience, for which that terminology was created. ... To decide whether a word like pogrom , for example, is an appropriate term to describe the events that are studied here, requires a comparative re-discussion of two historical frames—the Alexandria of 38 C.E. and the Russia of the end of the nineteenth century." [ 161 ] ^ a b John Klier : "upon the death of the Grand Prince of Kiev Sviatopolk , rioting broke out in Kiev against his agents and the town administration. The disorders were not specifically directed against Jews and they are best characterized as a social revolution. This fact has not prevented historians of medieval Russia from describing them as a pogrom." [ 163 ] Klier also writes that Alexander Pereswetoff-Morath has advanced a strong argument against considering the Kiev riots of 1113 an anti-Jewish pogrom. Pereswetoff-Morath writes in "A Grin without a Cat" (2002) that "I feel that Birnbaum's use of the term "anti-Semitism' as well as, for example, his use of 'pogrom' in references to medieval Rus are not warranted by the evidence he presents. He is, of course, aware that it may be controversial." [ 163 ] George Vernadsky : "Incidentally, one should not suppose that the movement was anti-Semitic. There was no general Jewish pogrom. Wealthy Jewish merchants suffered because of their association with Sviatopolk's speculations, especially his hated monopoly on salt." [ 164 ] ^ John Klier : "Russian armies led by Tsar Ivan IV captured the Polish city of Polotsk. The Tsar ordered drowned in the river Dvina all Jews who refused to convert to Orthodox Christianity. This episode certainly demonstrates the overt religious hostility towards the Jews which was very much a part of Muscovite culture, but its conversionary aspects were entirely absent from modern pogroms. Nor were the Jews the only heterodox religious group singled out for the tender mercies of Muscovite religious fanaticism." [ 163 ] ^ Israeli ambassador to Ireland , Boaz Moda'i: "I think it is a bit over-portrayed, meaning that, usually if you look up the word pogrom it is used in relation to slaughter and being killed. This is what happened in many other places in Europe, but that is not what happened here. There was a kind of boycott against Jewish merchandise for a while but that's not a pogrom." [ 166 ] ^ Carole Fink: "What happened in Pinsk on April 5, 1919 was not a literal "pogrom" – an organized, officially tolerated or inspired massacre of a minority such as the massacre which occurred in Lemberg – instead, it was a military execution of a small, suspect group of civilians. ... The misnamed "Pinsk pogrom", a plain, powerful, alliterative phrase, entered history in April 1919. Its importance lay not only in its timing, during the tensest moments of the Paris Peace Conference and the most crucial deliberations over Poland's political future: The reports of Pinsk once more demonstrated the swift transmission of local violence to world notice and the disfiguring process of rumor and prejudice on every level." [ 172 ] ^ 6 Catholics were killed, 4 by state force & 2 by anti-Catholic mob.

^ Media use of the term pogrom to refer to the 1991 Crown Heights riot caused public controversy.

[ 26 ] [ 24 ] For example, Joyce Purnick of The New York Times wrote in 1993 that the use of the word pogrom was "inflammatory"; she accused politicians of "trying to enlarge and twist the word" in order to "pander to Jewish voters".

[ 180 ] ^ 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus (official) 1,926 to 2,000+ total (other sources) [ 184 ] [ 185 ] [ 186 ] ^ Muslims in Australia and Arab Australians and people misidentified as belonging to those groups.

Descriptions of the events in the table [ edit ] ^ Aulus Avilius Flaccus , the Egyptian prefect of Alexandria appointed by Tiberius in 32 CE, may have encouraged the outbreak of violence in which Jews were pushed out of the city of Alexandria and blockaded into a Jewish "ghetto". Those trying to escape the ghetto were killed, dismembered, and some burnt alive.

[ 162 ] Philo wrote that Flaccus was later arrested and eventually executed for his part in this event. Scholarly research around the subject has been divided on certain points, including whether the Alexandrian Jews fought to keep their citizenship or to acquire it, whether they evaded the payment of the poll-tax or prevented any attempts to impose it on them, and whether they were safeguarding their identity against the Greeks or against the Egyptians.

^ A mob stormed the royal palace in Granada , which was at that time in Muslim-ruled al-Andalus , assassinated the Jewish vizier Joseph ibn Naghrela and massacred much of the Jewish population of the city.

^ Peasant crusaders from France and Germany during the People's Crusade , led by Peter the Hermit (and not sanctioned by the hierarchy of the Catholic Church , attacked Jewish communities in the three towns of Speyer , Worms and Mainz .

^ After an episode of famine and bad harvests, a pogrom happened in Lisbon, Portugal, [ 165 ] in which more than 1,000 " New Christian " (forcibly converted Jews) people were slaughtered or burnt by an angry Christian mob, in the first night of what became known as the " Lisbon Massacre ". The killing occurred from 19 to 21 April, almost eliminating the entire Jewish or Jewish-descended community in that city. Even the Portuguese military and the king himself had difficulty stopping it. Today the event is remembered with a monument in S. Domingos' church.

^ Following the fall of Polotsk to the army of Ivan IV, all those who refused to convert to Orthodox Christianity were ordered drowned in the Western Dvina river.

^ Eastern Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Cossack riots, aka pogroms, aka uprisings included massive atrocities committed against Jews in what is today Ukraine, in numbers (conservatively estimated here by Veidlinger, Ataskevitch & Bemporad). They resulted in the creation of a new Hetmantate.

^ The Greeks of Odessa attacked the local Jewish community, in what began as economic disputes.

^ Following accusations of Jews having conspired to murder a Christian monk for culinary purposes, the local population attacked Jewish businesses and committed acts of violence against the Jewish population.

^ A large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots swept through south-western Imperial Russia (present-day Ukraine and Poland from 1881 to 1884 (in that period over 200 anti-Jewish events occurred in the Russian Empire , notably the Kiev , Warsaw and Odessa pogroms ) ^ Three days of rioting against Jews, Jewish stores, businesses, and residences in the streets adjoining the Holy Cross Church.

^ A mob attacked the Jewish shops, killing fourteen Jews and one gendarme . The Russian military brought to restore order were stoned by mob.

^ A much bloodier wave of pogroms broke out from 1903 to 1906, leaving an estimated 2,000 Jews dead and many more wounded, as many Jewish residents took arms to defend their families and property from the attackers. The 1905 pogrom against the Jewish population in Odessa was the most serious pogrom of the period, with reports of up to 2,500 Jews killed.

^ Three days of anti-Jewish rioting sparked by antisemitic articles in local newspapers.

^ Two days of anti-Jewish rioting beginning as political protests against the Tsar.

^ Following a city hall meeting, a mob was drawn into the streets, proclaiming that "all Russia's troubles stemmed from the machinations of the Jews and socialists ." ^ An attack organized by the Russian secret police Okhrana . Antisemitic pamphlets had been distributed for over a week and before any unrest begun, a curfew was declared.

^ An economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community in Limerick, Ireland, for over two years.

^ A massacre of Armenians in the city of Adana amidst the government upheaval resulted in a series of anti-Armenian pogroms throughout the district.

^ A massacre of African Americans living in Slocum, Texas , organized by white mobs after rumors of a Black uprising began to spread. White people throughout Anderson County gathered guns, ammunition, and alcohol to prepare. District Judge Benjamin Howard Gardner attempted to stop the massacre by closing all saloons, gun stores, and hardware stores, but it was too late.

The tensions started in June 1934 and spread to a few other villages in Eastern Thrace region and to some small cities in Western Aegean region. At the height of the violent events, it was rumoured that a rabbi was stripped naked and was dragged through the streets shamefully while his daughter was raped. Over 15,000 Jews had to flee from the region.

[ 174 ] [ 175 ] ^ Some of the Jewish residents gathered in the town square in anticipation of the attack by the peasants, but nothing happened on that day. Two days later, however, on a market day, as historians Martin Gilbert and David Vital state, peasants attacked their Jewish neighbors.

Catholics generally fled across the border into the Republic of Ireland as refugees. After Belfast the other areas that saw violence were Newry , Armagh , Crossmaglen , Dungannon , Coalisland and Dungiven .

The bloodiest clashes were in Belfast, where seven people were killed and hundreds wounded, in what some viewed as an attempted pogrom against the Catholic minority. Protesters clashed with both the police and with loyalists, who attacked Catholic districts. Scores of homes and businesses were burnt out, most of them owned by Catholics, and thousands of mostly Catholic families were driven from their homes. In some cases, RUC officers helped the loyalists and failed to protect Catholic areas.

By the twentieth century, the word "pogrom" had become a generic term in English for all forms of collective violence directed against Jews. The term was especially associated with Eastern Europe and the Russian Empire, the scene of the most serious outbreaks of anti-Jewish violence before the Holocaust. Yet when applied indiscriminately to events in Eastern Europe, the term can be misleading, the more so when it implies that "pogroms" were regular events in the region and that they always shared common features. In fact, outbreaks of mass violence against Jews were extraordinary events, not a regular feature of East European life.

The word "pogrom" (from the Russian, meaning storm or devastation) has a relatively short history. Its international currency dates back to the anti-Semitic excesses in Tsarist Russia during the years 1881–1883, but the phenomenon existed in the same form at a much earlier date and was by no means confined to Russia. As John D. Klier points out in his seminal article "The pogrom paradigm in Russian history", the anti-Semitic pogroms in Russia were described by contemporaries as demonstrations, persecution, or struggle, and the government made use of the term besporiadok (unrest, riot) to emphasize the breach of public order. Then, during the twentieth century, the term began to develop along two separate lines. In the Soviet Union, the word lost its anti-Semitic connotation and came to be used for reactionary forms of political unrest and, from 1989, for outbreaks of interethnic violence; while in the West, the anti-Semitic overtones were retained and government orchestration or acquiescence was emphasized.

The etymological roots of the term pogrom are unclear, although it seems to be derived from the Slavic word for "thunder(bolt)" (Russian: grom, Ukrainian: hrim). The first syllable, po-, is a prefix indicating "means" or "target". The word therefore seems to imply a sudden burst of energy (thunderbolt) directed at a specific target. A pogrom is generally thought of as a cross between a popular riot and a military atrocity, where an unarmed civilian, often urban, population is attacked by either an army unit or peasants from surrounding villages, or a combination of the two.

^ Bergmann writes that "the concept of "ethnic violence" covers a range of heterogeneous phenomena, and in many cases there are still no established theoretical and conceptual distinctions in the field (Waldmann, 1995:343)" Bergmann then goes on to set out a variety of conflicting scholarly views on the definition and usage of the term pogrom.

Haaretz . 5 June 2014 . Retrieved 17 January 2023 .

On June 5, 1934, violent actions against Jews of several towns in the Turkish region of Thrace began. Although no Jews were killed, the extensive destruction of property, and the very fact of the attacks in a country that was always known for its hospitality to Jews, led to many of them moving from Thrace, or emigrating from Turkey altogether. Recent historical research has led some scholars to conclude that this was the goal of the government in the actions it took in the weeks prior to the pogroms...
