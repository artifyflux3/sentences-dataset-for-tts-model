The **interrobang** (),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-1) also known as the **interabang**[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-interrobang-2)**‽** (often rendered as **?!**, **!?**, **?!?**, **?!!**, **!??**, or **!?!**), is an unconventional [punctuation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_mark "Punctuation mark") intended to combine the functions of the [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark") (also known as the interrogative point)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-A_course_of_reading_for_common_schools_and_the_lower_classes_of_academies-3) and the [exclamation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark "Exclamation mark") (also known in the jargon of printers and programmers as a "bang").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-4) The glyph is a [ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(writing) "Ligature (writing)") of these two marks[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-5) and was first proposed in 1962 by Martin K. Speckter.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-NYT1988-6)

A sentence ending with an interrobang states a question in an excited manner, expresses excitement, disbelief, or confusion in the form of a question, or asks a [rhetorical question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question "Rhetorical question").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-7)

For example:

*   You call that a hat‽
*   Are you _out of your mind_‽
*   Your dog ate what‽
*   Are you a dummy‽

Writers using informal language may use several alternating question marks and exclamation marks for even more emphasis. However, this is regarded as poor style in formal writing.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-8)

An interrobang in the [Palatino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino "Palatino")[Linotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergenthaler_Linotype_Company "Mergenthaler Linotype Company") font

Historically, writers have used multiple consecutive punctuation marks to end a sentence expressing both surprise and question.

American Martin K. Speckter (June 14, 1915 – February 14, 1988)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-9) conceptualized the interrobang in 1962. As the head of an advertising agency, Speckter believed that advertisements would look better if [copywriters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copywriting "Copywriting") conveyed surprised rhetorical questions using a single mark. He proposed the concept of a single punctuation mark in an article in the magazine _TYPEtalks_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-10) Speckter solicited possible names for the new character from readers. Contenders included _exclamaquest_, and _exclarotive_, but he settled on _interrobang_. He chose the name to reference the punctuation marks that inspired it: _interrogatio_ is Latin for "rhetorical question" or "cross-examination";[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-11)_bang_ is printers' slang for the exclamation mark. Graphic treatments for the new mark were also submitted in response to the article.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-fonthaus-12)

In 1965, [Richard Isbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Isbell&action=edit&redlink=1 "Richard Isbell (page does not exist)") created the [Americana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(typeface) "Americana (typeface)") typeface for [American Type Founders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Type_Founders "American Type Founders") and included the interrobang as one of the characters.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-13) In 1968, an interrobang key was available on some [Remington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_Rand "Remington Rand")[typewriters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter"). In the 1970s, replacement interrobang keycaps and [typefaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface "Typeface") were available for some [Smith-Corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith-Corona "Smith-Corona") typewriters.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-14) The interrobang was in vogue for much of the 1960s; the word _interrobang_ appeared in some dictionaries, and the mark was used in magazine and newspaper articles.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-fonthaus-12)

Most fonts do not include the interrobang, but it has not disappeared. [Lucida Grande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucida_Grande "Lucida Grande"), the default font for many UI elements of legacy versions of [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.")'s [OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X "OS X") operating system, includes the interrobang, and [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") provides several versions of the interrobang in the [Wingdings 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingdings "Wingdings") character set (on the right bracket and tilde keys on US keyboard layouts), included with [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office "Microsoft Office").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-15) It was accepted into [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode")[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-16) and is included in several fonts, including [Lucida Sans Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucida_Sans_Unicode "Lucida Sans Unicode"), [Arial Unicode MS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial_Unicode_MS "Arial Unicode MS"), and [Calibri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibri "Calibri"), the default font in the [Office 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2007 "Microsoft Office 2007"), [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2010 "Microsoft Office 2010"), and [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2013 "Microsoft Office 2013") suites.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-17)

Upside-down interrobang
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interrobang&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Upside-down interrobang")]

An upside-down interrobang (combining ¿ and ¡, Unicode character: ⸘), suitable for starting phrases in [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_(language) "Spanish (language)"), [Galician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language "Galician language"), and [Asturian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturian_language "Asturian language")—which use [inverted question and exclamation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_question_and_exclamation_marks "Inverted question and exclamation marks")—is called an "inverted interrobang" or, rarely, a _gnaborretni_ (_interrobang_ spelled backwards).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-18) In current practice, interrobang-like emphatic ambiguity in Hispanic languages is usually achieved by including both sets of punctuation marks one inside the other (_¿¡De verdad!?_ or _¡¿De verdad?!_ [_Really!?_]).[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-19) Older usage, still official but not widespread, recommended mixing the punctuation marks: _¡Verdad?_ or _¿Verdad!_[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-20)

The symbol is encoded in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode")'s [General Punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Punctuation "General Punctuation") block at [codepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codepoint "Codepoint")U+203D‽INTERROBANG. The inverted interrobang is at codepoint U+2E18⸘INVERTED INTERROBANG. Single-character versions of the double-glyph versions are also available at codepoints U+2048⁈QUESTION EXCLAMATION MARK and U+2049⁉EXCLAMATION QUESTION MARK.

The [State Library of New South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Library_of_New_South_Wales "State Library of New South Wales"), in Australia, uses an interrobang as its logo,[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-21) as does the educational publishing company [Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_PLC "Pearson PLC"), which thus intends to convey "the excitement and fun of learning".[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-22)

The logo of the [National Endowment for the Humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Humanities "National Endowment for the Humanities") incorporates eight exclamation marks and eight question marks; although their main strokes are separate, they all share the same dot, as in some variants of interrobangs.

Chief Judge [Frank H. Easterbrook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_H._Easterbrook "Frank H. Easterbrook") used an interrobang in the 2012 [United States Seventh Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Seventh_Circuit "United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit") opinion _Robert F. Booth Trust v. Crowley_.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-99pi_2018-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-Easterbrook_2012-24)

[Australian Federal Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Court "Australian Federal Court") Justice Michael Wigney used an interrobang in the first paragraph of his 2018 judgment in _Faruqi v Latham [2018] FCA 1328_ (defamation proceedings between former Federal Opposition Leader Mark Latham and political campaigner and writer Osman Faruqi).[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-25)

In [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess "Chess"), an interrobang is used to represent a dubious move, one that is questionable but possibly has merits.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang#cite_note-CI14-26) (See also the [evaluation symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_annotation_symbols#Evaluation_symbols "Chess annotation symbols")?! (dubious move) and!? (interesting move).)
