Specifically, the two measures agree on which events have measure zero.

Definition [ edit ] Let Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } and ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } be two measures on the measurable space ( X , A ) , {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}}),} and let N Œº Œº := { A ‚àà ‚àà A ‚à£ ‚à£ Œº Œº ( A ) = 0 } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}_{\mu }:=\{A\in {\mathcal {A}}\mid \mu (A)=0\}} and N ŒΩ ŒΩ := { A ‚àà ‚àà A ‚à£ ‚à£ ŒΩ ŒΩ ( A ) = 0 } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}_{\nu }:=\{A\in {\mathcal {A}}\mid \nu (A)=0\}} be the sets of Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } - null sets and ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } -null sets, respectively. Then the measure ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } is said to be absolutely continuous in reference to Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } if and only if N ŒΩ ŒΩ ‚äá ‚äá N Œº Œº .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}_{\nu }\supseteq {\mathcal {N}}_{\mu }.} This is denoted as ŒΩ ŒΩ ‚â™ ‚â™ Œº Œº .

{\displaystyle \nu \ll \mu .} The two measures are called equivalent if and only if Œº Œº ‚â™ ‚â™ ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \mu \ll \nu } and ŒΩ ŒΩ ‚â™ ‚â™ Œº Œº , {\displaystyle \nu \ll \mu ,} [ 1 ] which is denoted as Œº Œº ‚àº ‚àº ŒΩ ŒΩ .

{\displaystyle \mu \sim \nu .} That is, two measures are equivalent if they satisfy N Œº Œº = N ŒΩ ŒΩ .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}_{\mu }={\mathcal {N}}_{\nu }.} Examples [ edit ] On the real line [ edit ] Define the two measures on the real line as Œº Œº ( A ) = ‚à´ ‚à´ A 1 [ 0 , 1 ] ( x ) d x {\displaystyle \mu (A)=\int _{A}\mathbf {1} _{[0,1]}(x)\mathrm {d} x} ŒΩ ŒΩ ( A ) = ‚à´ ‚à´ A x 2 1 [ 0 , 1 ] ( x ) d x {\displaystyle \nu (A)=\int _{A}x^{2}\mathbf {1} _{[0,1]}(x)\mathrm {d} x} for all Borel sets A .

{\displaystyle A.} Then Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } and ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } are equivalent, since all sets outside of [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} have Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } and ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } measure zero, and a set inside [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} is a Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } -null set or a ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } -null set exactly when it is a null set with respect to Lebesgue measure .

Abstract measure space [ edit ] Look at some measurable space ( X , A ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}})} and let Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } be the counting measure , so Œº Œº ( A ) = | A | , {\displaystyle \mu (A)=|A|,} where | A | {\displaystyle |A|} is the cardinality of the set a. So the counting measure has only one null set, which is the empty set . That is, N Œº Œº = { ‚àÖ ‚àÖ } .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}_{\mu }=\{\varnothing \}.} So by the second definition, any other measure ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } is equivalent to the counting measure if and only if it also has just the empty set as the only ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } -null set.

Supporting measures [ edit ] A measure Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } is called a supporting measure of a measure ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } if Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } is œÉ œÉ {\displaystyle \sigma } -finite and ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } is equivalent to Œº Œº .
