In mathematics , a solenoid is a compact connected topological space (i.e. a continuum ) that may be obtained as the inverse limit of an inverse system of topological groups and continuous homomorphisms f i : S i + 1 → → S i ∀ ∀ i ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle f_{i}:S_{i+1}\to S_{i}\quad \forall i\geq 0} where each S i {\displaystyle S_{i}} is a circle and f i is the map that uniformly wraps the circle S i + 1 {\displaystyle S_{i+1}} for n i + 1 {\displaystyle n_{i+1}} times ( n i + 1 ≥ ≥ 2 {\displaystyle n_{i+1}\geq 2} ) around the circle S i {\displaystyle S_{i}} .

[ 1 ] : Ch. 2 Def. (10.12) This construction can be carried out geometrically in the three-dimensional Euclidean space R 3 . A solenoid is a one-dimensional homogeneous indecomposable continuum that has the structure of an abelian compact topological group .

Solenoids were first introduced by Vietoris for the n i = 2 {\displaystyle n_{i}=2} case, [ 2 ] and by van Dantzig the n i = n {\displaystyle n_{i}=n} case, where n ≥ ≥ 2 {\displaystyle n\geq 2} is fixed.

[ 3 ] Such a solenoid arises as a one-dimensional expanding attractor , or Smale–Williams attractor , and forms an important example in the theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems .

Construction [ edit ] Geometric construction and the Smale–Williams attractor [ edit ] A solid torus wrapped twice around inside another solid torus in R 3 The first six steps in the construction of the Smale-Williams attractor.

Each solenoid may be constructed as the intersection of a nested system of embedded solid tori in R 3 .

Fix a sequence of natural numbers { n i }, n i ≥ 2. Let T 0 = S 1 × D be a solid torus . For each i ≥ 0, choose a solid torus T i +1 that is wrapped longitudinally n i times inside the solid torus T i . Then their intersection Λ Λ = ⋂ ⋂ i ≥ ≥ 0 T i {\displaystyle \Lambda =\bigcap _{i\geq 0}T_{i}} is homeomorphic to the solenoid constructed as the inverse limit of the system of circles with the maps determined by the sequence { n i }.

Here is a variant of this construction isolated by Stephen Smale as an example of an expanding attractor in the theory of smooth dynamical systems. Denote the angular coordinate on the circle S 1 by t (it is defined mod 2π) and consider the complex coordinate z on the two-dimensional unit disk D . Let f be the map of the solid torus T = S 1 × D into itself given by the explicit formula f ( t , z ) = ( 2 t , 1 4 z + 1 2 e i t ) .

{\displaystyle f(t,z)=\left(2t,{\tfrac {1}{4}}z+{\tfrac {1}{2}}e^{it}\right).} This map is a smooth embedding of T into itself that preserves the foliation by meridional disks (the constants 1/2 and 1/4 are somewhat arbitrary, but it is essential that 1/4 < 1/2 and 1/4 + 1/2 < 1). If T is imagined as a rubber tube, the map f stretches it in the longitudinal direction, contracts each meridional disk, and wraps the deformed tube twice inside T with twisting, but without self-intersections. The hyperbolic set Λ of the discrete dynamical system ( T , f ) is the intersection of the sequence of nested solid tori described above, where T i is the image of T under the i th iteration of the map f . This set is a one-dimensional (in the sense of topological dimension ) attractor , and the dynamics of f on Λ has the following interesting properties: meridional disks are the stable manifolds , each of which intersects Λ over a Cantor set periodic points of f are dense in Λ the map f is topologically transitive on Λ General theory of solenoids and expanding attractors, not necessarily one-dimensional, was developed by R. F. Williams and involves a projective system of infinitely many copies of a compact branched manifold in place of the circle, together with an expanding self- immersion .

Construction in toroidal coordinates [ edit ] In the toroidal coordinates with radius R {\displaystyle R} , the solenoid can be parametrized by t ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle t\in \mathbb {R} } as ζ ζ = 2 π π t , r e i θ θ = ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ r k e 2 π π i ω ω k t {\displaystyle \zeta =2\pi t,\quad re^{i\theta }=\sum _{k=1}^{\infty }r_{k}e^{2\pi i\omega _{k}t}} where ω ω k = 1 n 1 ⋯ ⋯ n k , r k = R δ δ 1 ⋯ ⋯ δ δ k {\displaystyle \omega _{k}={\frac {1}{n_{1}\cdots n_{k}}},\quad r_{k}=R\delta _{1}\cdots \delta _{k}} Here, δ δ k {\displaystyle \delta _{k}} are adjustable shape-parameters, with constraint 0 < δ δ < 1 − − 1 1 + sin ⁡ ⁡ π π n k {\displaystyle 0<\delta <1-{\frac {1}{1+\sin {\frac {\pi }{n_{k}}}}}} . In particular, δ δ = 1 2 n k {\displaystyle \delta ={\frac {1}{2n_{k}}}} works.

Let S ⊂ ⊂ R 3 {\displaystyle S\subset \mathbb {R} ^{3}} be the solenoid constructed this way, then the topology of the solenoid is just the subset topology induced by the Euclidean topology on R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} .

Since the parametrization is bijective, we can pullback the topology on S {\displaystyle S} to R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } , which makes R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } itself the solenoid. This allows us to construct the inverse limit maps explicitly: g k : R → → S k , g k ( t ) = ( r , θ θ , ζ ζ ) in toroidal coordinates, where ζ ζ = 2 π π t , r e i θ θ = ∑ ∑ k = 1 k r k e 2 π π i ω ω k t {\displaystyle g_{k}:\mathbb {R} \to S_{k},\quad g_{k}(t)=(r,\theta ,\zeta ){\text{ in toroidal coordinates, where }}\zeta =2\pi t,\quad re^{i\theta }=\sum _{k=1}^{k}r_{k}e^{2\pi i\omega _{k}t}} Construction by symbolic dynamics [ edit ] Viewed as a set, the solenoid is just a Cantor-continuum of circles, wired together in a particular way. This suggests to us the construction by symbolic dynamics , where we start with a circle as a "racetrack", and append an "odometer" to keep track of which circle we are on.

Define S = S 1 × × ∏ ∏ k = 1 ∞ ∞ Z n k {\displaystyle S=S^{1}\times \prod _{k=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {Z} _{n_{k}}} as the solenoid. Next, define addition on the odometer Z × × ∏ ∏ k = 1 ∞ ∞ Z n k → → ∏ ∏ k = 1 ∞ ∞ Z n k {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \times \prod _{k=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {Z} _{n_{k}}\to \prod _{k=1}^{\infty }\mathbb {Z} _{n_{k}}} , in the same way as p -adic numbers . 
Next, define addition on the solenoid + : R × × S → → S {\displaystyle +:\mathbb {R} \times S\to S} by r + ( θ θ , n ) = ( ( r + θ θ mod 1 ) , ⌊ ⌊ r + θ θ ⌋ ⌋ + n ) {\displaystyle r+(\theta ,n)=((r+\theta \mod 1),\lfloor r+\theta \rfloor +n)} The topology on the solenoid is generated by the basis containing the subsets S ′ × × Z ( m 1 , .

Pathological properties [ edit ] Solenoids are compact metrizable spaces that are connected , but not locally connected or path connected . This is reflected in their pathological behavior with respect to various homology theories , in contrast with the standard properties of homology for simplicial complexes . In Čech homology , one can construct a non-exact long homology sequence using a solenoid. In Steenrod -style homology theories, [ 4 ] the 0th homology group of a solenoid may have a fairly complicated structure, even though a solenoid is a connected space.
