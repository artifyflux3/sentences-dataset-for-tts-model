This inequality provides an upper bound on the probability of occurrence of at least one of a countable number of events in terms of the individual probabilities of the events. Boole's inequality is named for its discoverer, George Boole .

[ 1 ] Formally, for a countable set of events A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , ..., we have P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ A i ) ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ i = 1 ∞ ∞ P ( A i ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathbb {P} }\left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }A_{i}\right)\leq \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }{\mathbb {P} }(A_{i}).} In measure-theoretic terms, Boole's inequality follows from the fact that a measure (and certainly any probability measure ) is σ - sub-additive . Thus Boole's inequality holds not only for probability measures P {\displaystyle {\mathbb {P} }} , but more generally when P {\displaystyle {\mathbb {P} }} is replaced by any finite measure.

Proof [ edit ] Proof using induction [ edit ] Boole's inequality may be proved for finite collections of n {\displaystyle n} events using the method of induction .

[ citation needed ] For the n = 1 {\displaystyle n=1} case, it follows that P ( A 1 ) ≤ ≤ P ( A 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {P} (A_{1})\leq \mathbb {P} (A_{1}).} For the case n {\displaystyle n} , we have P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n A i ) ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ i = 1 n P ( A i ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathbb {P} }\left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\right)\leq \sum _{i=1}^{n}{\mathbb {P} }(A_{i}).} Since P ( A ∪ ∪ B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) − − P ( A ∩ ∩ B ) , {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} (A\cup B)=\mathbb {P} (A)+\mathbb {P} (B)-\mathbb {P} (A\cap B),} and because the union operation is associative , we have P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n + 1 A i ) = P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n A i ) + P ( A n + 1 ) − − P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n A i ∩ ∩ A n + 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {P} \left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{n+1}A_{i}\right)=\mathbb {P} \left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\right)+\mathbb {P} (A_{n+1})-\mathbb {P} \left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\cap A_{n+1}\right).} Since P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n A i ∩ ∩ A n + 1 ) ≥ ≥ 0 , {\displaystyle {\mathbb {P} }\left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\cap A_{n+1}\right)\geq 0,} by the first axiom of probability , we have P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n + 1 A i ) ≤ ≤ P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n A i ) + P ( A n + 1 ) , {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} \left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{n+1}A_{i}\right)\leq \mathbb {P} \left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\right)+\mathbb {P} (A_{n+1}),} and therefore P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n + 1 A i ) ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ i = 1 n P ( A i ) + P ( A n + 1 ) = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n + 1 P ( A i ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {P} \left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{n+1}A_{i}\right)\leq \sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbb {P} (A_{i})+\mathbb {P} (A_{n+1})=\sum _{i=1}^{n+1}\mathbb {P} (A_{i}).} Proof without using induction [ edit ] Let events A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , … … {\displaystyle A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},\dots } in our probability space be given. The countable additivity of the measure P {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} } states that if B 1 , B 2 , B 3 , … … {\displaystyle B_{1},B_{2},B_{3},\dots } are pairwise disjoint events, then P ( ⋃ ⋃ i B i ) = ∑ ∑ i P ( B i ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {P} \left(\bigcup _{i}B_{i}\right)=\sum _{i}\mathbb {P} (B_{i}).} Set B i := A i − − ⋃ ⋃ j = 1 i − − 1 A j .

{\displaystyle B_{i}:=A_{i}-\bigcup _{j=1}^{i-1}A_{j}.} Then B 1 , B 2 , B 3 , … … {\displaystyle B_{1},B_{2},B_{3},\dots } are pairwise disjoint. We claim that: ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ A i = ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ B i .

{\displaystyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }A_{i}=\bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }B_{i}.} One inclusion is clear. Indeed, since B i ⊂ ⊂ A i {\displaystyle B_{i}\subset A_{i}} for all i, thus ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ B i ⊂ ⊂ ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ A i {\displaystyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }B_{i}\subset \bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }A_{i}} .

For the other inclusion, let x ∈ ∈ ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ A i {\displaystyle x\in \bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }A_{i}} be given. Write k {\displaystyle k} for the minimum positive integer such that x ∈ ∈ A k {\displaystyle x\in A_{k}} . Then x ∈ ∈ A k − − ⋃ ⋃ j = 1 k − − 1 A j = B k {\displaystyle x\in A_{k}-\bigcup _{j=1}^{k-1}A_{j}=B_{k}} . Thus x ∈ ∈ ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ B i {\displaystyle x\in \bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }B_{i}} . Therefore ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ A i ⊂ ⊂ ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ B i {\displaystyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }A_{i}\subset \bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }B_{i}} .

Therefore P ( ⋃ ⋃ i A i ) = P ( ⋃ ⋃ i B i ) = ∑ ∑ i P ( B i ) ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ i P ( A i ) , {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} \left(\bigcup _{i}A_{i}\right)=\mathbb {P} \left(\bigcup _{i}B_{i}\right)=\sum _{i}\mathbb {P} (B_{i})\leq \sum _{i}\mathbb {P} (A_{i}),} where the last inequality holds because B i ⊂ ⊂ A i {\displaystyle B_{i}\subset A_{i}} implies that P ( B i ) ≤ ≤ P ( A i ) , {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} (B_{i})\leq \mathbb {P} (A_{i}),} for all i.

Bonferroni inequalities [ edit ] Boole's inequality for a finite number of events may be generalized to certain upper and lower bounds on the probability of finite unions of events.

[ 2 ] These bounds are known as Bonferroni inequalities , after Carlo Emilio Bonferroni ; see Bonferroni (1936) .

Let S 1 := ∑ ∑ i = 1 n P ( A i ) , S 2 := ∑ ∑ 1 ≤ ≤ i 1 < i 2 ≤ ≤ n P ( A i 1 ∩ ∩ A i 2 ) , … … , S k := ∑ ∑ 1 ≤ ≤ i 1 < ⋯ ⋯ < i k ≤ ≤ n P ( A i 1 ∩ ∩ ⋯ ⋯ ∩ ∩ A i k ) {\displaystyle S_{1}:=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\mathbb {P} }(A_{i}),\quad S_{2}:=\sum _{1\leq i_{1}<i_{2}\leq n}{\mathbb {P} }(A_{i_{1}}\cap A_{i_{2}}),\quad \ldots ,\quad S_{k}:=\sum _{1\leq i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}\leq n}{\mathbb {P} }(A_{i_{1}}\cap \cdots \cap A_{i_{k}})} for all integers k in {1, ..., n }.

Then, when K ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle K\leq n} is odd: ∑ ∑ j = 1 K ( − − 1 ) j − − 1 S j ≥ ≥ P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n A i ) = ∑ ∑ j = 1 n ( − − 1 ) j − − 1 S j {\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{K}(-1)^{j-1}S_{j}\geq \mathbb {P} {\Big (}\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}{\Big )}=\sum _{j=1}^{n}(-1)^{j-1}S_{j}} holds, and when K ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle K\leq n} is even: ∑ ∑ j = 1 K ( − − 1 ) j − − 1 S j ≤ ≤ P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n A i ) = ∑ ∑ j = 1 n ( − − 1 ) j − − 1 S j {\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{K}(-1)^{j-1}S_{j}\leq \mathbb {P} {\Big (}\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}{\Big )}=\sum _{j=1}^{n}(-1)^{j-1}S_{j}} holds.

The inequalities follow from the inclusion–exclusion principle , and Boole's inequality is the special case of K = 1 {\displaystyle K=1} . Since the proof of the inclusion-exclusion principle requires only the finite additivity (and nonnegativity) of P {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} } , thus the Bonferroni inequalities holds more generally P {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} } is replaced by any finite content , in the sense of measure theory.

Proof for odd K [ edit ] Let E = ⋂ ⋂ i = 1 n B i {\displaystyle E=\bigcap _{i=1}^{n}B_{i}} , where B i ∈ ∈ { A i , A i c } {\displaystyle B_{i}\in \{A_{i},A_{i}^{c}\}} for each i = 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle i=1,\dots ,n} . These such E {\displaystyle E} partition the sample space , and for each E {\displaystyle E} and every i {\displaystyle i} , E {\displaystyle E} is either contained in A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} or disjoint from it.

If E = ⋂ ⋂ i = 1 n A i c {\displaystyle E=\bigcap _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}^{c}} , then E {\displaystyle E} contributes 0 to both sides of the inequality.

Otherwise, assume E {\displaystyle E} is contained in exactly L {\displaystyle L} of the A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} . Then E {\displaystyle E} contributes exactly P ( E ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} (E)} to the right side of the inequality, while it contributes ∑ ∑ j = 1 K ( − − 1 ) j − − 1 ( L j ) P ( E ) {\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{K}(-1)^{j-1}{L \choose j}\mathbb {P} (E)} to the left side of the inequality. However, by Pascal's rule , this is equal to ∑ ∑ j = 1 K ( − − 1 ) j − − 1 ( ( L − − 1 j − − 1 ) + ( L − − 1 j ) ) P ( E ) {\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{K}(-1)^{j-1}{\Big (}{L-1 \choose j-1}+{L-1 \choose j}{\Big )}\mathbb {P} (E)} which telescopes to ( 1 + ( L − − 1 K ) ) P ( E ) ≥ ≥ P ( E ) {\displaystyle {\Big (}1+{L-1 \choose K}{\Big )}\mathbb {P} (E)\geq \mathbb {P} (E)} Thus, the inequality holds for all events E {\displaystyle E} , and so by summing over E {\displaystyle E} , we obtain the desired inequality: ∑ ∑ j = 1 K ( − − 1 ) j − − 1 S j ≥ ≥ P ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n A i ) {\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{K}(-1)^{j-1}S_{j}\geq \mathbb {P} {\Big (}\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}{\Big )}} The proof for even K {\displaystyle K} is nearly identical.

[ 3 ] Example [ edit ] Suppose that you are estimating five parameters based on a random sample,  and you can control each parameter separately. If you want your estimations of all five parameters to be good with a chance 95%, what should you do to each parameter?

Tuning each parameter's chance to be good to within 95% is not enough because "all are good" is a subset of each event "Estimate i is good". We can use Boole's Inequality to solve this problem. By finding the complement of event "all five are good", we can change this question into another condition: P (at least one estimation is bad) = 0.05 ≤ P ( A 1 is bad) + P ( A 2 is bad) + P ( A 3 is bad) + P ( A 4 is bad) + P ( A 5 is bad) One way is to make each of them equal to 0.05/5 = 0.01, that is 1%. In other words, you have to guarantee each estimate good to 99%( for example, by constructing a 99% confidence interval ) to make sure the total estimation to be good with a chance 95%. This is called the Bonferroni Method of simultaneous inference.
