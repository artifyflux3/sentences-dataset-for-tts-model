One type of Laplace functional, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] also known as a characteristic functional [ a ] is defined in relation to a point process, which can be interpreted as random counting measures, and has applications in characterizing and deriving results on point processes.

[ 5 ] Its definition is analogous to a characteristic function for a random variable .

The other Laplace functional is for probability spaces equipped with metrics and is  used to study the concentration of measure properties of the space.

Definition for point processes [ edit ] For a general point process N {\displaystyle \textstyle N} defined on R d {\displaystyle \textstyle {\textbf {R}}^{d}} , the Laplace functional is defined as: [ 6 ] L N ( f ) = E [ e − − ∫ ∫ R d f ( x ) N ( d x ) ] , {\displaystyle L_{N}(f)=E[e^{-\int _{{\textbf {R}}^{d}}f(x){N}(dx)}],} where f {\displaystyle \textstyle f} is any measurable non-negative function on R d {\displaystyle \textstyle {\textbf {R}}^{d}} and ∫ ∫ R d f ( x ) N ( d x ) = ∑ ∑ x i ∈ ∈ N f ( x i ) .

{\displaystyle \int _{{\textbf {R}}^{d}}f(x){N}(dx)=\sum \limits _{x_{i}\in N}f(x_{i}).} where the notation N ( d x ) {\displaystyle N(dx)} interprets the point process as a random counting measure ; see Point process notation .

Applications [ edit ] The Laplace functional characterizes a point process, and if it is known for a point process, it can be used to prove various results.

[ 2 ] [ 6 ] Definition for probability measures [ edit ] For some metric probability space ( X , d , μ ), where  ( X , d )  is a metric space and μ is a probability measure on the Borel sets of ( X , d ),  the Laplace functional : E ( X , d , μ μ ) ( λ λ ) := sup { ∫ ∫ X e λ λ f ( x ) d μ μ ( x ) | f : : X → → R is bounded, 1-Lipschitz and has ∫ ∫ X f ( x ) d μ μ ( x ) = 0 } .

{\displaystyle E_{(X,d,\mu )}(\lambda ):=\sup \left\{\left.\int _{X}e^{\lambda f(x)}\,\mathrm {d} \mu (x)\right|f\colon X\to \mathbb {R} {\text{ is bounded, 1-Lipschitz and has }}\int _{X}f(x)\,\mathrm {d} \mu (x)=0\right\}.} The Laplace functional maps from the positive real line to the positive (extended) real line, or in mathematical notation: E ( X , d , μ μ ) : : [ 0 , + ∞ ∞ ) → → [ 0 , + ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle E_{(X,d,\mu )}\colon [0,+\infty )\to [0,+\infty ]} Applications [ edit ] The Laplace functional of ( X , d , μ ) can be used to bound the concentration function of ( X , d , μ ), which is defined for r > 0 by α α ( X , d , μ μ ) ( r ) := sup { 1 − − μ μ ( A r ) ∣ ∣ A ⊆ ⊆ X and μ μ ( A ) ≥ ≥ 1 2 } , {\displaystyle \alpha _{(X,d,\mu )}(r):=\sup\{1-\mu (A_{r})\mid A\subseteq X{\text{ and }}\mu (A)\geq {\tfrac {1}{2}}\},} where A r := { x ∈ ∈ X ∣ ∣ d ( x , A ) ≤ ≤ r } .

{\displaystyle A_{r}:=\{x\in X\mid d(x,A)\leq r\}.} The Laplace functional of ( X , d , μ )  then gives leads to the upper bound: α α ( X , d , μ μ ) ( r ) ≤ ≤ inf λ λ ≥ ≥ 0 e − − λ λ r / 2 E ( X , d , μ μ ) ( λ λ ) .

{\displaystyle \alpha _{(X,d,\mu )}(r)\leq \inf _{\lambda \geq 0}e^{-\lambda r/2}E_{(X,d,\mu )}(\lambda ).} Notes [ edit ] ^ Kingman [ 3 ] calls it a "characteristic functional" but Daley and Vere-Jones [ 2 ] and others call it a "Laplace functional", [ 1 ] [ 4 ] reserving the term "characteristic functional" for when θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } is imaginary.
