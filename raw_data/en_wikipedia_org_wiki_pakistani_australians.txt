[ 4 ] History in Australia [ edit ] See also: Afghan cameleers in Australia An anthropological study by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology found a genetic pattern ( SNP ) among Aboriginal Australians which is also present among some Dravidian speakers native to the Indian subcontinent . According to the study, the migration of these genes from the subcontinent to Australia may have occurred well over 4,200 years ago at around 2217 BC, roughly the same period when the Indus Valley civilisation (IVC) was emerging.

[ 5 ] Although the IVC did not extend to the southern part of the Indian subcontinent where this SNP is predominantly found, it is a commonly held view that the Dravidians were "once more widespread than they are today." [ 5 ] The Indus Valley states extensively used seafaring ships to trade with their West Asian neighbours, and it is believed that these may have facilitated the means to get to Australia.

[ 5 ] These early settlers were assimilated into the local population.

[ 5 ] Early Muslim migrants (known as " Ghans ") entered Outback Australia as camel drivers in the late 1800s from Colonial India and some of those areas are now part of present-day Pakistan.

[ 4 ] Many of these men were unmarried, and intermarried with local Aboriginal women, resulting in a mixed Aboriginal Australian population with ancestry in Pakistan.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Immigration from lands that make up the historical territory of Pakistan to Australia has been occurring since the late 19 century.  In the modern sense, Pakistan came into existence in 1947 as a result of the dissolution of the British Raj via the Partition of India .  In the modern post-independence sense,  Pakistani migrants can be dated back to the early 1950s, Immigration to Australia from Pakistan started to pick up in the 1970s. Since then the number of Pakistani immigrants increased dramatically, with thousands of Pakistanis entering Australia each year since that time.

The bronze-age Indus valley civilisation, which reached its peak of development between 2600BC and 1900BC, is less well-known to outsiders than its contemporaries in China and the Middle East... One technology it managed to develop was seaworthy ships, rather than mere boats, and Indus valley states used them to trade with their Middle Eastern neighbours. Such ships could have provided the means to get to Australia, either deliberately or by accident...
