It has a population of 118,403 (2020) and a growing number of high-rise buildings .

Tallest buildings and structures [ edit ] This list ranks Cambridge buildings that stand at least 200 feet (61 m) tall, based on height measurement criteria established by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) and Emporis.com. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts, roof top signs, flag poles or other functional-technical equipment. An equals sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings. The "Year" column indicates the year in which a building was completed. Freestanding towers , guyed masts and other not habitable structures are included for comparison purposes; however, they are not ranked.

In 2015, Leland Cheung of the Cambridge City Council contemplated the maximum rezoning of the area in terms of building heights, and asked if buildings of up to 1,000 feet (305 m) could be considered in the future. A height of 1,000 feet would be over 200 feet taller than the tallest building in the metro-Boston area: the John Hancock Tower .
