It is a generalization of the concept of finite measure , which takes nonnegative real values only.

Definitions and first consequences [ edit ] Given a field of sets ( Ω Ω , F ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}})} and a Banach space X , {\displaystyle X,} a finitely additive vector measure (or measure , for short) is a function μ μ : F → → X {\displaystyle \mu :{\mathcal {F}}\to X} such that for any two disjoint sets A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} in F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} one has μ μ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) = μ μ ( A ) + μ μ ( B ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (A\cup B)=\mu (A)+\mu (B).} A vector measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is called countably additive if for any sequence ( A i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle (A_{i})_{i=1}^{\infty }} of disjoint sets in F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} such that their union is in F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} it holds that μ μ ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ A i ) = ∑ ∑ i = 1 ∞ ∞ μ μ ( A i ) {\displaystyle \mu {\left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }A_{i}\right)}=\sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\mu (A_{i})} with the series on the right-hand side convergent in the norm of the Banach space X .

{\displaystyle X.} It can be proved that an additive vector measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is countably additive if and only if for any sequence ( A i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle (A_{i})_{i=1}^{\infty }} as above one has lim n → → ∞ ∞ ‖ μ μ ( ⋃ ⋃ i = n ∞ ∞ A i ) ‖ = 0 , {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\left\|\mu {\left(\bigcup _{i=n}^{\infty }A_{i}\right)}\right\|=0,} * where ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|} is the norm on X .

{\displaystyle X.} Countably additive vector measures defined on sigma-algebras are more general than finite measures , finite signed measures , and complex measures , which are countably additive functions taking values respectively on the real interval [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ) , {\displaystyle [0,\infty ),} the set of real numbers , and the set of complex numbers .

Examples [ edit ] Consider the field of sets made up of the interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} together with the family F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} of all Lebesgue measurable sets contained in this interval. For any such set A , {\displaystyle A,} define μ μ ( A ) = χ χ A {\displaystyle \mu (A)=\chi _{A}} where χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } is the indicator function of A .

{\displaystyle A.} Depending on where μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is declared to take values, two different outcomes are observed.

μ μ , {\displaystyle \mu ,} viewed as a function from F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} to the L p {\displaystyle L^{p}} -space L ∞ ∞ ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) , {\displaystyle L^{\infty }([0,1]),} is a vector measure which is not countably-additive.

μ μ , {\displaystyle \mu ,} viewed as a function from F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} to the L p {\displaystyle L^{p}} -space L 1 ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) , {\displaystyle L^{1}([0,1]),} is a countably-additive vector measure.

Both of these statements follow quite easily from the criterion ( * ) stated above.

The variation of a vector measure [ edit ] Given a vector measure μ μ : F → → X , {\displaystyle \mu :{\mathcal {F}}\to X,} the variation | μ μ | {\displaystyle |\mu |} of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is defined as | μ μ | ( A ) = sup ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ‖ ‖ μ μ ( A i ) ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle |\mu |(A)=\sup \sum _{i=1}^{n}\|\mu (A_{i})\|} where the supremum is taken over all the partitions A = ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n A i {\displaystyle A=\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}} of A {\displaystyle A} into a finite number of disjoint sets, for all A {\displaystyle A} in F .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}.} Here, ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|} is the norm on X .

{\displaystyle X.} The variation of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a finitely additive function taking values in [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] .

{\displaystyle [0,\infty ].} It holds that ‖ ‖ μ μ ( A ) ‖ ‖ ≤ ≤ | μ μ | ( A ) {\displaystyle \|\mu (A)\|\leq |\mu |(A)} for any A {\displaystyle A} in F .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}.} If | μ μ | ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle |\mu |(\Omega )} is finite, the measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is said to be of bounded variation . One can prove that if μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a vector measure of bounded variation, then μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is countably additive if and only if | μ μ | {\displaystyle |\mu |} is countably additive.

Lyapunov's theorem [ edit ] In the theory of vector measures, Lyapunov 's theorem states that the range of a ( non-atomic ) finite-dimensional vector measure is closed and convex .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] In fact, the range of a non-atomic vector measure is a zonoid (the closed and convex set that is the limit of a convergent sequence of zonotopes ).

[ 2 ] It is used in economics , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] in ( "bang–bang" ) control theory , [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] and in statistical theory .

[ 8 ] Lyapunov's theorem has been proved by using the Shapley–Folkman lemma , [ 9 ] which has been viewed as a discrete analogue of Lyapunov's theorem.

Vind's article was noted by Debreu (1991 , p. 4) with this comment: The concept of a convex set (i.e., a set containing the segment connecting any two of its points) had repeatedly been placed at the center of economic theory before 1964. It appeared in a new light with the introduction of integration theory in the study of economic competition: If one associates with every agent of an economy an arbitrary set in the commodity space and if one averages those individual sets over a collection of insignificant agents, then the resulting set is necessarily convex . [Debreu appends this footnote: "On this direct consequence of a theorem of A. A. Lyapunov, see Vind (1964) ."] But explanations of the  ... functions of prices  ... can be made to rest on the convexity of sets derived by that averaging process .

Convexity in the commodity space obtained by aggregation over a collection of insignificant agents is an insight that economic theory owes  ... to integration theory. [ Italics added ] Debreu, Gérard (March 1991). "The Mathematization of economic theory".
