In polymer chemistry , chain termination is any chemical reaction that ceases the formation of reactive intermediates in a chain propagation step in the course of a polymerization , effectively bringing it to a halt.

IUPAC definition Chemical reaction in which a chain carrier is converted irreversibly into a non-propagating species without the formation of a new chain carrier.

[ 1 ] Mechanisms of termination [ edit ] In polymer chemistry , there are several mechanisms by which a polymerization reaction can terminate depending on the mechanism and circumstances of the reaction. A method of termination that applies to all polymer reactions is the depletion of monomer . In chain growth polymerization, two growing chains can collide head to head causing the growth of both of the chains to stop. In the case of radical or anionic polymerization , chain transfer can occur where the radical at the end of the growing chain can be transferred from the chain to an individual monomer unit causing a new chain to start growing and the previous chain to stop growing. With step-growth polymerization , the reaction can be terminated by adding a monofunctional species containing the same functionality as one or more of the types of monomer used in the reaction. For example, an alcohol R'−OH can be used to stop a reaction between a polyisocyanate and a polyol because it will react with the isocyanate functionality R−N=C=O to produce R−(N−H)−(C=O)−O−R' which is then no longer reactive with the polyol.

Termination of radical polymerization [ edit ] The termination steps of free radical polymerization steps are of two types: recombination and disproportionation .

[ 2 ] In a recombination step, two growing chain radicals (denoted by • ) form a covalent bond in a single stable molecule. For the example of a vinyl polymer , [ − − CH 2 − − CHX ∙ ∙ ] + [ − − CH 2 − − CHX ∙ ∙ ] ⟶ ⟶ [ − − CH 2 − − CHX − − CHX − − CH 2 − − ] {\displaystyle \ {\Bigl [}\!\!\!\!{\ce {-CH2-CHX}}^{\bullet }{\Bigr ]}\quad +\quad {\Bigl [}\!\!\!\!{\ce {-CH2-CHX}}^{\bullet }{\Bigr ]}\quad \longrightarrow \quad {\Bigl [}\!\!\!\!{\ce {-CH2-CHX-CHX-CH2{}-}}\!\!\!\!{\Bigr ]}} Termination by recombination increases the chain length and therefore the molecular weight of the final polymer.

[ 2 ] In a disproportionation step, one radical transfers a hydrogen atom to the other to form two stable molecules: [ − − CH 2 − − CHX ∙ ∙ ] + [ − − CH 2 − − CHX ∙ ∙ ] ⟶ ⟶ [ − − CH 2 − − CHX ] + [ − − CH = CHX ] {\displaystyle \ {\Bigl [}\!\!\!\!{\ce {-CH2-CHX^{\bullet }}}{\Bigr ]}\quad +\quad {\Bigl [}\!\!\!\!{\ce {-CH2-CHX^{\bullet }}}{\Bigr ]}\quad \longrightarrow \quad {\Bigl [}\!\!\!\!{\ce {-CH2-CHX}}{\Bigr ]}\quad +\quad {\Bigl [}\!\!\!\!{\ce {-CH=CHX}}{\Bigr ]}} Termination by disproportionation usually has a higher activation energy since it involves breaking of one bond, and therefore is more important at higher energy.
