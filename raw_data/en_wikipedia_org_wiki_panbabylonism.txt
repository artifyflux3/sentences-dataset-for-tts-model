[ 1 ] Overview [ edit ] A related school of thought is the Bible-Babel school, which regarded the Hebrew Bible and Judaism to be directly derived from Mesopotamian (Babylonian) mythology [ citation needed ] ; both are forms of hyperdiffusionism in archaeology .

[ 2 ] Both theories were popular in Germany, and Panbabylonism remained popular from the late 19th century to World War I . Prominent advocates included Friedrich Delitzsch , Peter Jensen , Alfred Jeremias and Hugo Winckler .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Panbabylonist thought largely disappeared from legitimate scholarship after the death of one of its greatest proponents, Hugo Winckler .

[ 2 ] The claims of the school were largely discredited by astronomical and chronological arguments of Franz Xaver Kugler (a Jesuit priest).
