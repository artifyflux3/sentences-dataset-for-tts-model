[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] Mathematics professor Michael Fekete, the Provost of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , with his water quota, during the siege of Jerusalem Michael Fekete was born in Zenta, Austria-Hungary (today Senta , Serbia ). He received his PhD in 1909 from the University of Budapest (later renamed Eötvös Loránd University). He studied under Lipót Fejér . After completing his PhD he switched to University of Göttingen , which was considered a mathematics hub. In 1914, he returned to the University of Budapest, where he attained the title of Privatdozent .

[ 2 ] Fekete also worked as a private math tutor.  Among his students was János Neumann . In 1922, Fekete published a paper together with Neumann on extremal polynomials, which was Neumann's first scientific paper .

[ 3 ] Fekete dedicated the majority of his scientific work to the transfinite diameter .

In 1928 Fekete immigrated to Mandate Palestine and was among the first instructors of the Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .

[ 4 ] In 1929 he was promoted to professor , and eventually headed the institute, succeeding Edmund Landau and Adolf Abraham Halevi Fraenkel . He later became the dean of Natural Sciences , and between the years 1946–1948 he was Hebrew University Provost .
