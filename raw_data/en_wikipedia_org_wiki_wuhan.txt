With a population of over eleven million, it is the most populous city in Hubei and the eighth-most-populous city in China.

[ 15 ] It is also one of China's nine national central cities .

[ 16 ] Wuhan historically served as a busy city port for commerce and trading with some crucial influences on Chinese history . The name "Wuhan" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang , Hankou , and Hanyang , which are collectively known as the "Three Towns of Wuhan" ( 武汉三镇 ). Wuhan lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain , at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River , and is known as "Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare" ( 九省通衢 ).

[ 1 ] Wuhan was the site of the 1911 Wuchang Uprising against the Qing dynasty which ended 2,000 years of dynastic rule . Wuhan was briefly a capital of China twice, in 1927 under a left wing Kuomintang (KMT) government , [ 17 ] and in 1937 as a provisional wartime capital during World War II .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] In 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War , the city was the site of the Battle of Wuhan . On December 31, 2019, SARS-CoV-2 , a novel coronavirus that later caused the COVID-19 pandemic , was first discovered in Wuhan [ 20 ] [ 21 ] and the city was the location of the first lockdown of the pandemic in January 2020.

[ 22 ] Wuhan is considered the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural, and educational center of Central China.

[ 23 ] It is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads, and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities.

[ 24 ] Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as "the Chicago of China" by foreign sources.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The "Golden Waterway" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang , Hankou , and Hanyang . The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city. The Three Gorges Dam , the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity , is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has suffered risks of flooding, [ 25 ] prompting the government to alleviate the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption mechanisms.

[ 26 ] While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial changes in China. Wuhan has three national development zones, four scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms.

[ 27 ] It produced GDP (nominal) of US$274 billion in 2021. The Dongfeng Motor Corporation , an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan. The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education, including Wuhan University [ 28 ] and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology . Wuhan is a major city in the world by scientific research outputs and it ranks 9th globally and 5th in the Asia-Pacific & China (after Beijing , Shanghai , Nanjing and Guangzhou ).

[ 29 ] In 2017, Wuhan was designated as a Creative City by UNESCO , in the field of design.

[ 30 ] Wuhan is classified as a Beta- (global second tier) city together with seven other cities in China, including Changsha , Dalian , Jinan , Shenyang , Xiamen , Xi'an and Zhengzhou by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network .

[ 31 ] Wuhan is also one of the world's top 100 financial centers, according to the Global Financial Centres Index .

[ 32 ] Etymology [ edit ] The name "Wuhan" comes from the two major cities on the banks of the Yangtze River that make up the Wuhan metropolis: "Wu" refers to the city of Wuchang ( Chinese : 武昌 ), which lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze, while "Han" refers to the city of Hankou ( Chinese : 汉口 ), which lies on the northern bank of the Yangtze. "Hankou" means "Mouth of the Han", from its position at the confluence of the Han with the Yangtze River.

In 1926, the Northern Expedition reached the Wuhan area and it was decided to merge Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang into one city in order to make a new capital for Nationalist China. On January 1, 1927, [ 33 ] the resulting city was proclaimed as ' 武漢 ' (the traditional Chinese characters for 'Wuhan'), which was later simplified as ' 武汉 ' (also 'Wuhan').

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Wuhan Antiquity era [ edit ] Panlongcheng , located in the southernmost area of the Erligang culture The Wuhan area has been settled for 3,500 years.

Panlongcheng , an archaeological site primarily associated with the Erligang culture ( c.

1510 – c.

1460 BC) (being sparsely populated during the earlier Erlitou period ), is located in modern-day Huangpi District of Wuhan.

During the Western Zhou the State of E , which gives its name to the single character abbreviation for Hubei province, controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state in 863 BC, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the State of Chu for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods. After the State of Huang was conquered by State of Chu in the summer of 648 BC, [ 37 ] the people of Huang were moved into the area in and around present-day Wuhan. Local geographical terms including the name of Wuhan's Huangpi District were named after the State of Huang.

[ citation needed ] Chu was in turn conquered by Qin in 223 BC.

Imperial China [ edit ] Yellow Crane Tower During the Han dynasty , Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought in the region over control of Jiangxia Commandery , territories of which included much of present-day eastern Hubei. In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms —the Battle of Red Cliffs —took place near the Yangtze River , with the cliffs near Wuhan identified as one of the potential locations.

[ 38 ] Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower , one of the Four Great Towers of China , was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan , leader of the Eastern Wu . The tower became a sacred site of Taoism .

[ 39 ] Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei kingdoms, in the autumn of 228, [ b ] Cao Rui , grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei , ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou ( 夏口 ; in present-day Wuhan).

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] In 279, Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (in present-day Yichang , Hubei), Xiakou ( 夏口 ; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang ( 武昌 ; present-day Ezhou , Hubei).

During the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420–479), Southern Qi (479–502), Liang , [ citation needed ] and Western Liang .

[ citation needed ] In fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si ( 蕭嗣 ). Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control. Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia ( 江夏 , in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire—believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne—and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang ( 淳于量 ). The opposing sides met at Zhuankou ( 沌口 , in modern Wuhan).

The city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies.

Cui Hao , a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty , visited the Yellow Crane Tower in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.

[ 43 ] In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture ( 鄂州 , in modern Wuhan). He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture ( 宋州 , in modern Shangqiu , Henan ). In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang ( 黃州 , in modern Wuhan) Prefectures.

Before Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that Möngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on the Wuhan area, near the Yangtze . The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces. Under the Mongol rulers ( Yuan dynasty ) (after 1301), the Wuchang prefecture , headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province. Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing , was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang , although it was already one of the four major national markets ( 四大名镇 [ zh ] ) of the Ming dynasty.

Hanyang's Guiyuan Temple was completed in the 15th year of Shunzhi (1658).

[ 44 ] By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four trading centers. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north–south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou.

[ 45 ] During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom , the Wuhan area was controlled for many years by rebel forces and the Yellow Crane Tower, Xingfu Temple , Zhuodaoquan Temple and other buildings were repurposed or damaged. During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856–1860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking , which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin , High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.

In the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Smith Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking , Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of 30.53 square kilometers (11.79 sq mi) along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession.

In 1862, Russian tea merchants arrived in the treaty port of Hankou. Russians in Hankou established four factories using assembly lines and machinery to produce brick tea, and became the city's richest industrialists in what would become the Russian concession.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] Japanese immigrants, mainly traders, also started arriving in 1874.

[ 46 ] Wuhan in 1864 Foreign concessions along the Hankou Bund c. 1900.

In 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang ( Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang ( Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of "Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application," known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.

Originally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891, with funds diverted from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years.

[ 48 ] On April 23, 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some 40 acres (160,000 m 2 ), could start production of small-caliber cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.

[ 49 ] In 1896, the Russian Empire also acquired a concession in Hankou.

[ 50 ] Wuchang Uprising [ edit ] Main article: Wuchang Uprising Present-day Wuhan area in 1915 By 1900, according to Collier's magazine, Hankou, the Yangtze River boom town, was "the St. Louis and Chicago of China." [ 4 ] On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen 's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising , [ 51 ] which led to the collapse of the Qing state and 2,000 years of dynastic rule, [ 52 ] as well as the establishment of the Republic of China .

[ 53 ] The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan.

[ 51 ] Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion.

[ 54 ] On September 14 the Literary Society ( 文學社 ) and the Progressive Association ( 共進會 ), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, [ 54 ] set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities.

[ 55 ] The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries' official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll.

[ 55 ] This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.

[ 51 ] On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army .

[ 51 ] They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution.

[ 56 ] Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices.

[ 54 ] Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chuyu ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of the Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared.

[ 51 ] Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong , the assistant governor of the Qing army, as the commander-in-chief.

[ 57 ] Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution.

[ 51 ] [ 54 ] As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai .

Huang Xing would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army.

[ 54 ] After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks , which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912.

[ 53 ] [ 58 ] Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar.

[ 59 ] The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.

Republic of China [ edit ] See also: Wuhan nationalist government A map of Wuhan painted by the Japanese in 1930, with Hankou being the most prosperous sector Nanyang Building Interior With the northern extension of the Northern Expedition , the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the Kuomintang Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In mid-December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou , and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called "Capital District". The new national government, later known as " Wuhan nationalist government ", was based in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang.

[ 17 ] In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan.

[ 60 ] Members of the Chinese Communist Party , who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and reelected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General.

[ 61 ] The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front , and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.

[ 62 ] In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for the mobilization of an army of workers and peasants.

[ 63 ] This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927, by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai -based rival in the Kuomintang. The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927, and ended by August 19, 1927.

[ 64 ] After the end of the Northern Expedition, Hankou was elevated to a centrally-controlled municipality.

In the 1931 China floods , one of the deadliest flood disasters in world history, Wuhan was a refuge for flood victims from outlying areas, who had been arriving since the late spring. But when the city itself was inundated in the early summer, and after a catastrophic dike failure just before 6:00 AM on July 27, [ 65 ] : 270 an estimated 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of 32 square miles and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months.

[ 65 ] : 269–270 Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases.

[ 66 ] Jin Shilong, Senior Engineer at the Hubei Flood Prevention Agency, described the flooding: There was no warning, only a sudden great wall of water. Most of Wuhan's buildings in those days were only one story high, and for many people there was no escape – they died by the tens of thousands. ... I was just coming off duty at the company's main office, a fairly new three-story building near the center of town ... When I heard the terrible noise and saw the wall of water coming, I raced to the top story of the building. ... I was in one of the tallest and strongest buildings left standing. At that time no one knew whether the water would subside or rise even higher.

[ 65 ] : 270 The high-water mark was reached on August 19 at Hankou, with the water level exceeding 16 m (53 ft) above normal.

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei , Hunan , Jiangxi , Wuhan and Chongqing caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim , as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] The gunboat Zhongshan During the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force , which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan . After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.
In early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat Zhongshan came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the Zhongshan sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the Zhongshan has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District , which opened on September 26, 2011.

[ citation needed ] As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China.

[ 73 ] On December 18, 1944, in a planned strategic move, and as revenge for the torture and execution of three captured American pilots by Japanese soldiers in the city, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers with the approval of Chiang Kai-Shek. This set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the military resources of the city.

[ 74 ] For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids also killed thousands of Chinese civilians.

[ 74 ] "According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944." [ 75 ] Wuhan returned to Chinese control in September 1945. Administratively, Wuchang and Hanyang were initially combined into a new City of Wuchang, but in October 1946 were separated into the City of Wuchang (including Wuchang only) and the County of Hanyang. Hankou became a centrally controlled municipality in August 1947. Militarily, the Wuhan Forward Headquarters was established in Wuhan, headed by Bai Chongxi .

[ 76 ] [ full citation needed ] People's Liberation Army troops at Zhongshan Avenue, Hankou on May 16, 1949 During the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Bai sought to broker peace, proposing that the Communist Party could rule northern China while the Nationalist government retained southern China. This was rejected, and on May 15, 1949, Bai and the Wuhan garrison retreated from the city. People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on the afternoon of Monday, May 16, 1949.

[ 81 ] : 48 The Changjiang Water Resources Commission was reestablished in February 1950 with its headquarters in Wuhan. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.

Before construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge , Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.

Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge during Construction The project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge , also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing–Hankou railway with the Guangdong–Hankou railway into the Beijing–Guangzhou railway , making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' ( 九省通衢 ) in name and in fact.

After Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.

The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District , [ 87 ] all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming , Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro- secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism.

[ 91 ] The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao .

[ 92 ] [ 93 ] On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing , the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as "Father of China's Great Fire Wall " [ 94 ] ) was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself "hanjunyi" ( 寒君依 , or 小湖北 ) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University .

[ 22 ] Wuhan and other Hubei cities were placed under lockdown for nearly three months to contain the disease.

[ 22 ] [ 112 ] On April 8, 2020, the Wuhan lockdown officially came to an end after no new domestic cases were reported in Hubei province.

[ 113 ] The virus is believed to have been a mutation of a virus that existed in bats, and first spread to humans at a wet market in Wuhan.

[ 114 ] Although no bats were sold at the market, some 38 other species of animals were offered, one of which could have served as an intermediary species. In December 2024, an American congressional committee, chaired by Rep.

Brad Wenstrup , completed a two-year investigation and released a final report concluding that the Covid-19 likely leaked from a virology laboratory in Wuhan.

[ 115 ] Geography [ edit ] Overview [ edit ] Map including the Wuhan area ( AMS , 1953) Wuhan is in east-central Hubei, at latitude 29° 58'–31° 22' N and longitude 113° 41'–115° 05' E. Wuhan sits at the confluence of the Han River flowing into the Yangtze River at the East of the Jianghan Plain along the Yangtze's middle reaches.

The metropolitan area comprises three parts— Wuchang , Hankou , and Hanyang —commonly called the "Three Towns of Wuhan" (hence the name "Wuhan", combining "Wu" from the first city and "Han" from the other two). The consolidation of these cities occurred in 1927 and Wuhan was thereby established. The three former cities face each other across the rivers and are linked by bridges, including one of the first modern bridges in China, known as the "First Bridge".

Wuchang lies south east of the Yangtze River that separates it from both Hankou and Hanyang.

Hankou sits north of the Yangtze River separating it from Wuchang. Hankou is north of the Han River separating it from Hanyang.

Hanyang lies west of the Yangtze separating it from Wuchang. Hanyang is south of the Han river separating it from Hankou.

East Lake It is simple in terrain—low and flat in the middle and hilly in the south, with the Yangtze and Han rivers winding through the city. The She River enters the Yangtze in Huangpi District. Wuhan occupies a land area of 8,494.41 square kilometers (3,279.71 sq mi), most of which is alluvial plain and decorated with hills and a great number of lakes and ponds. Water makes up one quarter of Wuhan's urban territory, which is the highest percentage among major cities in China.

[ 116 ] Wuhan has nearly 200 lakes, including the East Lake of 33 km2, and Tangxun Lake , which are the largest lakes entirely within a city in China.

[ 116 ] Other well-known lakes include South Lake and Sand Lake .

Liangzi Lake , the largest lake by surface area in Hubei province, is located in the southeast of Jiangxia District .The twin peaks at the junction of Huangpi District and Xiaogan City, with an altitude of 872.5 meters, are the highest points in Wuhan. There are also several mountains within the city limits of Wuhan including Mount Luojia ( 珞珈山 ) in Wuchang District as well as Mount Hong ( 洪山 ) and Mount Yujia ( 喻家山/瑜珈山 ) in Hongshan District .

In the Seventh Census of China in 2020 , Wuhan was home to 12,326,500 inhabitants, a 25.97% increase by 2.5411 million compared to the last census in 2010. 2010-2020 is the fastest growing 10 years in history since the census was established, averaging 2.34% annually, and it was the first time that Wuhan's population reached 10 million.

[ 162 ] The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010 [update] , a population of 19 million.

[ 163 ] [ 164 ] As of November 2019, urban development status considering both spatial and socioeconomic processes has been examined using Night Time Lighting data and land cover data as proxies; it showed Wuhan's high concentration
of socioeconomic activities compared to its urban spatial development.

Among other religious doctrines, 14.7% of the population adheres to Buddhism , 2.9% to Protestantism , 0.3% to Catholicism and 1.6% to Islam , and 1.6% of the population adheres to unspecified other religions.

[ 166 ] Religious sites in Wuhan Baotong Buddhist Temple Gude Buddhist Temple St. Alexander Nevsky Church Holy Family Catholic Church Transportation [ edit ] Railways [ edit ] China Railway Wuhan Group manages the Wuhan Railway Hub . Wuhan Railway Hub is considered one of the four key railway hubs of China.

[ 167 ] The city of Wuhan is served by three major railway stations: the Hankou railway station in Hankou , the Wuchang railway station in Wuchang , and the Wuhan railway station , located in a newly developed area east of the East Lake ( Hongshan District ). As the stations are many miles apart, it is important for passengers to be aware of the particular station(s) used by a particular train.

The (original) Hankou Station was the terminus for the Jinghan railway from Beijing, while the Wuchang Station was the terminus for the Yuehan railway to Guangzhou. Since the construction of the First Yangtze Bridge and the linking of the two lines into the Jingguang railway , both Hankou and Wuchang stations have been served by trains going to all directions, which contrasts with the situation in such cities as New York or Moscow, where different stations serve different directions.

With the opening of the Hefei-Wuhan high-speed railway on April 1, 2009, [ 168 ] Wuhan became served by high-speed trains with Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai; several trains a day now connect the city with Shanghai, getting there in under six hours. As of early 2010, most of these express trains leave from the Hankou railway station .

In 2006, construction began on the new Wuhan railway station with 11 platforms, located on the northeastern outskirts of the city. In December 2009, the station was opened, as China unveiled its second high-speed train with scheduled runs from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Billed as the fastest train in the world, it can reach a speed of 394 km/h (244.82 mph). The travel time between the two cities has been reduced from ten and a half hours to just three. The rail service has been extended north to Beijing.

[ 169 ] As of 2011 [update] , the new Wuhan railway station is primarily used by the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed trains, while most regular trains to other destinations continue to use the Hankou and Wuchang stations.

Construction work is carried out on several lines of the new Wuhan Metropolitan Area intercity railway , which will eventually connect Wuhan's three main rail terminals with several stations throughout the city's outer areas and farther suburbs, as well as with the nearby cities of Xianning , Huangshi , Huanggang , and Xiaogan . The first line of the system, the one to Xianning , opened for passenger operations at the end of 2013. The line to Xiaogen opened on December 1, 2016, and it was extended with the opening of the Wuhan–Shiyan high-speed railway to Shiyan on November 29, 2019.

[ 247 ] City Country From Until Arnhem Netherlands September 6, 1999 July 21, 2021 Nature and wildlife [ edit ] In Chinese mythology , the Baiji ("Yangtze River dolphin") has many origin stories. In one legend, the Baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general, and when he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame. The daughter ran after him and also fell into the river. Before they were drowned, the daughter was transformed into a dolphin, and the general a porpoise.
