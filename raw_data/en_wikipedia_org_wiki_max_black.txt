He made contributions to the philosophy of language , the philosophy of mathematics and science , and the philosophy of art , also publishing studies of the work of philosophers such as Frege . His translation (with Peter Geach ) of Frege's published philosophical writing is a classic text.

Early life and education [ edit ] Black was born, with the surname Tcherny , on February 24, 1909, in Baku , then within the Russian Empire and now the capital of Azerbaijan . As the family was Jewish and antisemitism was then prevalent in Russia, they left Baku whilst he was very young. After a short time in Paris, the family emigrated to England in 1912. The family name was changed to Black in 1911–1912.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He first attended a free school in north London , but at age nine was awarded a scholarship to Dame Alice Owen's School , where he remained until the age of eighteen.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] He studied mathematics at Queens' College at the University of Cambridge , where he developed an interest in the philosophy of mathematics .

Bertrand Russell , Ludwig Wittgenstein , G. E. Moore , and Frank P. Ramsey were all at Cambridge at that time, and their influence on Black may have been considerable. He graduated in 1930, and was awarded a fellowship to study at the University of Göttingen for a year.

[ 5 ] Career [ edit ] From 1931 to 1936, Black was mathematics master at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle .

[ 6 ] His first book was The Nature of Mathematics (1933), a critical exposition of Principia Mathematica and a critical analysis of the formalist and intuitionist schools of mathematics.

[ 7 ] Black made notable contributions to the metaphysics of identity . In a 1952 paper, [ 8 ] Black presents an objection to Leibniz' Law – the principle of the identity of indiscernibles that states that no two distinct things can exactly resemble each other. He does so, as Peter Forrest notes, by suggesting "there could be a universe containing nothing but two exactly resembling spheres" and that in "such a completely symmetrical universe the two spheres would be indiscernible".

[ 9 ] Black lectured in mathematics at the Institute of Education in London from 1936 to 1940.

[ 6 ] During this time he also undertook graduate work at the University of London , being awarded a Ph.D.

in 1939 for his dissertation on theories of logical positivism.

[ 3 ] In 1940 he moved to the United States and joined the Philosophy Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign . In 1946, he accepted a professorship in philosophy at Cornell University . In 1948, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

[ 3 ] Black advised the philosophy dissertation of American novelist William H. Gass .

[ 10 ] He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.

[ 11 ] Death and family [ edit ] Black was the elder brother of the architect Misha Black and the public relations manager Sam Black .

[ 2 ] [ 12 ] In 1933 he married Michal (or Mabel) Landesberg (1911–1985) with whom he had a daughter and a son.

[ 4 ] Black died in Ithaca, New York age 79, from a heart attack that followed surgery for cancer.
