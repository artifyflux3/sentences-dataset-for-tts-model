Unlike the standard octonions , they contain non-zero elements which are non-invertible.  Also the signatures of their quadratic forms differ: the split-octonions have a split signature (4,4) whereas the octonions have a positive-definite signature (8,0).

Up to isomorphism, the octonions and the split-octonions are the only two 8-dimensional composition algebras over the real numbers.  They are also the only two octonion algebras over the real numbers.  Split-octonion algebras analogous to the split-octonions can be defined over any field .

Definition [ edit ] Cayley–Dickson construction [ edit ] The octonions and the split-octonions can be obtained from the Cayley–Dickson construction by defining a multiplication on pairs of quaternions . We introduce a new imaginary unit ℓ and write a pair of quaternions ( a , b ) in the form a + b ℓ. The product is defined by the rule: [ 1 ] ( a + b ℓ ℓ ) ( c + d ℓ ℓ ) = ( a c + λ λ d ¯ ¯ b ) + ( d a + b c ¯ ¯ ) ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle (a+b\ell )(c+d\ell )=(ac+\lambda {\bar {d}}b)+(da+b{\bar {c}})\ell } where λ λ = ℓ ℓ 2 .

{\displaystyle \lambda =\ell ^{2}.} If λ is chosen to be −1, we get the octonions. If, instead, it is taken to be +1 we get the split-octonions. One can also obtain the split-octonions via a Cayley–Dickson doubling of the split-quaternions . Here either choice of λ (±1) gives the split-octonions.

Multiplication table [ edit ] A mnemonic for the products of the split octonions.

A basis for the split-octonions is given by the set { 1 , i , j , k , ℓ ℓ , ℓ ℓ i , ℓ ℓ j , ℓ ℓ k } {\displaystyle \{\ 1,\ i,\ j,\ k,\ \ell ,\ \ell i,\ \ell j,\ \ell k\ \}} .

Every split-octonion x {\displaystyle x} can be written as a linear combination of the basis elements, x = x 0 + x 1 i + x 2 j + x 3 k + x 4 ℓ ℓ + x 5 ℓ ℓ i + x 6 ℓ ℓ j + x 7 ℓ ℓ k , {\displaystyle x=x_{0}+x_{1}\,i+x_{2}\,j+x_{3}\,k+x_{4}\,\ell +x_{5}\,\ell i+x_{6}\,\ell j+x_{7}\,\ell k,} with real coefficients x a {\displaystyle x_{a}} .

By linearity, multiplication of split-octonions is completely determined by the following multiplication table : multiplier 1 {\displaystyle 1} i {\displaystyle i} j {\displaystyle j} k {\displaystyle k} ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } ℓ ℓ i {\displaystyle \ell i} ℓ ℓ j {\displaystyle \ell j} ℓ ℓ k {\displaystyle \ell k} multiplicand 1 {\displaystyle 1} 1 {\displaystyle 1} i {\displaystyle i} j {\displaystyle j} k {\displaystyle k} ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } ℓ ℓ i {\displaystyle \ell i} ℓ ℓ j {\displaystyle \ell j} ℓ ℓ k {\displaystyle \ell k} i {\displaystyle i} i {\displaystyle i} − − 1 {\displaystyle -1} k {\displaystyle k} − − j {\displaystyle -j} − − ℓ ℓ i {\displaystyle -\ell i} ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } − − ℓ ℓ k {\displaystyle -\ell k} ℓ ℓ j {\displaystyle \ell j} j {\displaystyle j} j {\displaystyle j} − − k {\displaystyle -k} − − 1 {\displaystyle -1} i {\displaystyle i} − − ℓ ℓ j {\displaystyle -\ell j} ℓ ℓ k {\displaystyle \ell k} ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } − − ℓ ℓ i {\displaystyle -\ell i} k {\displaystyle k} k {\displaystyle k} j {\displaystyle j} − − i {\displaystyle -i} − − 1 {\displaystyle -1} − − ℓ ℓ k {\displaystyle -\ell k} − − ℓ ℓ j {\displaystyle -\ell j} ℓ ℓ i {\displaystyle \ell i} ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } ℓ ℓ i {\displaystyle \ell i} ℓ ℓ j {\displaystyle \ell j} ℓ ℓ k {\displaystyle \ell k} 1 {\displaystyle 1} i {\displaystyle i} j {\displaystyle j} k {\displaystyle k} ℓ ℓ i {\displaystyle \ell i} ℓ ℓ i {\displaystyle \ell i} − − ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle -\ell } − − ℓ ℓ k {\displaystyle -\ell k} ℓ ℓ j {\displaystyle \ell j} − − i {\displaystyle -i} 1 {\displaystyle 1} k {\displaystyle k} − − j {\displaystyle -j} ℓ ℓ j {\displaystyle \ell j} ℓ ℓ j {\displaystyle \ell j} ℓ ℓ k {\displaystyle \ell k} − − ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle -\ell } − − ℓ ℓ i {\displaystyle -\ell i} − − j {\displaystyle -j} − − k {\displaystyle -k} 1 {\displaystyle 1} i {\displaystyle i} ℓ ℓ k {\displaystyle \ell k} ℓ ℓ k {\displaystyle \ell k} − − ℓ ℓ j {\displaystyle -\ell j} ℓ ℓ i {\displaystyle \ell i} − − ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle -\ell } − − k {\displaystyle -k} j {\displaystyle j} − − i {\displaystyle -i} 1 {\displaystyle 1} A convenient mnemonic is given by the diagram at the right, which represents the multiplication table for the split-octonions. This one is derived from its parent octonion (one of 480 possible), which is defined by: e i e j = − − δ δ i j e 0 + ε ε i j k e k , {\displaystyle e_{i}e_{j}=-\delta _{ij}e_{0}+\varepsilon _{ijk}e_{k},\,} where δ δ i j {\displaystyle \delta _{ij}} is the Kronecker delta and ε ε i j k {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{ijk}} is the Levi-Civita symbol with value + 1 {\displaystyle +1} when i j k = 123 , 154 , 176 , 264 , 257 , 374 , 365 , {\displaystyle ijk=123,154,176,264,257,374,365,} and: e i e 0 = e 0 e i = e i ; e 0 e 0 = e 0 , {\displaystyle e_{i}e_{0}=e_{0}e_{i}=e_{i};\,\,\,\,e_{0}e_{0}=e_{0},} with e 0 {\displaystyle e_{0}} the scalar element, and i , j , k = 1...7.

{\displaystyle i,j,k=1...7.} The red arrows indicate possible direction reversals imposed by negating the lower right quadrant of the parent creating a split octonion with this multiplication table.

Conjugate, norm and inverse [ edit ] The conjugate of a split-octonion x is given by x ¯ ¯ = x 0 − − x 1 i − − x 2 j − − x 3 k − − x 4 ℓ ℓ − − x 5 ℓ ℓ i − − x 6 ℓ ℓ j − − x 7 ℓ ℓ k , {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}=x_{0}-x_{1}\,i-x_{2}\,j-x_{3}\,k-x_{4}\,\ell -x_{5}\,\ell i-x_{6}\,\ell j-x_{7}\,\ell k,} just as for the octonions.

The quadratic form on x is given by N ( x ) = x ¯ ¯ x = ( x 0 2 + x 1 2 + x 2 2 + x 3 2 ) − − ( x 4 2 + x 5 2 + x 6 2 + x 7 2 ) .

{\displaystyle N(x)={\bar {x}}x=(x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2})-(x_{4}^{2}+x_{5}^{2}+x_{6}^{2}+x_{7}^{2}).} This quadratic form N ( x ) is an isotropic quadratic form since there are non-zero split-octonions x with N ( x ) = 0. With N , the split-octonions form a pseudo-Euclidean space of eight dimensions over R , sometimes written R 4,4 to denote the signature of the quadratic form.

If N ( x ) ≠ 0, then x has a (two-sided) multiplicative inverse x −1 given by x − − 1 = N ( x ) − − 1 x ¯ ¯ .

{\displaystyle x^{-1}=N(x)^{-1}{\bar {x}}.} Properties [ edit ] The split-octonions, like the octonions, are noncommutative and nonassociative. Also like the octonions, they form a composition algebra since the quadratic form N is multiplicative. That is, N ( x y ) = N ( x ) N ( y ) .

{\displaystyle N(xy)=N(x)N(y).} The split-octonions satisfy the Moufang identities and so form an alternative algebra . Therefore, by Artin's theorem , the subalgebra generated by any two elements is associative. The set of all invertible elements (i.e. those elements for which N ( x ) ≠ 0) form a Moufang loop .

The automorphism group of the split-octonions is a 14-dimensional Lie group , the split real form of the exceptional simple Lie group G 2 .

Zorn's vector-matrix algebra [ edit ] Since the split-octonions are nonassociative they cannot be represented by ordinary matrices (matrix multiplication is always associative).

Zorn found a way to represent them as "matrices" containing both scalars and vectors using a modified version of matrix multiplication.

[ 2 ] Specifically, define a vector-matrix to be a 2×2 matrix of the form [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ a v w b ] , {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}a&\mathbf {v} \\\mathbf {w} &b\end{bmatrix}},} where a and b are real numbers and v and w are vectors in R 3 . Define multiplication of these matrices by the rule [ a v w b ] [ a ′ v ′ w ′ b ′ ] = [ a a ′ + v ⋅ ⋅ w ′ a v ′ + b ′ v + w × × w ′ a ′ w + b w ′ − − v × × v ′ b b ′ + v ′ ⋅ ⋅ w ] {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}a&\mathbf {v} \\\mathbf {w} &b\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}a'&\mathbf {v} '\\\mathbf {w} '&b'\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}aa'+\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {w} '&a\mathbf {v} '+b'\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {w} \times \mathbf {w} '\\a'\mathbf {w} +b\mathbf {w} '-\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {v} '&bb'+\mathbf {v} '\cdot \mathbf {w} \end{bmatrix}}} where · and × are the ordinary dot product and cross product of 3-vectors. With addition and scalar multiplication defined as usual the set of all such matrices forms a nonassociative unital 8-dimensional algebra over the reals, called Zorn's vector-matrix algebra .

Define the " determinant " of a vector-matrix by the rule det [ a v w b ] = a b − − v ⋅ ⋅ w {\displaystyle \det {\begin{bmatrix}a&\mathbf {v} \\\mathbf {w} &b\end{bmatrix}}=ab-\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {w} } .

This determinant is a quadratic form on Zorn's algebra which satisfies the composition rule: det ( A B ) = det ( A ) det ( B ) .

{\displaystyle \det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B).\,} Zorn's vector-matrix algebra is, in fact, isomorphic to the algebra of split-octonions. Write an octonion x {\displaystyle x} in the form x = ( a + v ) + ℓ ℓ ( b + w ) {\displaystyle x=(a+\mathbf {v} )+\ell (b+\mathbf {w} )} where a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are real numbers and v and w are pure imaginary quaternions regarded as vectors in R 3 . The isomorphism from the split-octonions to Zorn's algebra is given by x ↦ ↦ ϕ ϕ ( x ) = [ a + b v + w − − v + w a − − b ] .

{\displaystyle x\mapsto \phi (x)={\begin{bmatrix}a+b&\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {w} \\-\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {w} &a-b\end{bmatrix}}.} This isomorphism preserves the norm since N ( x ) = det ( ϕ ϕ ( x ) ) {\displaystyle N(x)=\det(\phi (x))} .

Applications [ edit ] Split-octonions are used in the description of physical law. For example: The Dirac equation in physics (the equation of motion of a free spin 1/2 particle, like e.g. an electron or a proton) can be expressed on native split-octonion arithmetic.

[ 7 ] Supersymmetric quantum mechanics has an octonionic extension.

[ 8 ] The Zorn-based split-octonion algebra can be used in modeling local gauge symmetric SU(3) quantum chromodynamics.

[ 9 ] The problem of a ball rolling without slipping on a ball of radius 3 times as large has the split real form of the exceptional group G 2 as its symmetry group, because this problem can be described using split-octonions.
