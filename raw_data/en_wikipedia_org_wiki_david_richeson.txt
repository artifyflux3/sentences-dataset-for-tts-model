Richeson is an American mathematician whose interests include the topology of dynamical systems , recreational mathematics , and the history of mathematics . He is a professor of mathematics at Dickinson College , where he holds the John J. & Ann Curley Faculty Chair in the Liberal Arts.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Education and career [ edit ] Richeson was interested in mathematics from an early age, in part through Martin Gardner 's Mathematical Games columns .

[ 2 ] He graduated from Hamilton College in 1993, and completed his Ph.D. at Northwestern University in 1998; [ 1 ] his dissertation, Connection Matrix Pairs for the Discrete Conley Index , was supervised by John Franks.

[ 3 ] Richeson joined the Dickinson College faculty after postdoctoral research at Michigan State University . He was the editor of Math Horizons from 2014 to 2019.

[ 4 ] [ 2 ] Books [ edit ] Richeson is the author of the book Euler's Gem: The Polyhedron Formula and the Birth of Topology (Princeton University Press, 2008; paperback, 2012), on the Euler characteristic of polyhedra .

[ 5 ] The book won the 2010 Euler Book Prize of the Mathematical Association of America .

[ 6 ] His second book, Tales of Impossibility: The 2000-Year Quest to Solve the Mathematical Problems of Antiquity (Princeton University Press, 2019), concerns four famous problems of straightedge and compass construction , unsolved by the ancient Greek mathematicians and now known to be impossible: doubling the cube , squaring the circle , constructing regular polygons of any order , and trisecting the angle .
