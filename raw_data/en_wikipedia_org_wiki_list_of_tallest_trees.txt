Although giant trees grow in both tropical and temperate regions, they are very restricted geographically and phylogenetically. All the known giant trees occur in mesic climates, and nearly all of them are found in three regions: western North America (from California to British Columbia ), Southeast Asia (especially Borneo ) and southeastern Australia (especially Tasmania ).

Tallest living individuals by species [ edit ] The following are the tallest reliably-measured specimens from the top species. This table contains information on all species for which at least one specimen has been reliably measured at 80 meters (260 feet) or taller.

List of tallest trees by species Species Height Tree name Class Location Continent References Meters Feet Coast redwood ( Sequoia sempervirens ) 116.07 380.8 Hyperion Conifer Redwood National Park , California , United States Western North America [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It reached 116.07 metres (380.8 ft) in 2019.

[ 3 ] The second and sixth tallest trees, both redwoods, were also found at Redwood National Park in 2006 when Hyperion was found, and were named Helios 114.8 metres (377 ft), and Icarus 113.1 metres (371 ft) tall.

[ 3 ] The coast redwoods Nugget at 113.8 metres (373 ft), Stratosphere Giant at 113.5 metres (372 ft), and Paradox at 113.3 metres (372 ft) are the third, fourth, and fifth tallest trees.

By analyzing the interplay between these forces in coast redwoods ( Sequoia sempervirens ), a team of biologists led by George Koch of Northern Arizona University calculated the theoretical maximum tree height or the point at which opposing forces balance out and a tree stops growing. This point lies somewhere between 122 and 130 m (400 and 427 ft).

[ 51 ] On the one hand, the researchers found, trees in forests "desire" to grow as tall as possible to overtake neighboring trees and reach stronger sunlight. On the other hand, gravity makes it more and more difficult to haul water upwards from the roots to the canopy as the tree grows, and leaves thus become smaller near the top. They discovered that despite the moistness of the ground far below, the leaves at the treetops struggle to get enough water, so they are effectively living in a constant drought. The difficulty of getting water so far up into the sky is what ultimately constrains growth.

[ 52 ] Other researchers have developed models of maximum height for Coast Douglas-fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii ) trees that yield similar estimates of 109 to 138 meters (358 to 453 ft), [ 53 ] a range that includes the height of the tallest reliably-measured historical (dead) specimen, a 126-meter tree.

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Other claims of superlative height [ edit ] There are many historical and contemporary claims of superlative height for species beyond those listed in the table above. For example, several articles published in 1878 describe an Eucalyptus amygdalina exceeding 380 feet (120 m) and others nearing 420 feet (130 m) up to 500 feet (150 m), including the Nooksack Giant which was measured using a tape at 465 feet (142 m) after being cut down.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] The heights of the tallest trees in the world have been the subject of considerable dispute and much exaggeration. Modern verified measurements with laser rangefinders or with tape drop measurements made by tree climbers (such as those carried out by canopy researchers), have shown that some older tree height measurement methods are often unreliable, sometimes producing exaggerations of 5% to 15%  or more above the real height.

Claim in article that it is second tallest tree in the world is consistent with sloppy reading of Wikipedia's List of tallest trees as of June 21, 2023, but is apparently false: an earlier LiveScience article in 2022 reports on heights of three taller coastal redwood trees in the United States: Hyperion, Helios, and Icarus (third tallest, at 113.1 metres (371 ft) measured in 2006).
