A [Seifert surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert_surface "Seifert surface") bounded by a set of [Borromean rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings "Borromean rings"); these surfaces can be used as tools in geometric topology

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **geometric topology** is the study of [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") and [maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics)#Maps_as_functions "Map (mathematics)") between them, particularly [embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") of one manifold into another.

Geometric topology as an area distinct from [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology") may be said to have originated in the 1935 classification of [lens spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_space "Lens space") by [Reidemeister torsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reidemeister_torsion "Reidemeister torsion"), which required distinguishing spaces that are [homotopy equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_equivalent "Homotopy equivalent") but not [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic"). This was the origin of [_simple_ homotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_homotopy "Simple homotopy") theory. The use of the term geometric topology to describe these seems to have originated rather recently.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology#cite_note-1)

Differences between low-dimensional and high-dimensional topology
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geometric_topology&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Differences between low-dimensional and high-dimensional topology")]

Manifolds differ radically in behavior in high and low dimension.

High-dimensional topology refers to manifolds of dimension 5 and above, or in relative terms, embeddings in [codimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codimension "Codimension") 3 and above. [Low-dimensional topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-dimensional_topology "Low-dimensional topology") is concerned with questions in dimensions up to 4, or embeddings in codimension up to 2.

Dimension 4 is special, in that in some respects (topologically), dimension 4 is high-dimensional, while in other respects (differentiably), dimension 4 is low-dimensional; this overlap yields phenomena exceptional to dimension 4, such as [exotic differentiable structures on **R**4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_R4 "Exotic R4"). Thus the topological classification of 4-manifolds is in principle tractable, and the key questions are: does a topological manifold admit a differentiable structure, and if so, how many? Notably, the smooth case of dimension 4 is the last open case of the [generalized Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Generalized Poincaré conjecture"); see [Gluck twists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluck_twist "Gluck twist").

The distinction is because [surgery theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery_theory "Surgery theory") works in dimension 5 and above (in fact, in many cases, it works topologically in dimension 4, though this is very involved to prove), and thus the behavior of manifolds in dimension 5 and above may be studied using the surgery theory program. In dimension 4 and below (topologically, in dimension 3 and below), surgery theory does not work. Indeed, one approach to discussing low-dimensional manifolds is to ask "what would surgery theory predict to be true, were it to work?" – and then understand low-dimensional phenomena as deviations from this.

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Whitneytrickstep2.svg/250px-Whitneytrickstep2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Whitneytrickstep2.svg)

The [Whitney trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_trick "Whitney trick") requires 2+1 dimensions, hence surgery theory requires 5 dimensions.

The precise reason for the difference at dimension 5 is because the [Whitney embedding theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_embedding_theorem "Whitney embedding theorem"), the key technical trick which underlies surgery theory, requires 2+1 dimensions. Roughly, the Whitney trick allows one to "unknot" knotted spheres – more precisely, remove self-intersections of immersions; it does this via a [homotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy "Homotopy") of a disk – the disk has 2 dimensions, and the homotopy adds 1 more – and thus in codimension greater than 2, this can be done without intersecting itself; hence embeddings in codimension greater than 2 can be understood by surgery. In surgery theory, the key step is in the middle dimension, and thus when the middle dimension has codimension more than 2 (loosely, 2½ is enough, hence total dimension 5 is enough), the Whitney trick works. The key consequence of this is Smale's [_h_-cobordism theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-cobordism_theorem "H-cobordism theorem"), which works in dimension 5 and above, and forms the basis for surgery theory.

A modification of the Whitney trick can work in 4 dimensions, and is called [Casson handles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casson_handle "Casson handle") – because there are not enough dimensions, a Whitney disk introduces new kinks, which can be resolved by another Whitney disk, leading to a sequence ("tower") of disks. The limit of this tower yields a topological but not differentiable map, hence surgery works topologically but not differentiably in dimension 4.

Important tools in geometric topology
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geometric_topology&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Important tools in geometric topology")]

In all dimensions, the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") of a manifold is a very important invariant, and determines much of the structure; in dimensions 1, 2 and 3, the possible fundamental groups are restricted, while in dimension 4 and above every [finitely presented group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitely_presented_group "Finitely presented group") is the fundamental group of a manifold (note that it is sufficient to show this for 4- and 5-dimensional manifolds, and then to take products with spheres to get higher ones).

A manifold is orientable if it has a consistent choice of [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(mathematics) "Orientation (mathematics)"), and a [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") orientable manifold has exactly two different possible orientations. In this setting, various equivalent formulations of orientability can be given, depending on the desired application and level of generality. Formulations applicable to general topological manifolds often employ methods of [homology theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_theory "Homology theory"), whereas for [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifolds "Differentiable manifolds") more structure is present, allowing a formulation in terms of [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form"). An important generalization of the notion of orientability of a space is that of orientability of a family of spaces parameterized by some other space (a [fiber bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle "Fiber bundle")) for which an orientation must be selected in each of the spaces which varies continuously with respect to changes in the parameter values.

### Handle decompositions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geometric_topology&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Handle decompositions")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Sphere_with_three_handles.png/250px-Sphere_with_three_handles.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sphere_with_three_handles.png)

A 3-ball with three 1-handles attached.

A [handle decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_decomposition "Handle decomposition") of an _m_-[manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold")_M_ is a union

![Image 4: {\displaystyle \emptyset =M_{-1}\subset M_{0}\subset M_{1}\subset M_{2}\subset \dots \subset M_{m-1}\subset M_{m}=M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7b9d1239661d5e74e7969b3ed80484c452d8b69)
where each ![Image 5: {\displaystyle M_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eda8fd06f1cd5de22ed07385a0f8aa19773b2de9) is obtained from ![Image 6: {\displaystyle M_{i-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a7f34b876026cca5f06e9a487af7cd3620d63328) by the attaching of ![Image 7: {\displaystyle i}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/add78d8608ad86e54951b8c8bd6c8d8416533d20)-**handles**. A handle decomposition is to a manifold what a [CW-decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex "CW complex") is to a topological space—in many regards the purpose of a handle decomposition is to have a language analogous to CW-complexes, but adapted to the world of [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold"). Thus an _i_-handle is the smooth analogue of an _i_-cell. Handle decompositions of manifolds arise naturally via [Morse theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_theory "Morse theory"). The modification of handle structures is closely linked to [Cerf theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerf_theory "Cerf theory").

[Local flatness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_flatness "Local flatness") is a property of a [submanifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submanifold "Submanifold") in a [topological manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_manifold "Topological manifold") of larger [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension"). In the [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(mathematics) "Category (mathematics)") of topological manifolds, locally flat submanifolds play a role similar to that of [embedded submanifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submanifold#Embedded_submanifolds "Submanifold") in the category of [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifolds "Smooth manifolds").

Suppose a _d_ dimensional manifold _N_ is embedded into an _n_ dimensional manifold _M_ (where _d_<_n_). If ![Image 8: {\displaystyle x\in N,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e3c8d7fd864ef9386a936b3bf5ea31b82c595bb0) we say _N_ is **locally flat** at _x_ if there is a neighborhood ![Image 9: {\displaystyle U\subset M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/edd7b08ced14b1958599bba595488f7c314e59da) of _x_ such that the [topological pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_pair "Topological pair")![Image 10: {\displaystyle (U,U\cap N)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c56023f77636e15055a1b66540d0b3d8a3fc0552) is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to the pair ![Image 11: {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ^{n},\mathbb {R} ^{d})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3e63ccf95fb4bae4e27d90ec31535fa6cc479c1), with a standard inclusion of ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a713426956296f1668fce772df3c60b9dde8a685) as a subspace of ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d). That is, there exists a homeomorphism ![Image 14: {\displaystyle U\to R^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/623ffcffad0076760568fa2a9b7313415e37176e) such that the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)") of ![Image 15: {\displaystyle U\cap N}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/56643414a96610663ee313767b4408826852931a) coincides with ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a713426956296f1668fce772df3c60b9dde8a685).

### Schönflies theorems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geometric_topology&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Schönflies theorems")]

The generalized [Schoenflies theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoenflies_theorem "Schoenflies theorem") states that, if an (_n_−1)-dimensional [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere")_S_ is embedded into the _n_-dimensional sphere _S n_ in a [locally flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_flat "Locally flat") way (that is, the embedding extends to that of a thickened sphere), then the pair (_S n_,_S_) is homeomorphic to the pair (_S n_, _S_ _n_−1), where _S_ _n_−1 is the equator of the _n_-sphere. Brown and Mazur received the [Veblen Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_Prize "Veblen Prize") for their independent proofs[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology#cite_note-3) of this theorem.

Branches of geometric topology
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geometric_topology&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Branches of geometric topology")]

### Low-dimensional topology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geometric_topology&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Low-dimensional topology")]

[Low-dimensional topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-dimensional_topology "Low-dimensional topology") includes:

*   [Surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)") (2-manifolds)
*   [3-manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold "3-manifold")
*   [4-manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-manifold "4-manifold")

each have their own theory, where there are some connections.

Low-dimensional topology is strongly geometric, as reflected in the [uniformization theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem "Uniformization theorem") in 2 dimensions – every surface admits a constant curvature metric; geometrically, it has one of 3 possible geometries: positive curvature/spherical, zero curvature/flat, negative curvature/hyperbolic – and the [geometrization conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture "Geometrization conjecture") (now theorem) in 3 dimensions – every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of 8 possible geometries.

2-dimensional topology can be studied as [complex geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_geometry "Complex geometry") in one variable ([Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface") are complex curves) – by the uniformization theorem every conformal class of metrics is equivalent to a unique complex one, and 4-dimensional topology can be studied from the point of view of complex geometry in two variables (complex surfaces), though not every 4-manifold admits a complex structure.

[Knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory "Knot theory") is the study of [mathematical knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics) "Knot (mathematics)"). While inspired by knots which appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician's knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone. In mathematical language, a knot is an [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") of a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") in 3-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), **R**3 (since we're using topology, a circle isn't bound to the classical geometric concept, but to all of its [homeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism")). Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of **R**3 upon itself (known as an [ambient isotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_isotopy "Ambient isotopy")); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.

To gain further insight, mathematicians have generalized the knot concept in several ways. Knots can be considered in other [three-dimensional spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold "3-manifold") and objects other than circles can be used; see _[knot (mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot\_(mathematics) "Knot (mathematics)")_. Higher-dimensional knots are [_n_-dimensional spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere") in _m_-dimensional Euclidean space.

### High-dimensional geometric topology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geometric_topology&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: High-dimensional geometric topology")]

In high-dimensional topology, [characteristic classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_classes "Characteristic classes") are a basic invariant, and [surgery theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery_theory "Surgery theory") is a key theory.

A **[characteristic class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_class "Characteristic class")** is a way of associating to each [principal bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_bundle "Principal bundle") on a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space")_X_ a [cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology "Cohomology") class of _X_. The cohomology class measures the extent to which the bundle is "twisted" — particularly, whether it possesses [sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(fiber_bundle) "Section (fiber bundle)") or not. In other words, characteristic classes are global [invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_invariant "Topological invariant") which measure the deviation of a local product structure from a global product structure. They are one of the unifying geometric concepts in [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology"), [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry").

**[Surgery theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery_theory "Surgery theory")** is a collection of techniques used to produce one [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") from another in a 'controlled' way, introduced by [Milnor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milnor "John Milnor")([1961](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology#CITEREFMilnor1961)). Surgery refers to cutting out parts of the manifold and replacing it with a part of another manifold, matching up along the cut or boundary. This is closely related to, but not identical with, [handlebody decompositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_decomposition "Handle decomposition"). It is a major tool in the study and classification of manifolds of dimension greater than 3.

More technically, the idea is to start with a well-understood manifold _M_ and perform surgery on it to produce a manifold _M_′ having some desired property, in such a way that the effects on the [homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(mathematics) "Homology (mathematics)"), [homotopy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_group "Homotopy group"), or other interesting invariants of the manifold are known.

The classification of [exotic spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_sphere "Exotic sphere") by [Kervaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Kervaire "Michel Kervaire") and [Milnor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milnor "John Milnor")([1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology#CITEREFKervaireMilnor1963)) led to the emergence of surgery theory as a major tool in high-dimensional topology.
