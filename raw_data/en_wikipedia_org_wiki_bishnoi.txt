Bishnoi community is turned into a Hindu caste with time.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It has a set of 29 Niyamas (principles/commandments) given by Guru Jambheshwar (also known as Guru Jambhoji, Guru Jambha) (1451–1536).

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] As of 2010, there are an estimated 600,000 followers of Bishnoi Panth residing in northern and central India .

[ 7 ] Shree Guru Jambheshwar founded the sect at Samrathal Dhora in 1485 and his teachings, comprising 120 shabads , are known as Shabadwani . He preached for the next 51 years, travelling across India. The preaching of Guru Jambhoji inspires his followers as well as environmental protectors.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Etymology The term bishnoi is believed to be derived from bis (twenty) and nau (nine) and hence, it denotes the twenty nine principles of their sect.

[ 10 ] Origin Bishnoi is a panth who adopted the 29 principles which emphasised social ethics, environmental conservation and personal hygiene. These people’s are mostly from the Jat community.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] However they also includes some members from Bania , Rajput , Khati and Gaena.

[ 13 ] Clan structure There are 360 gotras of Bishnois which are considered to be of equal social status and they regulate marriage alliances. These gotras include Pawar, Godara, Khichore, Dhaka, Biria etc.

[ 14 ] History Bishnoi Panth was founded by Shree Guru Jambheshwar (1451–1536), also known as Jambhoji. Some people have used the term Vishnoi , meaning followers of Vishan ( Vishnu 's name in local dialect), while most refer to themselves as Bishnoi . Adherents are also known as Jambeshwarpanthi because of their devotion to their Guru, Jambeshwar.

[ 15 ] Shree Guru Jambeshwar announced a set of 29 Niyamas (Tenets).

[ 15 ] These were contained in a document called Shabadwani , written in the Nagri script , which consists of 120 shabads . Of his 29 Niyamas , ten are directed towards personal hygiene and maintaining good basic health , seven for healthy social behaviour , and four tenets to the worship of God. Eight Niyamas have been prescribed to preserve bio-diversity and encourage good animal husbandry . These include a ban on killing animals and cutting green trees, and providing protection to all life forms . The community is also directed to see that the firewood they use is devoid of small insects . Wearing blue clothes is prohibited because the dye for colouring them is obtained by cutting a large quantity of shrubs.

[ 16 ] They are called the first eco-warriors due to their pro-active approach in conserving ecological balance and protecting the environment.

[ 17 ] The word Bishnoi is derived from 'bis' and 'noi'. In the local language, 'Bis' means '20’ and 'Noi' means '9’. When both are added, the sum is 29.

[ 21 ] The sacred sites of the Bishnois are locally known as Sathri or Dhām, located in places that have some connection with Guru Jambheshwar. The Bishnoi poet Govind Ram has said that Sathri means a place that has been 'purified by the feet of Jambhoji'. Later on, some significant places came to be called Dhām.

"Open-air shrines located in fields or under trees are called Thān.

During those periods of time when the Than is associated with some kind of miracle or super-natural event, the shrine is called Dhām.

" [ 22 ] Main eight shrines of the Bishnois  are collectively called Ashtadhām.

[ 23 ] Peepasar , in Nagaur, is the birth place of Shri Guru Jambheshwar Bhagwan,  Ials called sthal - the site of reincarnation. The place has a residence of Thakur Lohatji, childhood home of Jambhoji and an old Khejri tree. On Janmashtami, also the birthdate of Hindu deity Krishna, is celebrated at Peepasar.

Muktidham Mukam, in Nokha in Bikaner district , is the most important religious place of the Bishnoi community. Jambhoji's last rites were performed here. Bishnois believe that Guruji is still resting here. A beautiful marbled temple is built here which is also called "Taj Mahal of Rajasthan'. An old Khejri tree under which Jambhoji's body was buried is considered sacred and devotees circumambulate around it. To enter the temple one has to cover the head as a mark of respect.

Samrathal Dhora is situated less than three kilometres south of Muktidham Mukam. This is a site where maximum sermons of Shri Guru Jambheshwar Bhagwan were delivered. It os ais  the site of the origin of the Bishnoi sect. There is a temple at the Samrathal Dhora and one sacred pond.

[ 25 ] Khejarli massacre Main article: Khejarli massacre The Bishnoi narrate the story of Amrita Devi , a member of the sect who inspired as many as 363 other Bishnois to go to their deaths in protest of the cutting down of Khejri trees on 12 September 1730. The Maharaja of Jodhpur , Abhay Singh , requiring wood for the construction of a new palace, sent soldiers to cut trees in the village of Khejarli , which was called Jehnad at that time. Noticing their actions, Amrita Devi hugged a tree in an attempt to stop them. Her family then adopted the same strategy, as did other local people when the news spread. She told the soldiers that she considered their actions to be an insult to her faith and that she was prepared to die to save the trees. The soldiers did indeed kill her and others until Abhay Singh was informed of what was going on and intervened to stop the massacre.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] A memorial Commemorating 363 Bishnois died for saving Green Trees Near Khejarli Village, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India Some of the 363 Bishnois who were killed protecting the trees were buried in Khejarli, where a simple grave with four pillars was erected. Every year, in September, i.e., Shukla Dashmi of Bhadrapad (Hindi month) the Bishnois assemble there to commemorate the sacrifice made by their people to preserve the trees.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] Salman Khan's poaching case Bishnois revere and care for most animals including the blackbuck. Bollywood actor Salman Khan allegedly hunted blackbucks in 1998 . The members of Bishnoi community are said to have caught him red-handed; protests from the community forced the authorities to arrest and try him.
