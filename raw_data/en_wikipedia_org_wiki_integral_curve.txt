In mathematics , an integral curve is a parametric curve that represents a specific solution to an ordinary differential equation or system of equations.

Name [ edit ] Integral curves are known by various other names, depending on the nature and interpretation of the differential equation or vector field. In physics , integral curves for an electric field or magnetic field are known as field lines , and integral curves for the velocity field of a fluid are known as streamlines . In dynamical systems , the integral curves for a differential equation that governs a system are referred to as trajectories or orbits .

Definition [ edit ] Suppose that F is a static vector field , that is, a vector-valued function with components ( F 1 , F 2 ,..., F n ) in a Cartesian coordinate system , and that x ( t ) is a parametric curve with Cartesian coordinates ( x 1 ( t ), x 2 ( t ),..., x n ( t )) . Then x ( t ) is an integral curve of F if it is a solution of the autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, d x 1 d t = F 1 ( x 1 , … … , x n ) ⋮ ⋮ d x n d t = F n ( x 1 , … … , x n ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {dx_{1}}{dt}}&=F_{1}(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\\&\;\,\vdots \\{\frac {dx_{n}}{dt}}&=F_{n}(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}).\end{aligned}}} Such a system may be written as a single vector equation, x ′ ( t ) = F ( x ( t ) ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} '(t)=\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {x} (t)).} This equation says that the vector tangent to the curve at any point x ( t ) along the curve is precisely the vector F ( x ( t )) , and so the curve x ( t ) is tangent at each point to the vector field F .

If a given vector field is Lipschitz continuous , then the Picard–Lindelöf theorem implies that there exists a unique flow for small time.

Examples [ edit ] Three integral curves for the slope field corresponding to the differential equation dy / dx = x 2 − x − 2 .

If the differential equation is represented as a vector field or slope field , then the corresponding integral curves are tangent to the field at each point.

Generalization to differentiable manifolds [ edit ] Definition [ edit ] Let M be a Banach manifold of class C r with r ≥ 2 . As usual, T M denotes the tangent bundle of M with its natural projection π M : T M → M given by π π M : ( x , v ) ↦ ↦ x .

{\displaystyle \pi _{M}:(x,v)\mapsto x.} A vector field on M is a cross-section of the tangent bundle T M , i.e. an assignment to every point of the manifold M of a tangent vector to M at that point. Let X be a vector field on M of class C r −1 and let p ∈ M . An integral curve for X passing through p at time t 0 is a curve α : J → M of class C r −1 , defined on an open interval J of the real line R containing t 0 , such that α α ( t 0 ) = p ; α α ′ ( t ) = X ( α α ( t ) ) for all t ∈ ∈ J .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\alpha (t_{0})&=p;\\\alpha '(t)&=X(\alpha (t)){\text{ for all }}t\in J.\end{aligned}}} Relationship to ordinary differential equations [ edit ] The above definition of an integral curve α for a vector field X , passing through p at time t 0 , is the same as saying that α is a local solution to the ordinary differential equation/initial value problem α α ( t 0 ) = p ; α α ′ ( t ) = X ( α α ( t ) ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\alpha (t_{0})&=p;\\\alpha '(t)&=X(\alpha (t)).\end{aligned}}} It is local in the sense that it is defined only for times in J , and not necessarily for all t ≥ t 0 (let alone t ≤ t 0 ). Thus, the problem of proving the existence and uniqueness of integral curves is the same as that of finding solutions to ordinary differential equations/initial value problems and showing that they are unique.

Remarks on the time derivative [ edit ] In the above, α ′( t ) denotes the derivative of α at time t , the "direction α is pointing" at time t . From a more abstract viewpoint, this is the Fréchet derivative : ( d t α α ) ( + 1 ) ∈ ∈ T α α ( t ) M .

{\displaystyle (\mathrm {d} _{t}\alpha )(+1)\in \mathrm {T} _{\alpha (t)}M.} In the special case that M is some open subset of R n , this is the familiar derivative ( d α α 1 d t , … … , d α α n d t ) , {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\mathrm {d} \alpha _{1}}{\mathrm {d} t}},\dots ,{\frac {\mathrm {d} \alpha _{n}}{\mathrm {d} t}}\right),} where α 1 , ..., α n are the coordinates for α with respect to the usual coordinate directions.

The same thing may be phrased even more abstractly in terms of induced maps . Note that the tangent bundle T J of J is the trivial bundle J × R and there is a canonical cross-section ι of this bundle such that ι ( t ) = 1 (or, more precisely, ( t , 1) ∈ ι ) for all t ∈ J . The curve α induces a bundle map α ∗ : T J → T M so that the following diagram commutes: Then the time derivative α ′ is the composition α ′ = α ∗ o ι , and α ′( t ) is its value at some point t ∈ J .
