From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **differential equation** is an [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_equation "Functional equation") that relates one or more unknown [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") and their [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-Zill2012-1) In applications, the functions generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two. Such relations are common in [mathematical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") and [scientific laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law "Scientific law"); therefore, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), and [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology").

The study of differential equations consists mainly of the study of their solutions (the set of functions that satisfy each equation), and of the properties of their solutions. Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas; however, many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without computing them exactly.

Often when a [closed-form expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression "Closed-form expression") for the solutions is not available, solutions may be approximated numerically using computers, and many [numerical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_methods "Numerical methods") have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy. The [theory of dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems_theory "Dynamical systems theory") analyzes the [qualitative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/qualitative "wikt:qualitative") aspects of solutions, such as their [average behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory "Ergodic theory") over a long time interval.

Differential equations came into existence with the [invention of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_calculus "History of calculus") by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz"). In Chapter 2 of his 1671 work [_Methodus fluxionum et Serierum Infinitarum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_Fluxions "Method of Fluxions"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-2) Newton listed three kinds of differential equations:

![Image 1: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {dy}{dx}}&=f(x)\\[4pt]{\frac {dy}{dx}}&=f(x,y)\\[4pt]x_{1}{\frac {\partial y}{\partial x_{1}}}&+x_{2}{\frac {\partial y}{\partial x_{2}}}=y\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d17bdcadcae4f4602463dba2e7ad439b31c3fa5b)
In all these cases, y is an unknown function of x (or of _x_ 1 and _x_ 2), and f is a given function.

He solves these examples and others using infinite series and discusses the non-uniqueness of solutions.

[Jacob Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli "Jacob Bernoulli") proposed the [Bernoulli differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_differential_equation "Bernoulli differential equation") in 1695.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-3) This is an [ordinary differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation") of the form

![Image 2: {\displaystyle y'+P(x)y=Q(x)y^{n}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0df4fcdfdb40fe6b609da7321a8c1d1a63c90eb2)
for which the following year Leibniz obtained solutions by simplifying it.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-4)

Historically, the problem of a vibrating string such as that of a [musical instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument "Musical instrument") was studied by [Jean le Rond d'Alembert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_le_Rond_d%27Alembert "Jean le Rond d'Alembert"), [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler"), [Daniel Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli "Daniel Bernoulli"), and [Joseph-Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange "Joseph-Louis Lagrange").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-8) In 1746, d’Alembert discovered the one-dimensional [wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation "Wave equation"), and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-Speiser-9)

The [Euler–Lagrange equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation "Euler–Lagrange equation") was developed in the 1750s by Euler and Lagrange in connection with their studies of the [tautochrone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautochrone "Tautochrone") problem. This is the problem of determining a curve on which a weighted particle will fall to a fixed point in a fixed amount of time, independent of the starting point. Lagrange solved this problem in 1755 and sent the solution to Euler. Both further developed Lagrange's method and applied it to [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), which led to the formulation of [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics").

In 1822, [Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier "Joseph Fourier") published his work on [heat flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_flow "Heat flow") in _Théorie analytique de la chaleur_ (The Analytic Theory of Heat),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-10) in which he based his reasoning on [Newton's law of cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling "Newton's law of cooling"), namely, that the flow of heat between two adjacent molecules is proportional to the extremely small difference of their temperatures. Contained in this book was Fourier's proposal of his [heat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation "Heat equation") for conductive diffusion of heat. This partial differential equation is now a common part of mathematical physics curriculum.

In [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time value varies. [Newton's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") allow these variables to be expressed dynamically (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time.

In some cases, this differential equation (called an [equation of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion "Equations of motion")) may be solved explicitly.

An example of modeling a real-world problem using differential equations is the determination of the velocity of a ball falling through the air, considering only gravity and air resistance. The ball's acceleration towards the ground is the acceleration due to gravity minus the deceleration due to air resistance. Gravity is considered constant, and air resistance may be modeled as proportional to the ball's velocity. This means that the ball's acceleration, which is a derivative of its velocity, depends on the velocity (and the velocity depends on time). Finding the velocity as a function of time involves solving a differential equation and verifying its validity.

Differential equations can be classified several different ways. Besides describing the properties of the equation itself, these classes of differential equations can help inform the choice of approach to a solution. Commonly used distinctions include whether the equation is ordinary or partial, linear or non-linear, and homogeneous or heterogeneous. This list is far from exhaustive; there are many other properties and subclasses of differential equations which can be very useful in specific contexts.

### Ordinary differential equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_equation&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Ordinary differential equations")]

An [ordinary differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation") (_ODE_) is an equation containing an unknown [function of one real or complex variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_of_a_real_variable "Function of a real variable")x, its derivatives, and some given functions of x. The unknown function is generally represented by a [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)") (often denoted y), which, therefore, _depends_ on x. Thus x is often called the [independent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_variable "Independent variable") of the equation. The term "_ordinary_" is used in contrast with the term [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"), which may be with respect to _more than_ one independent variable.

[Linear differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_differential_equation "Linear differential equation") are the differential equations that are [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation") in the unknown function and its derivatives. Their theory is well developed, and in many cases one may express their solutions in terms of [integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiderivative "Antiderivative").

Most ODEs that are encountered in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") are linear. Therefore, most [special functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_functions "Special functions") may be defined as solutions of linear differential equations (see [Holonomic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic_function "Holonomic function")).

As, in general, the solutions of a differential equation cannot be expressed by a [closed-form expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression "Closed-form expression"), [numerical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_ordinary_differential_equations "Numerical ordinary differential equations") are commonly used for solving differential equations on a computer.

### Partial differential equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_equation&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Partial differential equations")]

A [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation") (_PDE_) is a differential equation that contains unknown [multivariable functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus "Multivariable calculus") and their [partial derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivatives "Partial derivatives"). (This is in contrast to [ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equations "Ordinary differential equations"), which deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives.) PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved in closed form, or used to create a relevant [computer model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_model "Computer model").

PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena in nature such as [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound "Sound"), [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat"), [electrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics "Electrostatics"), [electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamics "Electrodynamics"), [fluid flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_flow "Fluid flow"), [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics) "Elasticity (physics)"), or [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalized similarly in terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems "Dynamical systems"), partial differential equations often model [multidimensional systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_systems "Multidimensional systems"). [Stochastic partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_partial_differential_equations "Stochastic partial differential equations") generalize partial differential equations for modeling [randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness "Randomness").

### Non-linear differential equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_equation&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Non-linear differential equations")]

A **non-linear differential equation** is a differential equation that is not a [linear equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation") in the unknown function and its derivatives (the linearity or non-linearity in the arguments of the function are not considered here). There are very few methods of solving nonlinear differential equations exactly; those that are known typically depend on the equation having particular [symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry"). Nonlinear differential equations can exhibit very complicated behaviour over extended time intervals, characteristic of [chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory"). Even the fundamental questions of existence, uniqueness, and extendability of solutions for nonlinear differential equations, and well-posedness of initial and boundary value problems for nonlinear PDEs are hard problems and their resolution in special cases is considered to be a significant advance in the mathematical theory (cf. [Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness "Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness")). However, if the differential equation is a correctly formulated representation of a meaningful physical process, then one expects it to have a solution.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-11)

Linear differential equations frequently appear as [approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearization "Linearization") to nonlinear equations. These approximations are only valid under restricted conditions. For example, the [harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator "Harmonic oscillator") equation is an approximation to the nonlinear pendulum equation that is valid for small amplitude oscillations.

### Equation order and degree

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_equation&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Equation order and degree")]

The **order of the differential equation** is the highest _[order of derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order\_of\_derivative "Order of derivative")_ of the unknown function that appears in the differential equation. For example, an equation containing only [first-order derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_derivative "First-order derivative") is a _[first-order differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order\_differential\_equation "First-order differential equation")_, an equation containing the [second-order derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_derivative "Second-order derivative") is a _second-order differential equation_, and so on.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-13)

When it is written as a [polynomial equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation "Polynomial equation") in the unknown function and its derivatives, its **degree of the differential equation** is, depending on the context, the [polynomial degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_degree "Polynomial degree") in the highest derivative of the unknown function,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-14) or its [total degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_degree "Total degree") in the unknown function and its derivatives. In particular, a [linear differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_differential_equation "Linear differential equation") has degree one for both meanings, but the non-linear differential equation ![Image 3: {\displaystyle y'+y^{2}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b2fe8e10eae179618276c80af8b6d4d60efe79b) is of degree one for the first meaning but not for the second one.

Differential equations that describe natural phenomena almost always have only first and second order derivatives in them, but there are some exceptions, such as the [thin-film equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_equation "Thin-film equation"), which is a fourth order partial differential equation.

In the first group of examples _u_ is an unknown function of _x_, and _c_ and _ω_ are constants that are supposed to be known. Two broad classifications of both ordinary and partial differential equations consist of distinguishing between _[linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear\_differential\_equation "Linear differential equation")_ and _nonlinear_ differential equations, and between [_homogeneous_ differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_differential_equation "Homogeneous differential equation") and _heterogeneous_ ones.

In the next group of examples, the unknown function _u_ depends on two variables _x_ and _t_ or _x_ and _y_.

Existence of solutions
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_equation&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Existence of solutions")]

[Solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_solving "Equation solving") differential equations is not like solving [algebraic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_equations "Algebraic equations"). Not only are their solutions often unclear, but whether solutions are unique or exist at all are also notable subjects of interest.

For first order initial value problems, the [Peano existence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_existence_theorem "Peano existence theorem") gives one set of circumstances in which a solution exists. Given any point ![Image 4: {\displaystyle (a,b)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7e5710198f33b00695903460983021e75860e2c) in the xy-plane, define some rectangular region ![Image 5: {\displaystyle Z}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cc6b75e09a8aa3f04d8584b11db534f88fb56bd), such that ![Image 6: {\displaystyle Z=[l,m]\times [n,p]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/515b71ad3b5fc01ff532df8cb71018baca811973) and ![Image 7: {\displaystyle (a,b)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7e5710198f33b00695903460983021e75860e2c) is in the interior of ![Image 8: {\displaystyle Z}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cc6b75e09a8aa3f04d8584b11db534f88fb56bd). If we are given a differential equation ![Image 9: {\textstyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=g(x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c55300534dfeb4b0220920df1cc3eacba0764f70) and the condition that ![Image 10: {\displaystyle y=b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/15a2b7edf933b5c4ff37ac2bca32cb5edc0c596c) when ![Image 11: {\displaystyle x=a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aaae23950e96a955ab5b07015a168fd931d4d82b), then there is locally a solution to this problem if ![Image 12: {\displaystyle g(x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bf358a54b0375e22ae5f3ab2c3e1a22c0c87e11c) and ![Image 13: {\textstyle {\frac {\partial g}{\partial x}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/191bf79648ec5c28dd09dc90f41f1a032dd1bdba) are both continuous on ![Image 14: {\displaystyle Z}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cc6b75e09a8aa3f04d8584b11db534f88fb56bd). This solution exists on some interval with its center at ![Image 15: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc). The solution may not be unique. (See [Ordinary differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation") for other results.)

However, this only helps us with first order [initial value problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem "Initial value problem"). Suppose we had a linear initial value problem of the nth order:

![Image 16: {\displaystyle f_{n}(x){\frac {d^{n}y}{dx^{n}}}+\cdots +f_{1}(x){\frac {dy}{dx}}+f_{0}(x)y=g(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1fdbbc62fccee2cfd06d647c6dd5ab2ad034ff15)
such that

![Image 17: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}y(x_{0})&=y_{0},&y'(x_{0})&=y'_{0},&y''(x_{0})&=y''_{0},&\ldots \end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cf0a086a01f6d1d23e093500b3b426d23f100aa1)
For any nonzero ![Image 18: {\displaystyle f_{n}(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b86f950ad1f8135017742e12a8da5e2367bfdc1a), if ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \{f_{0},f_{1},\ldots \}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/400e2f5ca9c6dc7392700222e59f15cff1e716c4) and ![Image 20: {\displaystyle g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77) are continuous on some interval containing ![Image 21: {\displaystyle x_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86f21d0e31751534cd6584264ecf864a6aa792cf), ![Image 22: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) exists and is unique.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation#cite_note-15)

*   A [delay differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_differential_equation "Delay differential equation") (DDE) is an equation for a function of a single variable, usually called **time**, in which the derivative of the function at a certain time is given in terms of the values of the function at earlier times.

Connection to difference equations
----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_equation&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Connection to difference equations")]

The theory of differential equations is closely related to the theory of [difference equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_equations "Difference equations"), in which the coordinates assume only discrete values, and the relationship involves values of the unknown function or functions and values at nearby coordinates. Many methods to compute numerical solutions of differential equations or study the properties of differential equations involve the approximation of the solution of a differential equation by the solution of a corresponding difference equation.

The study of differential equations is a wide field in [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics "Pure mathematics") and [applied mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics "Applied mathematics"), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"). All of these disciplines are concerned with the properties of differential equations of various types. Pure mathematics focuses on the existence and uniqueness of solutions, while applied mathematics emphasizes the rigorous justification of the methods for approximating solutions. Differential equations play an important role in modeling virtually every physical, technical, or biological process, from celestial motion, to bridge design, to interactions between neurons. Differential equations such as those used to solve real-life problems may not necessarily be directly solvable, i.e. do not have [closed form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression "Closed-form expression") solutions. Instead, solutions can be approximated using [numerical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_ordinary_differential_equations "Numerical ordinary differential equations").

Many fundamental laws of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") can be formulated as differential equations. In [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") and [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), differential equations are used to [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling "Mathematical modelling") the behavior of [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system "Complex system"). The mathematical theory of differential equations first developed together with the sciences where the equations had originated and where the results found application. However, diverse problems, sometimes originating in quite distinct scientific fields, may give rise to identical differential equations. Whenever this happens, mathematical theory behind the equations can be viewed as a unifying principle behind diverse phenomena. As an example, consider the propagation of light and sound in the atmosphere, and of waves on the surface of a pond. All of them may be described by the same second-order [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"), the [wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation "Wave equation"), which allows us to think of light and sound as forms of waves, much like familiar waves in the water. Conduction of heat, the theory of which was developed by [Joseph Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier "Joseph Fourier"), is governed by another second-order partial differential equation, the [heat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation "Heat equation"). It turns out that many [diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion "Diffusion") processes, while seemingly different, are described by the same equation; the [Black–Scholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes "Black–Scholes") equation in finance is, for instance, related to the heat equation.

The number of differential equations that have received a name, in various scientific areas is a witness of the importance of the topic. See [List of named differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_named_differential_equations "List of named differential equations").

Some [CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system "Computer algebra system") software can solve differential equations. These are the commands used in the leading programs:
