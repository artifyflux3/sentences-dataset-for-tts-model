It is a part of the municipality of Bergen , and lies about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) southwest of Alkmaar .

History [ edit ] The village was first mentioned in 922 as Ekmunde. The etymology is unknown.

[ 3 ] The missionary Adalbert of Egmond founded a chapel near Egmond-Binnen and died there around 740. In 922, the Benedictine Egmond Abbey was founded at the location and a settlement developed around it. The abbey was plundered and partially destroyed in 1573.

[ 4 ] The loot was used to finance the founding of Leiden University .

[ 5 ] René Descartes lived in the village during the 1640s.

[ 6 ] In 1789, the south tower collapsed, and the remainder was sold for demolition.

[ 4 ] The Dutch Reformed church was built in 1836 at the former north tower of the abbey. Between 1914 and 1956, the church was built and a tower was added. In 1933, a new monastery was built in Egmond-Binnen and elevated to abbey in 1950.

[ 5 ] Egmond-Binnen was home to 915 people in 1840. It was a separate municipality until 1978, when it merged with Egmond aan Zee and Egmond aan den Hoef to form the new municipality Egmond . In turn, Egmond was amalgamated into Bergen on 1 January 2001.

By 15 November 1644, Descartes was back in Holland. [...] When Descartes arrived in the United Provinces, he went almost immediately to Egmond-binnen, just two miles south of his former residence in Egmond aan den Hoef, and Egmond-binnen was his permanent residence until he left for Sweden in September 1649.
