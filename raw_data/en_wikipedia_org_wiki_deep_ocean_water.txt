Ocean water differs in temperature and salinity . Warm surface water is generally saltier than the cooler deep or polar waters; [ 1 ] in polar regions , the upper layers of ocean water are cold and fresh.

[ 2 ] Deep ocean water makes up about 90% of the volume of the oceans. Deep ocean water has a very uniform temperature, around 0–3 °C (32–37 °F), and a salinity of about 3.5% or, as oceanographers state, 35‰ ( parts per thousand ).

[ 3 ] In specialized locations, such as the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii , ocean water is pumped to the surface from approximately 900 m (3,000 ft) deep for applications in research, commercial and pre-commercial activities. DOW is typically used to describe ocean water at sub-thermal depths [ clarify ] sufficient to provide a measurable difference in water temperature.

When deep ocean water is brought to the surface, it can be used for a variety of things. Its most useful property is its temperature. At the surface of the Earth, most water and air is well above 3 °C. The difference in temperature is indicative of a difference in energy . Where there is an energy gradient , skillful application of engineering can harness that energy for productive use by humans.

The simplest use of cold water is for air conditioning : using the cold water itself to cool air saves the energy that would be used by the compressors for traditional refrigeration . Another use could be to replace expensive desalination plants. When cold water passes through a pipe surrounded by humid air, condensation results. The condensate is pure water , suitable for humans to drink or for crop irrigation . Via a technology called ocean thermal energy conversion , the temperature difference can be used to run a heat engine to generate electricity.

Cold-bed agriculture [ edit ] A potential indirect use of cold ocean water is "cold-bed agriculture".  During condensation or ocean thermal energy conversion operations, the water does not reach ambient temperature , because a certain temperature gradient is required to make these processes viable. The water leaving those operations is therefore still colder than the surroundings, and a further benefit can be extracted by passing this water through underground pipes, thereby cooling agricultural soil. This reduces evaporation, and even causes water to condense from the atmosphere.

[ 4 ] This allows agricultural production where crops would normally not be able to grow. This technique is sometimes referred to as "cold agriculture" [ 5 ] or "cold-bed agriculture".
