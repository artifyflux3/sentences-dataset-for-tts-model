Infobox references Chemical compound HCNH + , also known as protonated hydrogen cyanide , is a molecular ion of astrophysical interest. It also exists in the condensed state when formed by superacids .

Structure [ edit ] In the ground state , HC + N H is a simple linear molecule, whereas its excited triplet state is expected to have cis and trans isomeric forms . The higher-energy structural isomers H 2 CN + and C + N H 2 have also been studied theoretically.

[ 5 ] Laboratory studies [ edit ] As a relatively simple molecular ion, HCNH + has been extensively studied in the laboratory. The very first spectrum taken at any wavelength focused on the ν 2 (C−H stretch) ro-vibrational band in the infrared .

[ 6 ] Soon afterward, the same authors reported on their investigation of the ν 1 (N−H stretch) band.

[ 7 ] Following these initial studies, several groups published manuscripts on the various ro-vibrational spectra of HCNH + , including studies of the ν 3 band (C≡N stretch), [ 8 ] the ν 4 band (H−C≡N bend), [ 9 ] and the ν 5 band (H−N≡C bend)
.

[ 10 ] While all of these studies focused on ro-vibrational spectra in the infrared , it was not until 1998 that technology advanced far enough for an investigation of the pure rotational spectrum of HCNH + in the microwave region to take place. At that time, microwave spectra for HCNH + and its isotopomers HCND + and DCND + were published.

[ 11 ] Recently, the pure rotational spectrum of HCNH + was measured again in order to more precisely determine the molecular rotational constants B and D .

[ 12 ] Formation and destruction [ edit ] According to the database at astrochemistry.net , the most advanced chemical models of HCNH + include 71 total formation reactions and 21 total destruction reactions. Of these, however, only a handful dominate the overall formation and destruction.

[ 13 ] In the case of formation, the 7 dominant reactions are: H + 3 + HCN → HCNH + + H 2 H + 3 + HNC → HCNH + + H 2 HCO + + HCN → HCNH + + CO HCO + + HNC → HCNH + + CO H 3 O + + HCN → HCNH + + H 2 O H 3 O + + HNC → HCNH + + H 2 O C + + NH 3 → HCNH + + H Astronomical detections [ edit ] Initial interstellar detection [ edit ] HCNH + was first detected in interstellar space in 1986 toward the dense cloud Sgr B2 using the NRAO 12 m dish and the Texas Millimeter Wave Observatory .

[ 14 ] These observations utilized the J = 1–0, 2–1, and 3–2 pure rotational transitions at 74, 148, and 222 GHz, respectively.

Subsequent interstellar detections [ edit ] Since the initial detection, HCNH + has also been observed in TMC-1 [ 15 ] [ 16 ] as well as DR 21(OH) [ 15 ] .

[ 17 ] The initial detection toward Sgr B2 has also been confirmed.

[ 15 ] [ 18 ] All 3 of these sources are dense molecular clouds, and to date HCNH + has not been detected in diffuse interstellar material.

Solar System bodies [ edit ] While not directly detected via spectroscopy, the existence of HCNH + has been inferred to exist in the atmosphere of Saturn 's largest moon, Titan , [ 19 ] based on data from the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) instrument aboard the Cassini space probe. Models of Titan's atmosphere had predicted that HCNH + would be the dominant ion present, and a strong peak in the mass spectrum at ⁠ m / z ⁠ = 28 seems to support this theory.

In 1997, observations were made of the long-period comet Hale–Bopp in an attempt to find HCNH + , [ 20 ] but it was not detected. However, the upper limit derived from these observations, along with the detections of HCN , HNC , and CN , is important in understanding the chemistry associated with comets .
