In linear algebra , functional analysis and related areas of mathematics , a quasinorm is similar to a norm in that it satisfies the norm axioms, except that the triangle inequality is replaced by ‖ ‖ x + y ‖ ‖ ≤ ≤ K ( ‖ ‖ x ‖ ‖ + ‖ ‖ y ‖ ‖ ) {\displaystyle \|x+y\|\leq K(\|x\|+\|y\|)} for some K > 1.

{\displaystyle K>1.} Definition [ edit ] A quasi-seminorm [ 1 ] on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} is a real-valued map p {\displaystyle p} on X {\displaystyle X} that satisfies the following conditions: Non-negativity : p ≥ ≥ 0 ; {\displaystyle p\geq 0;} Absolute homogeneity : p ( s x ) = | s | p ( x ) {\displaystyle p(sx)=|s|p(x)} for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and all scalars s ; {\displaystyle s;} there exists a real k ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle k\geq 1} such that p ( x + y ) ≤ ≤ k [ p ( x ) + p ( y ) ] {\displaystyle p(x+y)\leq k[p(x)+p(y)]} for all x , y ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x,y\in X.} If k = 1 {\displaystyle k=1} then this inequality reduces to the triangle inequality . It is in this sense that this condition generalizes the usual triangle inequality.

A quasinorm [ 1 ] is a quasi-seminorm that also satisfies: Positive definite / Point-separating : if x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} satisfies p ( x ) = 0 , {\displaystyle p(x)=0,} then x = 0.

{\displaystyle x=0.} A pair ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} consisting of a vector space X {\displaystyle X} and an associated quasi-seminorm p {\displaystyle p} is called a quasi-seminormed vector space . 
If the quasi-seminorm is a quasinorm then it is also called a quasinormed vector space .

Multiplier The infimum of all values of k {\displaystyle k} that satisfy condition (3) is called the multiplier of p .

{\displaystyle p.} The multiplier itself will also satisfy condition (3) and so it is the unique smallest real number that satisfies this condition. 
The term k {\displaystyle k} -quasi-seminorm is sometimes used to describe a quasi-seminorm whose multiplier is equal to k .

{\displaystyle k.} A norm (respectively, a seminorm ) is just a quasinorm (respectively, a quasi-seminorm) whose multiplier is 1.

{\displaystyle 1.} Thus every seminorm is a quasi-seminorm and every norm is a quasinorm (and a quasi-seminorm).

Topology [ edit ] If p {\displaystyle p} is a quasinorm on X {\displaystyle X} then p {\displaystyle p} induces a vector topology on X {\displaystyle X} whose neighborhood basis at the origin is given by the sets: [ 2 ] { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < 1 / n } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)<1/n\}} as n {\displaystyle n} ranges over the positive integers. 
A topological vector space with such a topology is called a quasinormed topological vector space or just a quasinormed space .

Every quasinormed topological vector space is pseudometrizable .

A complete quasinormed space is called a quasi-Banach space . Every Banach space is a quasi-Banach space, although not conversely.

Related definitions [ edit ] See also: Banach algebra A quasinormed space ( A , ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ ) {\displaystyle (A,\|\,\cdot \,\|)} is called a quasinormed algebra if the vector space A {\displaystyle A} is an algebra and there is a constant K > 0 {\displaystyle K>0} such that ‖ ‖ x y ‖ ‖ ≤ ≤ K ‖ ‖ x ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ y ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|xy\|\leq K\|x\|\cdot \|y\|} for all x , y ∈ ∈ A .

{\displaystyle x,y\in A.} A complete quasinormed algebra is called a quasi-Banach algebra .

Characterizations [ edit ] A topological vector space (TVS) is a quasinormed space if and only if it has a bounded neighborhood of the origin.

[ 2 ] Examples [ edit ] Since every norm is a quasinorm, every normed space is also a quasinormed space.

L p {\displaystyle L^{p}} spaces with 0 < p < 1 {\displaystyle 0<p<1} The L p {\displaystyle L^{p}} spaces for 0 < p < 1 {\displaystyle 0<p<1} are quasinormed spaces (indeed, they are even F-spaces ) but they are not, in general, normable (meaning that there might not exist any norm that defines their topology). 
For 0 < p < 1 , {\displaystyle 0<p<1,} the Lebesgue space L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) {\displaystyle L^{p}([0,1])} is a complete metrizable TVS (an F-space ) that is not locally convex (in fact, its only convex open subsets are itself L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) {\displaystyle L^{p}([0,1])} and the empty set) and the only continuous linear functional on L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) {\displaystyle L^{p}([0,1])} is the constant 0 {\displaystyle 0} function ( Rudin 1991 , §1.47). 
In particular, the Hahn-Banach theorem does not hold for L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) {\displaystyle L^{p}([0,1])} when 0 < p < 1.
