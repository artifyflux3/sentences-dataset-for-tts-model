Byrhtferth's diagram with the [Four elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_elements "Four elements") (earth, water, air, fire), seasons, solstices, equinoxes, signs of the zodiac and ages of man. An [Ogham inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogham_inscription "Ogham inscription") is in the centre. Miniature from twelfth century English medieval manuscript MS Oxford St John's College 17, folium 7 verso. Copy from original about 1000 AD by Byrhtferth.

**Byrhtferth** ([Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language "Old English language"): _Byrhtferð_; c. 970– c. 1020) was a priest and [monk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk "Monk") who lived at [Ramsey Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_Abbey "Ramsey Abbey") in [Huntingdonshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingdonshire "Huntingdonshire") (now part of [Cambridgeshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire "Cambridgeshire")) in England.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-1) He had a deep impact on the intellectual life of later [Anglo-Saxon England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_England "Anglo-Saxon England") and wrote many [computistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus "Computus"), [hagiographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagiographic "Hagiographic"), and [historical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical "Historical") works.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Blackwell-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Szarmach_et_al.-3) He was a leading man of science and best known as the author of many different works (although he may not have written many of them).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Baker-4) His _Manual_ (_Enchiridion_), a scientific textbook, is Byrhtferth's best known work.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-5)

He studied with [Abbo of Fleury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbo_of_Fleury "Abbo of Fleury"), who was invited to [Ramsey Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_Abbey "Ramsey Abbey") by [Oswald of Worcester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_of_Worcester "Oswald of Worcester") to help teach. Abbo was there during the period 985 to 987, and became a large influence on Byhrtferth who was interested in the same studies, such as history, logic, astronomy, and mathematics.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Fletcher-6) We do not have contemporary biographies of Byrhtferth, and the only information we have is that given in his _Manual_ and his _Preface_.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-7)

Byrhtferth's signature appears on only two unpublished works, his Latin and Old English _Manual_, and Latin _Preface_. He also composed a Latin life of St. [Egwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egwin "Egwin"), compiled a chronicle of [Northumbrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Northumbria "Kingdom of Northumbria") history in the 990s, wrote a Latin life of [Oswald of Worcester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_of_Worcester "Oswald of Worcester") (the _Vita Oswaldi_) about the year 1000, and it is suggested that he is responsible for the early sections of the _Historia regum_, or _History of the Kings_, attributed to [Simeon of Durham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_of_Durham "Simeon of Durham"). This last attribution is based on the similarity of the style between Simeon and Byrhtferth.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Szarmach_et_al.-3)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Fletcher-6) An unsigned fragment of Old English text on _[computus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus "Computus")_ in the Manuscript [BL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library "British Library") Cotton Caligula A.xv[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-8) is attributed to him because of the stylistic similarity to the Old English that he wrote in the _Manual_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Szarmach_et_al.-3)[Cyril Roy Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Roy_Hart "Cyril Roy Hart") also tentatively identifies him as the author of the verse [Menologium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menologium#Old_English_poem "Menologium") preserved as a preface to a manuscript of the [Anglo-Saxon Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-karasawa-10) although Kazutomo Karasawa believes it more likely to have been written by an older contemporary.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKarasawa2015[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidhgo7EAAAQBAJpgPA71_71]-11)

Byrhtferth has also been credited with Latin commentaries on [Bede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede "Bede")'s _De natura rerum_ and _De temporum ratione_ (first attributed to him by John Herwagen) and a _Vita S. Dunstani_ signed "B" (first attributed to him by [Jean Mabillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Mabillon "Jean Mabillon")).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Baker-4) However, many scholars argue that these works were not written by Byrhtferth, but instead were a compilation of material by several writers in the late ninth and early tenth centuries. This is argued because of the smooth, polished style of these works in comparison with the styles of the only signed works, the _Manual_ and the _Preface_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Baker-4)

*   [Bodl.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodleian_Library "Bodleian Library") Ashmole MS 328 preserves Byrhtferth's Latin _Enchiridion_, or _Manual_. It is written in Latin and [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") and the largest part is that of a _computus_ similar to the one in _Preface_. It touches on the belief that the divine order of the universe can be perceived through the study of numbers and it is valuable for the study of medieval number symbolism.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Szarmach_et_al.-3) It also contains treatises on rhetorical and grammatical subjects, a table of weights and measures, and three theological tracts on the ages of the world, the loosing of [Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan "Satan") and the eight capital sins.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Lutz-12)

[St John's College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Oxford "St John's College, Oxford") MS 17 [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-13) contains several computistical works by Bede and Helperic, and a _[computus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus "Computus")_ which includes the Latin _Epilogus_ ("Preface") by Byrhtferth. He also constructed a full-page diagram showing the harmony of the universe, and suggesting correspondences among cosmological, numerological, and physiological aspects of the world. Other items in the [manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript "Manuscript") may in fact have been written by Byrhtferth, but this cannot be proved. Also, he may have compiled most of this material from works that [Abbo of Fleury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbo_of_Fleury "Abbo of Fleury") left behind at [Ramsey Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_Abbey "Ramsey Abbey") after his death.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth#cite_note-Szarmach_et_al.-3)
