[ 1 ] Production and release history [ edit ] Songs by Tom Lehrer was recorded in a single one-hour session on January 22, 1953, at the TransRadio studio in Boston for the total studio cost of $15. The first pressing was an issue of 400 copies, produced at Lehrer's own expense in the 10" LP record format. Records were sold for $3.50, and later $3.95. Later releases were issued in 10" and 12" LP format.

[ 2 ] The songs from Songs by Tom Lehrer were rerecorded for the 1960 live album Revisited .

Songs by Tom Lehrer was re-released alongside Lehrer's second album, More of Tom Lehrer , as part of Songs & More Songs by Tom Lehrer in 1997 and as part of the 2000 box set The Remains of Tom Lehrer .

However, in an attempt to make the songs more up to date, Lehrer made some noticeable changes in the lyrics that he later regretted and discarded. This version of the album has not been reissued on CD.

[ 3 ] The Reprise version of the album featured a cartoon cover designed by Eric Martin, who also designed the That Was The Year That Was cover.

The album was performed by singer Jack Nagle under an easily deciphered assumed name. "Eljan" 's album was reissued in 1960 in the wake of Revisited 's popularity.

[ 3 ] Actor Dennis Hopper sings a line from "Be Prepared" ( " 'Be prepared'; that's the Boy Scouts' marching song") in the 1994 motion picture Speed .

In 2012, rapper 2 Chainz sampled "The Old Dope Peddler" for his song "Dope Peddler", from his album Based on a T.R.U. Story .
