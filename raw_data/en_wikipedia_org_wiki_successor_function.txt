In mathematics , the successor function or successor operation sends a natural number to the next one. The successor function is denoted by S , so S ( n ) = n + 1. For example, S (1) = 2 and S (2) = 3. The successor function is one of the basic components used to build a primitive recursive function .

Successor operations are also known as zeration in the context of a zeroth hyperoperation : H 0 ( a , b ) = 1 + b . In this context, the extension of zeration is addition , which is defined as repeated succession.

Overview [ edit ] The successor function is part of the formal language used to state the Peano axioms , which formalise the structure of the natural numbers. In this formalisation, the successor function is a primitive operation on the natural numbers, in terms of which the standard natural numbers and addition are defined.

[ 1 ] For example, 1 is defined to be S (0), and addition on natural numbers is defined recursively by: m + 0 = m , m + S ( n ) = S ( m + n ).

This can be used to compute the addition of any two natural numbers. For example, 5 + 2 = 5 + S (1) = S (5 + 1) = S (5 + S (0)) = S ( S (5 + 0)) = S ( S (5)) = S (6) = 7.

Several constructions of the natural numbers within set theory have been proposed. For example, John von Neumann constructs the number 0 as the empty set {}, and the successor of n , S ( n ), as the set n ∪ { n }. The axiom of infinity then guarantees the existence of a set that contains 0 and is closed with respect to S . The smallest such set is denoted by N , and its members are called natural numbers.

[ 2 ] The successor function is the level-0 foundation of the infinite Grzegorczyk hierarchy of hyperoperations , used to build addition , multiplication , exponentiation , tetration , etc. It was studied in 1986 in an investigation involving generalization of the pattern for hyperoperations.

[ 3 ] It is also one of the primitive functions used in the characterization of computability by recursive functions .
