Renaissance reenactment is historical reenactment of events of the Renaissance period and the European Age of Exploration . In its broadest use, it encompasses reenactment of periods from the early 15th century through the mid-18th century. Reenactments of earlier events are commonly termed medieval reenactment , while more recent events are modern reenactment . Events and periods within Renaissance reenactment vary by region and nation, but include the English Civil War in the United Kingdom , the Eighty Years' War in the Low Countries (particularly the Netherlands ), L'Escalade in Switzerland , the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in eastern Europe , and the early colonial period in the United States and Canada .

Renaissance fairs , a primarily American phenomenon, [ 1 ] are, when historically based, considered part of Renaissance reenactment; however, some fairs favor entertainment over authenticity, [ 2 ] See also [ edit ] The Sealed Knot (reenactment) , English Civil War reenactors, the largest reenactment and historical society in the UK English Civil War Society , reenactors of the First and Second English Civil War Re-enactments in Kentwell Hall , re-enactment of the Tudor period List of Renaissance fairs References [ edit ] ^ Val Horsler, Living the Past , Weidenfeld & Nicolson, in association with English Heritage, London, England 2003.

^ "King Richard's Faire brings a Renaissance revival" , The Providence Journal , 2007-08-30 , retrieved 2011-06-10 , Shapiro has been producing Renaissance fairs since 1972, and says the goal is a balance between history and revelry, favoring the latter. "We were so authentic back then it was almost painful. Clearly this is an entertainment vehicle."
