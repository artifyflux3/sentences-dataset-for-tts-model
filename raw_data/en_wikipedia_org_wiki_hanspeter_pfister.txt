He is the An Wang Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and an affiliate faculty member of the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University . His research in visual computing lies at the intersection of scientific visualization , information visualization , computer graphics , and computer vision and spans a wide range of topics, including biomedical image analysis and visualization, image and video analysis, and visual analytics in data science.

Biography [ edit ] Hanspeter Pfister received his master's degree in 1991 in electrical engineering at ETH Zurich and moved to the United States for his PhD in computer science at Stony Brook University . In 1992 he began working with Arie Kaufman on Cube-3, a hardware architecture for volume visualization . By the time of his graduation in 1996, he had finished the architecture for Cube-4 and licensed it to Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories .

[ 2 ] He joined Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories in 1996 as a research scientists, where he worked for over a decade.

[ 3 ] He was the chief architect of VolumePro, Mitsubishi Electric's real-time volume rendering graphics card, for which he received the Mitsubishi Electric President's Award in 2000.

[ 4 ] He joined the faculty at Harvard University in 2007.  In 2012 Hanspeter Pfister was appointed the An Wang Professor of Computer Science and started his research lab called the Visual Computing Group. In the same year, he also served as the Technical Papers Chair at SIGGRAPH [ 5 ] and became a consultant for Disney Research [ 6 ] From 2013 to 2017, Hanspeter Pfister was the director of the Institute for Applied Computational Science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences .
