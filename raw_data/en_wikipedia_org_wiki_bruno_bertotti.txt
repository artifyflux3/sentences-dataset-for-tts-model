He was one of the last students of physicist Erwin Schrödinger .

[ 1 ] Bertotti was well known for his contributions to general relativity – particularly the Bertotti–Robinson electrovacuum , an exact solution of the Einstein field equation . He pioneered the post-Minkowskian expansion .

[ 2 ] He has also obtained a more accurate measurement of the parameter gamma of the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism , with the Cassini radioscience experiment.

[ 3 ] The PPN gamma parameter measures the curvature of space in the metric theory of gravitation and it is equal to one in general relativity .

[ 4 ] More recent studies [ 5 ] [ 6 ] revealed that the measured value of the PPN parameter gamma is affected by gravitomagnetic effect caused by the orbital motion of Sun around the barycenter of the Solar System . The gravitomagnetic effect in the Cassini radioscience experiment was implicitly postulated by Bertotti as having a pure general relativistic origin but its theoretical value has been never tested in the experiment which effectively makes the experimental uncertainty in the measured value of gamma actually larger (by a factor of 10) than that claimed by Bertotti and co-authors in Nature.

Between 1953 and 1956, Bertotti worked as a scholar at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies . Following, Bertotti was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, in 1958-59.

[ 7 ] In 2007 he was awarded the Italian Gold Medal for Merit in Science and Culture.

[ 8 ] Among the last scholars in relativity from the University of Pavia are Alessandro Spallicci and Alberto Vecchio .
