The fault plane traces from the upper right to the lower left of the image. The horse is the broad lens-shaped feature in the rock defined by the splitting and rejoining of the trace of the fault plane.

A horse , in geology , is any block of rock completely separated from the surrounding rock either by mineral veins or fault planes . In mining , a horse is a block of country rock entirely encased within a mineral lode .

[ 1 ] In structural geology the term was first used to describe the thrust-bounded imbricates found within a thrust duplex .

[ 2 ] In later literature it has become a general term for any block entirely bounded by faults, whether the overall deformation type is contractional , extensional or strike-slip in nature.
