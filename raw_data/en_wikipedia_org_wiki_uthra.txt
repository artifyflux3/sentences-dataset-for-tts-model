[ 1 ] Charles G. Häberl and James F. McGrath translate it as "excellency".

[ 2 ] Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley defines them as "Lightworld beings, called 'utras (sing.: 'utra 'wealth', but meaning 'angel' or 'guardian')." [ 3 ] Aldihisi (2008) compares them to the yazata of Zoroastrianism .

[ 4 ] According to E. S. Drower , "an 'uthra is an ethereal being, a spirit of light and Life." [ 5 ] : 2 Uthras are benevolent beings that live in škinas ( ࡔࡊࡉࡍࡀ , "celestial dwellings") in the World of Light ( alma ḏ-nhūra ) and communicate with each other via telepathy .

[ 4 ] Uthras are also occasionally mentioned as being in anana ("cloud"; e.g., in Right Ginza Book 17, Chapter 1), which can also be interpreted as female consorts.

[ 6 ] Many uthras also serve as guardians ( naṭra ); [ 7 ] for instance, Shilmai and Nidbai are the guardians of Piriawis , the Great Jordan ( yardna ) of Life. Other uthras are gufnas , or heavenly grapevines.

[ 6 ] Uthras that accompany people or souls are known as parwanqa ( ࡐࡀࡓࡅࡀࡍࡒࡀ ), which can be translated as "guide", "envoy", or "messenger".

[ 8 ] Etymology [ edit ] Uthra is typically considered to be cognate with the Aramaic ʿuṯrā 'riches', derived from the Semitic root * ʿ-ṯ-r 'to be rich'.

[ 9 ] Based on that etymology, E. S. Drower suggests a parallel with the South Arabian storm god Attar , who provides irrigation for the people.

[ 4 ] However, that etymology is disputed by Charles G. Häberl (2017), who suggests it is the ʾaqtal pattern noun *awtərā 'excellency', derived from the Semitic root * w-t-r 'to exceed'.

[ 9 ] Naming [ edit ] Uthras often have the term Ziwa / Ziua ( ࡆࡉࡅࡀ "Radiance') attached after their names, due to their origins from the World of Light . In Manichaeism , the Syriac term Ziwa ( ܙܝܘܐ ) is also used to refer to Jesus as Ishoʿ Ziwā ( Syriac : ܝܫܘܥ ܙܝܘܐ , Jesus the Splendor ), who is sent to awaken Adam and Eve to the source of the spiritual light trapped within their physical bodies.

Pairs of uthras also typically have rhyming names. The names can be alliterative (e.g., Adathan and Yadathan ), or one name may have an infixed consonant or syllable (e.g., Kapan and Kanpan). In Manichaeism , pairs of celestial beings can also have rhyming names, such as Xroshtag and Padvaxtag . Gardner (2010) discusses other parallels with Manichaeism.

[ 10 ] List of uthras [ edit ] Commonly mentioned uthras [ edit ] Below is a partial list of uthras. Some names of uthras are always listed together as pairs.

Manda d-Hayyi , the savior uthra whose name means " Gnosis of (the) Life " The triad consisting of the three sons of Adam according to Book 1 of the Left Ginza : Hibil ( Abel ) Shitil ( Seth ) Anush ( Enosh ) The emanations : Yushamin (the Second Life): the primal uthra Abatur (the Third Life): father of Ptahil Ptahil (the Fourth Life): the creator of the material world Sam Ziwa ( Shem ): Shem is cognate with the angelic soteriological figure Sam Ziwa Shilmai and Nidbai are a pair of uthras who serve as the guardian spirits ( naṭra ; plural: naṭria ) of the Jordan and the delegates of Manda d-Hayyi , who carry out the work of God ( Hayyi Rabbi ). (See Xroshtag and Padvaxtag in Manichaeism .) Adathan and Yadathan are a pair of uthras who stand at the Gate of Life, praising and worshipping God.

Yur (also Yur-Yahur) is one of the matarta guardians. Qulasta prayer 12 begins with the name Yur, son of Barit. Yur is also mentioned in Qulasta prayers 18 and 171.

Yura – "jewel". Mentioned in Right Ginza 15.7, 15.8, 16.1, and 17.1 as Yura Rba Ganzibra (literally "Great Yura the Ganzibra " or "Great Yura the Treasurer"). Yura is mentioned in Qulasta prayers 214 and 379 as well.

Yurba (spelled Jōrabba by Lidzbarski ) – also called the fighter. Yurba is identified with Shamish , the sun.

[ 13 ] Book 18 of the Right Ginza equates Yurba with Adonai of Judaism, while Gelbert (2017) identifies Yurba with Yao .

[ 14 ] Mentioned in Right Ginza 3, 5.3 (which mentions Yurba as a matarta guardian), 8, 12.1, 15.5, and 18 and Left Ginza 2.22 and 3.45.

Mandaean Book of John 52 is a narrative dedicated to Yurba. Yurba is often mentioned as engaging in conversation with Ruha.

Zarzeil Ziwa (Zarzʿil Ziwa) – mentioned in Right Ginza 5.1 and 15.8.

Zhir (meaning 'secured') – often mentioned as part of a pair with Zihrun Zihrun (sometimes spelled as Zahrun; literally means 'the Life warned me') – Zihrun is mentioned in Right Ginza 4 as Zihrun-Uthra (also called Yusmir -Kana) and Right Ginza 8, and in Mandaean Book of John 62 as a "morning star." Qulasta prayers 2 , 3 , 240 , and 319 mention him as Zihrun Raza ("Zihrun the Mystery"). He is described as an uthra of radiance, light, and glory in prayers 2 and 3, with prayer 2 mentioning Manda d-Hayyi as an emanation of Zihrun. Qulasta prayers 332 , 340 , 341 , and 374 mention him as the name for a drabsha (banner), and prayer 347 mentions him as Zihrun-Šašlamiel. He is the subject of Zihrun Raza Kasia .

In Right Ginza 5.1, Yawar Ziwa appoints four uthras each over the four directions to watch over Ur ( see also Guardians of the directions ): west : Azaziʿil , Azaziaʿil, Taqpʿil and Margazʿil the Great east : ʿUrpʿil , Marpʿil , Taqpʿil and Hananʿil north : Kanpan and Kapan, Gubran and Guban south : Hailʿil, Qarbʿil, Nurʿil and Nuriaʿil In the Qulasta [ edit ] A few Qulasta prayers list the names of lesser-known uthras in sets of four. They are referred to as the "four men, the sons of peace" ( arba gubria bnia šlama ) in Qulasta prayers 8 , 49 , 71 , 75 , and 77 , as well as Right Ginza 5.4, 14, and 15.8.

Qulasta prayer 17 and Left Ginza 1.2 refer to them as the "four uthras, the sons of light" ( arba ʿutria bnia nhura ). Mark J. Lofts (2010) considers them to be parallel to the Four Luminaries in Sethian Gnosticism . Qulasta prayers 17 and 77 list them as: [ 15 ] Rhum-Hai ("Mercy") Īn-Hai ("Wellspring" or "Source of Life" [ 6 ] ) Šum-Hai ("Name") Zamar-Hai ("Singer") Qulasta prayer 49 lists the "four men, the sons of peace" as: Īn-Hai Šum-Hai ( Šum can mean both Shem and "Name") Ziw -Hai ("Radiance") Nhur-Hai ("Light") These four uthras are considered to be the kings ( malkia ) of the North Star , who give strength and life to the sun. Together with Malka Ziwa (another name for Hayyi Rabbi ), they make up the "five primal beings of light." Conversely, Mandaeans consider the "five lords of the World of Darkness " to be Zartai-Zartanai , Hag and Mag , Gap and Gapan, Šdum , and Krun (the paired demons are considered to rule together as single lords).

[ 16 ] (See Manichaeism § The World of Light for similar parallels.) Other minor uthras mentioned in the Qulasta are: [ 17 ] Hamgai-Ziwa, son of Hamgagai-Ziwa – mentioned in Qulasta prayer 3 and Right Ginza 15.5.

Hazazban (Haza-Zban) – mentioned in Qulasta prayers 19 and 27 as an uthra who sets wreaths ( klila ) upon the heads of Mandaeans who are performing masbuta . Sometimes the klila itself is also called Hazazban. Also mentioned in the Ginza Rabba as the matarta guard Zan-Hazazban in Right Ginza 5.3 and 6 . Hazazban possibly means 'this time.' [ 18 ] ʿIt ʿNṣibat ʿUtria (or ʿIt Yawar bar ʿNṣibat ʿUtria – mentioned in Qulasta prayer 5 . Prayer 46 mentions ʿNiṣbat-ʿUtria.

Š'haq is also mentioned in Right Ginza 15.5. In the 1012 Questions , S'haq Ziwa or Adam S'haq Ziwa (literally "Adam was Bright Radiance" [ 5 ] : 75 ) is equated with Adam Kasia .

[ 19 ] Shingilan (or Šingilan-Uthra) – mentioned in Qulasta prayer 105 and Mandaean Book of John 1 and 69.

Yukašar – mentioned in Qulasta prayers 53 , 54 , 55 , 64 , 77 , and 343 Yaha-Yaha – mentioned in Qulasta prayer 15 Yaluz-Yaluz – mentioned in Qulasta prayers 22 and 50 Zha-Zha – mentioned in Qulasta prayer 15 Zhir – mentioned in Qulasta prayer 26 In other texts [ edit ] Uthras in the Diwan Abatur (DC 8): Hibil (upper left corner), Bihram (to the right of Hibil), Simat Hayyi , (upper right corner), along with Adam, Anush , Shitil , and Yadathan (bottom row of uthras) In the Mandaean Book of John , Etinṣib Ziwa ( Classical Mandaic : ࡏࡕࡉࡍࡑࡉࡁ ࡆࡉࡅࡀ , lit.

'Splendid Transplant') is an uthra who starts a battle against Nbaṭ .

[ 13 ] Some uthras mentioned in the Diwan Abatur include: [ 18 ] Arspan, an uthra connected with water and baptism; also the name of a throne in the Diwan Abatur Bihdad, an uthra who assists Abatur at the scales in the Diwan Abatur ʿQaimat – daughter of Yushamin, has 15 children by Ptahil [ 20 ] Rahmiʿil – often mentioned in love charms Samandarʿil – a flower and blossom spirit; also mentioned in Qulasta prayer 105 Šarhabiel – In the Diwan Abatur , he is the son of Ptahil who rules over purgatory. Šarhabʿil has been depicted as both male and female, and is also the epithet of the ritual incense cup.

[ 20 ] Šhaq – son of Ptahil and ruler of a matarta; means 'cloud(s)' Mentioned in the Alma Rišaia Zuṭa : [ 20 ] Mdabriel Gufna [ edit ] Main article: Gufna In various Mandaean texts, several heavenly beings are described as personified grapevines ( gufna or gupna ) in the World of Light.

Trees [ edit ] See also: Zihrun Raza Kasia § Plants In various Mandaean manuscripts, uthras can also be described as personified heavenly trees. Many Mandaean scrolls contain illustrations of the trees. Some of them are: [ 20 ] Dmut Kušṭa (MS Asiatic. Misc. C. 12) Abatur Rama , as a date palm Habšaba, as a fig tree Yawar Ziwa , as a great cotton plant Yushamin , as a mulberry tree Diwan Abatur (DC 8) Shatrin Gabriel Rihmat ('she-loved-Gabriel', a date palm) Baptism of Hibil Ziwa (DC 35) Nṣab Pirun Alma Rišaia Rba (DC 41): Haneil, Marmag, Mašqeil, Nahreil, Nahureil, Rahimeil (depicted twice), Samkieil, Tarwan Anana [ edit ] Main article: Anana (Mandaeism) The Mandaic term anana ( Classical Mandaic : ࡀࡍࡀࡍࡀ ) is typically translated as 'cloud,' but can also be interpreted as a female consort of an uthra, and hence also an uthra.

[ 6 ] In Qulasta prayers such as the Asut Malkia , the word niṭufta (spelled niṭupta ), which originally means 'drop' and has sometimes also been translated as 'cloud', is also often used as an appellation to refer to the consorts of uthras.

[ 21 ] It can also be interpreted as the semen or seed of the Father (Hayyi Rabbi), or a personified drop of "water of life".

The Aramaic verbal root ʿ-t-r 'to be rich' (from PS * ʿ-ṯ-r ) has completely disappeared from Mandaic through merger with the verbal root *y-t-r (from PS * w-t-r ) 'to exceed' due to the mergers of PS * ʾ with * ʿ and PS * ṯ with * t in Mandaic; […] The scholarly consensus that has developed over the past fifteen decades, namely that CM eutra is cognate with Aramaic ʿuṯrā 'riches' and therefore means 'riches', is not justified either by the internal evidence from the Mandaic literature or by the comparative evidence from the other Semitic languages. By comparing its contemporary spoken form, NM oṯrɔ , with related words in all other branches of Semitic, I have demonstrated that CM eutra clearly derives from the PS root * w-t-r 'to exceed', that it is one of an extremely small class of relic C-stem deverbal adjectives in Aramaic, that its original meaning with reference to divine beings is 'excellent', and that in Classical Mandaic (and only in Classical Mandaic) it secondarily came to be used as a proper noun referring to an entire category of supernatural beings ('the excellencies').
