Find sources: "Computer-aided garden design" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( August 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Computer-aided garden design describes the use of CAD packages to ease and improve the process of garden design .
Professional garden designers have used CAD packages designed for other professions. This includes architectural design software for the drafting of garden plans, 3-D software and image-editing software for visual representation. But tailor-made computer-aided design software is made for the amateur garden design market. It contains some of the functionality of the more advanced programs, packaged in an easy-to-use format.

[ 1 ] Although designers still use drawing by hand, in the 2020s AI has been used including by non-professionals.

[ 2 ] Apps are widely publicly available including for plant identification.
