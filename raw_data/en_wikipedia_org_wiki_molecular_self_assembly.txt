[ 1 ] ("Hydrogen bonds" in the top image are exaggerated by artifacts of the imaging technique.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] ) NC-AFM imaging of the molecular self-assembly process of 2-aminoterephthalic acid molecules on calcite(104).

[ 4 ] STM image of self-assembled Br 4 - pyrene molecules on Au(111) surface (top) and its model (bottom; pink spheres are Br atoms).

[ 5 ] In chemistry and materials science , molecular self-assembly is the process by which molecules adopt a defined arrangement without guidance or management from an outside source. There are two types of self-assembly : intermolecular and intramolecular . Commonly, the term molecular self-assembly refers to the former, while the latter is more commonly called folding .

Supramolecular systems [ edit ] Molecular self-assembly is a key concept in supramolecular chemistry .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] This is because assembly of molecules in such systems is directed through non-covalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding , metal coordination, hydrophobic forces , van der Waals forces , pi-stacking interactions , and/or electrostatic) as well as electromagnetic interactions. Common examples include the formation of colloids , biomolecular condensates , micelles , vesicles , liquid crystal phases, and Langmuir monolayers by surfactant molecules.

[ 9 ] Further examples of supramolecular assemblies demonstrate that a variety of different shapes and sizes can be obtained using molecular self-assembly.

[ 10 ] Molecular self-assembly allows the construction of challenging molecular topologies . One example is Borromean rings , interlocking rings wherein removal of one ring unlocks each of the other rings. DNA has been used to prepare a molecular analog of Borromean rings .

[ 11 ] More recently, a similar structure has been prepared using non-biological building blocks.

[ 12 ] Biological systems [ edit ] Molecular self-assembly underlies the construction of biologic macromolecular assemblies and biomolecular condensates in living organisms, and so is crucial to the function of cells . It is exhibited in the self-assembly of lipids to form the membrane , the formation of double helical DNA through hydrogen bonding of the individual strands, and the assembly of proteins to form quaternary structures . Molecular self-assembly of incorrectly folded proteins into insoluble amyloid fibers is responsible for infectious prion -related neurodegenerative diseases. Molecular self-assembly of nanoscale structures plays a role in the growth of the remarkable β-keratin lamellae / setae / spatulae structures used to give geckos the ability to climb walls and adhere to ceilings and rock overhangs .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Protein multimers [ edit ] When multiple copies of a polypeptide encoded by a gene self-assemble to form a complex, this protein structure is referred to as a "multimer".

[ 15 ] Genes that encode multimer-forming polypeptides appear to be common.  When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different mutant alleles of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone.  In such a case, the phenomenon is referred to as intragenic complementation .

[ 16 ] Jehle pointed out that, when immersed in a liquid and intermingled with other molecules, charge fluctuation forces favor the association of identical molecules as nearest neighbors.

[ 17 ] Nanotechnology [ edit ] Molecular self-assembly is an important aspect of bottom-up approaches to nanotechnology . Using molecular self-assembly, the final (desired) structure is programmed in the shape and functional groups of the molecules. Self-assembly is referred to as a 'bottom-up' manufacturing technique in contrast to a 'top-down' technique such as lithography where the desired final structure is carved from a larger block of matter. In the speculative vision of molecular nanotechnology , microchips of the future might be made by molecular self-assembly. An advantage to constructing nanostructure using molecular self-assembly for biological materials is that they will degrade back into individual molecules that can be broken down by the body.

DNA nanotechnology [ edit ] Main article: DNA nanotechnology DNA nanotechnology is an area of current research that uses the bottom-up, self-assembly approach for nanotechnological goals. DNA nanotechnology uses the unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties.

[ 18 ] DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information, to make structures such as complex 2D and 3D lattices (both tile-based as well as using the " DNA origami " method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra .

[ 19 ] These DNA structures have also been used as templates in the assembly of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles [ 20 ] and streptavidin proteins.

[ 21 ] Two-dimensional monolayers [ edit ] Main article: Monolayer The spontaneous assembly of a single layer of molecules at interfaces is usually referred to as two-dimensional self-assembly. One of the common examples of such assemblies are Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers and multilayers of surfactants. Non-surface active molecules can assemble into ordered structures as well. Early direct proofs showing that non-surface active molecules can assemble into higher-order architectures at solid interfaces came with the development of scanning tunneling microscopy and shortly thereafter.

[ 22 ] Eventually two strategies became popular for the self-assembly of 2D architectures, namely self-assembly following ultra-high-vacuum deposition and annealing and self-assembly at the solid-liquid interface.

[ 23 ] The design of molecules and conditions leading to the formation of highly-crystalline architectures is considered today a form of 2D crystal engineering at the nanoscopic scale .

Gecko "feet and toes are a hierarchical system of complex structures consisting of lamellae, setae, and spatulae. The distinguishing characteristics of the gecko adhesion system have been described [as] (1) anisotropic attachment, (2) high pulloff force to preload ratio, (3) low detachment force, (4) material independence, (5) self-cleaning, (6) anti-self sticking and (7) non-sticky default state. ... The gecko's adhesive structures are made from ß-keratin (modulus of elasticity [approx.] 2 GPa). Such a stiff material is not inherently sticky; however, because of the gecko adhesive's hierarchical nature and extremely small distal features (spatulae are [approx.] 200 nm in size), the gecko's foot is able to intimately conform to the surface and generate significant attraction using van der Waals forces .
