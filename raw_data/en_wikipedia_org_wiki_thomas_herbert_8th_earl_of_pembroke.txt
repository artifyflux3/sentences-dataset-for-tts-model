1656 – 22 January 1733), styled The Honourable Thomas Herbert until 1683, was a British statesman who served as Lord Privy Seal from 1692 to 1699.

Background [ edit ] Herbert was the third son of Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke and his wife Catharine Villiers, daughter of Sir William Villiers, 1st Baronet who was the half-brother of the 1st Duke of Buckingham, George Villiers . Through his grandmother, Susan de Vere , he was a great-grandson of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford , the Oxfordians' William Shakespeare . He was educated at Tonbridge School , Kent. Both of his brothers (the 6th Earl and the 7th Earl ) having died without a male heir, he succeeded to the earldoms in 1683. Through them, he would inherit the family seat of the Earls of Pembroke , Wilton House in Wiltshire.

Wilton House, Family seat of the Earls of Pembroke Public life [ edit ] Herbert was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Wilton at the two general elections of 1679 and the general election of 1681. He was no longer able to sit in the House of Commons after assuming the peerage in 1683.

[ 1 ] As Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire , Pembroke commanded the Wiltshire Militia against the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685. They mustered at Salisbury on 17 June and marched to Bath . Hearing that Frome had declared for the Duke of Monmouth , Pembroke  marched out with a squadron of Militia Horse carrying some musketeers behind their saddles. On arrival he found a large number of rebel recruits, some armed with pistols or pikes, others with scythes and clubs. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Pembroke entered the town at the head of his musketeers, followed by the horse. A shot was fired at him, but the rebels soon broke and ran before the advancing militia, who then captured the bridge after some fighting. Afterwards Pembroke with his Wiltshire Militia and some Hampshire Militia blocked Monmouth's advance into Wiltshire. The Wiltshire Militia then accompanied the Royal army to Bridgwater in pursuit of the rebels. When Monmouth attempted  a night attack on the Royal army camped on Sedgemoor , Pembroke quickly rode from his quarters at Weston Court in Westonzoyland and roused his men; they formed the reserve during the Battle of Sedgemoor . Afterwards they took part in the pursuit and clearing-up operations.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] From 1690 to 1692 as Lord Pembroke, he was First Lord of the Admiralty . He then served as Lord Privy Seal until 1699, being in 1697 the first plenipotentiary of Great Britain at the congress of Ryswick . On two occasions he was Lord High Admiral for a short period; he was also Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland , while he acted as one of the Lords Justices seven times; and he was President of the Royal Society in 1689–1690.

[ 5 ] He is the dedicatee of John Locke 's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Thomas Greenhill 's The Art of Embalming .
