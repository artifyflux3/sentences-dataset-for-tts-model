This is a circle that is tangent to each of the polygon's sides. The dual polygon of a tangential polygon is a cyclic polygon , which has a circumscribed circle passing through each of its vertices .

All triangles are tangential, as are all regular polygons with any number of sides. A well-studied group of tangential polygons are the tangential quadrilaterals , which include the rhombi and kites .

Characterizations [ edit ] A convex polygon has an incircle if and only if all of its internal angle bisectors are concurrent . This common point is the incenter (the center of the incircle).

[ 1 ] There exists a tangential polygon of n sequential sides a 1 , ..., a n if and only if the system of equations x 1 + x 2 = a 1 , x 2 + x 3 = a 2 , … … , x n + x 1 = a n {\displaystyle x_{1}+x_{2}=a_{1},\quad x_{2}+x_{3}=a_{2},\quad \ldots ,\quad x_{n}+x_{1}=a_{n}} has a solution ( x 1 , ..., x n ) in positive reals .

[ 2 ] If such a solution exists, then x 1 , ..., x n are the tangent lengths of the polygon (the lengths from the vertices to the points where the incircle is tangent to the sides).

Uniqueness and non-uniqueness [ edit ] If the number of sides n is odd, then for any given set of sidelengths a 1 , … … , a n {\displaystyle a_{1},\dots ,a_{n}} satisfying the existence criterion above there is only one tangential polygon. But if n is even there are an infinitude of them.

[ 3 ] : p. 389 For example, in the quadrilateral case where all sides are equal we can have a rhombus with any value of the acute angles, and all rhombi are tangential to an incircle.

Inradius [ edit ] If the n sides of a tangential polygon are a 1 , ..., a n , the inradius ( radius of the incircle) is [ 4 ] r = K s = 2 K ∑ ∑ i = 1 n a i {\displaystyle r={\frac {K}{s}}={\frac {2K}{\sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}}}} where K is the area of the polygon and s is the semiperimeter . (Since all triangles are tangential, this formula applies to all triangles.) Other properties [ edit ] For a tangential polygon with an odd number of sides, all sides are equal if and only if all angles are equal (so the polygon is regular). A tangential polygon with an even number of sides has all sides equal if and only if the alternate angles are equal (that is, angles A , C , E , ... are equal, and angles B , D , F , ... are equal).

[ 5 ] In a tangential polygon with an even number of sides, the sum of the odd numbered sides' lengths is equal to the sum of the even numbered sides' lengths.

[ 2 ] A tangential polygon has a larger area than any other polygon with the same perimeter and the same interior angles in the same sequence.

[ 6 ] : p. 862 [ 7 ] The centroid of any tangential polygon, the centroid of its boundary points, and the center of the inscribed circle are collinear , with the polygon's centroid between the others and twice as far from the incenter as from the boundary's centroid.

[ 6 ] : pp. 858–9 Tangential triangle [ edit ] While all triangles are tangential to some circle, a triangle is called the tangential triangle of a reference triangle if the tangencies of the tangential triangle with the circle are also the vertices of the reference triangle.

Tangential quadrilateral [ edit ] Main article: Tangential quadrilateral Tangential hexagon [ edit ] Concurrent main diagonals In a tangential hexagon ABCDEF , the main diagonals AD , BE , and CF are concurrent according to Brianchon's theorem .
