It is not certain when he lived; he may have lived any time between the 2nd century BC and the 2nd century AD. He wrote on mechanics , astronomy , and geometry .

Proclus quotes from an Astronomical Treatise by Carpus concerning whether problems should come before theorems, in which Carpus may (or may not) have been criticising Geminus .

[ 1 ] Proclus also quotes the view of Carpus that "an angle is a quantity, namely a distance between the lines of surfaces containing it." [ 2 ] According to Pappus , Carpus made use of mathematics for practical applications.

[ 3 ] According to Iamblichus , Carpus also constructed a curve for the purpose of squaring the circle , which he calls a curve generated by a double motion.
