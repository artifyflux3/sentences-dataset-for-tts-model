Scientific career Thesis The theory of London - van der Waals forces and certain features of the equation of state of gases (1963) Jagdish Mehra (April 8, 1931 – September 14, 2008) was an Indian–American physicist and historian of science.

Academic career [ edit ] Mehra was educated at Allahabad University , the Max Planck Institut für Physik and the University of California at Los Angeles and obtained a Ph.D. in theoretical physics at the University of Neuchatel .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He subsequently taught at Purdue University , Southeastern Massachusetts University , the University of Geneva , the Solvay Institute in Brussels, Rice University , the University of Houston and the International Center for Theoretical Physics .

He is particularly well known for his 6 volume-book The Historical Development of Quantum Theory , [ 3 ] which he wrote with Helmut Rechenberg . He also wrote a biography of Richard Feynman , The Beat of a Different Drum: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman .

He also wrote a book on the controversy surrounding the exact role David Hilbert played in the development of the gravitation theory of Albert Einstein .
