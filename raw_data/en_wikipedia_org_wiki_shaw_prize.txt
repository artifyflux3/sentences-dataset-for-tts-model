Schmidt (from left to right) jointly won the 2006 astronomy prize The Shaw Prize is a set of three annual awards presented by the Shaw Prize Foundation in the fields of astronomy , medicine and life sciences , and mathematical sciences . Established in 2002 in Hong Kong , [ 1 ] by Hong Kong entertainment mogul and philanthropist Run Run Shaw (邵逸夫), [ 2 ] the awards honour "individuals who are currently active in their respective fields and who have recently achieved distinguished and significant advances, who have made outstanding contributions in academic and scientific research or applications, or who in other domains have achieved excellence." [ 3 ] The prize has been described as the "Nobel of the East".

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Award [ edit ] The prize consists of three awards in the fields of astronomy , life science and medicine , and mathematical sciences ; it is not awarded posthumously. Nominations are submitted by invited individuals beginning each year in September. Winners are announced in the summer and receive the award at a ceremony in early autumn. Each award consists of a gold medal, a certificate and USD $1.2 million (US$1 million before 2015). The front of the medal bears a portrait of Shaw and the name of the prize in English and Traditional Chinese characters ; the back bears the year, category, laureate's name and a quotation from the Chinese philosopher Xunzi "制天命而用之" (translated to English as "Grasp the law of nature and make use of it").
