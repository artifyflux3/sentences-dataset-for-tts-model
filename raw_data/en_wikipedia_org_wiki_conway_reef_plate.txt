[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Map of the Conway Reef plate (as "Récif Conway") and its neighbouring plates (in French ) The Conway Reef plate is a small tectonic plate ( microplate ) located in the south Pacific west of Fiji .

[ 4 ] The western boundary is with the New Hebrides plate while the eastern is with the Australian plate . A short transform boundary also exists with the Balmoral Reef plate . Much of the plate underlies the south central portion of the North Fiji Basin .

Within the North Fiji Basin it lies between the spreading centers of the Central Spreading Ridge on the west and the West Fiji Ridge on the east.

[ 4 ] The plate is rotating counterclockwise with respect to all of its neighbours.

[ 4 ] The plate's existence was first modelled in 2003 by Bird.

[ 4 ] Its boundaries and angular momentum were further defined in 2011 and 2018 with refinement of tectonic plate deformation and strain rate.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The region is complex and may well have several other microplates or blocks .
