[ 13 ] [ 4 ] Later, he was a research fellow at the Discovery Institute , a Christian think tank known for its opposition to the theory of evolution and advocacy for intelligent design to be taught in public schools.

[ 4 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] He was a documentary filmmaker in his twenties and early thirties, with overseas projects such as Roughing It: Mongolia , and a film about baseball in Xinjiang called Diamond in the Dunes .

[ 5 ] In 2017, Rufo was one of 30 plaintiffs in a lawsuit that successfully prevented Seattle from imposing a 2.25% income tax on sums above $250,000 a year for individuals and over $500,000 for couples.

[ 16 ] In 2018, he briefly attempted a run for the city council.

[ 17 ] In 2021, Rufo spoke at the National Conservatism Conference in Orlando.

[ 18 ] In April 2022, Rufo was reported to have 2,500 paid subscribers to his newsletter.

[ 19 ] The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has described Rufo as a "far-right propagandist".

[ 20 ] Rufo was one of several conservative education activists appointed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to the board of trustees of New College of Florida in January 2023.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Rufo has argued in favor of establishing a "bridge" between the " dissident right and the establishment right".

[ 23 ] Critical race theory See also: 2020s controversies around critical race theory and Critical race theory § United States Rufo's views on race and poverty became more conservative while directing America Lost , a 2019 documentary coproduced by PBS and WNET for the series "Chasing the Dream: Poverty and Opportunity in America".

[ 24 ] [ 5 ] From 2016 through 2019, Rufo's investigation into poverty in  cities that had declined dramatically following periods of prosperity— Youngstown, Ohio ; Memphis, Tennessee ; and Stockton, California —left him with the view that poverty stemmed from "social, familial, even psychological [dynamics]" and could not be solved by public policy.

[ 5 ] [ 25 ] Rufo said that the 2016 United States presidential election challenged ineffective establishment responses to poverty and drew attention to these cities.

[ 25 ] In his 2018 Discovery Institute -funded policy paper "Seattle Under Siege: How Seattle's Homelessness Policy Perpetuates the Crisis and How We Can Fix It," Rufo wrote that four groups—"socialist intellectuals", "compassion brigades", the "homeless-industrial complex", and the "addiction evangelists"—had successfully framed the debate on homelessness and diverted funding to their projects, [ 26 ] [ 27 ] with the "compassion brigade" calling for social justice using terms such as "compassion, empathy, bias, inequality, root causes, systemic racism ." [ 27 ] Rufo has opposed what he calls critical race theory in governmental and other publicly funded institutions, and has characterized it as a kind of "cult indoctrination".

[ 7 ] [ 28 ] Rufo contended in 2020 that "critical race theory has pervaded every institution in the federal government".

[ 14 ] Critical race theory considers the idea that racism is systemic, in that laws, policies, regulations, and even court decisions create and continue historical racial prejudices in the United States.

[ 29 ] Rufo described his strategy to oppose critical race theory as intentionally using the term to conflate various race-related ideas in order to create a negative association.

[ 7 ] Rufo said that "[w]e will eventually turn [critical race theory] toxic, as we put all of the 'various cultural insanities' under that brand category. The goal is to have the public read something 'crazy' in the newspaper and immediately think 'critical race theory'." [ 30 ] Rufo has described intersectionality as "a hard left academic theory that reduces people to a network of racial , gender and sexual orientation identities and intersect in complex ways and determine whether you are an oppressor or oppressed".

[ 7 ] Kimberlé Crenshaw , an influential figure in critical race theory, has said that what Rufo and Republicans "are calling critical race theory is a whole range of things, most of which no one would sign on to, and many of the things in it are simply about racism".

[ 5 ] Through interviews with Tucker Carlson on Fox News , Rufo reportedly influenced the Trump administration to issue an executive order in 2020 to prohibit federal agencies from having diversity training that addressed topics such as systemic racism , white privilege and critical race theory.

[ 5 ] [ 1 ] [ 31 ] The administration described such programs as "divisive, anti-American propaganda".

[ 31 ] The ban was revoked by President Joe Biden on his first day in office.

[ 1 ] [ 31 ] Divisions continued at the state level, with Republican legislators putting forward bans on critical race theory.

[ 32 ] Rufo has appeared multiple times on Tucker Carlson Tonight and The Ingraham Angle .

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] According to New Yorker writer Benjamin Wallace-Wells, Rufo's story on racially divided bias-training sessions in Seattle was a "phenomenon" that "helped to generate more leaks from across the country" about the contents of courses and diversity training programs.

[ 5 ] According to The Washington Post , Snopes and New York , Rufo has misrepresented contents of diversity training programs and course curricula.

[ 7 ] [ 36 ] [ 4 ] For example, he falsely claimed that a diversity consultant hired by the U.S. Treasury Department had "told employees essentially that America was a fundamentally white supremacist country", and urged them to "accept their white racial superiority"; however, the diversity consultant had said no such thing.

[ 7 ] [ 4 ] Rufo told Fox News that The Washington Post subsequently issued multiple corrections to its reporting on him, including retracting a statement that a diversity seminar in Cupertino, California, referenced by Rufo did not occur.

[ 37 ] The article itself lists as "clarifications" that "[t]his report has been changed to clarify the sequence of events that followed Rufo’s appearance on Fox News last summer. In addition, the story adds a clarification from the Cupertino superintendent that a lesson was presented once before it was canceled." [ 7 ] New York magazine has also alleged that Rufo misrepresented the contents of internal documents from the Tigard-Tualatin School District in Oregon, which referenced Paulo Freire 's Pedagogy of the Oppressed . In Rufo's view, the documents incited revolutionary sentiments and assumed that white people were born racist, which he called "textbook cult indoctrination". The school district stated that the documents had not been used in formal settings, that Rufo had misquoted the references to Freire, and that he had misconstrued a reference to teachers moving beyond the "belief that you aren't racist if you don't purposely or consciously act in racist ways".

[ 4 ] LGBTQ issues and schools See also: LGBT grooming conspiracy theory Rufo has been a prominent advocate for bans on teachers discussing LGBTQ issues in classrooms. He supported Florida House Bill 1557 (The Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, more commonly known as the "Don’t Say Gay" bill), [ 19 ] which prohibits teachers from discussing such matters in kindergarten through the third grade. Rufo appeared alongside Florida Governor Ron DeSantis when he signed a bill retaliating against Disney after the company criticized the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act.

[ 19 ] Rufo linked LGBTQ discussions at schools to grooming , the act of connecting with children for the purpose of sexually abusing them.

[ 19 ] [ 38 ] He said that schools were "hunting grounds" for sexually predatory teachers and that parents had "good reason" to worry about grooming.

[ 19 ] Citing a study by Charol Shakeshaft , Rufo has claimed that public school teachers are responsible for 100 times more child sexual abuse than Catholic priests. Shakeshaft termed this a misuse of her data, calling it "completely invalid".

[ 38 ] After Disney criticized the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, Rufo suggested that Disney was involved in sexualizing children and that the company was rife with child sexual abuse.

[ 19 ] According to New York Times writer Trip Gabriel , "critics of Mr. Rufo, and of the broader right-wing push on LGBTQ issues, say the attacks represent a new era of moral panic , one with echoes of slanders from decades ago that gay teachers were a threat to children." [ 19 ] Writing for Salon , education journalist and political science lecturer Kathryn Joyce has argued that Rufo's claims about public school teachers and pedophilia are part of his goal to "generally foster so much anger against public schools that it drives a nationwide popular movement to privatize education".

[ 39 ] Similarly, president of the American Federation of Teachers Randi Weingarten has claimed that Rufo and others who wish to privatize "public education are using Big Lies to undermine public schools." [ 40 ] Rufo has said that "[t]o get to universal school choice , you really need to operate from a premise of universal public school distrust." [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Rufo opposes " socio-emotional learning ", saying that it "serves as a delivery mechanism for radical pedagogies such as critical race theory and gender deconstructionism." Socio-emotional learning, which promotes self-awareness, self-management, responsible decision-making, social awareness and relationship building, was a fairly uncontroversial pedagogical technique before it received criticism from Republicans and Rufo.

[ 42 ] Claudine Gay campaign In December 2023, Rufo and co-author Christopher Brunet investigated the past research of Harvard University president Claudine Gay , who had recently attracted controversy over her handling of antisemitism at the university and her defense of the university's handling of the situation at a congressional hearing . Rufo and Brunet alleged that many of her articles, including her dissertation, were plagiarized .

[ 43 ] Following further investigations of the plagiarism allegations in mainstream media outlets, Gay announced her resignation on January 2, 2024.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] In an interview with Politico , Rufo stated that Gay's resignation "was the result of a coordinated and highly organized conservative campaign." [ 44 ] Hoax reward offered In September 2024, during an incident related to the Springfield, Ohio, cat-eating hoax , Rufo alleged that African migrants were eating cats in Dayton, Ohio , based on an August 2023 video of skinned animals being grilled, which drew social media responses that the skinned animals resembled chickens. Dayton police responded that "there is no evidence to even remotely suggest that any group, including our immigrant community, is engaged in eating pets", while the Dayton mayor reported "absolutely zero reports of this type of activity".

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] Rufo has offered a $5,000 reward for proof supporting the unsubstantiated allegation.

[ 48 ] Personal life Rufo is married to Suphatra "Kip" Paravichai, a Thai American who entered the United States illegally [ 49 ] . She was once a computer programmer at Amazon Web Services .

[ 5 ] As of 2021 [update] , they live in Gig Harbor, Washington , with their three sons.

[ 17 ] [ 50 ] He is Catholic .
