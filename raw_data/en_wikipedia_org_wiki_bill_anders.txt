**William Alison Anders** (17 October 1933 – 7 June 2024) was an American [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force") (USAF) [major general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States) "Major general (United States)"), [electrical engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineer "Electrical engineer"), [nuclear engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineer "Nuclear engineer"), [NASA astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Astronaut_Corps "NASA Astronaut Corps"), and [businessman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Businessperson "Businessperson"). In December 1968, he was a member of the crew of [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8 "Apollo 8"), the first three people to leave [low-Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-Earth_orbit "Low-Earth orbit") and travel to the Moon. Along with fellow astronauts [Frank Borman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Borman "Frank Borman") and [Jim Lovell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lovell "Jim Lovell"), he circled the Moon ten times, and broadcast live images and commentary back to Earth, including the [Christmas Eve Genesis reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8_Genesis_reading "Apollo 8 Genesis reading"). During one of the mission's lunar orbits, he took the iconic _[Earthrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise "Earthrise")_ photograph.

A 1955 graduate of the [United States Naval Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy "United States Naval Academy"), Anders was commissioned a [second lieutenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_lieutenant "Second lieutenant") in the USAF the same year and became a [fighter pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot "Fighter pilot") flying [Northrop F-89 Scorpions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_F-89_Scorpion "Northrop F-89 Scorpion") equipped with [AIR-2A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIR-2_Genie "AIR-2 Genie") nuclear-tipped air-to-air rockets. In 1962, he earned a [Master of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science "Master of Science") degree in [nuclear engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering "Nuclear engineering") at the [Air Force Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Institute_of_Technology "Air Force Institute of Technology") (AFIT) of [Air University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_University_(United_States_Air_Force) "Air University (United States Air Force)"), and was sent to the [Air Force Weapons Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Weapons_Laboratory "Air Force Weapons Laboratory") to manage the technical aspects of the service's [nuclear reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor "Nuclear reactor") programs.

Anders was the executive secretary of the [National Aeronautics and Space Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Council "National Aeronautics and Space Council") from 1969 to 1973, a commissioner of the [United States Atomic Energy Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission "United States Atomic Energy Commission") from 1973 to 1975, and chairman of the [Nuclear Regulatory Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission "Nuclear Regulatory Commission") from 1975 to 1976. He then became the [United States Ambassador to Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_Norway "List of ambassadors of the United States to Norway") from 1976 to 1977. In September 1977, he joined [General Electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric "General Electric") (GE) as the vice president and general manager of its Nuclear Products Division and became the general manager of the GE Aircraft Equipment Division in 1980. He left GE to join [Textron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textron "Textron") as executive vice president for aerospace, and two years later became senior executive vice president for operations. During his time in the Civil Service, he remained a USAF reserve officer and retained his active flight status. He retired from the reserve as a major general in 1988. In 1990, he became vice chairman of [General Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics "General Dynamics"), and in 1991 its chairman and CEO. He retired as CEO in 1993 and as chairman in 1994.

Anders died in a crash of his [Beechcraft T-34 Mentor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_T-34_Mentor "Beechcraft T-34 Mentor") in June 2024 near the [San Juan Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_Islands "San Juan Islands").

William Alison Anders was born in Hong Kong on 17 October 1933, the son of Arthur Ferdinand Anders (1903–2000), a [United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy") lieutenant, and his wife, Muriel A. Anders ([née](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_name#Maiden_and_married_names "Birth name")Adams; 1911–1990). The family moved from Hong Kong to [Annapolis, Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland "Annapolis, Maryland"), where his father taught mathematics at the [U.S. Naval Postgraduate School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Postgraduate_School "Naval Postgraduate School"). After Annapolis, Anders' father received orders to billet in [Nanjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing "Nanjing"), China. After the family moved there, the [Second Sino-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War "Second Sino-Japanese War") erupted in 1937, followed by Japan invading China. In December of that year, his father was serving as the executive officer of the [river gunboat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_gunboat "River gunboat")[USS _Panay_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Panay_(PR-5) "USS Panay (PR-5)") when he was wounded as the ship was [attacked and sunk by Japanese bombers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Panay_incident "USS Panay incident"). As the Japanese began to advance toward Nanjing, Anders and his mother fled by taking a train to [Guangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou "Guangzhou").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-Arthur_F._Anders-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2)

From the porch of the Guangzhou hotel in which they stayed, they could see Japanese aircraft bombing ships on the [Pearl River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River "Pearl River") 200 yards (180 m) away. This was ominous since the river was their only means of escape. In addition to the threat of Japanese aircraft, the river was [mined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_mine "Naval mine") and there was the danger of being boarded by bandits. Foreigners were allocated special areas on the boat and separated from Chinese people by barbed wire. They eventually reached the Philippines, where they awaited news of his father. Arthur Anders was rescued by the British and sent to [San Diego Naval Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Medical_Center_San_Diego "Naval Medical Center San Diego") to recover from his wounds and a [staphylococcal infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcal_infection "Staphylococcal infection"). He was awarded the [Purple Heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Heart "Purple Heart") and the [Navy Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Cross "Navy Cross") but was discharged from the Navy owing to his wounds. He was recalled to active duty during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-Arthur_F._Anders-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2)

The family returned to the United States, where Anders was active in the [Boy Scouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America "Boy Scouts of America"), achieving the organization's second-highest rank, [Life Scout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Scout "Life Scout").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-4) As a teen, Anders attended St Martin's Academy and [Grossmont High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grossmont_High_School "Grossmont High School") in [El Cajon, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cajon,_California "El Cajon, California").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewland2010109-5) To improve his grades so that he could be accepted at the [United States Naval Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy "United States Naval Academy") in [Annapolis, Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland "Annapolis, Maryland"), Anders was sent to the Boyden School, a military academy prep school in downtown [San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego "San Diego").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-7) He commuted to Boyden by bus from [La Mesa, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Mesa,_California "La Mesa, California"). The school lay under the flight path into [Lindbergh Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_International_Airport "San Diego International Airport") and aircraft such as the huge [Convair B-36 Peacemaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair_B-36_Peacemaker "Convair B-36 Peacemaker") would fly low over the school. He was fascinated with flight and built model aircraft. He graduated from Boyden in 1951.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2)

Anders received an appointment to Annapolis, following in the footsteps of his father, who had graduated in the Class of 1927. Part of the course was orientation cruises during which midshipmen could experience life at sea. A cruise aboard an aircraft carrier convinced him that he did not want to become a [naval aviator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_aviator "Naval aviator"), for there were too many fatal accidents. He graduated in 1955 with a [Bachelor of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science "Bachelor of Science") degree in [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"), and was commissioned a [second lieutenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_lieutenant "Second lieutenant") in the [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force") (USAF).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-usaf-8)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-10)

While at Annapolis, he had met Valerie Elizabeth Hoard on a blind date. [Midshipmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midshipman "Midshipman") were not allowed to marry, but they were married soon after he graduated.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2) They would have six children: Alan (born in 1957), Glen (1958), Gayle (1960), Gregory (1962), Eric (1964) and Diana (1972).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-11)

After graduation, Anders reported for flight training, which was conducted in the piston-engine [Beechcraft T-34 Mentor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_T-34_Mentor "Beechcraft T-34 Mentor") and [North American T-28 Trojan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_T-28_Trojan "North American T-28 Trojan") and then in the jet [Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_T-33_Shooting_Star "Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star"). After receiving his [pilot wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Air_Force_aeronautical_rating "U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating") in 1956 he became a [fighter pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot "Fighter pilot") with the [84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/84th_Fighter-Interceptor_Squadron "84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron"), an all-weather interceptor squadron of the [Air Defense Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Defense_Command "Air Defense Command") based at [Hamilton Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Air_Force_Base "Hamilton Air Force Base") in California, flying [Northrop F-89 Scorpions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_F-89_Scorpion "Northrop F-89 Scorpion") equipped with [MB-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MB-1 "MB-1") nuclear-tipped air-to-air rockets. He then served with the [57th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/57th_Fighter-Interceptor_Squadron "57th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron") in Iceland, where he participated in intercepts of Soviet heavy bombers, which were challenging America's air defense borders. After a year he returned to the 84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Hamilton, which was now flying the [McDonnell F-101 Voodoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_F-101_Voodoo "McDonnell F-101 Voodoo").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-usaf-8)

Anders set his sights on becoming a [test pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot "Test pilot"). He spoke to [Chuck Yeager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Yeager "Chuck Yeager"), who recommended that he first obtain an [advanced degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_degree "Advanced degree"). Anders submitted an application to the [Air Force Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Institute_of_Technology "Air Force Institute of Technology") (AFIT) at [Wright-Patterson Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright-Patterson_Air_Force_Base "Wright-Patterson Air Force Base") in [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio "Ohio"), hoping to study [aeronautical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical_engineering "Aeronautical engineering"), but the [Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Nuclear_Propulsion "Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion") program was ongoing, and the AFIT had him study [nuclear engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering "Nuclear engineering") instead. While there he took a course in aeronautical engineering at [Ohio State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University "Ohio State University"). He graduated from the AFIT with a [Master of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science "Master of Science") degree in nuclear engineering in 1962. By that time, the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program had been canceled, so he was assigned to the [Air Force Weapons Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Weapons_Laboratory "Air Force Weapons Laboratory") at [Kirtland Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtland_Air_Force_Base "Kirtland Air Force Base") in [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico"), where he was responsible for the technical management of [nuclear reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_reactor "Nuclear power reactor") programs.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-usaf-8)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-nasabio-12)

### Selection and training

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Anders&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Selection and training")]

Anders (right) with fellow Apollo 8 crewmates [Jim Lovell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lovell "Jim Lovell") (center) and [Frank Borman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Borman "Frank Borman") (left)

Anders then applied to the USAF [Aerospace Research Pilots School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_Research_Pilots_School "Aerospace Research Pilots School") (ARPS) for test pilot training,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2) but on 5 June 1963, the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Administration "National Aeronautics and Space Administration") (NASA) announced that it would be recruiting ten to fifteen new [astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronauts "Astronauts") for [Project Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini "Project Gemini") and [Project Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Apollo "Project Apollo"),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorseBays197361-13) and Anders decided to apply for that too. In two previous astronaut selections, applicants had to be test pilots, but this time it was preferred but not required, making Anders eligible. He was one of the 34 finalists chosen for interviews, and on his birthday, 17 October 1963, he was informed by [Mercury Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Seven "Mercury Seven") astronaut [Deke Slayton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deke_Slayton "Deke Slayton") that he had been accepted as a member of the [third group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Astronaut_Group_3 "NASA Astronaut Group 3") of NASA astronauts. Three days later, Yeager informed him that he had failed to make the cut for the ARPS but recommended that he apply again the following year.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-roundup-14)

While at NASA, he became involved in [dosimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimetry "Dosimetry"), radiation effects, and environmental controls.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-nasabio-12) In September 1966, he was the backup pilot for the [Gemini 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_11 "Gemini 11") mission, with [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong "Neil Armstrong") as the backup commander. This would have put him in line to fly a Gemini 13 mission, but no such mission was flown; Project Gemini ended with [Gemini 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_12 "Gemini 12"). Armstrong and Anders then became the first astronauts to fly the [Lunar Landing Training Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Landing_Training_Vehicle "Lunar Landing Training Vehicle"). The astronauts in his group without test pilot training—Anders, [Roger B. Chaffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_B._Chaffee "Roger B. Chaffee"), [Walter Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cunningham "Walter Cunningham"), [Rusty Schweickart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Schweickart "Rusty Schweickart"), [Gene Cernan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Cernan "Gene Cernan"), and [Buzz Aldrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin "Buzz Aldrin")—were assigned to Apollo crews as the [Lunar Module pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_module_pilot "Lunar module pilot") (LMP), the lowest-ranking crew member.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-roundup-14)

The [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8 "Apollo 8") 1968 Christmas Eve [broadcast and reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8_Genesis_reading "Apollo 8 Genesis reading") from the [Book of Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis "Book of Genesis") while in lunar orbit

On 22 December 1966, Anders was assigned to the third Apollo mission, which was to be commanded by [Frank Borman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Borman "Frank Borman"), with [command module pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_module_pilot "Command module pilot") (CMP) [Michael Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut) "Michael Collins (astronaut)"); Neil Armstrong, [Jim Lovell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lovell "Jim Lovell") and Buzz Aldrin were assigned as their backup crew the following year.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooksGrimwoodSwenson1979374-15) Collins was replaced by Lovell in July 1968, after suffering a [cervical disc herniation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation "Spinal disc herniation") that required surgery to repair.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTECollins2001288%E2%80%93294-16) The mission, scheduled for December 1968, was intended to be a second test of the [Apollo Lunar Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module "Apollo Lunar Module") (LM) in medium Earth orbit,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooksGrimwoodSwenson1979231%E2%80%93234-17) but the delivery of the LM fell behind schedule, and when it arrived at the [Kennedy Space Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center "Kennedy Space Center") (KSC) in June 1968, more than a hundred significant defects were discovered. There was no prospect of it being ready to fly in 1968.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooksGrimwoodSwenson1979256-18) In August 1968, there were reports, including one from the [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency"), that the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") was planning a crewed circumlunar mission before the end of the year.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBormanSerling1988189-19)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-20)

Although the LM would not be ready to fly in December 1968, the [Apollo command and service module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module "Apollo command and service module") (CSM) would be, so a CSM-only mission could be flown. It could be sent to the Moon, entering lunar orbit before returning to Earth.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooksGrimwoodSwenson1979257%E2%80%93260-21) Slayton asked [James McDivitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McDivitt "James McDivitt"), the designated commander of the second mission, if he still wanted to fly it. McDivitt turned it down; his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test the LM, and that was what he still wanted to do.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooksGrimwoodSwenson1979262-22) When Borman was asked the same question, he answered "yes" without any hesitation.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBormanSerling1988189-19) Slayton then decided to swap the crews and spacecraft, so Borman, Lovell, and Anders' mission became [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8 "Apollo 8").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooksGrimwoodSwenson1979262-22)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTECollins2001296%E2%80%93298-23) Anders was less enthusiastic about being the Lunar Module pilot of a mission without a Lunar Module.

According to Borman:

> Rookie Bill Anders was thirty-five, slightly built, a devout Roman Catholic, and very serious minded. I'm not sure he ever got used to my rough sense of humor or Lovell's free-wheeling spirit. But Anders was one hell of a worker, a superb technician and all in all a great guy. Anders was always friendly and cooperative, but he avoided the usual astronaut bull sessions. Some of the guys regarded him as a younger version of Frank Borman in his single-minded concentration on work, his aversion to unnecessary conversation.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBormanSerling1988189-19)

In December 1968, Anders flew on the Apollo 8 mission, the first mission where humans traveled beyond [low-Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-Earth_orbit "Low-Earth orbit"),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-nasabio-12) and the first crewed flight to reach and orbit the Moon.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-24) When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front, the crew witnessed an "Earthrise" for the first time in human history.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-journal_day_4-456-25) NASA's [Lunar Orbiter 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_1 "Lunar Orbiter 1") had taken the first picture of an Earthrise from the vicinity of the Moon, on 23 August 1966.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-26)

Anders saw the Earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others, taking a black-and-white photograph as he did so. Anders asked Lovell for color film and then took _[Earthrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise "Earthrise")_, which was later picked by _[Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life\_(magazine) "Life (magazine)")_ magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-journal_day_4-456-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-27) Anders reflected on the lasting impact of the Earthrise photograph, noting that it gained iconic status over time and helped people realize the need to take care of our fragile planet. He remarked on the photograph's message for humanity, highlighting the contrast between our only home and the conflicts, including nuclear threats and terrorism, that we face. "It amazes me."[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-28) According to Anders:

> We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-29)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-nmspacemuseum-30)

On conservation of the planet, he said:

> If you can imagine yourself in a darkened room with only one clearly visible object, a small blue-green sphere about the size of a Christmas-tree ornament, then you can begin to grasp what the Earth looks like from space. I think that all of us subconsciously think that the Earth is flat... Let me assure you that, rather than a massive giant, it should be thought of as the fragile Christmas-tree ball which we should handle with considerable care.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTENicks197014-31)

The Apollo 8 command module splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on 27 December after a flight lasting 147 hours and 42 seconds and a voyage of 504,006 nautical miles (933,419 km). It landed just 2 nautical miles (3.7 km) from the recovery ship, the [aircraft carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier "Aircraft carrier")[USS _Yorktown_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Yorktown_(CV-10) "USS Yorktown (CV-10)").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff200040-32) Due to [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation "Time dilation"), the three astronauts had aged about 300 microseconds more than people back on Earth.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEScience_and_Technology_Division,_Library_of_Congress197071-33)

The July 1969 [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11") mission was commanded by Armstrong, with Collins as the CMP and Aldrin as the LMP. The Apollo 8 crew became its backup, but without Borman. Lovell stepped up to become the backup commander, and Anders became the backup CMP, with rookie astronaut [Fred Haise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Haise "Fred Haise") as the backup LMP.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooksGrimwoodSwenson1979374-15)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff200090-34)

Anders could see that Project Apollo was coming to a close and felt that his chances of commanding a Moon mission were slim.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogsdon201551-35) On 16 May 1969, President [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon") nominated him to become the executive secretary of the [National Aeronautics and Space Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Space_Council "National Space Council") (NASC). This was the highest government post ever offered to an astronaut up to that time.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEScience_and_Technology_Division,_Library_of_Congress1970141-36) He was confirmed by the [United States Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") on 19 June.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEScience_and_Technology_Division,_Library_of_Congress1970184-37) The Space Council consisted of the [Administrator of NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA "Administrator of NASA"), the [Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission#AEC_Chair "United States Atomic Energy Commission") (AEC), and the [Secretaries of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State "United States Secretary of State"), [Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense"), and [Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation "United States Secretary of Transportation"), and was chaired by the Vice President.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogsdon2015136-38) Due to his commitment to the Apollo 11 backup crew, Anders was unable to assume the position until August.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogsdon201551-35)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTESlaytonCassutt1994237-39)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Greg_Anders_sprays_Bill_Anders_with_the_fire_hose.jpg/250px-Greg_Anders_sprays_Bill_Anders_with_the_fire_hose.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Greg_Anders_sprays_Bill_Anders_with_the_fire_hose.jpg)

Anders sprayed with a fire hose by his son Greg at [Davis–Monthan Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis%E2%80%93Monthan_Air_Force_Base "Davis–Monthan Air Force Base") in 2008

In his new role, Anders was responsible for developing aeronautical and space policy.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-nasabio-12) He worked closely with the [Office of Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Science_Advisory_Committee "President's Science Advisory Committee") (OST) and the [Office of Management and Budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Management_and_Budget "Office of Management and Budget") (OMB) and became a personal advisor to the OMB director, [Caspar Weinberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Weinberger "Caspar Weinberger").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogsdon201551-35) Anders worked hard to bridge the gap between OMB and OST on the one hand and NASA on the other. He became increasingly pessimistic about the future of the NASC and the space program generally. He opposed the development of the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle"), urging instead that NASA concentrate on developing the [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab "Skylab") space station.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogsdon2015200-40) He argued that a small Space Shuttle would be a better option than a large one, but the large one was approved because it would involve more jobs in California.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2) Frustrated with the NASC's lack of influence, he recommended in 1972 that it be abolished.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogsdon2015200-40) This was done on 30 June 1973.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-41)

Nixon was impressed by Anders and wanted to retain him in the administration.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogsdon2015199-42) On 6 August 1973, he appointed Anders to the five-member AEC. Nixon felt that the commission was dominated by lawyers and he wanted an engineer on it. The chairman of the AEC, [Dixy Lee Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixy_Lee_Ray "Dixy Lee Ray"), appointed Anders to be the lead commissioner for nuclear and non-nuclear power [research and development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development "Research and development"). He also served as the U.S. chairman of the joint US-Soviet Union [nuclear fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission "Nuclear fission") and [fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion "Nuclear fusion") power technology exchange program.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-nasabio-12)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2) He spent much of his time dealing with the AEC's problematic research and development programs, particularly the troubled [breeder reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor "Breeder reactor") program.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGillette19751173%E2%80%931175-43)

One issue that had dogged the AEC since its inception was its dual role in both developing nuclear energy and regulating it. The perception that there was a conflict of interest between the two roles became acute with the growth of the nuclear power industry.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGillette19751173%E2%80%931175-43) On 19 January 1975, the commission was split in two, with its research and development responsibilities assumed by the [Energy Research and Development Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Research_and_Development_Administration "Energy Research and Development Administration") (ERDA), and its regulatory ones by the [Nuclear Regulatory Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission "Nuclear Regulatory Commission") (NRC). Some 1,970 former employees of the AEC joined the NRC.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBuck198318-44) President [Gerald Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford "Gerald Ford") appointed Anders as the first chairman of the NRC. He was the only one of the five AEC commissioners to transition to one of the new organizations. Anders made the decision process of the commissioners of the NRC more transparent than that of the AEC. The NRC inherited [nuclear safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_safety_and_security "Nuclear safety and security") and environmental compatibility functions from the AEC, but unlike the AEC's regulatory branch, the NRC had its own safety and security research capability, so it was not reliant on the ERDA.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGillette19751173%E2%80%931175-43)

After his term as NRC chairman, Anders was asked if he would be interested in an ambassadorship. He did not want to, but asked his wife Valerie. She expressed an interest in Norway, based on their trip there during the Apollo 8 world publicity tour. So Anders asked if Norway was available. [Lawrence Eagleburger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Eagleburger "Lawrence Eagleburger") submitted his name for the position.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2) Anders was appointed [Ambassador to Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_Norway "List of ambassadors of the United States to Norway") on 13 April 1976 and held that post until 18 June 1977.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-45)

Anders served briefly as a fellow of the [American Enterprise Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute "American Enterprise Institute"). In September 1977, he joined [General Electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric "General Electric") (GE) as its vice president and general manager of its Nuclear Products Division. Based in [San Jose, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California "San Jose, California"), Anders was responsible for the [fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel "Nuclear fuel"), equipment, and instrumentation used in its [boiling water reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor "Boiling water reactor") in San Jose and [Wilmington, North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_North_Carolina "Wilmington, North Carolina"). He also oversaw GE's partnership with [Chicago Bridge & Iron Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bridge_%26_Iron_Company "Chicago Bridge & Iron Company"), which manufactured large steel pressure vessels in [Memphis, Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee "Memphis, Tennessee"). In August 1979, GE sent him to [Harvard Business School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Business_School "Harvard Business School") to attend its six-week [Advanced Management Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Business_School#Advanced_Management_Program "Harvard Business School"). On 1 January 1980, he became the general manager of the GE Aircraft Equipment Division. From its headquarters in [Utica, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York "Utica, New York"), the division controlled more than 8,500 employees in five locations in the northeastern United States. Its products included aircraft flight and weapon control systems, cockpit instruments, aircraft electrical generating systems, airborne radars and data processing systems, electronic countermeasures, space command systems, and aircraft/surface multi-barrel armament systems.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-nasabio-12)

In 1984, Anders left GE to join [Textron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textron "Textron") as its executive vice president for aerospace. Two years later he became senior executive vice president for operations,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-nasabio-12) but Anders did not get along well with the CEO. A perk of the job was that he got to fly [Bell helicopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Textron "Bell Textron"), as Bell was a subsidiary of Textron.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2) During his time in the civil service, Anders had remained in the Air Force as a reservist and had retained his active flight status flying NASA [Northrop T-38 Talon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_T-38_Talon "Northrop T-38 Talon") aircraft and helicopters, retiring from the reserves as a [major general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States) "Major general (United States)") in 1988. He was also a consultant to the U.S. [Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Science_and_Technology_Policy "Office of Science and Technology Policy"), and a member of the [Defense Science Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Science_Board "Defense Science Board") and the [NASA Advisory Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA#NASA_Advisory_Council "NASA").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-usaf-8)

### General Dynamics board

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Anders&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: General Dynamics board")]

Anders became vice chairman of [General Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics "General Dynamics") in January 1990, and on 1 January 1991, its chairman and CEO.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-GD_CEO-46) Soon after he took over as CEO, the company lost $700 million (equivalent to $1.6 billion in 2024) in write-offs over the canceled [A-12 Avenger II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_A-12_Avenger_II "McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II") program.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-Anders_&_A-12-47) The January 1991 cancelation directly caused about 3,500 employees to be laid-off at the [Fort Worth, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas "Fort Worth, Texas") plant that built the A-12.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-Fort_Worth_Layoffs-48) On 19 June 1991, Anders announced that General Dynamics was moving its corporate headquarters from [St. Louis, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri "St. Louis, Missouri"), to [Falls Church, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Church,_Virginia "Falls Church, Virginia"), to be closer to its military customers at [The Pentagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon "The Pentagon").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-Anders_Announces_HQ_Move-49) The move started on 20 December 1991, with 110 of the 275 headquarters employees moving to the [Washington Beltway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Beltway "Capital Beltway") location, and 50 remaining in the accounting office in St. Louis, leaving 115 unemployed.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-HQ_Dec_Move-50)

When Anders took over, General Dynamics was in financial trouble.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-GD_Big_Losses-51) The quarter before he became chairman and CEO was the worst in the company's history, losing $858 million (equivalent to $2 billion in 2024) between October and December 1990.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-GD's_worst_Quarter-52) Anders sold off assets worth nearly $3 billion (equivalent to $6.7 billion in 2024), including the missile-systems business and the subsidiary of [Cessna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna "Cessna"). On 9 December 1992, he sold the military aircraft division, which made the [F-16 jet fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"), to the [Lockheed Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation "Lockheed Corporation") for $1.5 billion (equivalent to $3.4 billion in 2024).[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-Selloff_to_Lockheed-53) These selloffs reduced the number of employees from 98,600 to around 35,000, and the company's debt from $430 million (equivalent to $900 million in 2024) to $183 million (equivalent to $400 million in 2024). GD shareholders received $600 million in dividends. Although annual sales dropped from $10 to $3.5 billion, the value of the company's share price quadrupled. Anders earned over $40 million.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-54)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-55) He retired as CEO in 1993,[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-Steps_down_as_CEO-56) and as chairman on 4 May 1994.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-Steps_down_as_Chairman-57)

Retirement and death
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Anders&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Retirement and death")]

After retirement, Anders and his wife purchased a house in [Anacortes, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacortes,_Washington "Anacortes, Washington"), overlooking [Puget Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound "Puget Sound") and [Burrows Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows_Island_Light "Burrows Island Light"). After realizing he disliked the winters in northwest Washington, he purchased a second home in [Point Loma, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Loma,_California "Point Loma, California").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2)

Anders established the William A. Anders Foundation, a philanthropic organization for the benefit of educational and environmental issues.

In 1996, he founded the [Heritage Flight Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Flight_Museum "Heritage Flight Museum") in [Bellingham, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington "Bellingham, Washington"); it moved to [Skagit Regional Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skagit_Regional_Airport "Skagit Regional Airport") in [Burlington, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Washington "Burlington, Washington"). It was initially run by his family, with Anders as president until 2008, his wife Valerie as secretary, son Greg as vice president, executive director and webmaster, and son Alan as vice president and director of maintenance.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-airportjournals-2)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-museumofflight-58)

Anders died on 7 June 2024, at the age of 90, while flying the vintage [T-34](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_T-34_Mentor "Beechcraft T-34 Mentor") registered to him.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-USA_Today_OBIT-59) The aircraft crashed into the waters of north Puget Sound between [Jones Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_Island_State_Park "Jones Island State Park") and [Orcas Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orcas_Island "Orcas Island")[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-Crash_Location-60)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-NPR_Obit-61)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-NYT_Obit-62). Witnesses reported the plane in a nosedive into a small channel between the islands, catching fire, then sinking.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-USAT_Obit-63) After a search by the U.S. Coast Guard and the San Juan County Sheriff's Department[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-People_Obit-64), Greg Anders confirmed the death of his father and the recovery of his body.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-Fox13_Obit-65)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-AP_Obit-66) Beginning with his Air Force career, Anders had logged over 8,000 flight hours.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders#cite_note-heritageflight-67)
