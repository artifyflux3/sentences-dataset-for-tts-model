The capital building, from the yard taking a photo.

Tata Castle , built at the mid 14th-century on the northern tip of Lake Öreg (Old Lake), is one of the jewels of Tata, Hungary .

[ 1 ] Its blooming can be dated to the reign of Sigismund of Luxembourg (r. 1433–1437) and Mátyás Hunyadi (r. 1458–1490) as the summer resort of the king and a favoured residence.

[ 2 ] It was burnt by Habsburgs and later renovated.

[ 1 ] The walls of the castle reflect the marks of romantic style which is due to the Esterházy family who used to live here.

In popular culture [ edit ] Parts of the Bollywood film Raabta (2017) [ 3 ] and The Witcher TV series [ 4 ] were shot at the castle.
