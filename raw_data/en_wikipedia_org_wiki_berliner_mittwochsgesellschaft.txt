As early as 1783 (with Johann Erich Biester as secretary), intellectuals associated with the Late Enlightenment had gathered in a Gesellschaft der Freunde der Aufklärung , or Society of Friends of the Enlightenment. It was established by Wilhelm Abraham Teller . Members included the Prussian finance minister Carl August von Struensee , the finance councillor Johann Heinrich Wloemer (1726–1797), the poet Leopold Friedrich Günther von Goeckingk , Christian Konrad Wilhelm von Dohm , the theatre director and writer Johann Jacob Engel , the Supreme Court councillor Friedrich Wilhelm von Beneke , Friedrich Gedike , Karl Franz von Irwing , the jurist Ernst Ferdinand Klein , Franz Michael Leuchsenring , the physician Johann Carl Wilhelm Moehsen und Christian Gottlieb Selle , the preachers Johann Joachim Spalding and Johann Friedrich Zöllner , and Karl Gottlieb Suarez .

Moses Mendelssohn was an honorary member.

It was through this scholarly semi-secret society, as well as through the longer-lived Montagsclub , which had a more social character, that the Berlin Enlightenment spread its ideas, using the Berlinische Monatsschrift as an outlet. Nearly every member wrote in this paper, and Werner Krauss , in his studies of the period, called it the movement's most important forum.

In 1798, Frederick William III of Prussia closed down the society as a threat to public order.

With the short-lived Berliner Blätter and Neue Berlinische Monatsschrift (which lasted until 1811), Biester continued to promote their ideas, the enthusiasm for which philosophical Idealism had threatened to quench; but the standards of previous years (when Kant had made contributions) were never quite matched, and Biester died in 1816, with no-one left to replace him.
