He belonged to the nobel Gansneb family from Gelderland , later called ("genaamd") Tengnagel. This family had as their residence from 1553 to 1742 an estate called "De Camp" near Neede , explaining the third part of Tengnagel's name. Part of his youth he spent with his maternal grandfather at Bocholt , so that he was sometimes called a Westphalian .

[ 1 ] He matriculated from the University of Franeker in 1593 and joined the astronomer Tycho Brahe on Uraniborg in February 1595. In 1601 he married Brahe's daughter Lisbeth. Tengnagel wrote a brief prefatory note to Johannes Kepler 's astronomical treatise Astronomia Nova . From 1604 to 1606 he was a corresponding member of the Accademia dei Lincei .
