[ 1 ] The objective of neomercantilist policies is to increase the level of foreign reserves held by the government, allowing more effective monetary policy and fiscal policy .

Background [ edit ] Neomercantilism is considered the oldest school of thought in international political economy (IPE).

[ 2 ] It is rooted in mercantilism , a preindustrial doctrine, and gained ground during the Industrial Revolution .

[ 2 ] It is also considered the IPE counterpart of realism in the sense that both hold that power is central in global relations.

[ 2 ] This regime is also associated with corporatocracy particularly during the 1970s when both were treated as components of a functional system and policy goals.

[ 3 ] In the United States , neomercantilism was embraced in the late 20th century amidst the move to buttress American industries from Japanese competition.

[ 4 ] American thinkers who subscribed to the doctrine, however, include Alexander Hamilton , one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and the first U.S. secretary of the treasury.
