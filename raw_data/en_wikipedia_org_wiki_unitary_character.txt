There are at least two distinct, but overlapping meanings.

[ 1 ] Other uses of the word "character" are almost always qualified.

Multiplicative character [ edit ] Main article: multiplicative character A multiplicative character (or linear character , or simply character ) on a group G is a group homomorphism from G to the multiplicative group of a field ( Artin 1966 ), usually the field of complex numbers .  If G is any group, then the set Ch( G ) of these morphisms forms an abelian group under pointwise multiplication.

This group is referred to as the character group of G . Sometimes only unitary characters are considered (thus the image is in the unit circle ); other such homomorphisms are then called quasi-characters .

Dirichlet characters can be seen as a special case of this definition.

Multiplicative characters are linearly independent , i.e. if χ χ 1 , χ χ 2 , … … , χ χ n {\displaystyle \chi _{1},\chi _{2},\ldots ,\chi _{n}} are different characters on a group G to the same field then from a 1 χ χ 1 + a 2 χ χ 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n χ χ n = 0 {\displaystyle a_{1}\chi _{1}+a_{2}\chi _{2}+\dots +a_{n}\chi _{n}=0} it follows that a 1 = a 2 = ⋯ ⋯ = a n = 0 {\displaystyle a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots =a_{n}=0} .

Character of a representation [ edit ] Main article: Character theory The character χ χ : G → → F {\displaystyle \chi :G\to F} of a representation ϕ ϕ : : G → → G L ( V ) {\displaystyle \phi \colon G\to \mathrm {GL} (V)} of a group G on a finite-dimensional vector space V over a field F is the trace of the representation ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } ( Serre 1977 ), i.e.

χ χ ϕ ϕ ( g ) = Tr ⁡ ⁡ ( ϕ ϕ ( g ) ) {\displaystyle \chi _{\phi }(g)=\operatorname {Tr} (\phi (g))} for g ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle g\in G} In general, the trace is not a group homomorphism, nor does the set of traces form a group.  The characters of one-dimensional representations are identical to one-dimensional representations, so the above notion of multiplicative character can be seen as a special case of higher-dimensional characters. The study of representations using characters is called " character theory " and one-dimensional characters are also called "linear characters" within this context.

Alternative definition [ edit ] If restricted to finite abelian group with 1 × × 1 {\displaystyle 1\times 1} representation in C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } (i.e.

G L ( V ) = G L ( 1 , C ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} (V)=\mathrm {GL} (1,\mathbb {C} )} ), the following alternative definition would be equivalent to the above (For abelian groups, every matrix representation decomposes into a direct sum of 1 × × 1 {\displaystyle 1\times 1} representations. For non-abelian groups, the original definition would be more general than this one): A character χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } of group ( G , ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle (G,\cdot )} is a group homomorphism χ χ : G → → C ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \chi :G\rightarrow \mathbb {C} ^{*}} i.e.

χ χ ( x ⋅ ⋅ y ) = χ χ ( x ) χ χ ( y ) {\displaystyle \chi (x\cdot y)=\chi (x)\chi (y)} for all x , y ∈ ∈ G .

{\displaystyle x,y\in G.} If G {\displaystyle G} is a finite abelian group, the characters play the role of harmonics . For infinite abelian groups, the above would be replaced by χ χ : G → → T {\displaystyle \chi :G\to \mathbb {T} } where T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } is the circle group .
