The Suda states that Nicomachus was from Stageira , was a philosopher, a pupil of Theophrastus , [ 1 ] and, according to Aristippus, his lover.

[ 2 ] He may have written a commentary on his father's lectures in physics.

[ 3 ] Nicomachus was born to the slave Herpyllis , and his father's will commended his care as a boy to several tutors, then to his adopted son, Nicanor. Historians think the Nicomachean Ethics , a compilation of Aristotle's lecture notes, was probably named after or dedicated to Aristotle's son. However, Nicomachus is also believed to be the name of Aristotle's father . Several ancient authorities may have conflated Aristotle's ethical works with the commentaries that Nicomachus wrote on them.

[ 4 ] Ancient sources indicate that Nicomachus died in battle while still a "lad".
