This article is about the punctuation mark. For a colon-like character used as an alphabetic letter in some languages, rather than as punctuation, see [Colon (letter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(letter) "Colon (letter)"). For other uses, see [Colon (disambiguation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(disambiguation) "Colon (disambiguation)").

The **colon**, **:**, is a [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") mark consisting of two equally sized dots aligned vertically. A colon often precedes an explanation, a list,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-PunctuationGuide-1) or a quoted sentence.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-2) It is also used between hours and minutes in time,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-PunctuationGuide-1) between certain elements in [medical journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_journal "Medical journal") citations,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-3) between [chapter and verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapters_and_verses_of_the_Bible "Chapters and verses of the Bible") in [Bible citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_citation "Bible citation"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-4) between two numbers in a [ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio"), and, in the US, for [salutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salutation "Salutation") in business letters and other formal letters.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-PunctuationGuide-1)

In [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek"), in [rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric "Rhetoric") and [prosody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_(poetry) "Meter (poetry)"), the term [κῶλον](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%E1%BF%B6%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek "wikt:κῶλον") (_\_kôlon\__, lit. 'limb, member of a body') did not refer to punctuation, but to a member or section of a complete thought or passage; see also _[Colon (rhetoric)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon\_(rhetoric) "Colon (rhetoric)")_. From this usage, in [palaeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeography "Palaeography"), a colon is a clause or group of clauses written as a line in a [manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript "Manuscript").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-oed-5)

In the 3rd century BC, [Aristophanes of Byzantium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes_of_Byzantium "Aristophanes of Byzantium") is alleged to have devised [a punctuation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_punctuation "Greek punctuation"), in which the end of such a _kôlon_ was thought to occasion a medium-length breath, and was marked by a [middot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct")[·](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%B7 "·"). In practice, evidence is scarce for its early usage, but it was revived later as the _[ano teleia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ano\_teleia "Ano teleia")_, the [modern Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek "Modern Greek")[semicolon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon "Semicolon").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-nicky-6) Some writers also used a [double dot symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_dot_punctuation "Two dot punctuation")⁚, that later came to be used as a [full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") or to mark a change of speaker. (See also _[Punctuation in Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek\_punctuation "Greek punctuation")_.)

In 1589, in _The Arte of English Poesie_, the [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") term _colon_ and the corresponding punctuation mark : is attested:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-arber-7)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-8)

> For these respectes the auncient reformers of language, inuented, three maner of pauses [...] The shortest pause or intermission they called _comma_ [...] The second they called _colon_, not a peece but as it were a member for his larger length, because it occupied twise as much time as the comma. The third they called _periodus_, [...]

In 1622, in [Nicholas Okes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Okes "Nicholas Okes")' print of [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare")'s _[Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello "Othello")_, the typographical construction of a colon followed by a [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen") or [dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash "Dash") to indicate a restful pause is attested.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-9) This construction, known as the _[dog's bollocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog%27s\_bollocks\_(typography) "Dog's bollocks (typography)")_, was once common in [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English"), though this usage is now discouraged.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-dean-10)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-martens-11)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-sussex-12)

As late as the 18th century, [John Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mason_(minister) "John Mason (minister)") related the appropriateness of a colon to the length of the pause taken when reading the text aloud, but [silent reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_reading "Silent reading") eventually replaced this with other considerations.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-13)

In modern English usage, a complete sentence precedes a colon, while a list, description, explanation, or definition follows it. The elements which follow the colon may or may not be a complete sentence: since the colon is preceded by a sentence, it is a complete sentence whether what follows the colon is another sentence or not. While it is acceptable to capitalise the first letter after the colon in American English, it is not the case in British English, except where a proper noun immediately follows a colon.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-14)

Colon used before list _Daequan was so hungry that he ate everything in the house: chips, cold pizza, pretzels and dip, hot dogs, peanut butter, and candy._ Colon used before a description _Bertha is so desperate that she'll date anyone, even William: he's uglier than a squashed toad on the highway, and that's on his good days._ Colon before definition _For years while I was reading Shakespeare's_ Othello _and criticism on it, I had to constantly look up the word "egregious" since the villain uses that word: outstandingly bad or shocking._ Colon before explanation _I guess I can say I had a rough weekend: I had chest pain and spent all Saturday and Sunday in the emergency room._
Some writers use fragments (incomplete sentences) before a colon for emphasis or stylistic preferences (to show a character's voice in literature), as in this example:

_Dinner: chips and juice. What a well-rounded diet I have._
_[The Bedford Handbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Bedford\_Handbook "The Bedford Handbook")_ describes several uses of a colon. For example, one can use a colon after an independent clause to direct attention to a list, an [appositive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appositive "Appositive"), or a quotation, and it can be used between independent clauses if the second summarizes or explains the first. In non-literary or non-expository uses, one may use a colon after the salutation in a formal letter, to indicate hours and minutes, to show proportions, between a title and subtitle, and between city and publisher in bibliographic entries.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-15)

[Luca Serianni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Serianni "Luca Serianni"), an Italian scholar who helped to define and develop the colon as a punctuation mark, identified four punctuational modes for it: _syntactical-deductive_, _syntactical-descriptive_, _appositive_, and _segmental_.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-16)

### Syntactical-deductive

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colon_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Syntactical-deductive")]

The colon introduces the [logical consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence "Logical consequence"), or effect, of a fact stated before.

_There was only one possible explanation: the train had never arrived._

### Syntactical-descriptive

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colon_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Syntactical-descriptive")]

In this sense the colon introduces a description; in particular, it makes explicit the elements of a set.

_I have three sisters: Daphne, Rose, and Suzanne._
Syntactical-descriptive colons may separate the numbers indicating [hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour "Hour"), [minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute "Minute"), and [seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") in abbreviated measures of time.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-ISO8601-17)

_The concert begins at 21:45._ _The rocket launched at 09:15:05._
[British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English") and [Australian English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_English "Australian English"), however, more frequently use a [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark "Decimal mark") for this purpose:

_The programme will begin at 8.00 pm._ _You will need to arrive by 14.30._[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-trask-18)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-19)
A colon is also used in the descriptive location of a book verse if the book is divided into verses, such as in the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible "Bible") or the [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran "Quran"):

"Isaiah 42:8""Deuteronomy 32:39""Quran 10:5"_Luruns could not speak: he was drunk._[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-20)
An appositive colon also separates the [subtitle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitle_(titling) "Subtitle (titling)") of a work from its principal title. (In effect, the example given above illustrates an appositive use of the colon as an abbreviation for the conjunction "because".) Dillon has noted the impact of colons on scholarly articles,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-21)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-22) but the reliability of colons as a predictor of quality or impact has also been challenged.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-23)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-24) In titles, neither needs to be a complete sentence as titles do not represent [expository](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/expository "wikt:expository") writing:

_Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi_
Like a [dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash "Dash") or [quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark"), a segmental colon introduces [speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech "Speech"). The segmental function was once a common means of indicating an unmarked quotation on the same line. The following example is from the grammar book _[The King's English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_King%27s\_English "The King's English")_:

_Benjamin Franklin proclaimed the virtue of frugality: A penny saved is a penny earned._
This form is still used in British industry-standard templates for written performance [dialogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue "Dialogue"), such as in a [play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre) "Play (theatre)").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-25) The colon indicates that the words following an character's name are spoken by that character.

_Patient: Doctor, I feel like a pair of curtains._ _Doctor: Pull yourself together!_
The uniform visual pattern of `<character_nametag : character_spoken_lines>` placement on a script page assists an actor in scanning for the lines of their assigned character during rehearsal, especially if a script is undergoing rewrites between rehearsals.

Use of capitalization or lower-case after a colon varies. In [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English"), and in most [Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations") countries, the word following the colon is in lower case unless it is normally capitalized for some other reason, as with [proper nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun "Proper noun") and [acronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym"). British English also capitalizes a new sentence introduced by a colon's [segmental use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#Segmental).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English") permits writers to similarly capitalize the first word of any [independent clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_clause "Independent clause") following a colon. This follows the guidelines of some modern American style guides, including those published by the [Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press "Associated Press") and the [Modern Language Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Language_Association "Modern Language Association"). _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_, however, requires capitalization only when the colon introduces a direct quotation, a direct question, or two or more complete sentences.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-26)[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

In many [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") languages, the colon is usually followed by a lower-case letter unless the upper case is required for other reasons, as with British English. [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") usage requires capitalization of [independent clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_clause "Independent clause") following a colon.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-27)[Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language") further capitalizes the first word of any quotation following a colon, even if it is not a complete sentence on its own.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-28)

### Spacing and parentheses

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colon_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Spacing and parentheses")]

In print, a thin space was traditionally placed before a colon and a thick space after it. In modern [English-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language "English-language") printing, no space is placed before a colon and a single space is placed after it.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-29)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-30) In [French-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") typing and printing, the traditional rules are preserved.

One or two spaces may be and have been used after a colon. The older convention (designed to be used by [monospaced fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font "Monospaced font")) was to use _two_ spaces after a colon.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-31)

In modern typography, a colon will be placed outside the closing [parenthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthesis "Parenthesis") introducing a list. In very early English typography, it could be placed inside, as seen in [Roger Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Williams "Roger Williams")' 1643 book about the Native American languages of New England.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-32)

Usage in other languages
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colon_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Usage in other languages")]

In [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "Finnish language") and [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language "Swedish language"), the colon can appear inside words in a manner similar to the [apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe "Apostrophe") in the English [possessive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive_case "Possessive case"), connecting a grammatical [suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix "Suffix") to an [abbreviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation "Abbreviation") or [initialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialism "Initialism"), a special symbol, or a [digit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit "Numerical digit") (e.g., Finnish _USA:n_ and Swedish _USA:s_ for the [genitive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") of "USA", Finnish _%:ssa_ for the [inessive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inessive_case "Inessive case") of "%", or Finnish _20:een_ for the [illative case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illative_case "Illative case") of "20").

Written Swedish uses colons in [contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_(grammar) "Contraction (grammar)"), such as _S:t_ for _Sankt_ (Swedish for "Saint") – for example in the name of the [Stockholm metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_metro "Stockholm metro") station _[S:t Eriksplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankt\_Eriksplan\_metro\_station "Sankt Eriksplan metro station")_, and _k:a_ for _kyrka_ ("church") – for instance [Svenska k:a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svenska_kyrkan "Svenska kyrkan") (Svenska kyrkan), the Evangelical Lutheran national Church of Sweden. This can even occur in people's names, for example [Antonia Ax:son Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Ax:son_Johnson "Antonia Ax:son Johnson") (_[Ax:son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ax:son\_Johnson\_family "Ax:son Johnson family")_ for _Axelson_). [Early Modern English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_English "Early Modern English") texts also used colons to mark abbreviations.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-33)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-34)

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Ethiopic_genesis_%28ch._29%2C_v._11-16%29%2C_15th_century_%28The_S.S._Teacher%27s_Edition-The_Holy_Bible_-_Plate_XII%2C_1%29.jpg/250px-Ethiopic_genesis_%28ch._29%2C_v._11-16%29%2C_15th_century_%28The_S.S._Teacher%27s_Edition-The_Holy_Bible_-_Plate_XII%2C_1%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ethiopic_genesis_(ch._29,_v._11-16),_15th_century_(The_S.S._Teacher%27s_Edition-The_Holy_Bible_-_Plate_XII,_1).jpg)

In [Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia "Ethiopia"), both [Amharic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic "Amharic") and [Ge'ez script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%27ez_script "Ge'ez script") used and sometimes still use a [colon-like mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%CA%BDez_script#Punctuation "Geʽez script") as [word separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_separator "Word separator").

Historically, a colon-like mark was used as a word separator in [Old Turkic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Turkic_script "Old Turkic script").

### End of sentence or verse

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colon_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: End of sentence or verse")]

In [Armenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_language "Armenian language"), a colon indicates the end of a sentence, similar to a Latin [full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") or period.

In liturgical [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation "Hebrew punctuation"), the [sof pasuq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sof_passuk "Sof passuk") is used in some writings such as prayer books to signal the end of a verse.

In [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"), [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"), and sometimes in [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language"), a colon divides the scores of opponents in sports and games. A result of [149–0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Adema_149%E2%80%930_SO_l%27Emyrne "AS Adema 149–0 SO l'Emyrne") would be written as 149 : 0 in German and in Hebrew.

Mathematics and logic
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colon_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Mathematics and logic")]

The colon is used in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [cartography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography "Cartography"), [model building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model "Scale model"), and other fields, in this context it denotes a [ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio") or a [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(ratio) "Scale (ratio)"), as in 3:1 (pronounced "three to one").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-PunctuationGuide-1)

When a ratio is [reduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(mathematics) "Reduction (mathematics)") to a simpler form, such as 10:15 to 2:3, this may be expressed with a [double colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_colon_(disambiguation) "Double colon (disambiguation)") as 10:15::2:3; this would be read "10 is to 15 as 2 is to 3". This form is also used in tests of logic where the question of "Dog is to Puppy as Cat is to _____?" can be expressed as "Dog:Puppy::Cat:_____". For these uses, there is a dedicated [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") symbol (U+2236∶RATIO) that is preferred in some contexts. Compare 2:3 (ratio colon) with 2:3 (U+003A ASCII colon).

In some languages (e.g. German, Russian, and French), the colon is the commonly used sign for division (instead of ÷). (See also [Division sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_sign "Division sign") and [Division (mathematics) §Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics)#Notation "Division (mathematics)").)

The notation |G: H| may also denote the [index of a subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_a_subgroup "Index of a subgroup").

The notation ƒ: X → Y indicates that f is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") with domain X and codomain Y.

The combination with an equal sign (≔) is used for [definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition "Definition").

In [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), when using [set-builder notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation "Set-builder notation") for describing the characterizing property of a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)"), it is used as an alternative to a [vertical bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar "Vertical bar") (which is the [ISO 31-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_31-11 "ISO 31-11") standard), to mean "**such that**". Example:

![Image 2: {\displaystyle S=\{x\in \mathbb {R} :1<x<3\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7697172bdfd846b5f6cc50fe820a474c1b381c6d) (_S_ is the set of all x in ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) (the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")) such that x is strictly greater than 1 and strictly smaller than 3)
In older literature on mathematical logic, it is used to indicate how expressions should be bracketed (see [Glossary of _Principia Mathematica_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Principia_Mathematica "Glossary of Principia Mathematica")).

In [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory "Type theory") and [programming language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory "Programming language theory"), the colon sign after a term is used to indicate its type, sometimes as a replacement to the "∈" symbol. Example:

![Image 4: {\displaystyle \lambda x.x\mathrel {:} A\to A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/de0e2aa5df3e775a29cd390598f6853d37f4ab23).
A colon is also sometimes used to indicate a [tensor contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction "Tensor contraction") involving two indices, and a double colon (::) for a contraction over four indices.

A colon is also used to denote a [parallel sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_sum "Parallel sum") operation involving two operands (many authors, however, instead use a [∥](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%88%A5 "∥") sign and a few even a [∗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%88%97 "∗") for this purpose).

The character was on early typewriters and therefore appeared in most text encodings, such as [Baudot code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code "Baudot code") and [EBCDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC "EBCDIC"). It was placed at code 58 in [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") and from there inherited into Unicode. Unicode also defines several related characters:

### Programming languages

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colon_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Programming languages")]

Many programming languages, most notably [ALGOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL "ALGOL"), [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal (programming language)") and [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language) "Ada (programming language)"), use a colon and equals sign `:=` as the [assignment operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science) "Assignment (computer science)"), to distinguish it from a single equals `=` which is an equality test ([C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") instead uses a single equals as assignment, and a double equals `==` as the equality test).[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-39)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-40)

Many languages including [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") and [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)") use the colon to indicate the text before it is a [label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_(computer_science) "Label (computer science)"), such as a target for a [goto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto "Goto") or an introduction to a case in a [switch statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement "Switch statement").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-c99-41): 131 [[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-42) In a related use, [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)") uses a colon to separate a control statement (the _clause header_) from the block of statements it controls (the _suite_):[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-43)

if test(x):
    print("test(x) is true!")
else:
    print("test(x) is not true...")

In many languages, including [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript"), colons are used to define [name–value pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name%E2%80%93value_pair "Name–value pair") in a [dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON "JSON") or [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science) "Object (computer science)").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-44): 96–100  This is also used by data formats such as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON "JSON").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-rfc8259-45) Some other languages use an equals sign.

var obj = {
 name: "Charles",
 age: 18,
}

The colon is used as part of the [?:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F: "?:") conditional operator in C and many other languages.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-c99-41): 90

[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") uses a double colon as the [scope resolution operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_resolution_operator "Scope resolution operator"), and [class member access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_member_function "Class member function").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-46) Most other languages use a period but C++ had to use this for compatibility with C. Another language using colons for scope resolution is [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language) "Erlang (programming language)"), which uses a single colon.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-47)

In [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC "BASIC"), it is used as a separator between the statements or instructions in a single line. Most other languages use a semicolon, but BASIC had used semicolon to separate items in print statements.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-48)

In [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language) "Forth (programming language)"), a colon _precedes_ definition of a new word.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-49)

[Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell "Haskell") uses a colon (pronounced as "[cons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons "Cons")", short for "construct") as an operator to add a [data element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_element "Data element") to the front of a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(computing) "List (computing)"):[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-50)

"child" : ["woman", "man"] -- equals ["child","woman","man"]

while a double colon `::` is read as "has type of" (compare [scope resolution operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_resolution_operator#Haskell "Scope resolution operator")):[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-51)

("text", False) :: ([Char], Bool)

The [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language) "ML (programming language)") languages (such as [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML "Standard ML")) have the above reversed, where the double colon (`::`) is used to add an element to the front of a list; and the single colon (`:`) is used for type guards.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-52): 20, 70

[MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB "MATLAB") uses the colon as a binary operator to generate a vector, or to select a part of an extant matrix.

[APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)") uses the colon:

*   to introduce a [control structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow "Control flow") element. In this usage it must be the first non-blank character of the line.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-DyalogAPL-53): 64 
*   after a label name that will be the target of a `:goto` or a right-pointing arrow (this style of programming is deprecated and programs are supposed to use control structures instead).[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-DyalogAPL-53): 64 
*   to separate a guard ([Boolean expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_expression "Boolean expression")) from its expression in a dynamic function.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-DyalogAPL-53): 111  Two colons are used for an Error guard (one or more error numbers).[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-DyalogAPL-53): 115 
*   Colon + space are used in class definitions to indicate inheritance.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-DyalogAPL-53): 135 
*   ⍠ (a colon in a box) is used by APL for its variant operator.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-DyalogAPL-53): 340 

The colon is also used in many operating systems commands.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-54)

In the [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language "Esoteric programming language")[INTERCAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTERCAL "INTERCAL"), the colon is called _two-spot_ and used to label a [32-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit_computing "32-bit computing") variable, distinct from _spot_ (.) to label a [16-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit_computing "16-bit computing") variable.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-55): 3

Internet URLs use the colon to separate the protocol (such as `http:`) from the [hostname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname "Hostname") or [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-rfc3986-56)

In an [IPv6 address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#Representation "IPv6 address"), colons (and one optional double colon) separate up to 8 groups of 16 [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit") in [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal") representation.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-rfc4291-57) In a [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL "URL"), a colon follows the initial scheme name (such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol ([HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP "HTTP")) and [File Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol "File Transfer Protocol") (FTP), and separates a [port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_number "Port number") from the [hostname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname "Hostname") or [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-rfc3986-56)

In [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows")[filenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename "Filename"), the colon is reserved for use in [alternate data streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(file_system)#Microsoft "Fork (file system)") and cannot appear in a filename.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-58) It was used as the directory separator in [Classic Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS "Classic Mac OS"), and was difficult to use in early versions of the newer [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD "BSD")-based [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS "MacOS") due to code swapping the slash and colon to try to preserve this usage. In most systems it is often difficult to put a colon in a filename as the shell interprets it for other purposes.

[CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M "CP/M") and early versions of [MSDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSDOS "MSDOS") required the colon after the names of devices, such as `CON:` though this gradually disappeared except for disks (where it had to be between the disk name and the required [path representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing) "Path (computing)") of the file as in `C:\Windows\`). This then migrated to use in [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator "Uniform Resource Locator").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#cite_note-rfc3986-56)

It is often used as a single post-fix [delimiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter "Delimiter"), signifying a token keyword had immediately preceded it or the transition from one mode of character string interpretation to another related mode. Some applications, such as the widely used [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki "MediaWiki"), utilize the colon as both a pre-fix and post-fix delimiter.

In [wiki markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_markup "Wiki markup"), the colon is often used to indent text. Common usage includes separating or marking comments in a discussion as replies, or to distinguish certain parts of a text.

| Markup | Renders as |
| --- | --- |
| Normal text. :Indented text by the means of a colon. ::The gap increases with colon number. | Normal text. Indented text by the means of a colon. The gap increases with colon number. |
|  |  |
