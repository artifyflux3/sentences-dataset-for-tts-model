[Hyperboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid "Hyperboloid") of one sheet

**Solid geometry** or **stereometry** is the [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") of [three-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space")[Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") (3D space).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_geometry#cite_note-1) A **solid figure** is the [region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_(mathematics) "Region (mathematics)") of 3D space bounded by a [two-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional "Two-dimensional")[closed surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_surface "Closed surface"); for example, a solid [ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics) "Ball (mathematics)") consists of a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") and its [interior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_(topology) "Interior (topology)").

Solid geometry deals with the [measurements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement "Measurement") of [volumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") of various solids, including [pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(geometry) "Pyramid (geometry)"), [prisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(geometry) "Prism (geometry)") (and other [polyhedrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedrons "Polyhedrons")), [cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubes "Cubes"), [cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry) "Cylinder (geometry)"), [cones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry) "Cone (geometry)") (and [truncated cones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustum "Frustum")).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_geometry#cite_note-2)

The [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism "Pythagoreanism") dealt with the [regular solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_solid "Regular solid"), but the pyramid, prism, cone and cylinder were not studied until the [Platonists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism "Platonism"). [Eudoxus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus "Eudoxus of Cnidus") established their measurement, proving the pyramid and cone to have one-third the volume of a prism and cylinder on the same base and of the same height. He was probably also the discoverer of a proof that the volume enclosed by a sphere is proportional to the cube of its [radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius "Radius").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_geometry#cite_note-3)

List of solid figures
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solid_geometry&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: List of solid figures")]

Whereas a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") is the surface of a [ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics) "Ball (mathematics)"), for other solid figures it is sometimes ambiguous whether the term refers to the surface of the figure or the volume enclosed therein, notably for a [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder "Cylinder").

Various techniques and tools are used in solid geometry. Among them, [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry") and [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)") techniques have a major impact by allowing the systematic use of [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations "System of linear equations") and [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)") algebra, which are important for higher dimensions.

A major application of solid geometry and stereometry is in [3D computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics "3D computer graphics").
