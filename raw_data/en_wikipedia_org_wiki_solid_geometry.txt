[ 1 ] A solid figure is the region of 3D space bounded by a two-dimensional closed surface ; for example, a solid ball consists of a sphere and its interior .

Solid geometry deals with the measurements of volumes of various solids, including pyramids , prisms (and other polyhedrons ), cubes , cylinders , cones (and truncated cones ).

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The Pythagoreans dealt with the regular solids , but the pyramid, prism, cone and cylinder were not studied until the Platonists .

Eudoxus established their measurement, proving the pyramid and cone to have one-third the volume of a prism and cylinder on the same base and of the same height. He was probably also the discoverer of a proof that the volume enclosed by a sphere is proportional to the cube of its radius .

[ 3 ] Topics [ edit ] Basic topics in solid geometry and stereometry include: incidence of planes and lines dihedral angle and solid angle the cube , cuboid , parallelepiped the tetrahedron and other pyramids prisms octahedron , dodecahedron , icosahedron cones and cylinders the sphere other quadrics : spheroid , ellipsoid , paraboloid and hyperboloids .

Advanced topics include: projective geometry of three dimensions (leading to a proof of Desargues' theorem by using an extra dimension) further polyhedra descriptive geometry .

List of solid figures [ edit ] For a more complete list and organization, see List of mathematical shapes .

Whereas a sphere is the surface of a ball , for other solid figures it is sometimes ambiguous whether the term refers to the surface of the figure or the volume enclosed therein, notably for a cylinder .

Major types of shapes that either constitute or define a volume.

Figure Definitions Images Parallelepiped A polyhedron with six faces ( hexahedron ), each of which is a parallelogram A hexahedron with three pairs of parallel faces A prism of which the base is a parallelogram Rhombohedron A parallelepiped where all edges are the same length A cube , except that its faces are not squares but rhombi Cuboid A convex polyhedron bounded by six quadrilateral faces, whose polyhedral graph is the same as that of a cube [ 4 ] Some sources also require that each of the faces is a rectangle (so each pair of adjacent faces meets in a right angle ). This more restrictive type of cuboid is also known as a rectangular cuboid , right cuboid , rectangular box , rectangular hexahedron , right rectangular prism , or rectangular parallelepiped .

[ 5 ] Polyhedron Flat polygonal faces , straight edges and sharp corners or vertices Small stellated dodecahedron Toroidal polyhedron Uniform polyhedron Regular polygons as faces and is vertex-transitive (i.e., there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other) (Regular) Tetrahedron and Cube Uniform Snub dodecahedron Pyramid A polyhedron comprising an n -sided polygonal base and a vertex point square pyramid Prism A polyhedron comprising an n -sided polygonal base , a second base which is a translated copy (rigidly moved without rotation) of the first, and n other faces (necessarily all parallelograms ) joining corresponding sides of the two bases hexagonal prism Antiprism A polyhedron comprising an n -sided polygonal base , a second base translated and rotated.sides]] of the two bases square antiprism Bipyramid A polyhedron comprising an n -sided polygonal center with two apexes.

triangular bipyramid Trapezohedron A polyhedron with 2 n kite faces around an axis, with half offsets tetragonal trapezohedron Cone Tapers smoothly from a flat base (frequently, though not necessarily, circular) to a point called the apex or vertex A right circular cone and an oblique circular cone Cylinder Straight parallel sides and a circular or oval cross section A solid elliptic cylinder A right and an oblique circular cylinder Ellipsoid A surface that may be obtained from a sphere by deforming it by means of directional scalings , or more generally, of an affine transformation Examples of ellipsoids x 2 a 2 + y 2 b 2 + z 2 c 2 = 1 : {\displaystyle {x^{2} \over a^{2}}+{y^{2} \over b^{2}}+{z^{2} \over c^{2}}=1:} sphere (top, a=b=c=4), spheroid (bottom left, a=b=5, c=3), tri-axial ellipsoid (bottom right, a=4.5, b=6, c=3)]] Lemon A lens (or less than half of a circular arc) rotated about an axis passing through the endpoints of the lens (or arc) [ 6 ] Hyperboloid A surface that is generated by rotating a hyperbola around one of its principal axes Techniques [ edit ] Various techniques and tools are used in solid geometry. Among them, analytic geometry and vector techniques have a major impact by allowing the systematic use of linear equations and matrix algebra, which are important for higher dimensions.

Applications [ edit ] A major application of solid geometry and stereometry is in 3D computer graphics .
