( June 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Theory developed by William Warren Bartley Pancritical rationalism (literally "criticism of all things", from pan- , "all", also known as PCR ), also called comprehensively critical rationalism ( CCR ), is a development of critical rationalism and panrationalism originated by William Warren Bartley in his book The Retreat to Commitment . PCR attempts to work around the problem of ultimate commitment or infinite regress by decoupling criticism and justification. A pancritical rationalist holds all positions open to criticism, including PCR itself. Such a position in principle never resorts to appeal to authority for justification of stances, since all authorities are held to be intrinsically fallible .
