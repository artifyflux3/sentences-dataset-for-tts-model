[ 1 ] From the late 19th century through the mid-20th century, they were often associated with a cultivated New England accent , [ 2 ] Harvard University , [ 3 ] Anglicanism , [ 4 ] and traditional British-American customs and clothing. Descendants of the earliest English colonists are typically considered to be the most representative of the Boston Brahmins.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] They are considered White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs).

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Etymology [ edit ] Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.

, who coined the phrase "Brahmin" in a January 1860 article he authored for The Atlantic Monthly The phrase "Brahmin Caste of New England" was first coined by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.

, a physician and writer, in a January 1860 article in The Atlantic Monthly .

[ 10 ] The term is derived from the brahmin , the chief priestly caste in the Hindu caste system . The appropriated term became a shorthand to refer to the old wealthy and elite New England families of traditionally British Protestant origin that became influential in the development of American institutions and culture. The influence of the old American gentry has been reduced in modern times, but some vestiges remain, primarily in the institutions and the ideals that they championed in their heyday.

[ 11 ] Characteristics [ edit ] The typical dress of the Boston elite, c.

1816–1817 Beacon Hill , a preeminent neighborhood for Boston Brahmin located near the Massachusetts State House in Boston [ 12 ] The nature of the Brahmins is referenced in the doggerel "Boston Toast" by Holy Cross alumnus John Collins Bossidy: And this is good old Boston, The home of the bean and the cod , Where the Lowells talk only to Cabots , And the Cabots talk only to God.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Many 19th-century Brahmin families of large fortune were of common origin; fewer were of an aristocratic origin. The new families were often the first to seek, in typically British fashion, suitable marriage alliances with those old aristocratic New England families that were descended from land-owners in England to elevate and cement their social standing. The Winthrops, Dudleys, Saltonstalls, Winslows, and Lymans (descended from English magistrates, gentry, and aristocracy) were, by and large, happy with this arrangement. All of Boston's "Brahmin elite", therefore, maintained the received culture of the old English gentry, including cultivating the personal excellence that they imagined maintained the distinction between gentlemen and freemen, and between ladies and women. They saw it as their duty to maintain what they defined as high standards of excellence, duty, and restraint. Cultivated, urbane, and dignified, a Boston Brahmin was supposed to be the very essence of enlightened aristocracy .

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] The ideal Brahmin was not only wealthy, but displayed what was considered suitable personal virtues and character traits.

The Brahmin were expected to maintain the customary English reserve in dress, manner, and deportment, and cultivate the arts, support charities such as hospitals and colleges, and assume the role of community leaders.

[ 17 ] : 14 Although the ideal called on him to transcend commonplace business values, in practice many found the thrill of economic success quite attractive. The Brahmins warned each other against avarice and insisted upon personal responsibility. Scandal and divorce were unacceptable. This culture was buttressed by the strong extended family ties present in Boston society. Young men attended the same prep schools, colleges, and private clubs, [ 18 ] and heirs married heiresses. Family not only served as an economic asset, but also as a means of moral restraint.

Most belonged to the Unitarian or Episcopal churches, [ 19 ] although some were Congregationalists or Methodists .

[ 20 ] Politically, they were successively Federalists , Whigs , and Republicans . They were marked by their manners and once distinctive elocution . Their distinctive Anglo-American manner of dress has been much imitated and is the foundation of the style now informally known as preppy . Many of the Brahmin families trace their ancestry back to the original 17th- and 18th-century colonial ruling class consisting of Massachusetts governors and magistrates, Harvard presidents, distinguished clergy, and fellows of the Royal Society of London , a leading scientific body, while others entered New England aristocratic society during the 19th century with their profits from commerce and trade, often marrying into established Brahmin families.
