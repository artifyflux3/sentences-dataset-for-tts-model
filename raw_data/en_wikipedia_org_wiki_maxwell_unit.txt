Gaussian base units 1 cm 3/2 ⋅ g 1/2 ⋅ s −1 SI units ≘ 10 −8 Wb The maxwell (symbol: Mx) is the CGS (centimetre–gram–second) unit of magnetic flux ( Φ ).

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The unit name honours James Clerk Maxwell , [ 2 ] who presented a unified theory of electromagnetism . The maxwell was recommended as a CGS unit at the International Electrical Congress held in 1900 at Paris.

[ 3 ] This practical unit was previously called a line , [ 4 ] reflecting Faraday 's conception of the magnetic field as curved lines of magnetic force, [ 5 ] which he designated as line of magnetic induction .

[ 4 ] Kiloline (10 3 line) and megaline (10 6 line) were sometimes used because 1 line was very small relative to the phenomena that it was used to measure.

[ 5 ] The maxwell was affirmed again unanimously as the unit name for magnetic flux at the Plenary Meeting of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in July 1930 at Oslo.

[ 6 ] In 1933, the Electric and Magnetic Magnitudes and Units committee of the IEC recommended to adopt the metre–kilogram–second ( MKS ) system ( Giorgi system ), and the name weber was proposed for the practical unit of magnetic flux ( Φ ), subject to approval of various national committees, which was achieved in 1935.

[ 7 ] The weber was thus adopted as a practical unit of magnetic flux  by the IEC.

Definition [ edit ] The maxwell is a non- SI unit .

[ 8 ] 1 maxwell = 1 gauss × ( centimetre ) 2 That is, one maxwell is the total flux across a surface of one square centimetre perpendicular to a magnetic field of strength one gauss.

The weber is the related SI unit of magnetic flux, which was defined in 1946.
