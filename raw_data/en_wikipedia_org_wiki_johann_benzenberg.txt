Biography [ edit ] Benzenberg was born near Elberfeld , Germany on 5 May 1777 to Heinrich Benzenberg and Johanna Elisabeth. He married Charlotte Platzhoff in 1807. After studying theology at Herborn and Marburg , he travelled to Göttingen where he became interested in science through attending lectures by Georg Christoph Lichtenberg and Abraham Gotthelf Kästner . Benzenberg obtained a PhD from the University of Duisburg in 1800 and became a professor of mathematics at the women's college of Düsseldorf in 1805. After the Napoleonic occupation of Germany he immigrated to Switzerland where he became interested in politics.

[ 1 ] Benzenberg's interest in politics led him to write extensively on issues such as the constitution of Prussia.

[ 2 ] In 1844 Benzenberg built a private observatory, the Düsseldorf-Bilk Observatory , in Bilk, which he later donated to the city along with a grant to pay for a resident astronomer.

[ 1 ] In 1798, whilst still a student at the University of Göttingen, Benzenberg and Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes studied the atmospheric altitude of meteors , collecting the first evidence that they were inside the atmosphere.

[ 3 ] Later, in 1802 and 1804, Benzenberg helped prove the Earth's rotation by conducting experiments originally suggested by Isaac Newton ; dropping balls from a height.
