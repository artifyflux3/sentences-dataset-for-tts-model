The hammer and sickle symbol The hammer and sickle ( Unicode : U+262D ☭ HAMMER AND SICKLE ) is a communist symbol representing proletarian solidarity between industrial and agricultural workers. It was first adopted during the Russian Revolution at the end of World War I , the hammer representing workers and the sickle representing the peasants.

[ 1 ] After World War I (from which Russia withdrew in 1917) and the Russian Civil War , the hammer and sickle became more widely used as a symbol for labor within the Soviet Union (USSR) and for international proletarian unity . It was taken up by many communist movements around the world, some with local variations. The hammer and sickle remains commonplace in self-declared socialist states, such as China , Cuba , Laos , North Korea , and Vietnam , but also some former Soviet republics following the dissolution of the Soviet Union , such as Belarus and Russia . Some countries have imposed bans on communist symbols , where the display of the hammer and sickle is prohibited.

History [ edit ] The Chilean peso coin used the hammer and sickle symbol over a wreath between 1894 and 1940, as designed by Louis-Oscar Roty .

Worker symbolism [ edit ] One example of use prior to its political instrumentalization by the Soviet Union is found in Chilean currency circulating since 1894.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Inception [ edit ] In 1918, Yevgeny Ivanovich Kamzolkin proposed a 'hammer and sickle' symbol as a decoration for the May Day celebrations in the Zamoskvorechye District of Moscow .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] It originally featured a sword, but Lenin strongly objected, disliking the militaristic connotations.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] On 6 July 1923, the 2nd session of the Central Executive Committee (CIK) adopted the emblem.

[ 6 ] [ failed verification ] In 1919, the new Republic of Austria introduced a sickle and a hammer to its coat of arms , one in each talon of its supporting eagle, to represent the farming and industrial classes. They were removed in 1934 with the establishment of the Fascist Federal State of Austria and returned in 1945 after the defeat of Nazi Germany (which had absorbed Austria in 1938) in the Second World War.

In his work, Daily Life in a Crumbling Empire: The Absorption of Russia into the World Economy , sociologist David Lempert hypothesizes that the hammer and sickle was a secular replacement for the patriarchal cross .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Use in Soviet Union [ edit ] The hammer and sickle symbol and red star .

A hammer and sickle on the insignia of the Order of the Patriotic War .

The State Emblem of the Soviet Union and the Coats of Arms of the Soviet Republics showed the hammer and sickle, which also appeared on the red star badge on the uniform cap of the Red Army uniform and in many other places.

Serp i Molot ( transliteration of Russian : cерп и молот , "sickle and hammer") is the name of the Moscow Metallurgical Plant .

Serp i Molot is also the name of a stop on the electric railway line from Kurski railway station in Moscow to Gorky , featured in Venedikt Yerofeyev 's novel, Moscow-Petushki .

Meaning [ edit ] At the time of creation, the hammer and sickle stood for worker-peasant alliance, with the hammer a traditional symbol of the industrial proletariat (who dominated the proletariat of Russia) and the sickle a traditional symbol for the peasantry, but the meaning has since broadened to a globally recognizable symbol for Marxism , communist parties , or socialist states .

[ 6 ] Current usage [ edit ] Post-Soviet states [ edit ] Two federal subjects of the post-Soviet Russian Federation use the hammer and sickle in their symbols: the Vladimir Oblast has them on its flag and the Bryansk Oblast has them on its flag and coat of arms, which is also the central element of its flag. In addition, the Russian city of Oryol also uses the hammer and sickle on its flag.

[ 10 ] The former Soviet (now Russian) national airline, Aeroflot , continues to use the hammer and sickle in its symbol.

[ 11 ] Flag of Transnistria The de facto government of Transnistria uses (with minor modifications) the flag and the emblem of the former Moldavian SSR , which includes the hammer and sickle. The flag can also appear without the hammer and sickle in some circumstances, for example on Transnistrian-issued license plates , military uniforms , and money .

[ 12 ] Communist parties [ edit ] Three out of the five currently ruling Communist parties use a hammer and sickle as the party symbol: the Chinese Communist Party , the Communist Party of Vietnam and the Lao People's Revolutionary Party . In Laos and Vietnam, the hammer and sickle party flags can often be seen flying side by side with their respective national flags.

[ citation needed ] Many communist parties around the world also use it, including the Communist Party of Greece , [ 13 ] the Communist Party of Argentina , the Communist Party of Chile , both the Communist Party of Brazil and the Brazilian Communist Party , the Purba Banglar Sarbahara Party from Bangladesh, the Communist Party of Sri Lanka , the Communist Party of India (Marxist) , the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation , the Communist Party of India , the Communist Party of India (Maoist) , the Indian Communist Marxist Party , the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) , the Egyptian Communist Party , the Communist Party of Pakistan , the Communist Refoundation Party in Italy, the Communist Party of Spain , the Communist Party of Denmark , the Communist Party of Norway , the Romanian Communist Party , the Lebanese Communist Party , the Communist Party of the Philippines and the Shining Path . The Communist Party of Sweden , the Portuguese Communist Party [ 14 ] and the Mexican Communist Party use the hammer and sickle imposed on the red star.

Variations [ edit ] Flag of Angola Flag of Mozambique Many symbols having similar structures and messages to the original have been designed. For example, the Angolan flag shows a segment of a cog , crossed by a machete and crowned with a socialist star , while the flag of Mozambique features an AKM crossed by a hoe . In the logo of the Communist Party USA , a circle is formed by a half cog and a semicircular sickle-blade. A hammer is laid directly over the sickle's handle, with the hammer's head at the logo's center. The logo of the Communist Party of Turkey consists of half a cog wheel crossed by a hammer, with a star on the top.

[ 15 ] Tools represented in other designs include: the brush , sickle and hammer of the Workers' Party of Korea ; the spade , flaming torch and quill used prior to 1984 by the British Labour Party ; the pickaxe and rifle used in communist Albania ; and the hammer and compasses of the East German emblem and flag. The Far Eastern Republic of Russia used an anchor crossed over a spade or pickaxe, symbolising the union of the fishermen and miners. The Fourth International , founded by Leon Trotsky , uses a hammer and sickle symbol on which the number 4 is superimposed. The hammer and sickle in the Fourth International symbol are the opposite of other hammer and sickle symbols in that the head of the hammer is on the right side and the sickle end tip on the left. The Trotskyist League for the Fifth International merges a hammer with the number 5, using the number's lower arch to form the sickle. A sickle with a rifle is also used by the People's Mojahedin of Iran .

The Communist Party of Britain uses the hammer and dove symbol . Designed in 1988 by Michal Boncza, it is intended to highlight the party's connection to the peace movement. It is usually used in conjunction with the hammer and sickle, and it appears on all of the CPB's publications. Some members of the CPB prefer one symbol over the other, although the party's 1994 congress reaffirmed the hammer and dove's position as the official emblem of the party. Similarly, the Communist Party of Israel uses a dove over the hammer and sickle as its symbol. The flag of the Guadeloupe Communist Party uses a sickle, turned to look like a majuscule G , to represent Guadeloupe .

Art [ edit ] The hammer and sickle has long been a common theme in socialist realism, but it has also seen some depiction in non-Marxist popular culture.

Andy Warhol who created many drawings and photographs of the hammer and sickle is the most famous example of this.

The metro station, Plošča Lienina , Minsk Sándor Pinczehelyi, Hammer and Sickle A tableau in a communist rally in Kerala , India "Worker, peasant and the intellectual " in front of the Juche Tower , Pyongyang The Hoof and Horn flag described in the book Animal Farm is a parody of the hammer and sickle.

Legal status [ edit ] See also: Red star § Legal status , and Bans on communist symbols In several countries in the former Eastern Bloc , there are laws that define the hammer and sickle as the symbol of a " totalitarian and criminal ideology" and the public display of the hammer and sickle and other Communist symbols such as the red star is considered a criminal offence.

Georgia , [ 19 ] Hungary , [ 20 ] Latvia , [ 21 ] Lithuania , [ 22 ] Moldova (1 October 2012 – 4 June 2013) [ 23 ] and Ukraine [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] have banned communist symbols including this one. A similar law was considered in Estonia , [ 27 ] but it eventually failed in a parliamentary committee.

[ 28 ] In Ukraine, the legislature equates communist symbols including hammer with sickle to Nazi swastika symbols.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] In 2010, the Lithuanian , Latvian , Bulgarian , Hungarian , Romanian , and Czech governments called for the European Union to criminalize "the approval, denial or belittling of communist crimes" similar to how a number of EU member states have banned Holocaust denial . The European Commission turned down this request, finding after a study that the criteria for EU-wide criminal legislation were not met, leaving individual member states to determine the extent to which they wished to handle past totalitarian crimes.

[ 31 ] In February 2013, the Constitutional Court of Hungary annulled the ban on the use of symbols of fascist and communist dictatorships, including the hammer and sickle, the red star and the swastika, saying the ban was too broad and imprecise.
