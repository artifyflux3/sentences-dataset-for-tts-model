[ 2 ] [ 3 ] She is sometimes known in modern popular literature as Mariam al-Asṭurlābiyya ( Arabic : مريم الأسطرلابية ) but her supposed first name 'Mariam' is not mentioned in the only known source about her life.

Life [ edit ] According to ibn al-Nadim , she was the daughter of another astrolabe maker known as al-ʻIjliyy; [ 3 ] she and her father were apprentices ( tilmīthah ) of an astrolabe maker from Baghdad, Nasṭūlus .

[ 3 ] Al-ʻIjliyyah manufactured astrolabes , an astronomical instrument, during the 10th century; [ 1 ] [ 4 ] she was employed by the first Emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla , who reigned from 944 to 967.

[ 3 ] [ 1 ] Beyond that information, nothing is known about her. Her supposed name, "Mariam", is not supported by sources from her time, and the phrase "al-Asturlabiyy" in the names by which she and her father are known simply means "the astrolabist", and indicates their profession; astrolabes were long known by her time.

Legacy [ edit ] The main-belt asteroid 7060 Al-ʻIjliya , discovered by Henry E. Holt at Palomar Observatory in 1990, was named in her honor.

[ 2 ] The naming citation was published on 14 November 2016 ( M.P.C.

102252 ).

[ 5 ] She inspired a character in the 2015 award-winning book Binti and Netflix series Vikings: Valhalla .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] She was named an extraordinary woman from the Islamic Golden Age by 1001 Inventions.
