Geometrically, it generalizes a quotient of a scheme or a variety by a group : a quotient variety, say, would be a coarse approximation of a quotient stack.

The notion is of fundamental importance in the study of stacks: a stack that arises in nature is often either a quotient stack itself or admits a stratification by quotient stacks (e.g., a Deligne–Mumford stack .) A quotient stack is also used to construct other stacks like classifying stacks .

Definition [ edit ] A quotient stack is defined as follows. Let G be an affine smooth group scheme over a scheme S and X an S -scheme on which G acts . Let the quotient stack [ X / G ] {\displaystyle [X/G]} be the category over the category of S -schemes, where an object over T is a principal G -bundle P → → T {\displaystyle P\to T} together with equivariant map P → → X {\displaystyle P\to X} ; a morphism from P → → T {\displaystyle P\to T} to P ′ → → T ′ {\displaystyle P'\to T'} is a bundle map (i.e., forms a commutative diagram) that is compatible with the equivariant maps P → → X {\displaystyle P\to X} and P ′ → → X {\displaystyle P'\to X} .

Suppose the quotient X / G {\displaystyle X/G} exists as an algebraic space (for example, by the Keel–Mori theorem ). The canonical map [ X / G ] → → X / G {\displaystyle [X/G]\to X/G} , that sends a bundle P over T to a corresponding T -point, [ 1 ] need not be an isomorphism of stacks; that is, the space "X/G" is usually coarser. The canonical map is an isomorphism if and only if the stabilizers are trivial (in which case X / G {\displaystyle X/G} exists.) [ citation needed ] In general, [ X / G ] {\displaystyle [X/G]} is an Artin stack (also called algebraic stack). If the stabilizers of the geometric points are finite and reduced, then it is a Deligne–Mumford stack .

Burt Totaro ( 2004 ) has shown: let X be a normal Noetherian algebraic stack whose stabilizer groups at closed points are affine. Then X is a quotient stack if and only if it has the resolution property ; i.e., every coherent sheaf is a quotient of a vector bundle. Earlier, Robert Wayne Thomason proved that a quotient stack has the resolution property.

Remark: It is possible to approach the construction from the point of view of simplicial sheaves .

Examples [ edit ] An effective quotient orbifold , e.g., [ M / G ] {\displaystyle [M/G]} where the G {\displaystyle G} action has only finite stabilizers on the smooth space M {\displaystyle M} , is an example of a quotient stack.

[ 3 ] If X = S {\displaystyle X=S} with trivial action of G {\displaystyle G} (often S {\displaystyle S} is a point), then [ S / G ] {\displaystyle [S/G]} is called the classifying stack of G {\displaystyle G} (in analogy with the classifying space of G {\displaystyle G} ) and is usually denoted by B G {\displaystyle BG} .

Borel's theorem describes the cohomology ring of the classifying stack.

Moduli of line bundles [ edit ] One of the basic examples of quotient stacks comes from the moduli stack B G m {\displaystyle B\mathbb {G} _{m}} of line bundles [ ∗ ∗ / G m ] {\displaystyle [*/\mathbb {G} _{m}]} over Sch {\displaystyle {\text{Sch}}} , or [ S / G m ] {\displaystyle [S/\mathbb {G} _{m}]} over Sch / S {\displaystyle {\text{Sch}}/S} for the trivial G m {\displaystyle \mathbb {G} _{m}} -action on S {\displaystyle S} . For any scheme (or S {\displaystyle S} -scheme) X {\displaystyle X} , the X {\displaystyle X} -points of the moduli stack are the groupoid of principal G m {\displaystyle \mathbb {G} _{m}} -bundles P → → X {\displaystyle P\to X} .

Moduli of line bundles with n-sections [ edit ] There is another closely related moduli stack given by [ A n / G m ] {\displaystyle [\mathbb {A} ^{n}/\mathbb {G} _{m}]} which is the moduli stack of line bundles with n {\displaystyle n} -sections. This follows directly from the definition of quotient stacks evaluated on points. For a scheme X {\displaystyle X} , the X {\displaystyle X} -points are the groupoid whose objects are given by the set [ A n / G m ] ( X ) = { P → → A n ↓ ↓ X : P → → A n is G m equivariant and P → → X is a principal G m -bundle } {\displaystyle [\mathbb {A} ^{n}/\mathbb {G} _{m}](X)=\left\{{\begin{matrix}P&\to &\mathbb {A} ^{n}\\\downarrow &&\\X\end{matrix}}:{\begin{aligned}&P\to \mathbb {A} ^{n}{\text{ is }}\mathbb {G} _{m}{\text{ equivariant and}}\\&P\to X{\text{ is a principal }}\mathbb {G} _{m}{\text{-bundle}}\end{aligned}}\right\}} The morphism in the top row corresponds to the n {\displaystyle n} -sections of the associated line bundle over X {\displaystyle X} . This can be found by noting giving a G m {\displaystyle \mathbb {G} _{m}} -equivariant map ϕ ϕ : P → → A 1 {\displaystyle \phi :P\to \mathbb {A} ^{1}} and restricting it to the fiber P | x {\displaystyle P|_{x}} gives the same data as a section σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } of the bundle. This can be checked by looking at a chart and sending a point x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} to the map ϕ ϕ x {\displaystyle \phi _{x}} , noting the set of G m {\displaystyle \mathbb {G} _{m}} -equivariant maps P | x → → A 1 {\displaystyle P|_{x}\to \mathbb {A} ^{1}} is isomorphic to G m {\displaystyle \mathbb {G} _{m}} . This construction then globalizes by gluing affine charts together, giving a global section of the bundle. Since G m {\displaystyle \mathbb {G} _{m}} -equivariant maps to A n {\displaystyle \mathbb {A} ^{n}} is equivalently an n {\displaystyle n} -tuple of G m {\displaystyle \mathbb {G} _{m}} -equivariant maps to A 1 {\displaystyle \mathbb {A} ^{1}} , the result holds.

Moduli of formal group laws [ edit ] Example: [ 4 ] Let L be the Lazard ring ; i.e., L = π π ∗ ∗ MU {\displaystyle L=\pi _{*}\operatorname {MU} } . Then the quotient stack [ Spec ⁡ ⁡ L / G ] {\displaystyle [\operatorname {Spec} L/G]} by G {\displaystyle G} , G ( R ) = { g ∈ ∈ R [ [ t ] ] | g ( t ) = b 0 t + b 1 t 2 + ⋯ ⋯ , b 0 ∈ ∈ R × × } {\displaystyle G(R)=\{g\in R[\![t]\!]|g(t)=b_{0}t+b_{1}t^{2}+\cdots ,b_{0}\in R^{\times }\}} , is called the moduli stack of formal group laws , denoted by M FG {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}_{\text{FG}}} .
