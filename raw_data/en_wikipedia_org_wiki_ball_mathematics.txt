In [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), a **ball** is the volume bounded by a sphere

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **ball** is the [solid figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_geometry "Solid geometry") bounded by a _[sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere")_; it is also called a **solid sphere**.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics)#cite_note-1) It may be a **closed ball** (including the [boundary points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_points "Boundary points") that constitute the sphere) or an **open ball** (excluding them).

These concepts are defined not only in three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") but also for lower and higher dimensions, and for [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") in general. A _ball_ in n dimensions is called a **hyperball** or **n-ball** and is bounded by a _hypersphere_ or [(_n_−1)-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere"). Thus, for example, a ball in the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") is the same thing as a [disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)"), the [planar region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_region "Planar region") bounded by a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"). In [Euclidean 3-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), a ball is taken to be the [region of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_of_space "Region of space") bounded by a [2-dimensional sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-sphere "2-sphere"). In a [one-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional_space "One-dimensional space"), a ball is a [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment").

In other contexts, such as in [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") and informal use, _sphere_ is sometimes used to mean _ball_. In the field of [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") the closed ![Image 2: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-dimensional ball is often denoted as ![Image 3: {\displaystyle B^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7cc008f3b356b77d960b4b7e4586d20a1dd9dfe4) or ![Image 4: {\displaystyle D^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2303f762ed832af70154f7f9d06a6a7b673c5085) while the open ![Image 5: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-dimensional ball is ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} B^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20e92c03ba6fed81ff2a4e062d78bd7f02955d9b) or ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} D^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e0d128fa3bd2f0d559ac8222912023022a7d351f).

In Euclidean n-space, an (open) n-ball of radius r and center x is the set of all points of distance less than r from x. A closed n-ball of radius r is the set of all points of distance less than or equal to r away from x.

In Euclidean n-space, every ball is bounded by a [hypersphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersphere "Hypersphere"). The ball is a bounded [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") when _n_ = 1, is a **[disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)")** bounded by a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") when _n_ = 2, and is bounded by a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") when _n_ = 3.

The n-dimensional volume of a Euclidean ball of radius _r_ in _n_-dimensional Euclidean space is given by [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics)#cite_note-2)![Image 8: {\displaystyle V_{n}(r)={\frac {\pi ^{\frac {n}{2}}}{\Gamma {\left({\frac {n}{2}}+1\right)}}}r^{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b9d62c968be671e50deefc2471d804a74430bf51) where Γ is [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler")'s [gamma function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function "Gamma function") (which can be thought of as an extension of the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial "Factorial") function to fractional arguments). Using explicit formulas for [particular values of the gamma function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular_values_of_the_gamma_function "Particular values of the gamma function") at the integers and half integers gives formulas for the volume of a Euclidean ball that do not require an evaluation of the gamma function. These are: ![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}V_{2k}(r)&={\frac {\pi ^{k}}{k!}}r^{2k}\,,\\[2pt]V_{2k+1}(r)&={\frac {2^{k+1}\pi ^{k}}{\left(2k+1\right)!!}}r^{2k+1}={\frac {2\left(k!\right)\left(4\pi \right)^{k}}{\left(2k+1\right)!}}r^{2k+1}\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f89ca477f307c13de64810b321d09346d6a7377f)

In the formula for odd-dimensional volumes, the [double factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_factorial "Double factorial")(2 _k_ + 1)!! is defined for odd integers 2 _k_ + 1 as (2 _k_ + 1)!! = 1 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 ⋅ ⋯ ⋅ (2 _k_ − 1) ⋅ (2 _k_ + 1).

In general metric spaces
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ball_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: In general metric spaces")]

Let (_M_, _d_) be a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"), namely a set M with a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)") (distance function) d, and let ⁠![Image 10: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538)⁠ be a positive real number. The open (metric) **ball of radius**r centered at a point p in M, usually denoted by _B r_(_p_) or _B_(_p_; _r_), is defined the same way as a Euclidean ball, as the set of points in M of distance less than r away from p, ![Image 11: {\displaystyle B_{r}(p)=\{x\in M\mid d(x,p)<r\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d8686f6de47bd60f16d76ebaaa724f6171ad41ab)

The _closed_ (metric) ball, sometimes denoted _B r_[_p_] or _B_[_p_; _r_], is likewise defined as the set of points of distance less than or equal to r away from p, ![Image 12: {\displaystyle B_{r}[p]=\{x\in M\mid d(x,p)\leq r\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97410ad1bcfd5d3cf7fd3a7cd6d9dcbb16eb6532)

In particular, a ball (open or closed) always includes p itself, since the definition requires _r_> 0. A **[unit ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_ball "Unit ball")** (open or closed) is a ball of radius 1.

A ball in a general metric space need not be round. For example, a ball in [real coordinate space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space "Real coordinate space") under the [Chebyshev distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance "Chebyshev distance") is a [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube "Hypercube"), and a ball under the [taxicab distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_distance "Taxicab distance") is a [cross-polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-polytope "Cross-polytope"). A closed ball also need not be [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space"). For example, a closed ball in any infinite-dimensional [normed vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space "Normed vector space") is never compact. However, a ball in a vector space will always be [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set "Convex set") as a consequence of the triangle inequality.

A subset of a metric space is [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set "Bounded set") if it is contained in some ball. A set is [totally bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally_bounded "Totally bounded") if, given any positive radius, it is covered by finitely many balls of that radius.

The open balls of a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") can serve as a [base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(topology) "Base (topology)"), giving this space a [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), the open sets of which are all possible [unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory) "Union (set theory)") of open balls. This topology on a metric space is called the **topology induced by** the metric d.

Let ![Image 13: {\displaystyle {\overline {B_{r}(p)}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8bac379651ad5c007b49869fbfa6af24a2cf3cc8) denote the [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(topology) "Closure (topology)") of the open ball ![Image 14: {\displaystyle B_{r}(p)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38142f107d23ceee9c99f650ab067fcbf2c28ac8) in this topology. While it is always the case that ![Image 15: {\displaystyle B_{r}(p)\subseteq {\overline {B_{r}(p)}}\subseteq B_{r}[p],}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d2286a76161dba32f17651a80c0983f18d648b6) it is _not_ always the case that ![Image 16: {\displaystyle {\overline {B_{r}(p)}}=B_{r}[p].}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9b2c843ccd5de0ad4206f76cbe72d3eb256086c8) For example, in a metric space ![Image 17: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) with the [discrete metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_metric "Discrete metric"), one has ![Image 18: {\displaystyle {\overline {B_{1}(p)}}=\{p\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c2290f814a7a90984a5ac97fdf05d896c11bf4c) but ![Image 19: {\displaystyle B_{1}[p]=X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0ad7882d621699a99a746dc473c5600035f365de) for any ![Image 20: {\displaystyle p\in X.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/180e351f0e4c54e950e0cb08086ccd789e0d76b5)

In normed vector spaces

The Euclidean balls discussed earlier are an example of balls in a normed vector space.

The _L_ 2-norm, known as the Euclidean metric, generates the well known disks within circles, and for other values of p, the corresponding balls are areas bounded by [Lamé curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lam%C3%A9_curve "Lamé curve") (hypoellipses or hyperellipses).

For _n_ = 3, the _L_ 1-balls are within octahedra with axes-aligned _body diagonals_, the _L_∞-balls are within cubes with axes-aligned _edges_, and the boundaries of balls for L p with _p_> 2 are [superellipsoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superellipsoid "Superellipsoid"). _p_ = 2 generates the inner of usual spheres.

### General convex norm

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ball_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: General convex norm")]

More generally, given any [centrally symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_symmetry "Central symmetry"), [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set "Bounded set"), [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set"), and [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set "Convex set") subset X of **R**_n_, one can define a [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) "Norm (mathematics)") on **R**_n_ where the balls are all translated and uniformly scaled copies of X. Note this theorem does not hold if "open" subset is replaced by "closed" subset, because the origin point qualifies but does not define a norm on**R**_n_.

In topological spaces
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ball_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: In topological spaces")]

One may talk about balls in any [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space")X, not necessarily induced by a metric. An (open or closed) n-dimensional **topological ball** of X is any subset of X which is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to an (open or closed) Euclidean n-ball. Topological n-balls are important in [combinatorial topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_topology "Combinatorial topology"), as the building blocks of [cell complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_complex "Cell complex").

Any open topological n-ball is homeomorphic to the Cartesian space **R**_n_ and to the open [unit n-cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube "Hypercube") (hypercube) (0, 1)_n_ ⊆ **R**_n_. Any closed topological n-ball is homeomorphic to the closed n-cube [0, 1]_n_.

An n-ball is homeomorphic to an m-ball if and only if _n_ = _m_. The homeomorphisms between an open n-ball B and **R**_n_ can be classified in two classes, that can be identified with the two possible [topological orientations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(mathematics) "Orientation (mathematics)") of B.

A topological n-ball need not be [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"); if it is smooth, it need not be [diffeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphic "Diffeomorphic") to a Euclidean n-ball.

A number of special regions can be defined for a ball:

*   _[cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical\_cap "Spherical cap")_, bounded by one plane
*   _[sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical\_sector "Spherical sector")_, bounded by a conical boundary with apex at the center of the sphere
*   _[segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical\_segment "Spherical segment")_, bounded by a pair of parallel planes
*   _[shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical\_shell "Spherical shell")_, bounded by two concentric spheres of differing radii
*   _[wedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical\_wedge "Spherical wedge")_, bounded by two planes passing through a sphere center and the surface of the sphere
