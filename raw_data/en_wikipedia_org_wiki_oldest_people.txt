Jeanne Calment (here depicted at age 20 in 1895) holds the record for the longest documented lifespan with 122 years and 164 days.

The following are tables of the oldest people in the world in ordinal ranks . To avoid including false or unconfirmed claims of old age , names here are restricted to those people whose ages have been validated by an international body dealing in longevity research, such as the Gerontology Research Group , LongeviQuest , or Guinness World Records , and others who have otherwise been reliably sourced .

The longest documented and verified human lifespan is that of Jeanne Calment of France (1875–1997), a woman who lived to the age of 122 years and 164 days. As women live longer than men on average , women predominate in combined records. The longest lifespan for a man is that of Jiroemon Kimura of Japan (1897–2013), who lived to the age of 116 years and 54 days.

The oldest living person in the world whose age has been validated is Ethel Caterham of the United Kingdom , who has lived 115 years, 361 days. She was born on 21 August 1909.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The oldest living verified man is João Marinho Neto of Brazil , who has lived 112 years, 316 days. He was born on 5 October 1912.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] Ten oldest verified people Main article: List of the verified oldest people Systematic verification of longevity has only been practiced since the 1950s and only in certain parts of the world. All ten oldest verified people ever are female.

The longest documented and verified human lifespan is that of Jeanne Calment of France, a woman who lived to age 122 years and 164 days.

[ 4 ] She received news media attention in 1985, after turning 110. Calment's claim was investigated and authenticated by Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard for the Gerontology Research Group (GRG).

[ 5 ] Her longevity claim was put into question in 2018, but the original assessing team stood by their judgement.
