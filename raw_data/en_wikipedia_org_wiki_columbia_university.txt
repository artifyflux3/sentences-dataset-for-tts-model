It was first established in 1754 as King's College by royal charter under George II of Great Britain on the grounds of Trinity Church in Manhattan .

It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolution , and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students Alexander Hamilton and John Jay . In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in Morningside Heights and renamed Columbia University. It is the oldest institution of higher education in New York and the fifth- oldest in the United States .

Columbia is organized into twenty schools, including four undergraduate schools and 16 graduate schools. The university's research efforts include the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory , the Goddard Institute for Space Studies , and accelerator laboratories with Big Tech firms such as Amazon and IBM .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Columbia is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the MD degree .

[ 11 ] The university also administers and annually awards the Pulitzer Prize .

Columbia scientists and scholars have played a pivotal role in scientific breakthroughs including brain–computer interface ; the laser and maser ; [ 12 ] [ 13 ] nuclear magnetic resonance ; [ 14 ] the first nuclear pile ; the first nuclear fission reaction in the Americas ; the first evidence for plate tectonics and continental drift ; [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] and much of the initial research and planning for the Manhattan Project during World War II .

As of December 2021 [update] , its alumni, faculty, and staff have included 7 of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America; [ a ] 4 U.S. presidents ; [ b ] 34 foreign heads of state or government ; [ c ] 2 secretaries-general of the United Nations; [ n 1 ] 10 justices of the United States Supreme Court ; 103 Nobel laureates ; 125 National Academy of Sciences members; [ 59 ] 53 living billionaires; [ 60 ] 23 Olympic medalists ; [ 61 ] 33 Academy Award winners; and 125 Pulitzer Prize  recipients.

History Main article: History of Columbia University 18th century Samuel Johnson , the first president of Columbia Discussions regarding the founding of a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Classes were initially held in July 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president, Samuel Johnson who was an Anglican Priest.

[ 64 ] : 8–10 [ 65 ] : 3 The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of George II , [ 66 ] [ 67 ] making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the State of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.

[ 11 ] In 1763, Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by Myles Cooper , a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford , and an ardent Tory . In the charged political climate of the American Revolution , his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, Alexander Hamilton .

[ 65 ] : 3 The Irish anatomist, Samuel Clossy , was appointed professor of natural philosophy in October 1765 and later the college's first professor of anatomy in 1767.

[ 68 ] King's College Hall in 1790 The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the Continental Army . The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] The 1797 Taylor Map of New York City , showing "The Colledge [sic]" at its Park Place (then Robinson Street) location and its earlier location, Trinity Church , on the lower left The legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed "an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College".

[ 64 ] The Act created a board of regents to oversee the resuscitation of King's College, and, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the legislature stipulated that "the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of Columbia College ", [ 64 ] a reference to Columbia , an alternative name for America which in turn comes from the name of Christopher Columbus . The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college granted the power to a separate board of 24 trustees .

[ 71 ] : 65–70 For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. President George Washington and Vice President John Adams , in addition to both houses of Congress attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution .

[ 64 ] : 74 The library and law school buildings, both constructed in a Gothic and Revival style, on the Madison Avenue campus 19th century Low Memorial Library , c.

1900 Alma Mater , by Daniel Chester French (1903) In November 1813, the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, a new school created by the Regents of New York, forming Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons .

[ 71 ] : 53–60 In 1857, the college moved from the King's College campus at Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th Street and Madison Avenue , where it remained for the next forty years.

During the last half of the 19th century, under the presidency of Frederick A. P. Barnard , for whom Barnard College is named, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university. Barnard College was created in 1889 as a response to the university's refusal to accept women.

[ 72 ] In 1896, university president Seth Low moved the campus from 49th Street to its present location, a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of Morningside Heights .

[ 64 ] [ 73 ] Under the leadership of Low's successor, Nicholas Murray Butler , who served for over four decades, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the multiversity model that later universities would adopt.

[ 11 ] Prior to becoming the president of Columbia University, Butler founded Teachers College , as a school to prepare home economists and manual art teachers for the children of the poor, with philanthropist Grace Hoadley Dodge .

[ 62 ] Teachers College is currently affiliated as the university's Graduate School of Education.

[ 11 ] 20th century See also: Columbia University protests of 1968 and Student activism at Columbia University In the 1940s, faculty members, including John R. Dunning , I. I. Rabi , Enrico Fermi , and Polykarp Kusch , began what became the Manhattan Project , creating the first nuclear fission reactor in the Americas and researching gaseous diffusion .

[ 74 ] In 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College.

[ 62 ] [ 75 ] The college was closed in 1936 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently taught at Morningside Heights, although they did not belong to any college but to the university at large.

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] There was an evening school called University Extension, which taught night classes, for a fee, to anyone willing to attend.

In 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the School of General Studies in response to the return of GIs after World War II .

[ 78 ] In 1995, the School of General Studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more, or are pursuing dual-degrees) and was fully integrated into Columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum.

[ 79 ] The same year, the Division of Special Programs, later called the School of Continuing Education and now the School of Professional Studies , was established to reprise the former role of University Extension.

[ 80 ] While the School of Professional Studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages, it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields.

[ 81 ] In the aftermath of World War II, the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university, and in response, the School of International and Public Affairs was founded in 1946, drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science, economics, and history.

[ 82 ] The Columbia University Bicentennial was celebrated in 1954.

[ 83 ] During the 1960s, student activism reached a climax with protests in the spring of 1968 , when hundreds of students occupied buildings on campus. The incident forced the resignation of Columbia's president, Grayson Kirk , and the establishment of the University Senate.

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] Though several schools in the university had admitted women for years, Columbia College first admitted women in the fall of 1983, [ 86 ] after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College , the all-female institution affiliated with the university, to merge the two schools.

[ 87 ] Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia, and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.

[ 88 ] During the late 20th century, the university underwent significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university. For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences .

[ 89 ] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts , and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools.

21st century Lee C. Bollinger became Columbia's 19th president in June 2002, [ 90 ] succeeding George Rupp.

[ 91 ] He was appointed in October 2001 after arriving from the presidency of the University of Michigan.

[ 92 ] [ 93 ] Key initiatives included the Manhattanville campus expansion into West Harlem, addressing space needs.

[ 94 ] Bollinger launched the World Leaders Forum [ 95 ] and aimed to increase international student numbers.

[ 95 ] He appointed key leaders like Jeffrey Sachs ( Earth Institute ), [ 96 ] Alan Brinkley (Provost), [ 95 ] Nicholas Lemann (Journalism), David Hirsch (Research), [ 97 ] and Nicholas Dirks (Arts & Sciences).

[ 98 ] Bollinger was the defendant in the Supreme Court's 2003 affirmative action cases ( Gratz and Grutter ), resulting in a split decision.

[ 92 ] [ 95 ] He consistently defended free speech principles during campus controversies involving faculty and students.

[ 95 ] The university publicly launched a record $4 billion capital campaign in September 2006. Financial aid was improved, eliminating loans for undergraduates from families earning under $50,000, supported by a major gift from trustee Gerry Lenfest .

[ 99 ] Globalization efforts continued with the World Leaders Forum and the creation of the Committee on Global Thought, chaired by Joseph Stiglitz . Columbia faculty received multiple Nobel Prizes: Richard Axel and Linda Buck (Medicine, 2004), Edmund Phelps (Economics, 2006), and Orhan Pamuk (Literature, 2006).

Václav Havel joined the faculty.

Controversy erupted over a planned 2006 invitation to Iranian President Ahmadinejad, which was ultimately canceled due to logistical and security issues. Later that year, a campus event featuring Minuteman Project speakers was disrupted by protesters. Bollinger strongly condemned the disruption, reaffirming free speech principles while stating protesters do not have the right to silence speakers. Several students faced disciplinary action, and non-affiliated individuals involved were banned from campus.

[ 100 ] The 2008 financial crisis impacted Columbia's endowment, but less than peers as only 13% of the operating budget reliant on the endowment (compared to higher percentages at peers like Harvard ).

[ 101 ] The endowment recovered, hitting $8.2B in Oct 2013. Despite the downturn, Columbia pressed on with Manhattanville construction, receiving final state approval in June 2009. Major gifts fueled progress, including $400M from John Kluge upon his death, $50M from the Vagelos family for the Medical Center, $100M from Henry Kravis for the Business School, $30M from Gerry Lenfest for an Arts center, and $200M from Mortimer Zuckerman for the Mind, Brain, Behavior Institute.

[ 102 ] Following the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," the University Senate voted 51–17 to invite ROTC back after a 40-year absence, and Bollinger announced an agreement with the Navy. Columbia expanded its Global Centers network (Amman, Beijing, Mumbai, Paris, Nairobi, Istanbul, Santiago), aiming to increase global engagement and international student enrollment (11% in CC in 2011, targeted higher).

[ 103 ] From 2014 to 2021, Columbia University pursued significant physical expansion, notably opening major facilities on the Manhattanville campus (ZMBBI, Lenfest Center, The Forum). Key strategic initiatives launched included the Knight First Amendment Institute , Columbia World Projects, and the new Columbia Climate School (2020). A $5 billion university capital campaign was launched (with a $1.5B A&S target), major gifts like $50M for A&S's Uris Hall renovation were secured, and the endowment grew significantly ($14.35B by mid-2021).

[ 104 ] The COVID-19 pandemic starting March 2020 prompted remote operations, hiring/salary freezes, budget cuts, substantial borrowing (~$700M cited), and unpopular retirement contribution cuts, intensifying financial pressures. Following accusations by Michael Thaddeus , a Columbia math professor, that Columbia submitted inaccurate data for college rankings, U.S. News removed the university from its 2022 list, and Columbia later announced it would no longer participate.

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ] NYPD cleaning the original encampment on the East Lawn, shortly after the arrests, April 18, 2024 Beginning in fall 2023, protests at Columbia University regarding the Gaza war resulted in police action, student disciplinary measures, and a presidential resignation.

[ 109 ] The federal government then launched an investigation into antisemitism and threatened to withdraw funding, prompting the university to adopt stricter campus policies.

[ 110 ] In July 2025, Columbia finalized a $220 million settlement to resume federal funding, agreeing to provide applicant data and other policy changes while admitting no wrongdoing.

[ 111 ] Campus Morningside Heights College Walk The majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights on Seth Low 's late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts planning principles by the architects McKim, Mead & White . Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks , or 32 acres (13 ha), in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system , more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.

[ 112 ] Butler Library Butler Library is the largest in the Columbia University Libraries system and one of the largest buildings on the campus. It was completed in 1934 and renamed to Butler Library in 1946.

[ 113 ] As of 2020 [update] , Columbia's library system includes over 15.0 million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.

[ 114 ] Several buildings on the Morningside Heights campus are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

Low Memorial Library , a National Historic Landmark and the centerpiece of the campus, is listed for its architectural significance.

Philosophy Hall is listed as the site of the invention of FM radio .

[ 115 ] Also listed is Pupin Hall , another National Historic Landmark , which houses the physics and astronomy departments. Here the first experiments on the fission of uranium were conducted by Enrico Fermi . The uranium atom was split there ten days after the world's first atom-splitting in Copenhagen , Denmark.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] Other buildings listed include Casa Italiana , the Delta Psi, Alpha Chapter building of St. Anthony Hall , Earl Hall , and the buildings of the affiliated Union Theological Seminary .

[ 118 ] [ 119 ] [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Union Theological Seminary A statue by sculptor Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater is centered on the front steps of Low Memorial Library . The statue represents a personification of the traditional image of the university as an alma mater , or "nourishing mother", draped in an academic gown and seated on a throne. She wears a laurel wreath on her head and holds in her right hand a scepter capped by a King's Crown, a traditional symbol of the university. A book, representing learning, rests on her lap. The arms of her throne end in lamps, representing "Sapientia et Doctrina", or "Wisdom and Learning"; on the back of the throne is embossed an image of the seal of the university .

[ 122 ] [ 123 ] The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college .

[ 124 ] [ 125 ] "The Steps", alternatively known as "Low Steps" or the "Urban Beach", are a popular meeting area for Columbia students. The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace.

[ 126 ] Panoramic view of the Morningside Heights campus as seen from Butler Library and facing Low Memorial Library Other campuses Lamont Campus entrance in Palisades , New York The entrance to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Washington Heights In April 2007, the university purchased more than two-thirds of a 17 acres (6.9 ha) site for a new campus in Manhattanville , an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street , Columbia Manhattanville houses buildings for Columbia's Business School, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia School of the Arts, and the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

[ 127 ] [ 128 ] The $7 billion expansion plan included demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant (the Studebaker Building , Prentis Hall , and the Nash Building), eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132 apartments. Replacing these buildings created 6.8 million square feet (630,000 m 2 ) of space for the university. Community activist groups in West Harlem fought the expansion for reasons ranging from property protection and fair exchange for land, to residents' rights.

[ 129 ] [ 130 ] Subsequent public hearings drew neighborhood opposition. As of December 2008 [update] , the State of New York's Empire State Development Corporation approved use of eminent domain, which, through declaration of Manhattanville's "blighted" status, gives governmental bodies the right to appropriate private property for public use.

[ 131 ] On May 20, 2009, the New York State Public Authorities Control Board approved the Manhanttanville expansion plan.

[ 132 ] NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital is affiliated with the medical schools of both Columbia University and Cornell University . According to U.S. News & World Report ' s "2020–21 Best Hospitals Honor Roll and Medical Specialties Rankings", it is ranked fourth overall and second among university hospitals.

[ 133 ] Columbia's medical school has a strategic partnership with New York State Psychiatric Institute , and is affiliated with 19 other hospitals in the U.S. and four hospitals in other countries. Health-related schools are located at the Columbia University Medical Center , a 20-acre (8.1 ha) campus located in the neighborhood of Washington Heights , fifty blocks uptown. Other teaching hospitals affiliated with Columbia through the NewYork-Presbyterian network include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan, and the Payne Whitney Westchester, a psychiatric institute located in White Plains, New York.

[ 134 ] On the northern tip of Manhattan island (in the neighborhood of Inwood ), Columbia owns the 26-acre (11 ha) Baker Field, which includes the Lawrence A. Wien Stadium as well as facilities for field sports, outdoor track, and tennis. There is a third campus on the west bank of the Hudson River , the 157-acre (64 ha) Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory and Earth Institute in Palisades , New York. A fourth is the 60-acre (24 ha) Nevis Laboratories in Irvington, New York , for the study of particle and motion physics. A satellite site in Paris holds classes at Reid Hall .

[ 11 ] Sustainability In 2006, the university established the Office of Environmental Stewardship to initiate, coordinate and implement programs to reduce the university's environmental footprint. The U.S. Green Building Council selected the university's Manhattanville plan for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Neighborhood Design pilot program.

[ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] Columbia has been rated "B+" by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.

[ 138 ] Access to Columbia is enhanced by the 116th Street–Columbia University subway station ( 1 train) on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line .

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S.

potential natural vegetation types, Columbia University would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak ( 104 ) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest ( 25 ).

[ 139 ] Transportation Columbia Transportation is the bus service of the university, operated by Academy Bus Lines . The buses are open to all Columbia faculty, students, Dodge Fitness Center members, and anyone else who holds a Columbia ID card. In addition, all TSC students can ride the buses.

[ 140 ] In the New York City Subway , the train serves the university at 116th Street-Columbia University . The M4 , M104 and M60 buses stop on Broadway while the M11 stops on Amsterdam Avenue.

The main campus is primarily boxed off by the streets of Amsterdam Avenue, Broadway , 114th street, and 120th street, with some buildings, including Barnard College, located just outside the area. The nearest major highway is the Henry Hudson Parkway ( NY 9A ) to the west of the campus. It is located 3.4 miles (5.5 km) south of the George Washington Bridge .

[ 143 ] Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516.

[ 144 ] In 2015–2016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).

[ 145 ] The college is need-blind for domestic applicants.

[ 146 ] On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400 million donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education.

[ 147 ] However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies.

[ 148 ] In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application . The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.

[ 149 ] Scholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee. Designations include John W. Kluge Scholars, John Jay Scholars, C. Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars "distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences".

[ 150 ] In 1919, Columbia established a student application process characterized by The New York Times as "the first modern college application". The application required a photograph of the applicant, the maiden name of the applicant's mother, and the applicant's religious background.

[ 153 ] Its official corporate name is Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York .

In 1754, the university's first charter was granted by King George II ; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature.
Columbia has four official undergraduate colleges: Columbia College , the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree; the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering), the engineering and applied science school offering the Bachelor of Science degree; the School of General Studies , the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree to non-traditional students undertaking full- or part-time study; and Barnard College .

[ 154 ] [ 155 ] Barnard College is a women's liberal arts college and an academic affiliate in which students receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University. Their degrees are signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.

(2003), Stand, Columbia: A History of Columbia University in the City of New York, 1754–2004 , New York: Columbia University Press, p. 177, ISBN 0-231-13008-2 , Several developments at Columbia in the 1890s helped separate, or at least dramatize, the break with what had gone before and what would come later. The first was a formal change in name, giving the institution the fourth in its history. It began in 1754 as King's College and became in 1784 and remained for three years thereafter Columbia College in the State of New York. From 1787 until 1896 Columbia was officially Columbia College in the City of New York, until, by trustee resolution on May 2, 1896, it became Columbia University in the City of New York.<Footnote 2: Columbia University Trustees Minutes, January 8, 1912.
