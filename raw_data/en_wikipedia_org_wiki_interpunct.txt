An **interpunct****·**, also known as an **interpoint**,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-1)**middle dot**, **middot**, **centered dot** or **centred dot**, is a punctuation mark consisting of a vertically centered dot used for [interword separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interword_separation "Interword separation") in [Classical Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Latin "Classical Latin"). ([Word-separating spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation) "Space (punctuation)") did not appear until some time between 600 and 800[CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era "Common Era").) It appears in a variety of uses in some modern languages.

The **[multiplication dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#In_mathematics_and_science)** or "dot operator" is frequently used in mathematical and scientific notation, and it may differ in appearance from the interpunct.

In written language

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interpunct&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: In written language")]

Various dictionaries use the interpunct (in this context, sometimes called a hyphenation point) to indicate where to split a word and insert a hyphen if the word doesn't fit on the line. There is also a separate Unicode character, U+2027‧HYPHENATION POINT.

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Mayflower_Compact_Bradford.jpg/250px-Mayflower_Compact_Bradford.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mayflower_Compact_Bradford.jpg)

Bradford's transcription of the [Mayflower Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower_Compact "Mayflower Compact")

In [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English")[typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography"), the **space dot** was once used as the formal [decimal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_point "Decimal point"). Its use was advocated by laws and can still be found in some UK-based academic journals such as _[The Lancet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Lancet "The Lancet")_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-2) When the [pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling") was [decimalised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimalisation "Decimalisation") in 1971, the official advice issued was to write decimal amounts with a raised point (for example, `£21·48`) and to use a decimal point "on the line" only when typesetting constraints made it unavoidable. However, this usage had already been declining since the 1968 ruling by the [Ministry of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Technology "Ministry of Technology") to use the [full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") as the decimal point,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-3) not only because of that ruling but also because the standard [UK keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_keyboard_layout "UK keyboard layout") (for typewriters and computers) has only the full stop.

In the early modern era, full stops (periods) were sometimes written as interpuncts (for example in the depicted 1646 transcription of the [Mayflower Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower_Compact "Mayflower Compact")).

In the artificially constructed [Shavian alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavian_alphabet "Shavian alphabet"), interpuncts are used instead of [capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization "Capitalization") as the marker of proper nouns. The dot is placed at the beginning of a word.

The **_punt volat_** ("flying point") is used in [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language "Catalan language") between two [Ls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L "L") in cases where each belongs to a separate syllable, for example _cel·la_, "cell". This distinguishes such "[geminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminate "Geminate") Ls" (_ela geminada_), which are pronounced [[ɫ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velarized_alveolar_lateral_approximant "Velarized alveolar lateral approximant")ː], from "double L" (_doble ela_), which are written without the flying point and are pronounced [[ʎ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_palatal_lateral_approximant "Voiced palatal lateral approximant")]. In situations where the flying point is unavailable, [periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_mark "Period mark") (as in _col.lecció_) or [hyphens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen") (as in _col-lecció_) are frequently used as substitutes, but this is tolerated rather than encouraged.

Historically, medieval Catalan also used the symbol · as a marker for certain [elisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision "Elision"), much like the modern apostrophe (see [Occitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#Occitan) below) and [hyphenations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabification "Syllabification").

There is no separate physical [keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout "Keyboard layout") for Catalan: the flying point can be typed using ⇧ Shift+3 in the [Spanish (Spain) layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#Spanish "QWERTY") or with Option +⇧ Shift+9 on a US English layout. On a mobile phone with a Catalan keyboard layout, the geminate L with a flying dot appears when holding down the L key. It appears in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") as the [pre-composed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomposed_character "Precomposed character") letters Ŀ (U+013F) and ŀ (U+0140), but they are [compatibility characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_compatibility_characters "Unicode compatibility characters") and are not frequently used or recommended.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-4)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-5)

The interpunct or "partition sign" is used in [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language") (which generally lacks spacing between [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters "Chinese characters")) to mark divisions in words [transliterated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration_into_Chinese_characters "Transliteration into Chinese characters") from [phonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonogram_(linguistics) "Phonogram (linguistics)") languages, particularly names. Some fonts and software render U+00B7·MIDDLE DOT as double-width if it is between double-width characters, Chinese standards recommend half-width between Arabic numerals.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-6) In Taiwan, the formal standard, as defined by CNS 11643, historically specified U+2027‧HYPHENATION POINT,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-7) while U+30FB・KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT should be primarily used in Japanese contexts for separating [Katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana") words. When the Chinese text is [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese "Romanization of Chinese"), the partition sign is simply replaced by a standard space or other appropriate punctuation. Thus, [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare") is written as 威廉·莎士比亞 (_Wēilián Shāshìbǐyà_) and [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush") as 乔治·W. 布什 (喬治·W. 布殊; _Qiáozhì W. Bùshí_).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-8)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-9) Titles and other translated words are not similarly marked: [Genghis Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan "Genghis Khan") and [Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II "Elizabeth II") are simply 成吉思汗 (_Chéngjísī hán_) and 伊丽莎白二世 (伊麗莎白二世; _Yīlìshābái èrshì_).

The partition sign is also used to separate book and chapter titles when they are mentioned consecutively: book first and then chapter.

In [Pe̍h-ōe-jī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB "Pe̍h-ōe-jī") for [Taiwanese Hokkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien "Taiwanese Hokkien"), middle dot is often used as a workaround for the _dot above_ right [diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic"), since most early encoding systems did not support this diacritic. This is now encoded as U+0358◌͘COMBINING DOT ABOVE RIGHT (see [o͘](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%CD%98 "O͘")). Unicode did not support this diacritic until June 2005. Newer fonts often support it natively; however, the practice of using middle dot still exists. Historically, it was derived in the late 19th century from an older barred-o with curly tail as an adaptation to the typewriter.

In [Tibetan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Tibetan "Standard Tibetan") the interpunct, called _tsek_ (ཙེག་), is used as a [morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme "Morpheme") delimiter.

The [Geʽez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%CA%BDez_script "Geʽez script") (Ethiopic) script traditionally [separates words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_separator "Word separator") with an interpunct of two vertically aligned dots, like a [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)"), but with larger dots: U+1361፡ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE. (For example ገድለ፡ወለተ፡ጴጥሮስ). Starting in the late 19th century the use of such punctuation has largely fallen out of use in favor of whitespace, except in formal hand-written or liturgical texts. In Eritrea the character may be used as a comma.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-ethiospace-10)

In [Franco-Provençal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Proven%C3%A7al_language "Franco-Provençal language") (or Arpitan), the interpunct is used in order to distinguish the following graphemes:

*   **ch·**, pronounced [ʃ], versus **ch**, pronounced [ts]
*   **j·**, pronounced [ʒ], versus **j**, pronounced [dz]
*   **g·** before _e, i,_ pronounced [ʒ], versus **g** before _e, i,_ pronounced [dz]

In modern [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"), the interpunct is sometimes used for [gender-neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language "Gender-neutral language") writing, as in _les salarié·e·s_ for _les salariés et les salariées_ ("the male employees and the female employees").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") lacked spacing or interpuncts but instead ran all the letters together. By [Late Antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Antiquity "Late Antiquity"), various marks were used to separate words, particularly the [Greek comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_comma "Greek comma").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-tlg-11)

In [modern Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"), the **ano teleia** mark ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): άνω τελεία, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek "Romanization of Greek"):_ánō teleía_, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")'upper stop'; also known as άνω στιγμή, _áno stigmí_) is the infrequently-encountered Greek semicolon and is properly [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek "Romanization of Greek") as such.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-elot-12) In Greek text, [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") provides the code point U+0387·GREEK ANO TELEIA,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-13) however, it is also expressed as an interpunct. In practice, the separate code point for ano teleia canonically decomposes to the interpunct.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-tlg-11)

The Hellenistic scholars of [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria") first developed the mark for a function closer to the [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma"), before it fell out of use and was then repurposed for its present role.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-tlg-11)

Interpuncts are often used to separate transcribed foreign names or words written in [katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana"). For example, "[Beautiful Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Sunday_(song) "Beautiful Sunday (song)")" becomes ビューティフル・サンデー (_Byūtifuru·Sandē_). A middle dot is also sometimes used to separate lists in [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language") instead of the [Japanese comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#East_Asia "Comma"). Dictionaries and [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar") lessons in Japanese sometimes also use a similar symbol to separate a [verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb "Verb")[suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affix "Affix") from its root. While some fonts may render the Japanese middle dot as a square under great magnification, this is not a defining property of the middle dot that is used in China or Japan.

However, the Japanese writing system usually does not use space or punctuation to separate words (though the mixing of katakana, [kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji "Kanji") and [hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana") gives some indication of word boundary).

In Japanese [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography"), there exist two Unicode code points:

*   U+30FB・KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT, with a fixed width that is the same as most kana characters, known as _fullwidth_.
*   U+FF65･HALFWIDTH KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT

The interpunct also has a number of other uses in Japanese, including the following: to separate titles, names and positions: 課長補佐・鈴木 (Assistant Section Head · Suzuki); as a decimal point when writing numbers in kanji: 三・一四一五九二 (3.141 592); as a slash when writing for "or" in abbreviations: 月・水・金曜日 (Mon/Wed/Friday); in place of hyphens, dashes and colons when writing vertically; and in song lyrics to add a brief pause between syllables.

Interpuncts are used in written Korean to denote a list of two or more words, similarly to how a [slash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation) "Slash (punctuation)") (/) is used to juxtapose words in many other languages. In this role it also functions in a similar way to the English [en dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_dash "En dash"), as in 미·소관계, "American–Soviet relations". The use of interpuncts has declined in years of digital typography and especially in place of slashes, but, in the strictest sense, a slash cannot replace a middle dot in Korean typography.

U+318D ㆍ HANGUL LETTER ARAEA (아래아) is used more than a middle dot when an interpunct is to be used in Korean typography, though _araea_ is technically not a punctuation symbol but actually an [obsolete Hangul _jamo_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul#Obsolete_letters "Hangul"). Because _araea_ is a [full-width](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-width "Full-width") letter, it looks better than middle dot between Hangul. In addition, it is drawn like the middle dot in Windows default Korean fonts such as _[Batang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming\_(typeface) "Ming (typeface)")_.

The interpunct (_interpunctus_) was regularly used in [classical Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Latin "Classical Latin") to separate words. In addition to the most common round form, [inscriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscription "Inscription") sometimes use a small [equilateral triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle") for the interpunct, pointing either up or down. It may also appear as a mid-line comma, similar to the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#Greek) practice of the time. The interpunct fell out of use c. 200 CE, and [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") was then written _[scripta continua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripta\_continua "Scripta continua")_ for several centuries.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In [Occitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language "Occitan language"), especially in the [Gascon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gascon_language "Gascon language") dialect, the interpunct (_punt interior_, literally, "inner dot", or _ponch naut_ for "high / upper point") is used to distinguish the following graphemes:

*   **s·h**, pronounced [s.h], versus **sh**, pronounced [ʃ], for example, in _des·har_ 'to undo' vs _deishar_ 'to leave'
*   **n·h**, pronounced [n.h], versus **nh**, pronounced [ɲ], for example in _in·hèrn_ 'hell' vs _vinha_ 'vineyard'

Although it is considered to be a spelling error, a [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") is frequently used when a middle dot is unavailable: _des.har, in.hèrn_, which is the case for French [keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#French "Keyboard layout").

In modern editions of [Old Occitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Occitan "Old Occitan") texts, the apostrophe and interpunct are used to denote certain [elisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision "Elision") that were not originally marked. The apostrophe is used with [proclitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitic#Proclitic "Clitic") forms and the interpunct is used with [enclitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitic#Enclitic "Clitic") forms:

*   **que·l** (_que lo_, that the) versus **qu'el** (that he)
*   From [Bertran de Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertran_de_Born "Bertran de Born")'s _Ab joi mou lo vers e·l comens_ (translated by James H. Donalson):

_Bela Domna·l vostre cors gens_

_E·lh vostre bel olh m'an conquis,_

_E·l doutz esgartz e lo clars vis,_

_E·l vostre bels essenhamens,_

_Que, can be m'en pren esmansa,_

_De beutat no·us trob egansa:_

_La genser etz c'om posc'e·l mon chauzir,_

_O no·i vei clar dels olhs ab que·us remir._ _Domna·l_[ˈdonnal] = _Domna, lo_ ("Lady, the": singular [definite article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_article#Definite_article "Definite article")) 

_E·lh_[eʎ] = _E li_ ("And the": plural definite article) 

_E·l_[el] = _E lo_ ("And the") 

_E·l_ = _E lo_ ("And the")

_No·us_[nows] = _Non vos_ ("(do) not... you": [direct object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_objects "Indirect objects") pronoun) 

_E·l_ = _En lo_ ("in the") 

_No·i_[noj] = _Non i_ ("(do) not... there") // _Que·us_[kews] = _Que vos_ ("that (I)... you")O pretty lady, all your grace 

 and eyes of beauty conquered me, 

 sweet glance and brightness of your face 

 and all your nature has to tell 

 so if I make an appraisal 

 I find no one like in beauty: 

 most pleasing to be found in all the world 

 or else the eyes I see you with have dimmed.

In many linguistic works discussing [Old Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Irish "Old Irish") (but not in actual Old Irish manuscripts), the interpunct is used to separate a pretonic preverbal element from the stressed syllable of the verb, e.g. _do·beir_ "gives". It is also used in citing the verb forms used after such preverbal elements (the [prototonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototonic "Prototonic") forms), e.g. _·beir_ "carries", to distinguish them from forms used without preverbs, e.g. _beirid_ "carries".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-14) In other works, the [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen") (_do-beir_, _-beir_) or [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)") (_do:beir_, _:beir_) may be used for this purpose.

[Runic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic "Runic") texts use either an interpunct-like or a colon-like punctuation mark to separate words. There are two [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") characters dedicated for this:

*   U+16EB᛫RUNIC SINGLE PUNCTUATION
*   U+16EC᛬RUNIC MULTIPLE PUNCTUATION

Up to the mid twentieth century, and sporadically even much later, the interpunct could be found used as the [decimal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_marker "Decimal marker") in British publications, such as tables of constants (e.g., "π = 3·14159").

In publications conforming to the standards of the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units"), as well as the multiplication sign (×), the centered dot (dot operator) can be used as a multiplication sign.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Only a [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma") or [full stop (period)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") may be used as a decimal marker.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The centered dot can be used when multiplying units, as in m·kg·s−2 for the [newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) "Newton (unit)") expressed in terms of SI base units.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In the United States, the use of a centered dot for the multiplication of numbers or values of quantities is discouraged by [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST "NIST").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-15)

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a small middle dot can be used to represent [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"); for example, ![Image 3: {\displaystyle x\cdot y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/13939e6cddd7ba416fd805830d8f5d815c9b4e76) for multiplying ![Image 4: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) by ![Image 5: {\textstyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db9936ddb2761b76fa640fb275cb5d1fa4d6fa23). When dealing with [scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)"), it is interchangeable with the [multiplication sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign "Multiplication sign") (×), as long as the multiplication sign is between numerals such that it would not be mistaken as variable ![Image 6: {\textstyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d951e0f3b54b6a3d73bb9a0a005749046cbce781). For instance, ![Image 7: {\textstyle 2\cdot 3y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3c2ba71da5932454593604a9033bdfbd8064e2bc) means the same thing as ![Image 8: {\textstyle 2\times 3y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39dde0a90f1ebb4df9730855a58c9ac5e8afb7ae). However, when dealing with [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)"), the dot operator denotes a [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") (e.g. ![Image 9: {\textstyle {\vec {x}}\cdot {\vec {y}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/113603551c2ef5b8c8926114971c6b9a853a1e33), a scalar), which is distinct from the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") (e.g. ![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\vec {x}}\times {\vec {y}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/571e44ffe91374b89d0af8f692cd5e09df2b660d), a vector).

The symbol is sometimes used to denote the ["AND" relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction "Logical conjunction") in formal [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra "Boolean algebra"), which can be seen as a special case of multiplication.

Another usage of this symbol in mathematics is with [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)"), where the dot is used as a placeholder for a [function argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function "Argument of a function"), in order to distinguish between the (general form of the) function itself and the value or a specific form of a function evaluated at a given point or with given specifications.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-16)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-17) For example, ![Image 11: {\textstyle f(\cdot )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b1d2264ac16b295fd8f93dfa67198d75ee2cce1) denotes the function ![Image 12: {\textstyle x\mapsto f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb708f83391a57d987fd56b73e0265f0c0e46784), and ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \theta (s,a,\cdot )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b56f9143eaca97f166e042834d0869ec9aacdec5) denotes a [partial application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application "Partial application"), where the first two arguments are given and the third argument shall take any valid value on its domain.

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), the middle dot is usually displayed (but not printed) to indicate [white space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character "Whitespace character") in various software applications such as [word processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processing "Word processing"), [graphic design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design "Graphic design"), web layout, [desktop publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing "Desktop publishing") or [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development") programs. In some [word processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor "Word processor"), interpuncts are used to denote not only [hard space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_space "Hard space") or space characters, but also sometimes used to indicate a space when put in paragraph format to show indentations and spaces. This allows the user to see where white space is located in the document and what sizes of white space are used, since normally white space is invisible so tabs, spaces, non-breaking spaces and such are indistinguishable from one another.

In [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), the middle dot is used to separate the parts of formulas of [addition compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition_compound "Addition compound"), mixture salts or solvates (typically hydrates), such as of [copper(II) sulphate pentahydrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(II)_sulfate "Copper(II) sulfate"), CuSO 4·5H 2 O. The middle dot should not be surrounded by spaces when indicating a chemical adduct.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-18)

The middot as a letter
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interpunct&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: The middot as a letter")]

A middot may be used as a [consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant "Consonant") or [modifier letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifier_letter "Modifier letter"), rather than as punctuation, in transcription systems and in language orthographies. For such uses Unicode provides the code point U+A78F ꞏ LATIN LETTER SINOLOGICAL DOT.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-19)

In [Americanist phonetic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americanist_phonetic_notation "Americanist phonetic notation"), the middot is a more common variant of the [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(letter) "Colon (letter)")⟨꞉⟩ used to indicate [vowel length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length "Vowel length"). It may be called a _half-colon_ in such usage. Graphically, it may be high in the letter space (the top dot of the colon) or centered as the interpunct. From Americanist notation, it has been adopted into the orthographies of several languages, such as [Washo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washo_language "Washo language").

In the writings of [Franz Boas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Boas "Franz Boas"), the middot was used for palatal or [palatalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_(phonetics) "Palatalization (phonetics)") consonants, e.g. ⟨kꞏ⟩ for IPA [c].

In the Sinological tradition of the [36 initials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36_initials "36 initials"), the onset 影 (typically reconstructed as a [glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop "Glottal stop")) may be transliterated with a middot ⟨ꞏ⟩, and the onset 喻 (typically reconstructed as a [null onset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_onset "Null onset")) with an [apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifier_letter_apostrophe "Modifier letter apostrophe")⟨ʼ⟩. Conventions vary, however, and it is common for 影 to be transliterated with the apostrophe. These conventions are used both for Chinese itself and for other scripts of China, such as [ʼPhags-pa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BCPhags-pa_script "ʼPhags-pa script")[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#cite_note-20) and [Jurchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurchen_script "Jurchen script").

In the [Canadian Aboriginal syllabics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics "Canadian Aboriginal syllabics"), a middle dot ⟨ᐧ⟩ indicates a syllable medial ⟨w⟩ in [Cree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cree_language "Cree language") and [Ojibwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe_language "Ojibwe language"), ⟨y⟩ or ⟨yu⟩ in some of the [Athapascan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athapascan_languages "Athapascan languages"), and a syllable medial ⟨s⟩ in [Blackfoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfoot_language "Blackfoot language"). However, depending on the writing tradition, the middle dot may appear after the syllable it modifies (which is found in the Western style) or before the syllable it modifies (which is found in the Northern and Eastern styles). In Unicode, the middle dot is encoded both as independent glyph U+1427 ᐧ CANADIAN SYLLABICS FINAL MIDDLE DOT or as part of a pre-composed letter, such as in U+143C ᐼ CANADIAN SYLLABICS PWI. In the [Carrier syllabics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_syllabics "Carrier syllabics") subset, the middle dot Final indicates a glottal stop, but a centered dot diacritic on [ə]-position letters transform the vowel value to [i], for example: U+1650 ᙐ CANADIAN SYLLABICS CARRIER SE, U+1652 ᙒ CANADIAN SYLLABICS CARRIER SI.
