There are five fundamental symmetry classes which have triangular fundamental domains: dihedral , cyclic , tetrahedral , octahedral , and icosahedral symmetry.

This article lists the groups by Schoenflies notation , Coxeter notation , [ 1 ] orbifold notation , [ 2 ] and order.

John Conway uses a variation of the Schoenflies notation, based on the groups' quaternion algebraic structure, labeled by one or two upper case letters, and whole number subscripts. The group order is defined as the subscript, unless the order is doubled for symbols with a plus or minus, "±", prefix, which implies a central inversion .

[ 3 ] Hermann–Mauguin notation (International notation) is also given. The crystallography groups, 32 in total, are a subset with element orders 2, 3, 4 and 6.

[ 4 ] Involutional symmetry [ edit ] There are four involutional groups: no symmetry (C 1 ), reflection symmetry (C s ), 2-fold rotational symmetry (C 2 ), and central point symmetry (C i ).

They can be classified as products of orthogonal groups O( n ) or special orthogonal groups SO( n ). O(1) is a single orthogonal reflection, dihedral symmetry order 2, Dih 1 . SO(1) is just the identity. Half turns, C 2 , are needed to complete.
