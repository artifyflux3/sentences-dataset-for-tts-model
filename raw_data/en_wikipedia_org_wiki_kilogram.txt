The **kilogram** (also spelled **kilogramme**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-:1-2)) is the [base unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Base_units "International System of Units") of [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") in the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI), equal to one thousand grams. It has the unit symbol **kg**.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-:1-2) The word "kilogram" is formed from the combination of the [metric prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix "Metric prefix")[kilo-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo- "Kilo-") (meaning one thousand) and [gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram "Gram");[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-3) it is colloquially [shortened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening_(linguistics) "Shortening (linguistics)") to "**kilo**" (plural "kilos").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-4)

The kilogram is an SI [base unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_unit_(measurement) "Base unit (measurement)"), defined ultimately in terms of three [defining constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#SI_defining_constants "International System of Units") of the SI, namely [a specific transition frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_standard "Caesium standard") of the [caesium-133](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_caesium "Isotopes of caesium") atom, the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), and the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-5): 131  A properly equipped [metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology "Metrology") laboratory can calibrate a mass measurement instrument such as a [Kibble balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble_balance "Kibble balance") as a primary standard for the kilogram mass.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-6)

The kilogram was originally defined in 1795 during the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution") as the mass of one [litre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre "Litre") of [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water "Properties of water") (originally at 0[°C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius "Celsius"), later changed to the temperature of its [maximum density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_density "Maximum density"), approximately 4°C). The current definition of a kilogram agrees with this original definition to within 30 [parts per million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million "Parts per million") (0.003%). In 1799, the platinum _[Kilogramme des Archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave\_(unit)#Kilogramme\_des\_Archives "Grave (unit)")_ replaced it as the standard of mass. In 1889, a cylinder composed of [platinum–iridium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum%E2%80%93iridium_alloy "Platinum–iridium alloy"), the [International Prototype of the Kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prototype_of_the_Kilogram "International Prototype of the Kilogram") (IPK), became the standard of the unit of mass for the metric system and remained so for 130 years, before the current standard was [adopted in 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_revision_of_the_SI "2019 revision of the SI").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-vox-7)

The kilogram is defined in terms of three defining constants:[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-5)

*   a specific atomic transition frequency [Δ _ν_ Cs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_standard "Caesium standard"), which defines the duration of the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"),
*   the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light")c, which when combined with the second, defines the length of the [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre"),
*   and the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant")h, which when combined with the metre and second, defines the [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") of the kilogram.

The formal definition according to the [General Conference on Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures "General Conference on Weights and Measures") (CGPM) is:

> The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.626 070 15×10−34 when expressed in the unit J⋅s, which is equal to kg⋅m 2⋅s−1, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of c and Δ _ν_ Cs.

— CGPM[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-draft-resolution-A-8)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-9)

Defined in term of those units, the kg is formulated as:[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-10)

kg = ⁠(299 792 458)2/(6.626 070 15×10−34)(9 192 631 770)⁠⁠_h_ Δ _ν_ Cs/_c_ 2⁠

≈ (1.475 5214×10 40)⁠_h_ Δ _ν_ Cs/_c_ 2⁠.

This definition is generally consistent with previous definitions: the kilogram remains within 30 [parts per million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation "Parts-per notation") (0.003%) of the mass of one [litre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre "Litre") of [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water") at the temperature of its [maximum density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_density "Maximum density") (approximately 4[°C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius "Celsius")), with the [density of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_water "Density of water") at that temperature very close to 1 kg/L.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-11)

Name and terminology
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kilogram&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Name and terminology")]

The kilogram is the only [base SI unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit "SI base unit") with an [SI prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_prefix "SI prefix") (_kilo_) as part of its name. The word _kilogramme_ or _kilogram_ is derived from the [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language")_kilogramme_,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-OED-16) which itself was a learned coinage, prefixing the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek "Koine Greek") stem of χίλιοι _khilioi_ "a thousand" to _gramma_, a Late Latin term for "a small weight", itself from Greek γράμμα.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-17) The word _kilogramme_ was written into French law in 1795, in the _Decree of [18 Germinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French\_Republican\_Calendar "French Republican Calendar")_,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-18) which revised the provisional system of units introduced by the French [National Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Convention "National Convention") two years earlier, where the _gravet_ had been defined as weight (_poids_) of a cubic centimetre of water, equal to 1/1000 of a _[grave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave\_(unit) "Grave (unit)")_.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-19) In the decree of 1795, the term _gramme_ thus replaced _gravet_, and _kilogramme_ replaced _grave_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-Zupko-14)

The French spelling was adopted in Great Britain when the word was used for the first time in English in 1795,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-20)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-OED-16) with the spelling _kilogram_ being adopted in the United States. In the United Kingdom both spellings are used, with "kilogram" having become by far the more common.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-:1-2) UK law regulating the units to be used when [trading by weight or measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weights_and_Measures_Acts_of_the_United_Kingdom "Weights and Measures Acts of the United Kingdom") does not prevent the use of either spelling.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-21)

In the 19th century the French word _kilo_, a [shortening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(morphology) "Clipping (morphology)") of _kilogramme_, was imported into the English language where it has been used to mean both kilogram[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-22) and kilometre.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-23) While _kilo_ as an alternative is acceptable, to _[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Economist "The Economist")_ for example,[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-24) the Canadian government's [Termium Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termium_Plus "Termium Plus") system states that "SI (International System of Units) usage, followed in scientific and technical writing" does not allow its usage and it is described as "a common informal name" on Russ Rowlett's Dictionary of Units of Measurement.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-25)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-26) When the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") gave the metric system legal status in 1866, it permitted the use of the word _kilo_ as an alternative to the word _kilogram_,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-27) but in 1990 revoked the status of the word _kilo_.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-28)

The SI system was introduced in 1960 and in 1970 the [BIPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures") started publishing the [_SI Brochure_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#SI_Brochure "International System of Units"), which contains all relevant decisions and recommendations by the [CGPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures "General Conference on Weights and Measures") concerning units. The _SI Brochure_ states that "It is not permissible to use abbreviations for unit symbols or unit names ...".[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-29)[[Note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-30)

For use with east Asian character sets, the SI symbol is encoded as a single Unicode character, U+338F㎏SQUARE KG in the [CJK Compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_Compatibility "CJK Compatibility") block.

Redefinition based on fundamental constants
-------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kilogram&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Redefinition based on fundamental constants")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Unit_relations_in_the_new_SI.svg/500px-Unit_relations_in_the_new_SI.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Unit_relations_in_the_new_SI.svg)

The [SI system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") after the 2019 redefinition: the kilogram is now fixed in terms of the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"), the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") and the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant"); furthermore the [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere") no longer depends on the kilogram

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Watt_balance%2C_large_view.jpg/500px-Watt_balance%2C_large_view.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Watt_balance,_large_view.jpg)

A [Kibble balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble_balance "Kibble balance"), which was originally used to measure the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant") in terms of the IPK, can now be used to calibrate secondary standard weights for practical use.

The replacement of the [International Prototype of the Kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prototype_of_the_Kilogram "International Prototype of the Kilogram") (IPK) as the primary standard was motivated by evidence accumulated over a long period of time that the mass of the IPK and its replicas had been changing; the IPK had diverged from its replicas by approximately 50 micrograms since their manufacture late in the 19th century. This led to [several competing efforts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_approaches_to_redefining_the_kilogram "Alternative approaches to redefining the kilogram") to develop measurement technology precise enough to warrant replacing the kilogram artefact with a definition based directly on physical fundamental constants.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-vox-7)

The [International Committee for Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures "International Committee for Weights and Measures") (CIPM) approved a [revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_revision_of_the_SI "2019 revision of the SI") in November 2018 that defines the kilogram by defining the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant") to be exactly 6.626 070 15×10−34 kg⋅m 2⋅s−1, effectively defining the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. The new definition took effect on 20 May 2019.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-vox-7)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-draft-resolution-A-8)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-31)

Prior to the redefinition, the kilogram and several other SI units based on the kilogram were defined by a man-made metal artifact: the _[Kilogramme des Archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogramme\_des\_Archives "Kilogramme des Archives")_ from 1799 to 1889, and the IPK from 1889 to 2019.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-vox-7)

In 1960, the [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre"), previously similarly having been defined with reference to a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it, was redefined in terms of an invariant physical constant (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by [krypton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton "Krypton"),[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-32) and later the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light")) so that the standard can be independently reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification.

At the 94th Meeting of the CIPM in 2005, it was recommended that the same be done with the kilogram.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-33)

In October 2010, the CIPM voted to submit a resolution for consideration at the [General Conference on Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures "General Conference on Weights and Measures") (CGPM), to "take note of an intention" that the kilogram be defined in terms of the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant"), _h_ (which has dimensions of energy times time, thus mass × length 2 / time) together with other physical constants.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-34)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-draft-35) This resolution was accepted by the 24th conference of the CGPM[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-36) in October 2011 and further discussed at the 25th conference in 2014.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-:0-37)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-38) Although the Committee recognised that significant progress had been made, they concluded that the data did not yet appear sufficiently robust to adopt the revised definition, and that work should continue to enable the adoption at the 26th meeting, scheduled for 2018.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-:0-37) Such a definition would theoretically permit any apparatus that was capable of delineating the kilogram in terms of the Planck constant to be used as long as it possessed sufficient precision, accuracy and stability. The [Kibble balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble_balance "Kibble balance") is one way to do this.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-39)

As part of this project, a variety of very [different technologies and approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_approaches_to_redefining_the_kilogram "Alternative approaches to redefining the kilogram") were considered and explored over many years. Some of these approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would enable the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, physical constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and that expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to physical constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass and therefore require precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories ([gravimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravimetry "Gravimetry")). All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Because an SI unit may not have multiple prefixes (see [SI prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_prefix "SI prefix")), prefixes are added to _[gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram "Gram")_, rather than the base unit _kilogram_, which already has a prefix as part of its name.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-40) For instance, one-millionth of a kilogram is 1 mg (one milligram), not 1 μkg (one microkilogram).

*   The unit name _megagram_ is rarely used, and even then typically only in technical fields in contexts where especially rigorous consistency with the SI standard is desired. For most purposes, the name _[tonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne "Tonne")_ is instead used. The tonne and its symbol, "t", were adopted by the CIPM in 1879. It is a non-SI unit accepted by the BIPM for use with the SI. According to the BIPM, "This unit is sometimes referred to as 'metric ton' in some English-speaking countries."[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#cite_note-54)
