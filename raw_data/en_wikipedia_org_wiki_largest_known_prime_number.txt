It was found on October 12, 2024, on a cloud-based virtual machine volunteered by Luke Durant, a 36-year-old researcher from San Jose, California, to the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] A plot of the number of digits in the largest known prime by year since the advent of the electronic computer . The vertical scale is logarithmic .

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Euclid's theorem proves that for any given prime number, there will always be a higher one, and thus there are infinitely many; there is no largest prime.

Many of the largest known primes are Mersenne primes , numbers that are one less than a power of two , because they can utilize a specialized primality test that is faster than the general one. As of October 2024 [update] , the seven largest known primes are Mersenne primes.

[ 3 ] The last eighteen record primes were Mersenne primes.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The binary representation of any Mersenne prime is composed of all ones , since the binary form of 2 k − 1 is simply k ones.

[ 6 ] Finding larger prime numbers is sometimes presented as a means to stronger encryption , but this is not the case.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Current record [ edit ] The standard format of 50 lines per page, 75 characters per line would require 10,940 single-sided pages to print this prime number, or approximately 22 reams of paper. (15 are shown here.) [ 9 ] The record is currently held by 2 136,279,841 − 1 with 41,024,320 digits, found by GIMPS on October 12, 2024.

[ 1 ] The first and last 120 digits of its value are: [ 10 ] 881694327503833265553939100378117358971207354509066041067156376412422630694756841441725990347723283108837509739959776874 ...

[ 11 ] A prime with one million digits was found in 1999, earning the discoverer a US$50,000 prize.

[ 12 ] In 2008, a ten-million-digit prime won a US$100,000 prize and a Cooperative Computing Award from the EFF.

[ 11 ] Time called this prime the 29th top invention of 2008.

[ 13 ] Both of these primes were discovered through the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), which coordinates long-range search efforts among tens of thousands of computers and thousands of volunteers. The $50,000 prize went to the discoverer and the $100,000 prize went to GIMPS.  GIMPS will split the US$150,000 prize for the first prime of over 100 million digits with the winning participant. A further US$250,000 prize is offered for the first prime with at least one billion digits.

[ 11 ] GIMPS also offers a US$3,000 research discovery award for participants who discover a new Mersenne prime of less than 100 million digits.

[ 14 ] History [ edit ] Commemorative postmark used by the UIUC Math Department after proving that M 11213 is prime The following table lists the progression of the largest known prime number in ascending order.

[ 4 ] Here M p = 2 p − 1 is the Mersenne number with exponent p , where p is a prime number. The longest record-holder known was M 19 = 524,287 , which was the largest known prime for 144 years.

The primes up to and including 2 148 + 1 17 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2^{148}+1}{17}}} are found without a computer, while the primes starting with 180×(M 127 ) 2 +1 are found using computers.

GIMPS volunteers found the sixteen latest records, all of them Mersenne primes . They were found on ordinary personal computers until the most recent one, found by ex- Nvidia employee Luke Durant using a network of thousands of dedicated graphics processing units (GPUs).

[ 1 ] Durant spent about one year and US$2 million on the hunt.

[ 15 ] This is the first time a Mersenne prime has been discovered using GPUs instead of central processing units (CPUs).
