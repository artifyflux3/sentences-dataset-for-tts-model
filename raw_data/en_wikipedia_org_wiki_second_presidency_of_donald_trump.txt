United States New York felony conviction for falsifying business records Stormy Daniels scandal New York investigations Georgia election indictment Georgia election investigation mug shot v t e Donald Trump 's second and current tenure as the president of the United States began upon his inauguration as the 47th president on January 20, 2025.

Trump, a member of the Republican Party who previously served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021, took office after defeating the incumbent vice president , Kamala Harris of the Democratic Party , in the 2024 presidential election . He is the second U.S. president to serve two non-consecutive terms, [ a ] as well as the first with a felony conviction. At 78 years old, he became the oldest person to assume the presidency , a record previously held by predecessor Joe Biden and himself during his first presidency.

The first few months of his presidency consisted of issuing multiple executive orders , many of which are being challenged in court .

[ 1 ] On immigration , he signed the Laken Riley Act into law, and issued executive orders blocking illegal immigrants from entering the U.S., reinstating the national emergency at the Mexico–U.S. border , designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations, attempting to end birthright citizenship , and initiating procedures for mass deportation of immigrants . Trump established a task force known as the Deparment of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is tasked with reducing spending by the federal government and limiting bureaucracy, and which has overseen mass layoffs of civil servants . The Trump administration has taken action against law firms for challenging Trump's executive orders and policies.

Trump's second presidency has overseen a series of tariff increases and pauses , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] which has led to retaliatory tariffs placed on the U.S. by other countries.

[ 4 ] These tariff moves, particularly the "Liberation Day" tariffs , [ 5 ] and counter-moves caused a brief stock market crash .

In international affairs, Trump has further strengthened U.S. ties with Israel . He authorized strikes that attacked several Iranian nuclear facilities , aiding Israel in the June 2025 Iran–Israel war and securing a ceasefire between Israel and Iran . Amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began in 2022, the Trump administration temporarily suspended the provision of intelligence and military aid to Ukraine , offered concessions to Russia , requested half of Ukraine's oil and minerals as repayment for American support, and said that Ukraine bore partial responsibility for the invasion. The administration resumed the aid after Ukraine agreed to a potential ceasefire.

[ 6 ] Like in his first presidency, Trump initiated the withdrawal of the U.S. from the World Health Organization , the Paris Climate Accords , and UNESCO .

[ 7 ] Following his election victories in 2016 and in 2024 , he is not eligible to be elected to a third term due to the provisions of the Twenty-second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution . Trump has suggested before and during this term that there are ways to circumvent that prohibition.

2024 election Main articles: Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign and 2024 United States presidential election Further information: 2024 United States elections , 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries , and 2024 Republican National Convention 2024 Electoral College vote results Trump, who previously served as 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021 and lost his reelection bid to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election , [ 8 ] announced his candidacy for the nomination of the Republican Party in the 2024 presidential election on November 15, 2022.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] In March 2024, Trump secured the Republican nomination.

Trump selected Senator JD Vance of Ohio, a former critic of his, as his running mate , and the two were officially nominated at the 2024 Republican National Convention .

[ 11 ] On July 13, Trump was the victim of an attempted assassination during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania .

[ 12 ] Early on November 6, 2024, the day after the election, Trump was projected to have secured the presidency.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Trump won the presidential election with 312 electoral votes, while Kamala Harris received 226.

[ 15 ] Trump, upon taking office, was the second president in U.S. history to serve non-consecutive terms after Grover Cleveland in 1893, [ 16 ] the oldest individual to assume the presidency, and the first convicted felon to serve the presidency following his conviction in May 2024.

[ 17 ] Vance, as the third-youngest vice president in U.S. history , became the first Millennial vice president.

[ 17 ] In the concurrent congressional elections , Republicans retained a reduced majority in the House of Representatives and took control of the Senate .

[ 18 ] Transition period, inauguration, and first 100 days Main articles: Second presidential transition of Donald Trump and Second inauguration of Donald Trump See also: First 100 days of Donald Trump's second presidency Inaugural portrait Incumbent president Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office on November 13, 2024 Chief Justice John Roberts administers the presidential oath of office to Trump in the Capitol rotunda , January 20, 2025 The presidential transition period began following Trump's victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election , though Trump had chosen Linda McMahon and Howard Lutnick to begin planning for the transition in August 2024. According to The New York Times , Trump was "superstitious" and preferred to avoid discussing the presidential transition process until after Election Day. His transition team relied on the work of the America First Policy Institute , rather than the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank that garnered controversy during the election for Project 2025 , a set of initiatives that would reshape the federal government.

[ 19 ] By October, he had not participated in the federal presidential transition process, [ 20 ] and he had not signed a required ethics pledge, as of November.

[ 21 ] During the transition period, Trump announced nominations for his cabinet and administration . Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2025, officially assuming the presidency at 12:00 pm, EST.

[ 22 ] He was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts .

[ 23 ] The inauguration occurred indoors in the Capitol Rotunda .

[ 24 ] Two days before the inauguration, Trump launched a meme coin , $Trump .

[ 25 ] In his first weeks, several of Trump's actions ignored or violated federal laws, regulations, and the Constitution.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] Administration Further information: Political appointments of the second Trump administration Cabinet Cabinet meeting, February 2025 Second Trump cabinet Office Name Term President Donald Trump 2025–present Vice President JD Vance 2025–present Secretary of State Marco Rubio 2025–present Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent 2025–present Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth 2025–present Attorney General Pam Bondi 2025–present Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum 2025–present Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins 2025–present Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick 2025–present Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer 2025–present Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] It was also described as the wealthiest administration in modern history, with over 13 billionaires chosen to take government posts.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] He nominated or appointed 23 former Fox News employees to his administration.

[ 34 ] Trump officials and Elon Musk threatened to fund primary challengers in upcoming elections against Republican senators who did not vote for Trump's nominees.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] Despite this, three Republicans — Susan Collins , Mitch McConnell , and Lisa Murkowski — have voted against at least one of Trump's nominees; all three voted against U.S. secretary of defense Pete Hegseth.

[ 37 ] Loyalty tests Once the second Trump presidency began, White House screening teams fanned out to federal agencies to screen job applicants for their loyalty to the president's agenda. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order asserting to restore merit-based federal hiring practices and "dedication to our Constitution".

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] As part of its U.S. federal deferred resignation program , the Trump administration demanded "loyalty" from federal workers.

[ 40 ] In a break from politically neutral speech, the Justice Department issued memos about "insubordination", "abhorrent conduct" and vowed to pursue opponents of Trump's cost-cutting efforts "to the ends of the Earth" in what was described by current and former law enforcement officials as a campaign of intimidation against agents insufficiently loyal to Trump.

[ 41 ] Staffers were dispatched across federal agencies to look for anti-Trump sentiment among government agencies. Some new hires were told to provide examples of what they did to help Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, when their moment of "MAGA revelation" occurred, prove their "enthusiasm", be positively referenced by confirmed loyalists, and provide access to their social media handles.

The Associated Press described the intense loyalty tests as a way to separate individuals following traditional Republican orthodoxy from Trump's MAGA ideology.

[ 38 ] Candidates for top national intelligence and law enforcement positions were given Trump loyalty tests. Candidates were asked to give yes or no responses to whether or not January 6 was an "inside job" and whether or not the 2020 election was "stolen". Those that did not say yes to both answers were not hired.

[ 42 ] Advisors Trump had assistance from Elon Musk, other political operatives, and an antisemitism task force.

[ 43 ] Advisors were Christopher Rufo in education; Stephen Miller in domestic policy and immigration; and four co-authors of Project 2025: Russell Vought , Peter Navarro , Paul S. Atkins , and Brendan Carr .

[ 44 ] Executive orders See also: List of executive orders in the second presidency of Donald Trump Trump signed the most first-day executive orders of recent presidents. First-day executive orders by previous ten presidents, 1969–2025 Trump began office with the most executive orders ever signed on the first day of a United States presidential term, [ 45 ] at 26 executive orders .

[ 46 ] Following behind Trump's executive order tally is Joe Biden at 9 executive orders on January 20, 2021, [ 47 ] then Barack Obama at 2 executive orders, and Bill Clinton at 1 executive order.

[ 48 ] Trump's signing of executive orders was described as a "shock and awe" campaign that tested the limits of executive authority.

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] Four days into Trump's second term, analysis conducted by Time found that nearly two-thirds of his executive actions "mirror or partially mirror" proposals from Project 2025 , [ 51 ] which was seconded with analysis from Bloomberg Government .

[ 52 ] The signing of many of Trump's executive orders are being challenged in court , with the executive orders affecting federal funding, federal employee status, immigration, federal programs, government data availability , and more. The majority of the cases are being filed in response to executive orders related to the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Executive Order 14158 , and the actions taken by Elon Musk and the DOGE team towards federal agencies as self-identified cost-cutting measures.

[ 53 ] Domestic policy Main article: Domestic policy of the second Donald Trump administration Abortion In April 2024, Former-President Trump had declared that abortion should be delegated to states.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] He said he wouldn’t sign a federal ban and criticized the Arizona Supreme Court 's ruling in Planned Parenthood Arizona v. Mayes (2024), which upheld an 1864 law.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] The Alabama Supreme Court ruled in LePage v. Center for Reproductive Medicine (2024) that frozen embryos are living beings. In contrast, Trump positioned himself in favor of in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] On January 24, 2025, Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy ("global gag rule") , which had been rescinded by the Biden administration . Since Reagan in the 1980s, this rule has been put in place during Republican administrations and rescinded during Democratic administrations.

[ 60 ] In May 2025, in a case involving telehealth prescriptions and the abortion-drug Mifepristone , the Trump administration asked the court to dismiss the case, arguing that the states involve did not have standing .  This case was Missouri v. FDA brought before Federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in the Northern District of Texas .  The states involved were Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas.

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] In June 2025, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ended the rule which required hospitals to provide emergency abortions under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act .

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] "Big, Beautiful" Budget Act Main article: One Big Beautiful Bill Act This section needs to be updated .

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

( July 2025 ) The One Big Beautiful Bill Act [ 67 ] [ 68 ] includes hundreds of provisions, is estimated to add roughly $3 trillion to the national debt [ 69 ] [ 70 ] and is projected to cut approximately $4.46 trillion in tax revenue over a 10-year period.

[ 71 ] [ 72 ] The Act permanently extends the individual tax rates Trump signed into law in 2017 , which were set to expire at the end of 2025.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] Establishes a $50 billion Rural Hospital Fund, up from $25 billion, to support health care providers in rural areas , providing a safety net against Medicaid cuts; [ 69 ] [ 75 ] The bill cuts over $1.2 trillion in federal spending, [ 69 ] primarily from Medicaid [ 73 ] and nutrition funding SNAP .

[ 76 ] This Act: Requires states to charge enrollees in Medicaid expansion states with family incomes between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level up to $35 for each health care service, if they qualify for Medicaid based on income alone.

[ 77 ] Adds work requirements for Medicaid recipients for the first time, with individuals ages 19 to 64 required to work at least 80 hours per month. Some exemptions exist for adults with dependent children ages 14 and under and those with medical conditions; [ 78 ] Cuts the Medicaid provider tax, which helps states fund their Medicaid costs, from 6% to 3.5% by 2031; [ 69 ] FEMA In April, the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied an extension of benefits for areas in Georgia and North Carolina which had been hit by Hurricane Helene in September 2024.

[ 79 ] Tornadoes hit parts the state of Mississippi in mid-March and a major disaster declaration by the federal government took more than two months, even at the request of Republican Governor Tate Reeves of Mississippi.

[ 80 ] On May 23, the Trump administration approved disaster aid for areas within 8 states including Mississippi.  The other 7 states with areas so designated are Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.

[ 81 ] Health policy See also: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention § Second Trump administration On November 14, Trump announced that he would nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

for Health and Human Services Secretary. This was controversial given Kennedy's repeated endorsement of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories . The director of the American Public Health Association , America's largest organization of public health professionals, said, "He is not competent by training, management skills, temperament or trust to have this job." [ 82 ] In December, Trump revealed he was discussing ending childhood vaccination programs with Kennedy and promoted the scientifically debunked claim of a link between vaccines and autism .

[ 83 ] On February 18, Trump signed an executive order calling for the policy recommendations for reducing the out-of-pocket costs of IVF , or In Vitro Fertilisation .

[ 59 ] [ 84 ] On February 25, Trump signed an executive order to improve healthcare cost transparency.

[ 85 ] By late April, the Trump administration had placed on leave and then temporarily rehired federal employees in the NIOSH, or National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, who had been involved in monitoring for black lung disease.

[ 86 ] On June 9, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices.  He claimed that it "has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine." Senator Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) , a medical doctor, said "now the fear is that the ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion." These firings came before a scheduled June 25 meeting in which the Committee was expected to issue new recommendations for vaccines including COVID-19.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] See also: 2025 United States government online resource removals In late January, several CDC websites, pages, and datasets related to HIV and STI prevention, LGBT and youth health became unavailable for viewing .

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] Shortly thereafter, the CDC ordered its scientists to retract or pause the publication of all research which had been submitted or accepted for publication, but not yet published, which included any of the following banned terms: "Gender, transgender, pregnant person, pregnant people, LGBT, transsexual, non-binary, nonbinary, assigned male at birth, assigned female at birth, biologically male, biologically female." [ 91 ] In mid-February, around 1,300 CDC employees were laid off.

[ 92 ] In April, it was reported that among the reductions were the elimination of the Freedom of Information Act team, the Division of Violence Prevention, labs involved in testing for antibiotic resistance, and the team responsible for recalls of hazardous infant products. Additional cuts affected the technology branch of the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which was established during the COVID-19 pandemic.

[ 93 ] On June 25, 2025, Kennedy announced that the U.S. was stopping its donations to the Gavi vaccine alliance, until Gavi can better demonstrate vaccine safety.

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] The United States had been providing approximately 13 percent of Gavi’s budget.

[ 96 ] On August 5, 2025, Secretary Kennedy announced that he was stopping 22 vaccine projects using mRNA technology, including Covid, RSV, and bird flu.   A critic of this funding halt pointed out that mRNA vaccines have the potential for faster roll-out.

[ 97 ] Immigration Main articles: Immigration policy of the second Donald Trump administration and Deportation in the second presidency of Donald Trump See also: Mexico–United States border crisis § Second Trump administration (2025–present) , Mexico–United States border wall § Second Trump administration (2025–present) , and Activist deportations in the second Trump presidency Kristi Noem , Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security According to The New York Times , President-elect Trump stated his intentions to revive the immigration policies from his first presidency, including a travel ban on refugees from Iran , Iraq , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria , and Yemen . Other policies included expulsion of asylum seekers by asserting that they carry infectious diseases , deputization of police officers and soldiers to assist in mass deportations , and the establishment of sprawling detention camps .

[ 98 ] Trump said "there is no price tag" to carry out these deportations.

[ 99 ] On November 10, 2024, Trump announced that Tom Homan would be joining the incoming administration as the " border czar ." [ 100 ] While border crossings reached record highs during the first half of the Biden presidency, they fell to lower levels near the end of his term and continued at these lower levels into Trump's 2nd presidency.

[ 101 ] Shortly after he became president on January 20, 2025, the Trump administration ended services for the app of CBP One , reinstated the national emergency at the southern border , ordered the armed forces to draft plans for deployment, [ 102 ] [ 103 ] and began the steps towards labeling Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations.

[ 104 ] Trump increased deportation authorities for the Drug Enforcement Administration , the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives , and the Marshals Service .

[ 105 ] He gave ICE the power to deport immigrants who had come to the United States legally under Biden administration programs, [ 106 ] and established daily deportation quotas to ICE offices.

[ 107 ] Trump also signed an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants as well as immigrants legally but temporarily present in the United States. At least nine lawsuits have been filed challenging the order on constitutional grounds, and as of February 2025 [update] , four federal judges have issued preliminary injunctions blocking its implementation and enforcement nationwide.

[ 108 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] On June 27, the Supreme Court limited the ability of individual District Judges to issue injunctions against executive actions, meaning to pause executive action. The Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of birthright citizenship. District Judges can still issue injunctions in limited circumstances, such as for persons directly involved in a class action lawsuit.

[ 111 ] On January 22, 2025, Trump ended the policy from 2011 which prohibited immigration arrests in sensitive areas such as courthouses, schools, churches, and hospitals, or during funerals and weddings.

[ 112 ] NPR reported that a "growing number" of Democrat and Republican officials in cities, states, police departments, school districts and other local governments stated they would not assist in migrant raids citing public safety, civil rights, and administrative capability concerns.

[ 113 ] On January 29, Trump signed the Laken Riley Act into law, the first legislation of his second term.

[ 114 ] [ 115 ] On the same day, he signed a presidential memorandum to begin expansion of the Guantanamo Migrant Operations Center to house up to 30,000 migrants under detention, separate from the high security military prison at Guantanamo Bay.

On February 6, U.S. Border Patrol chief Michael W. Banks claimed that illegal border crossings were already down almost 90% since Trump's inauguration, and that criminal prosecutions of those apprehended were up more than 50%.

[ 116 ] On February 25, Trump announced that the US would launch " Gold Card " residency permits for wealthy immigrants for a price of US$5 million, with an estimated release near the end of March 2025.

[ 117 ] Trump deported 37,660 people during his first month in office.

[ 118 ] In response to injunctions countering his deportations, Trump considered suspending habeas corpus .

[ 119 ] Stephen Miller in May 2025 said regarding immigration cases that " habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion", and that the Trump administration was "actively looking at" carrying out such a suspension, depending on "whether the courts do the right thing or not"; Article One of the United States Constitution forbids such a suspension "unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it." [ 120 ] On July 1, Trump toured a newly-built facility in the Florida Everglades nicknamed " Alligator Alcatraz ". This facility is designed to keep 3,000 persons in detention.

[ 121 ] On July 10, the Department of Health and Human Services announced they would be restricting undocumented immigrants from enrolling for Head Start , a federally funded U.S. preschool program.

[ 122 ] Social Security On March 18, 2025, the Social Security Administration announced they would be implementing tighter identity requirements starting March 31, [ 123 ] [ 124 ] with this date pushed forward to April 14. The new policy requires takes away the telephone option and requires individuals to either apply online or appear in-person at a field office.

[ 125 ] Applications for SSDI, Medicare, or SSI are exempted from this in-person requirement, along with applicants subject to extreme situations “such as terminal cases or prisoner pre-release scenarios.” [ 125 ] This new policy comes at a time the Trump administration is closing some field offices and laying off some Social Security staff.

[ 126 ] In late March, Wired reported that DOGE was putting together a team to migrate the Social Security base code from COBOL to a more modern programming language, with the goal of achieving this in a matter of months, whereas most experts say it should take several years to do and test this safely.

[ 127 ] [ 128 ] It was reported in mid-April that the Trump administration had placed on the "Master Death File", renamed the "Master Ineligible File", more 6,000 persons who are legal immigrants whom officials claim are either on a terrorism watch list or have an FBI criminal record. The White House, however, did not provide evidence for this claim.

[ 129 ] Social Security will "clawback" money from a disabled or retired person's monthly payments in cases in which overpayments are discovered.  Overpayments can either be the fault of Social Security or of the recipient, for example, a person on SSDI disability not reporting monthly work income over a certain threshold. The Biden administration had capped the clawback rate at 10%, but this expired on March 27, 2025, reverting back to 100%. On April 25, the Trump administration reduced this clawback rate to 50%.

[ 130 ] Universities Leo Terrell , the head of the Trump administration's Task Force to Combat Antisemitism , with Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, April 7, 2025 In February 2025, Leo Terrell , the chair of the Department of Justice's Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, announced that he would investigate Columbia University , Harvard University , George Washington University , Johns Hopkins University , New York University , Northwestern University , Berkeley University , the University of California , the University of Minnesota , and the University of Southern California as part of the Department of Justice's broader investigation into antisemitism on college campuses.

[ 131 ] Jobs numbers revised downward in mid-2025 In early August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revised their numbers for May from 125,000 new jobs to 19,000, and their June numbers from 147,000 new jobs to 14,000. The BLS frequently revises monthly jobs numbers, but typically not to this extent.

[ 132 ] For the United States, unemployment is still low at 4.2%. The BLS estimates that 73,000 new jobs were added in July.

[ 132 ] President Trump fired BLS director Erika McEntarfer . On social media, Trump wrote, “No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes.” [ 132 ] In the last 10 years, companies have responded slower to the jobs survey and the percentage of companies responding at all has fallen. However, the survey gets responses from roughly 200,000 business locations, which can be independent companies or franchises owners.

[ 132 ] Two former commissioners with the BLS issued public statements supporting the former director and criticizing the firing, including a commissioner who had been appointed by Trump. U.S. jobs numbers have been described as setting the gold standard for economic data.

[ 133 ] Among 24 surveyed countries, Trump's 2025 ratings trailed those of Joe Biden's 2024 ratings by an average of twelve percentage points in world affairs, though Trump fared better among right-wing populist parties in Europe.

[ 134 ] As of June 2025, Trump has made three international trips to eight different countries during his second presidency.

Trump with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House on February 7, 2025 Trump's second term foreign policy has been described as a mixture of both imperialist and expansionist policies.

[ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ] He engaged in a realist and isolationist " America First " foreign policy agenda.

[ 139 ] [ 140 ] His relations with allies were transactional and ranged from indifference to hostility, and he threatened them with economic tariffs or annexation.

[ 141 ] [ 142 ] He was described as taking the side of Russia in the Russian invasion of Ukraine , [ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] and overseeing a rupture of the post-1945 rules-based liberal international order and abandonment of multilateralism .

[ 144 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] Trump, historians, and commentators frequently compared his foreign policy to former president William McKinley in relation to expansionism and tariffs.

[ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] Michael Klare wrote that containing the influence of China and preventing the rise of any rival power is the central foreign policy objective of the Trump administration, comparing Trump's approach to the Wolfowitz Doctrine .

[ 156 ] During his 2024 campaign, he said he would not defend NATO allies if they did not meet the alliance's spending target of 2% of GDP on defense, and that he would "encourage" Russia to "do whatever the hell they want".

[ 157 ] [ 158 ] [ 159 ] Trump officials privately expressed contempt for European "freeloading";.

[ 160 ] [ 161 ] Trump's policies and rhetoric accelerated an ongoing European rearmament .

[ 162 ] [ 163 ] [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Trump called Poland, which exceeds the NATO defense spending target, "one of the best groups of people I have ever met".

[ 166 ] Trump's administration has also expressed cultural disagreement with Europe and the European Union : in a speech at the 61st Munich Security Conference , Vice President Vance criticized European policies on free speech and democratic values, and accused European leaders of suppressing dissenting views on issues such as immigration.

[ 156 ] [ 167 ] Vance also expressed support for lifting restrictions on the Alternative for Germany , a far-right German political party.

[ 168 ] Trump's first foreign visit as president-elect was to Paris for the reopening of the Notre-Dame de Paris , during which he met with French president Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the war in Ukraine , [ 169 ] [ 170 ] and met with other European officials.

[ 175 ] In February 2025, Trump held phone calls with Russian president Vladimir Putin and with Zelenskyy that he said marked the beginning of negotiations.

[ 176 ] He threatened Ukraine with a suspension of U.S. military aid [ 177 ] and Russia with sanctions and tariffs if he decided they were not negotiating in good faith.

[ 178 ] [ 179 ] The U.S. sought a mineral resources agreement with Ukraine [ 180 ] though was unwilling to offer postwar security guarantees for Ukraine in exchange.

[ 180 ] [ 181 ] Negotiators reached a deal on the agreement [ 182 ] [ 183 ] [ 184 ] but the agreement fell through after a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office that ended when the Ukrainian delegation was abruptly asked to leave.

[ 173 ] [ 185 ] Afterwards, the U.K. and France developed a proposal in which a " coalition of the willing " would provide security guarantees to Ukraine.

[ 186 ] [ 187 ] The U.S. and Russia held a summit in Saudi Arabia for peace talks in February [ 188 ] and U.S. held a summit with Ukraine the next month, during which Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire.

[ 189 ] [ 190 ] Putin did not accept the ceasefire, [ 191 ] though on March 18 Russia agreed to a 30-day ceasefire only for strikes on energy infrastructure and in the Black Sea , [ 192 ] which Ukraine agreed to.

[ 193 ] [ 194 ] On July 9, Trump reversed a previously suspended military aid package to Ukraine following Russia’s largest aerial assault on the country, involving hundreds of drones and missiles. The suspension, reportedly authorized by senior defense officials without Trump’s prior knowledge. Trump expressed growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of insincerity and relentless aggression, saying, “He wants to go all the way, just keep killing people, it’s no good.” The U.S. are discussing sending 10 Patriot missiles to Ukraine, and Trump said he is reviewing a proposed sanctions bill by Senator Lindsey Graham that would impose 500% tariffs on countries trading with Russia. Although Trump has previously mentioned secondary sanctions , none have been implemented so far, with the president citing their cost and waiting to see if a peace deal would emerge.

[ 195 ] On July 14, 2025, Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs and secondary sanctions on countries purchasing Russian oil if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire within 50 days.

[ 196 ] [ 197 ] Trump confirmed a summit meeting between him and Putin to be held on August 15, 2025, in Alaska [ 198 ] Africa South Africa Trump with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May 2025 Trump's administration strained relations with South Africa . Trump suspended all aid to South Africa, saying the country's land expropriation law discriminated against Afrikaners ; [ 199 ] he also offered Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S.

[ 156 ] [ 200 ] Rubio refused to attend the G20 foreign ministers' meeting in Johannesburg [ 201 ] and he declared the South African ambassador persona non grata for his criticism of U.S. policies.

[ 202 ] Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda Rubio condemned the Rwandan -backed Goma offensive in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and called for an immediate ceasefire and respect for territorial integrity.

[ 203 ] In April, U.S. officials entered into talks with the DRC on a minerals deal after a proposal from Congolese president Félix Tshisekedi .

[ 204 ] Signing ceremony for the peace agreement, Washington, D.C., June 27, 2025.

In June 2025, President Trump brokered a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda , with the U.S. getting "a lot of mineral rights." This potentially brings to an end a 30+ year conflict dating back to the 1994 Rwanda genocide.  Each country had accused the other of financing and supporting rebel groups. On June 27, in a deal signed in the White House, each country pledged to end such support, allow the return of refugees, and create a joint security coordination mechanism aimed at resolving disputes.

[ 205 ] An estimated 6 million persons have died in this conflict, and Trump said that this deal ends "one of the worst wars anyone's ever seen." A critic said, "It risks reducing peace to a transactional exchange. Minerals are only one driver of conflict." Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, "This is an important moment after 30 years of war. President Trump is a president of peace. He really does want peace. He prioritizes it above all else." [ 205 ] A former prime minister of the DR Congo, Joseph Kabila, expressed skepticism of the peace deal, saying that it was “nothing more than a trade agreement.” [ 206 ] South Sudan In April 2025, the U.S. revoked all visas of and barred entry to citizens of South Sudan after a dispute over the deportation of a South Sudanese citizen.

[ 208 ] U.S. officials accidentally included The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg in a Signal group chat discussing the military plans, sparking a political scandal and accusations of risking national security and violating records-preservation laws.

[ 209 ] [ 210 ] [ 211 ] In May 2025, Trump announced that his administration had reached a ceasefire deal with the Houthis.

[ 212 ] Iran Trump and Vance in the Situation Room during strikes on Iran Trump reinstated his "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran and sought a new set of negotiations to limit Iran's nuclear program .

[ 213 ] [ 214 ] In March 2025, Trump sent a letter to Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei urging new negotiations and warning of military action if talks fail.

[ 215 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ] On June 13, 2025, Israeli planes bombed sites in Iran associated with Iran's nuclear program. President Trump stated he was not involved, although Iranian leaders have said they do not believe this. There have been reports that Trump vetoed a plan to kill Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei, and that the United States communicated to Israel that Iran has not killed an American and discussions of killing political leaders should not be on the table.

[ 218 ] In retaliation, Iran has fired missiles and drones at Israel, most of which has been shot down by Israel's Iron Dome air defense system.

[ 219 ] As of June 15, 24 people have been killed in Israel [ 220 ] and 224 people have been killed in Iran, [ 221 ] according to state media.

On June 18, Trump said he has not decided whether to join with Israeli bombing runs on nuclear program sites in Iran. Trump said that it is “very late to be talking.” An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman told Al Jazeera news that he did not believe the Trump administration could dictate to Israel what it can and cannot do.

[ 222 ] Regarding whether the United States will strike with B-2 planes carrying “bunker-buster” bombs directed against Iran's Fordo nuclear site (which is buried in a mountain), President Trump said, “Based on the fact that there is a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.” [ 223 ] On June 21, 2025, the U.S.

attacked three nuclear sites : the Fordow uranium enrichment facility, the Natanz nuclear facility, and Isfahan nuclear technology center.

[ 224 ] [ 225 ] B-2 airplanes took off from the state of Missouri and made the 18-flight to Iran, being refueled multiple times en route. Entering Iranian airspace, fighter jets cleared space ahead of them, and a Navy sub fired more than 24 Tomahawk missiles. The leading B-2 dropped two Massive Ordnance Penetrators bombs (MOPs, or “bunker-busters”) at the Fordo site. A total of 14 MOPs were dropped at two target sites.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said, “We devastated the Iranian nuclear program, but it's worth noting that the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people.” [ 226 ] On June 22, Trump said that since the Islamic regime in control of Iran has failed to make Iran great, it should be replaced to "Make Iran Great Again".

[ 227 ] [ 228 ] Later he posted on social media that their constant anger, hostility, and despair have only led them to ruin. The path they’re on offers no hope, only more hardship, " I wish the leadership of Iran would realize that you often get more with honey than you do with vinegar".

[ 229 ] President Trump hosting Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on July 7, 2025 Israel and Gaza After being elected in November 2024, Trump said he wished to end the Gaza war , [ 230 ] [ 231 ] telling Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end Israel's invasion within two months [ 230 ] and warning Hamas that they would have "all hell to pay" if they did not agree to a ceasefire and release all hostages by Trump's inauguration.

[ 232 ] Trump's incoming administration joined the Biden administration in pressuring negotiations, [ 233 ] [ 234 ] [ 235 ] and Israel and Hamas agreed to a phased ceasefire on January 15, 2025.

[ 236 ] [ 237 ] [ 238 ] In February 2025, Trump proposed an American takeover of Gaza in which the territory's Palestinian population would be relocated to allow for its redevelopment, which was criticized by Egypt and Jordan.

[ 239 ] [ 240 ] The ceasefire lasted until March 18, when Israel launched attacks on Gaza .

[ 241 ] On May 16, while in Abu Dhabi , UAE , Trump said, "We’re looking at Gaza. And we’re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving." This is an area of tension between President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .  Israel claims that Hamas systemically raids food aid in order to support its operations, and Israel has put forward a plan of food distributed through a system of hubs run by private contractors and protected by Israeli soldiers.  The U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been set up to carry out this plan and announced it would be ready to begin operations by the end of May.

[ 242 ] [ 243 ] On July 28 while in Scotland, President Trump said he believed there was starvation occurring in Gaza.  He further added, “Nobody's done anything great over there. The whole place is a mess... I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way.” Israeli Prime Minister said, “And what has interdicted the supply of humanitarian aid is one force, Hamas. Again, the reversal of truth.” [ 244 ] [ 245 ] Syria Trump with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia , May 14, 2025 During the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives that toppled the Assad regime in Syria, Trump said that the U.S. should stay out of the conflict.

[ 246 ] In March 2025, Rubio condemned the massacres of Syrian Alawites .

[ 247 ] Trump agreed to lift sanctions on Syria after discussing the situation with Mohammed bin Salman and Erdoğan .

[ 248 ] [ 249 ] Indian subcontinent Trump with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , February 2025 India rejected Trump's offer to mediate India–China tensions .

[ 250 ] On February 13, 2025, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi became the fourth world leader to visit Donald Trump at the White House.

[ 251 ] In early 2025, deportations to Bhutan of Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugees who had been settled in the US for nearly two decades resulted in statelessness of the deportees following their interrogation and expulsion from Bhutan upon arrival. Some of the refouled refugees , who had encountered largely minor legal issues in the US, were then arrested for illegal entry to Nepal upon seeking to re-enter the refugee camps they had previously inhabited before US resettlement.

[ 252 ] [ 253 ] In response to the 2025 India–Pakistan strikes , Vice President Vance said that, a potential war between India and Pakistan is "none of our business." [ 254 ] In July 2025, Trump criticized India over its continued oil trade with Russia, despite ongoing Western sanctions.

[ 255 ] Trump announced that a 25% reciprocal tariff on Indian goods would go into effect on August 1 and warned of an additional, unspecified penalty in response to India's continued purchases of Russian military equipment and energy .

[ 255 ] Caucasus Main article: Armenia–Azerbaijan peace agreement Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev , President Trump and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan signing a trilateral joint declaration in Washington, D.C. on August 8, 2025 On August 8, 2025, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev signed a peace agreement in a ceremony hosted by President Donald Trump in the White House, [ 256 ] ending the more than 35-year conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

[ 257 ] Foreign aid Main article: United States Agency for International Development Freezing most programs for 90 days DOGE dismantled most of USAID , [ 258 ] which had been a 10,000-person agency originally tasked to carry-out humanitarian projects.

[ 259 ] USAID's critics maintained that many of the projects were in fact not all that humanitarian and/or much of the money was not well spent.

[ 260 ] In January 2025, the administration issued a 90-day stop-work order worldwide, [ 261 ] [ 262 ] Stop work interrupted about 30 clinical trials , [ 263 ] and interrupted projects such as emergency medical care for displaced Palestinians and Yemenis, aid for war refugees on the Sudan-Chad border, and heat and electricity for Ukrainian refugees.

[ 262 ] The HIV Modeling Consortium estimated the death toll from HIV in sub-Saharan Africa at 14,872 adults and 1,582 children in the one month after Trump's January 2025 funding freeze.

[ 264 ] [ 265 ] A key controversy is whether or not waivers are being made and money actually starting to flow again for the most essential programs.

[ 262 ] For example, the Associated Press reported on February 19, that waivers for PEPFAR , the program that has saved 26 million lives from AIDS , were not in force, despite a federal judge having lifted the funding freeze.

[ 266 ] U.S. Army and Air Force service members assist USAID with the transportation of nearly 12,000 pounds of medical kits from the Netherlands, through Germany and on to Lebanon in August 2020.

In early February 2025, it was reported that the USAID director of security and a deputy were put on administrative leave after they "blocked efforts by DOGE members to physically access restricted areas" in order to obtain sensitive information. The DOGE members eventually gained access to the information, which reportedly included email as well as classified information for which they did not have security clearance. And they obtained the ability to lock USAID staff out. Musk had earlier tweeted "USAID is a criminal organization" and that it is "Time for it to die." [ 267 ] USAID staff were instructed to keep away from USAID headquarters while hundreds of USAID staff lost access to USAID computer systems.

[ 258 ] There have been reports that China has offered to take over development projects if the United States permanently leaves.

[ 268 ] [ 269 ] [ 270 ] During a February 6 press conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated, "If it's providing food or medicine or anything that is saving lives and is immediate and urgent, you're not included in the freeze." [ 271 ] However, a February 8 CNN article reported that many waivers were not being acted upon because of staff placed on leave, plus payment systems had been taken over.

[ 271 ] In an interview before the February 9 Super Bowl , Trump said, "Let him take care of the few good ones", referring to Rubio.

[ 272 ] Rubio's waivers were not in effect.

[ 273 ] On February 13, federal judge Amir Ali ordered the Trump administration to continue contracts and grants which were in effect January 19.

[ 274 ] Chief Justice John Roberts, overseeing cases for the District of Columbia, paused this order.

[ 275 ] [ 276 ] On March 5, the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that the Trump administration must comply with Judge Ali's order.

[ 277 ] [ 278 ] [ 279 ] However, the Supreme Court stated that Judge Ali must clarify the payment obligations with "due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines".

[ 277 ] On March 10, Judge Ali ruled that the Trump administration must pay for completed projects at the rate of 300 back payments a day, meaning four days for all 1,200 back payments, and this being for projects completed by February 13.

[ 280 ] [ 281 ] A March 11 ABC News article reported that, until recently, no payments were being made because DOGE had disabled the payment system.

[ 281 ] Keeping 17% of programs On March 10, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that he was cancelling 83% of USAID programs, or approximately 5,200 out of 6,200 programs. The remaining 1,000 programs (approximately) would be moved to the Department of State.

[ 282 ] [ 283 ] As of late March, DOGE no longer lists the details of canceled USAID contracts on its "Wall of Receipts." [ 284 ] DOGE lists approximately $12 billion saved, although a former USAID analyst estimates the actual amount is closer to $6 or $7 billion.

[ 284 ] President Trump stated the United States would help in response to the March 28 earthquake in Myanmar , although the question was asked by a former USAID executive of whether or not the United States will beat other countries in getting there with a relief team(s).

[ 285 ] In early April, USAID announced it was adding back 14 nations to grants under the UN's World Food Programme . These nations include Lebanon, Syria, Somalia, Jordan, Iraq and Ecuador, plus the International Organization for Migration in the Pacific region.

[ 286 ] However, food aid was not restored to either Yemen or Afghanistan, with a State Department spokesperson saying this was "based on concern that the funding was benefiting terrorist groups, including the Houthis and the Taliban".

[ 287 ] July 2025 rescissions (“claw backs”), but not for PEPFAR In June 2025, the White House requested that Congress pass a package of rescissions , or “claw backs”, of approximately $8 billion in foreign aid and $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting including NPR and PBS .

[ 288 ] The House of Representatives passed the cuts as requested. The Senate excluded the PEPFAR cuts, which is the program started in 2003 during the presidency of George W Bush to help provide HIV medicines to lower-income countries. The Senate passed two preliminary votes in close 51-50 fashion with Vice-President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking votes. A rescission is one of the exceptions to the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster rule.

[ 288 ] President Trump focused on the public broadcasting aspect, criticizing CNN and also “MSDNC” which is a portmanteau (“smash up”) of MSNBC and DNC (Democratic National Committee). In a social media post, he wrote, “Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement.” [ 289 ] In a late night session at 2:00 AM on July 17, the Senate voted 51-48 in favor of the cuts. Later that same day, the House of Representatives voted 216 - 213 for the Senate version, meaning PEPFAR was protected in the amount of $400 million.

[ 289 ] Regarding the cuts to public broadcasting, service to rural areas became one of the political issues.

[ 290 ] Refugees On May 12, 59 white South African refugees arrived from South Africa. The Trump administration has been criticized for fast-tracking their applications while pausing other refugee programs.

[ 291 ] The Trump administration slowed the entry of Afghan refugees into the U.S, including persons who had fought on the U.S. side against the Taliban. A leader of an American veterans group said, “these pilots risked everything for America. Their lives are now on the line because of our failure to follow through on our promises.” [ 292 ] On May 12, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Noem announced that TPS , or Temporary Protected Status , for Afghan refugees would be ended in 60 days, which is the shortest time period permitted by United States law. This decision cited improved conditions in Afghanistan.

[ 293 ] [ 294 ] The Hill reports that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has stated that the situation in Afghanistan has not improved, with a report stating “The large-scale returns are putting even greater pressure on already stretched humanitarian resources.” On the other hand, Secretary Noem has pointed to an increase in tourists from China and a drop in the number of Afghans needing assistance from 29 million to 24 million.

[ 293 ] Fox News reports that the leader of “Afghans for Trump,” which formed in the aftermath of President Biden's chaotic 2021 withdraw from Afghanistan, states that conditions have not significantly improved and is urging President Trump to reconsider.

[ 294 ] Trade Main article: Tariffs in the second Trump administration Trump with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland on the day of the signing of the US-EU trade agreement, July 27, 2025 Trump has been a strong proponent of tariffs both during his campaign and as President.

[ 295 ] [ 296 ] Throughout the first 100 days of his presidency, he implemented tariffs on multiple different countries, though mainly China, Mexico, and Canada, leading to retaliation.

[ 297 ] On April 2, 2025, a day Trump nicknamed " Liberation Day ," he announced a 10% universal import duty on all goods brought into the US (even higher for some trade partners), before ordering a 90-day pause shortly after drops in the market.

[ 298 ] [ 299 ] The Trump administration promised it would achieve 90 trade deals during this period, though only managed to achieve two by the end of the deadline, July 9, as well as ongoing negotiations with China, extending the window until August 1.

[ 300 ] Trump has since then threatened to raise tariffs on multiple countries, including Japan and South Korea.

[ 301 ] Donald Trump's four-day visit to the Middle East focused primarily on securing business deals and investments in the United States.

[ 302 ] [ 303 ] [ 304 ] [ 305 ] 90-day deal with China in May 2025 On May 12, the United States and China announced that tariffs would be reduced for a period of 90 days. U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced from 145% to 30% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods would be reduced from 125% to 10%.

[ 306 ] [ 307 ] However, this 30% is still more expensive for consumers in the United States compared to the state of affairs before Trump's initial tariffs.

[ 308 ] US–EU Trade Deal On July 27, 2025, the United States and the European Union concluded a trade agreement, providing for 15% tariffs on European exports. The deal was announced by Trump and President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , at Turnberry , Scotland.

[ 309 ] [ 310 ] European states committed to $750 billion in energy purchases and $600 billion in additional investments in the United States.

[ 311 ] Expansionism and revanchism Main article: American expansionism under Donald Trump Trump with NATO General Secretary Mark Rutte at the 2025 The Hague NATO summit In the lead-up to his second inauguration, Trump proposed plans and ideas that would expand the United States' political influence and territory.

[ 312 ] It has been characterized as a revival of the Monroe Doctrine .

[ 313 ] The last territory acquired by the United States was in 1947 when the Mariana , Caroline , and Marshall Islands were acquired.

Canada See also: Movements for the annexation of Canada to the United States § Proposals to annex Canada by President Donald Trump Trump with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney , June 2025 The Trump administration has imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian goods imports that do not fall under Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement , with exceptions for steel, aluminum, and Canadian-made passenger vehicle content.

[ 314 ] Canadian officials responded with retaliatory 25% tariffs, [ 315 ] [ 316 ] and have even proposed cutting off the supply of Canadian energy into the Northern United States .

[ 317 ] Manitoba has diverted energy to Canada that it previously supplied to the USA.

[ 318 ] Peter Navarro , a trade envoy and high-ranking Trump official, has suggested expelling Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance to increase pressure in the trade war.

[ 319 ] Trump has repeatedly stated his desire for the United States to annex Canada and calling for it to become the 51st state, [ 320 ] calling former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau "Governor of the Great State of Canada".

[ 321 ] Trudeau stated to business leaders in Canada that he believes the annexation threats are a "real thing." [ 322 ] The strained relations have led to a "Buy Canadian" movement to boycott American goods and services, [ 323 ] and booing the American national anthem during international hockey games.

[ 324 ] When tariffs were implemented on March 4, Trudeau stated that Trump's goal in the trade war was to weaken Canada in order to annex it.

[ 325 ] Greenland See also: Proposals for the United States to purchase Greenland Vice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, March 28, 2025 Trump and Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen at NATO summit in The Hague , June 25, 2025 In December 2024, Trump stated a further proposal for the United States to purchase Greenland from Denmark , describing ownership and control of the island as "an absolute necessity" for national security purposes. This builds upon a prior offer from Trump to buy Greenland during his first term, which the Danish Realm refused, causing him to cancel his August 2019 visit to Denmark.

[ 326 ] [ better source needed ] On January 7, 2025, Trump's son Donald Trump Jr.

visited Greenland's capital city Nuuk alongside Charlie Kirk to hand out MAGA hats .

[ 327 ] At a press conference the following day, Trump refused to rule out military or economic force to take over Greenland or the Panama Canal.

[ 328 ] However, he did rule out military force in taking over Canada.

[ 328 ] On January 14, the Trump-affiliated Nelk Boys also visited Nuuk, handing out dollar bills to locals.

[ 329 ] On January 16, the CEOs of major Danish companies Novo Nordisk, Vestas and Carlsberg among others were assembled for a crisis meeting in the Ministry of State to discuss the situation.

[ 330 ] [ 331 ] On the subsequent day, former chief executive Friis Arne Petersen in the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the situation as "historically unheard of", while Noa Redington , special adviser to former prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt , compared the international pressure on Denmark that during the 2005 Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy .

[ 332 ] On February 12, 2025, a bill was introduced in Congress to advance efforts to acquire Greenland and rename it Red, White, and Blueland.

[ 333 ] Panama Canal In 2024, Trump demanded that Panama return control of the Panama Canal to the United States due to 'excessive rates' being charged for American passage.

[ 334 ] The United States previously was in control of the Panama Canal Zone from 1903 until 1999 , and has invaded Panama before in 1989 .

[ 335 ] [ 336 ] Trump told Congress in March 2025 that his administration "will be reclaiming the Panama Canal".

[ 337 ] Also that month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth instructed the Trump administration to "immediately" present "credible military options to ensure fair and unfettered US military and commercial access to the Panama Canal".

[ 338 ] Ethics See also: First presidency of Donald Trump § Ethics Trump's second presidency was described by political commentators as having fewer prohibitions on business activity and guardrails against potential conflicts of interest than his first, and for having more opportunities to directly influence Trump.

[ 339 ] [ 340 ] Trump repealed and rolled back anti-corruption measures and ethical standards for himself and his allies, dropped corruption charges against political figures with ties to him, and fired inspectors generals investigating fraud and abuse.

The New York Times described Trump as making up statistics "out of thin air", and for accusing government agencies and "anyone he disfavors of corruption and even criminality without proof".

[ 341 ] His second presidency was described as breaking with decades of ethical norms, [ 342 ] and raising substantial corruption concerns.

[ 343 ] [ 344 ] Congressional Republicans largely downplayed or ignored the concerns.

[ 345 ] [ 342 ] Federal judges found many of the administration's actions to be illegal, [ 346 ] and by mid-July, a Washington Post analysis found he defied judges and the courts in roughly one third of all cases against him, actions which were described by legal experts as unprecedented for any presidential administration.

[ 347 ] His defiance of court orders and a claimed right to disobey the courts raised fears among legal experts of a constitutional crisis .

[ 348 ] By August 2025, several grant terminations and spending freezes were found by judges and the Government Accountability Office as being illegal and unconstitutional.

[ 349 ] [ 350 ] [ 351 ] "Pay-for-Access" and MAGA INC Trump maintained what The New York Times described as a "Pay-for-Access" operation, with millions being raised for his pro-Trump PAC, MAGA Inc , which had collected $177 million dollars in the first half of 2025, twice as much than was raised by the Republican National Committee and unusually large for term-limited presidents. Millions were raised from individuals, lobbyists, corporations, and donors to it and other Trump-friendly outlets. Those that gave were granted access to the president and shortly afterward several received presidential pardons, favorable regulatory and policy actions, or appointments for government positions.

[ 352 ] Examples of criticism included but were not limited to the Trump administration lifting a ban on Central Romana Corporation shipping sugar to the United States following allegations of forced labor at the company. According to OpenSecrets , Fanjul Corp which owns Central Romana had given $1 million to MAGA Inc.

[ 353 ] [ 354 ] Another action criticized was the pardon of Paul Walczak following his mothers attendance at a $1 million per personal fund raising "candlelight dinner" sponsored by MAGA Inc. Walczak was alleged by prosecutors to have withheld over $10 million from paychecks of staff at a nursing home for trust fund taxes instead using the money to buy a $2 million yacht among other expenses. Walczak was supposed to pay $4.3 million in restitution prior to his pardon.

[ 355 ] [ 356 ] The Trump administration was also criticized for delaying a rule change which would restrict coverage of skin substitutes under Medicare after Extremity Care "a leading seller of skin substitutes" gave $5 million to MAGA Inc.

[ 357 ] [ 358 ] Government targeting of political opponents and civil society Protest against the detention of Mahmoud Khalil , New York City on March 10, 2025 These paragraphs are an excerpt from Targeting of political opponents and civil society under the second Trump administration .

[ edit ] During Donald Trump 's second presidency, the Trump administration took a series of actions using the government to target his political opponents and civil society . His actions were described by the media as part of his promised "retribution" and "revenge" campaign, within the context of a strongly personalist and leader-centered conception of politics.

[ 359 ] [ 360 ] [ 361 ] [ 362 ] During his 2024 presidential campaign , he repeatedly stated that he had "every right" to go after his political opponents.

[ 363 ] He undertook a massive expansion of presidential power under a maximalist interpretation of the unitary executive theory , [ 364 ] and several of his actions ignored or violated federal laws, regulations, and the Constitution according to American legal scholars.

[ 365 ] [ 366 ] [ 367 ] He threatened, signed executive actions, and ordered investigations into his political opponents, critics, and organizations aligned with the Democratic Party .

[ 368 ] He politicized the civil service , [ 364 ] undertaking mass layoffs of government employees to recruit workers more loyal to himself.

[ 369 ] He ended the post- Watergate norm of Justice Department independence, weaponizing it and ordering it to target his political enemies.

[ 370 ] He utilized several government agencies to retaliate against his political enemies and continued filing personal lawsuits against his political opponents, companies, and news organizations that angered him.

[ 361 ] By July, 2025, Trump had extracted more than $1.2 billion in settlements in a "cultural crackdown" against a variety of institutions that largely chose to settle rather than fight back.

[ 371 ] He engaged in an unprecedented targeting of law firms and lawyers that previously represented positions adverse to himself.

[ 372 ] [ 373 ] He targeted higher education by demanding it give federal oversight of curriculum and targeted activists , legal immigrants, tourists, and students with visas who expressed criticism of his policies or engaged in pro-Palestinian advocacy.

[ 374 ] He detained and deported United States citizens .

[ 375 ] His actions against civil society were described by legal experts and hundreds of political scientists as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding , [ 376 ] [ 377 ] [ 378 ] and negatively impacting free speech and the rule of law .

[ 370 ] [ 379 ] [ 380 ] [ 381 ] Conflicts of interest Trump's second presidency included multiple potential conflicts of interest that did not exist during his first term in office, including a publicly traded company in Truth Social , a cryptocurrency venture , new overseas real estate deals involving state-affiliated entities, and several branding and licensing deals selling Trump-branded merchandise.

[ 339 ] His 2024 campaign was noted for an "unprecedented" mixing of personal business and political fundraising.

[ 382 ] Trump promoted $59.99 bibles , $399 sneakers, $99 "Victory47" cologne, and $99 Trump-branded NFT digital trading cards for his personal, non-campaign accounts.

[ 383 ] [ 384 ] Trump's campaign was noted for spending large sums of campaign money at Trump-owned businesses, in particular his Mar-a-Lago resort and the Trump National Doral Miami .

[ 385 ] After winning the election, Trump mirrored his first term's ethics commitments and did not divest from his interests in branding and real estate. He also did not place his assets in a trust managed by an independent trustee.

[ 386 ] Trump did not adopt his own formal ethics guidelines.

[ 387 ] Trump transferred his shares of Truth Social into a trust in which he is the sole beneficiary, of which his oldest son is the trustee. Ethics experts described it as falling "well short of the blind trusts and divestitures from private business interests that other presidents have used to avoid ethical conflicts with their job". Trump's son, Eric Trump , said the Trump Organization would continue to pursue business deals overseas, dropping a self-imposed prohibition during Trump's first presidency.

[ 340 ] Trump profited from holding events at his hotels and golf courses.

[ 386 ] [ 388 ] Trump's conflicts of interest were described as having national-security risks, with particular emphasis placed on relationships with the Saudi and Dubai governments through the Trump Organization and his son-in-law Jared Kushner 's investment fund backed by the Saudis.

[ 389 ] Trump noted that conflict of interest laws did not apply to him and that he was protected by broad immunity for his official actions as president.

[ 390 ] On March 11, 2025, Trump and Elon Musk promoted Tesla vehicles on the White House south lawn.

[ 391 ] As part of the Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions , Trump repealed Ethic Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel which prohibited executive branch employees accepting major gifts from lobbyists and two year bans on lobbyists seeking executive jobs and vice versa. Critics described the repeal as the opposite of his pledge to " drain the swamp ".

[ 392 ] Trump also signed Executive Order 14209 to stop the Justice Department prosecuting Americans accused of bribing foreign government officials under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act .

[ 393 ] Trump's wife, Melania, entered into a deal with Amazon to create a documentary about herself, which raised ethics concerns as it was made while she was still in office.

[ 386 ] In March 2025, Trump praised Tesla's cars on the White House lawn with notes about the cars' features alongside Elon Musk in "something of a sales pitch" which was described in The Nation as "brazenly corrupt".

[ 391 ] [ 394 ] Countries facing tariffs were pushed by the State Department to approve Musk's Starlink satellite service.

[ 395 ] On April 9, 2025, Trump's encouragement of investors to buy stocks hours before pausing tariffs that sent markets soaring was scrutinized by Democrats and government ethics experts as possible market manipulation.

[ 396 ] Representative Adam Schiff called on Congress to investigate whether in pausing tariffs, Trump had engaged in insider trading or market manipulation.

[ 397 ] His use of tariff exemptions also raised concerns of corruption, with claims of insider trading and special exemptions being given to friends and to punish rivals.

[ 398 ] [ 399 ] In May 2025, Trump's intention to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar to first serve as Air Force One and later be transferred to his presidential library elicited rare, bipartisan criticism, with his supporters deriding it as a "bribe", "grift" and "corruption".

[ 400 ] The Guardian criticized it as an example of a quid pro quo .

[ 401 ] The Boston Globe described the deal as an example of an increasingly transactional presidency, describing it as more direct than during his first term and showing that he was "willing to bend for anyone who gives him what he craves: praise, prestige, and a cut of the profits".

[ 402 ] Trump's cabinet were noted to have a large number of potential conflicts of interest, with the Campaign Legal Center finding over 467 that would require recusal, with the most, 106, belonging to Howard Lutnick .

[ 387 ] Trump Media gifted 25,946 shares of stock of DJT to each of his picks for FBI director, Kash Patel , and education secretary nominee, Linda McMahon , totaling $779,400 each as of January 31, 2025. Both members served as directors for his company, and they later said they would not accept the award. He also gifted thousands of shares to his son.

[ 403 ] Cryptocurrency ventures See also: Cryptocurrency in the second Donald Trump administration Trump and his family involvement in the cryptocurrency industry have given rise to ethical and legal concerns.

[ 404 ] On January 17, 2025, Trump launched, promoted, and personally benefited [ 392 ] from a cryptocurrency memecoin , $Trump , that soared to a market valuation of over $5 billion within a few hours—a total $27 billion diluted value—through a Trump-owned company called CIC Digital LLC, which owned 80 percent of the coin's supply.

[ 405 ] Within two days, the $Trump coin became the 19th most valuable form of cryptocurrency in the world, with a total trading value of nearly $13 billion, and a total of $29 billion worth of trades based on a $64 value of each of the 200 million tokens issued by the afternoon of January 19.

The New York Times reported that Trump affiliates controlled an additional 800 million tokens that, hypothetically, could be worth over $51 billion, potentially making Trump one of the richest people in the world. Trump also launched a new meme coin named after his wife, $Melania, and promoted it on Truth Social shortly before attending an inauguration rally. The crypto venture was criticized by ethics experts and government watchdogs.

[ 406 ] The venture and the possibility of foreign governments buying the coin was highlighted as possibly violating the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause .

[ 407 ] He promoted exclusive access to him for the largest holders of $Trump, including hosting a dinner , which according to The New York Times , certain buyers in interviews and statements said they "bought the coins or entered the dinner contest with the intention of securing an action by Mr. Trump to affect United States policy".

[ 408 ] He directly benefited from his cryptocurrency company World Liberty Financial which engaged in an unprecedented mixing of private enterprise and government policy. It directly solicited access to Trump with secret payments and currency swaps from foreign investors, companies, and individuals with criminal records and investigations. At least one investigation was dropped after payment worth several million was made to the firm, and Trump granted an official pardon to an investor of a company World Liberty had invested in. Trump's family received a cut of all transactions made through the World Liberty, and the company directly advertised its connections to Trump, who disclosed income of nearly US$60 million in an ethics filing.

[ 409 ] [ 410 ] Several actions taken by Trump's administration regarding cryptocurrency were noted to bolster the company's assets and position. A spokeswoman for Trump stated that since his assets were in a trust managed by his children, there were "no conflicts of interest".

[ 390 ] On May 12, 2025, another family bitcoin company co-founded by Eric Trump in March, American Bitcoin , announced plans to go public by merging with an existing Nasdaq company.

[ 411 ] Elections during the second Trump presidency Congressional party leaders Senate leaders House leaders Congress Year Majority Minority Speaker Minority 119th 2025–present Thune Schumer Johnson Jeffries Republican seats in Congress Congress Senate House 119th [ b ] 53 220 Internal Republican politics MAGA fallout over non-release of Jeffrey Epstein files On July 7, 2025, the FBI issued a two-page statement saying they had concluded that convicted sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein did not possess a " client list ," even though Attorney General Pam Bondi had hinted in February that such a document was on her desk.  Several right-wing media personalities were highly critical of the decision.  And per more mainstream sources, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is considering resigning and has been feuding with Bondi.  One of the reasons given for the non-release is the privacy of the victims.

[ 412 ] On July 12, President Trump defended Bondi and posted, “They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening.” [ 412 ] Historical evaluations and public opinion Evaluations Though Trump repeatedly promoted his 2024 victory as a mandate —to inflate the actual degree of voter support—he failed to receive 50% of the popular vote.

[ 413 ] His 1.5 percentage point margin of victory in 2024 (shown in chart) place it in only the 20th percentile of presidential elections since 1828.

[ 414 ] Professor Christina Pagel mapped the first actions of the Trump administration in a Venn diagram that identifies "five broad domains that correspond to features of proto-authoritarian states". These five domains are: undermining democratic institutions and the rule of law, dismantling federal government; dismantling social protections and rights, enrichment and corruption; suppressing dissent and controlling information; attacking science, environment, health, arts and education; aggressive foreign policy and global destabilization.

[ 415 ] Journalist Martin Sandu and authoritarian politics researcher Alex Norris described the maximalist interpretation of executive power in Trump's second term as president, including sweeping executive orders , the federal funding freeze , actions against political opponents and the media , pardons of those involved in the 2021 attempted self-coup, the actions of Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency , and the like as an attempted self-coup .

[ 416 ] [ 417 ] Political scientist Lee Morgenbesser argued the actions of DOGE are a form of state capture .

[ 418 ] Public opinion Main articles: Opinion polling on the second Donald Trump administration and United States presidential approval rating Trump's presidential approval ratings consistently declined over the first six months of his second term, with more disapproval ratings than approval ratings just two months after his elections and disapproval ratings rising to over 50% after three months.

[ 419 ] Hands Off! Protest in Chico, California, in April 2025 Donald Trump began his second term with another historically low job approval rating, only improving on his lowest-ever rating (occurring in his first term) by three percentage points.

[ 420 ] President Trump began his first term at 45% job approval, and his second with 47%. According to Gallup , "Trump remains the only elected president with sub-50% initial approval ratings".

[ 420 ] In a CBS News / YouGov poll conducted from February 5–7, 2025, Trump reached a career high poll rating of 53%.

[ 421 ] According to ABC News, Trump's approval rating at the end of his first 100 days in office was 39%, worse than any president's approval after his first 100 days since at least 1945.

[ 422 ] By July 2025, Gallup found Trump's approval rating reached the lowest for his second term at 37% largely driven by declining support from independents.

[ 423 ] By August 2025, multiple surveys revealed record or near-record low job approval ratings which Gallup found to be lower than any modern president.

[ 424 ] Immigration enforcement and protests against ICE In early June 2025 in response to street protests against ICE actions , President Trump activated and sent 2,100 members of the California National Guard to the Los Angeles area.

[ 425 ] Reuters reported that the protests were the strongest domestic backlash to Trump since he took office in January, [ 426 ] and became a focal point in a national debate over immigration, protest, the use of federal force in domestic affairs, the boundaries of presidential power, and freedom of speech and assembly.

[ 427 ] June 2025 military parade and "No Kings" protests On June 14, the Trump administration held the U.S. Army 250th Anniversary Parade in Washington, DC, to celebrate the anniversary of the U.S. Army and coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday.

[ 428 ] The parade is estimated to have cost somewhere between $25 and $45 million.

[ 428 ] In protest, 50501 , Indivisible , and other organizations [ 429 ] organized No Kings protests in many American cities.  Millions attended the largest protest since Trump was re-elected.

The Washington Post . Retrieved August 1, 2025 .

A comprehensive analysis of hundreds of lawsuits against Trump policies shows dozens of examples of defiance, delay and dishonesty, which experts say pose an unprecedented threat to the U.S. legal system. [...] The Post examined 337 lawsuits filed against the administration since Trump returned to the White House and began a rapid-fire effort to reshape government programs and policy. As of mid-July, courts had ruled against the administration in 165 of the lawsuits. The Post found that the administration is accused of defying or frustrating court oversight in 57 of those cases — almost 35 percent. Legal experts said the pattern of conduct is unprecedented for any presidential administration and threatens to undermine the judiciary's role as a check on an executive branch asserting vast powers that test the boundaries of the law and Constitution.

The failure to fund grant awards violated the Impoundment Control Act and the Constitution, which certified Congress as the branch of government responsible for funding decisions, said GAO.
