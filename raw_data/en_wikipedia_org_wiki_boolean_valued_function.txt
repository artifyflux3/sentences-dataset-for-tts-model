In the formal sciences , mathematics , mathematical logic , statistics , and their applied disciplines, a Boolean-valued function may also be referred to as a characteristic function, indicator function , predicate, or proposition. In all of these uses, it is understood that the various terms refer to a mathematical object and not the corresponding semiotic sign or syntactic expression.

In formal semantic theories of truth , a truth predicate is a predicate on the sentences of a formal language , interpreted for logic, that formalizes the intuitive concept that is normally expressed by saying that a sentence is true. A truth predicate may have additional domains beyond the formal language domain, if that is what is required to determine a final truth value .
