In geometry , a uniform 4-polytope (or uniform polychoron ) [ 1 ] is a 4-dimensional polytope which is vertex-transitive and whose cells are uniform polyhedra , and faces are regular polygons .

There are 47 non- prismatic convex uniform 4-polytopes. There are two infinite sets of convex prismatic forms, along with 17 cases arising as prisms of the convex uniform polyhedra. There are also an unknown number of non-convex star forms.

History of discovery [ edit ] Convex Regular polytopes : 1852 : Ludwig Schläfli proved in his manuscript Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität that there are exactly 6 regular polytopes in 4 dimensions and only 3 in 5 or more dimensions.

Regular star 4-polytopes ( star polyhedron cells and/or vertex figures ) 1852 : Ludwig Schläfli also found 4 of the 10 regular star 4-polytopes, discounting 6 with cells or vertex figures { 5 / 2 ,5} and {5, 5 / 2 } .

1883 : Edmund Hess completed the list of 10 of the nonconvex regular 4-polytopes, in his book (in German) Einleitung in die Lehre von der Kugelteilung mit besonderer Berücksichtigung ihrer Anwendung auf die Theorie der Gleichflächigen und der gleicheckigen Polyeder Einleitung in die Lehre von der Kugelteilung mit besonderer Berücksichtigung ihrer Anwendung auf die Theorie der Gleichflächigen und der gleicheckigen Polyeder, von dr.

Convex semiregular polytopes : (Various definitions before Coxeter's uniform category) 1900 : Thorold Gosset enumerated the list of nonprismatic semiregular convex polytopes with regular cells ( Platonic solids ) in his publication On the Regular and Semi-Regular Figures in Space of n Dimensions . In four dimensions, this gives the rectified 5-cell , the rectified 600-cell , and the snub 24-cell .

[ 2 ] 1910 : Alicia Boole Stott , in her publication Geometrical deduction of semiregular from regular polytopes and space fillings , expanded the definition by also allowing Archimedean solid and prism cells. This construction enumerated 45 semiregular 4-polytopes, corresponding to the nonprismatic forms listed below.

[ 3 ] The snub 24-cell and grand antiprism were missing from her list.

[ 4 ] 1911 : Pieter Hendrik Schoute published Analytic treatment of the polytopes regularly derived from the regular polytopes , followed Boole-Stott's notations, enumerating the convex uniform polytopes by symmetry based on 5-cell , 8-cell / 16-cell , and 24-cell .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] 1912 : E. L. Elte independently expanded on Gosset's list with the publication The Semiregular Polytopes of the Hyperspaces , polytopes with one or two types of semiregular facets.

[ 7 ] Convex uniform polytopes : 1940 : The search was expanded systematically by H.S.M. Coxeter in his publication Regular and Semi-Regular Polytopes .

Convex uniform 4-polytopes : 1965 : The complete list of convex forms was finally enumerated by John Horton Conway and Michael Guy , in their publication Four-Dimensional Archimedean Polytopes , established by computer analysis, adding only one non-Wythoffian convex 4-polytope, the grand antiprism.

1966 Norman Johnson completes his Ph.D. dissertation The Theory of Uniform Polytopes and Honeycombs under advisor Coxeter, completes the basic theory of uniform polytopes for dimensions 4 and higher.

1986 Coxeter published a paper Regular and Semi-Regular Polytopes II which included analysis of the unique snub 24-cell structure, and the symmetry of the anomalous grand antiprism.

1998 [ 8 ] -2000 : The 4-polytopes were systematically named by Norman Johnson, and given by George Olshevsky's online indexed enumeration (used as a basis for this listing). Johnson named the 4-polytopes as polychora, like polyhedra for 3-polytopes, from the Greek roots poly ("many") and choros ("room" or "space").

[ 9 ] The names of the uniform polychora started with the 6 regular polychora with prefixes based on rings in the Coxeter diagrams; truncation t 0,1 , cantellation, t 0,2 , runcination t 0,3 , with single ringed forms called rectified, and bi, tri-prefixes added when the first ring was on the second or third nodes.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] 2004 : A proof that the Conway-Guy set is complete was published by Marco Möller in his dissertation, Vierdimensionale Archimedische Polytope . Möller reproduced Johnson's naming system in his listing.

[ 12 ] 2008 : The Symmetries of Things [ 13 ] was published by John H. Conway and contains the first print-published listing of the convex uniform 4-polytopes and higher dimensional polytopes by Coxeter group family, with general vertex figure diagrams for each ringed Coxeter diagram permutation—snub, grand antiprism, and duoprisms—which he called proprisms for product prisms. He used his own ijk -ambo naming scheme for the indexed ring permutations beyond truncation and bitruncation, and all of Johnson's names were included in the book index.

Nonregular uniform star 4-polytopes : (similar to the nonconvex uniform polyhedra ) 1966 : Johnson describes three nonconvex uniform antiprisms in 4-space in his dissertation.

[ 14 ] 1990-2006 : In a collaborative search, up to 2005 a total of 1845 uniform 4-polytopes (convex and nonconvex) had been identified by Jonathan Bowers and George Olshevsky, [ 15 ] with an additional four discovered in 2006 for a total of 1849. The count includes the 74 prisms of the 75 non-prismatic uniform polyhedra (since that is a finite set – the cubic prism is excluded as it duplicates the tesseract), but not the infinite categories of duoprisms or prisms of antiprisms.

[ 16 ] 2020-2023 : 342 new polychora were found, bringing up the total number of known uniform 4-polytopes to 2191. The list has not been proven complete.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] Regular 4-polytopes [ edit ] Regular 4-polytopes are a subset of the uniform 4-polytopes, which satisfy additional requirements.

Regular 4-polytopes can be expressed with Schläfli symbol { p , q , r } have cells of type { p , q }, faces of type { p }, edge figures { r }, and vertex figures { q , r }.

The existence of a regular 4-polytope { p , q , r } is constrained by the existence of the regular polyhedra { p , q } which becomes cells, and { q , r } which becomes the vertex figure .

Existence as a finite 4-polytope is dependent upon an inequality: [ 18 ] sin ⁡ ⁡ ( π π p ) sin ⁡ ⁡ ( π π r ) > cos ⁡ ⁡ ( π π q ) .

{\displaystyle \sin \left({\frac {\pi }{p}}\right)\sin \left({\frac {\pi }{r}}\right)>\cos \left({\frac {\pi }{q}}\right).} The 16 regular 4-polytopes , with the property that all cells, faces, edges, and vertices are congruent: 6 regular convex 4-polytopes : 5-cell {3,3,3}, 8-cell {4,3,3}, 16-cell {3,3,4}, 24-cell {3,4,3}, 120-cell {5,3,3}, and 600-cell {3,3,5}.

10 regular star 4-polytopes : icosahedral 120-cell {3,5, 5 / 2 }, small stellated 120-cell { 5 / 2 ,5,3}, great 120-cell {5, 5 / 2 ,5}, grand 120-cell {5,3, 5 / 2 }, great stellated 120-cell { 5 / 2 ,3,5}, grand stellated 120-cell { 5 / 2 ,5, 5 / 2 }, great grand 120-cell {5, 5 / 2 ,3}, great icosahedral 120-cell {3, 5 / 2 ,5}, grand 600-cell {3,3, 5 / 2 }, and great grand stellated 120-cell { 5 / 2 ,3,3}.

Convex uniform 4-polytopes [ edit ] Symmetry of uniform 4-polytopes in four dimensions [ edit ] Main article: Point groups in four dimensions Orthogonal subgroups The 24 mirrors of F 4 can be decomposed into 2 orthogonal D 4 groups: = (12 mirrors) = (12 mirrors) The 10 mirrors of B 3 × A 1 can be decomposed into orthogonal groups, 4 A 1 and D 3 : = (3+1 mirrors) = (6 mirrors) There are 5 fundamental mirror symmetry point group families in 4-dimensions: A 4 = , B 4 = , D 4 = , F 4 = , H 4 = .

[ 10 ] There are also 3 prismatic groups A 3 A 1 = , B 3 A 1 = , H 3 A 1 = , and duoprismatic groups: I 2 (p)×I 2 (q) = . Each group defined by a Goursat tetrahedron fundamental domain bounded by mirror planes.

Each reflective uniform 4-polytope can be constructed in one or more reflective point group in 4 dimensions by a Wythoff construction , represented by rings around permutations of nodes in a Coxeter diagram . Mirror hyperplanes can be grouped, as seen by colored nodes, separated by even-branches. Symmetry groups of the form [a,b,a], have an extended symmetry, [[a,b,a]], doubling the symmetry order. This includes [3,3,3], [3,4,3], and [ p ,2, p ]. Uniform polytopes in these group with symmetric rings contain this extended symmetry.

If all mirrors of a given color are unringed (inactive) in a given uniform polytope, it will have a lower symmetry construction by removing all of the inactive mirrors. If all the nodes of a given color are ringed (active), an alternation operation can generate a new 4-polytope with chiral symmetry, shown as "empty" circled nodes", but the geometry is not generally adjustable to create uniform solutions .

TOTAL: 68 − 4 = 64 These 64 uniform 4-polytopes are indexed below by George Olshevsky. Repeated symmetry forms are indexed in brackets.

In addition to the 64 above, there are 2 infinite prismatic sets that generate all of the remaining convex forms: Set of uniform antiprismatic prisms - sr{ p ,2}×{ } - Polyhedral prisms of two antiprisms .

Set of uniform duoprisms - { p }×{ q } - A Cartesian product of two polygons.

The A 4 family [ edit ] Further information: A4 polytope The 5-cell has diploid pentachoric [3,3,3] symmetry , [ 10 ] of order 120, isomorphic to the permutations of five elements, because all pairs of vertices are related in the same way.

Facets (cells) are given, grouped in their Coxeter diagram locations by removing specified nodes.

The snub 24-cell is repeat to this family for completeness. It is an alternation of the cantitruncated 16-cell or truncated 24-cell , with the half symmetry group [(3,3) + ,4]. The truncated octahedral cells become icosahedra. The cubes becomes tetrahedra, and 96 new tetrahedra are created in the gaps from the removed vertices.

The F 4 family [ edit ] Further information: F4 polytope This family has diploid icositetrachoric symmetry , [ 10 ] [3,4,3], of order 24×48=1152: the 48 symmetries of the octahedron for each of the 24 cells. There are 3 small index subgroups, with the first two isomorphic pairs generating uniform 4-polytopes which are also repeated in other families, [3 + ,4,3], [3,4,3 + ], and [3,4,3] + , all order 576.

Like the 5-cell, the 24-cell is self-dual, and so the following three forms have twice as many symmetries, bringing their total to 2304 ( extended icositetrachoric symmetry [[3,4,3]]).

This family has order 12×16=192: 4!/2=12 permutations of the four axes, half as alternated, 2 4 =16 for reflection in each axis. There is one small index subgroups that generating uniform 4-polytopes, [3 1,1,1 ] + , order 96.

In contrast to its appearance within former groups as partly snubbed 4-polytope, only within this symmetry group it has the full analogy to the Kepler snubs, i.e. the snub cube and the snub dodecahedron .

The grand antiprism [ edit ] There is one non-Wythoffian uniform convex 4-polytope, known as the grand antiprism , consisting of 20 pentagonal antiprisms forming two perpendicular rings joined by 300 tetrahedra .  It is loosely analogous to the three-dimensional antiprisms , which consist of two parallel polygons joined by a band of triangles . Unlike them, however, the grand antiprism is not a member of an infinite family of uniform polytopes.

Its symmetry is the ionic diminished Coxeter group , [[10,2 + ,10]], order 400.

The prismatic uniform 4-polytopes consist of two infinite families: Polyhedral prisms : products of a line segment and a uniform polyhedron.  This family is infinite because it includes prisms built on 3-dimensional prisms and antiprisms .

Duoprisms : products of two polygons.

Convex polyhedral prisms [ edit ] The most obvious family of prismatic 4-polytopes is the polyhedral prisms, i.e. products of a polyhedron with a line segment .  The cells of such a 4-polytopes are two identical uniform polyhedra lying in parallel hyperplanes (the base cells) and a layer of prisms joining them (the lateral cells).  This family includes prisms for the 75 nonprismatic uniform polyhedra (of which 18 are convex; one of these, the cube-prism, is listed above as the tesseract ).

[ citation needed ] There are 18 convex polyhedral prisms created from 5 Platonic solids and 13 Archimedean solids as well as for the infinite families of three-dimensional prisms and antiprisms .

[ citation needed ] The symmetry number of a polyhedral prism is twice that of the base polyhedron.

Tetrahedral prisms: A 3 × A 1 [ edit ] This prismatic tetrahedral symmetry is [3,3,2], order 48. There are two index 2 subgroups, [(3,3) + ,2] and [3,3,2] + , but the second doesn't generate a uniform 4-polytope.

The second is the infinite family of uniform duoprisms , products of two regular polygons . A duoprism's Coxeter-Dynkin diagram is . Its vertex figure is a disphenoid tetrahedron , .

This family overlaps with the first: when one of the two "factor" polygons is a square, the product is equivalent to a hyperprism whose base is a three-dimensional prism.  The symmetry number of a duoprism whose factors are a p -gon and a q -gon (a " p,q -duoprism") is 4 pq if p ≠ q ; if the factors are both p -gons, the symmetry number is 8 p 2 . The tesseract can also be considered a 4,4-duoprism.

The extended f-vector of { p }×{ q } is ( p , p ,1)*( q , q ,1) = ( pq ,2 pq , pq + p + q , p + q ).

= gives the family of duoantiprisms , but they generally cannot be made uniform. p=q=2 is the only convex case that can be made uniform, giving the regular 16-cell. p=5, q=5/3 is the only nonconvex case that can be made uniform, giving the so-called great duoantiprism .

[ 23 ] Polygonal prismatic prisms: [p] × [ ] × [ ] [ edit ] The infinite set of uniform prismatic prisms overlaps with the 4-p duoprisms: (p≥3) - - p cubes and 4 p -gonal prisms - (All are the same as 4-p duoprism ) The second polytope in the series is a lower symmetry of the regular tesseract , {4}×{4}.

Nonuniform alternations [ edit ] Like the 3-dimensional snub cube , , an alternation removes half the vertices, in two chiral sets of vertices from the ringed form , however the uniform solution requires the vertex positions be adjusted for equal lengths. In four dimensions, this adjustment is only possible for 2 alternated figures, while the rest only exist as nonequilateral alternated figures.

Coxeter showed only two uniform solutions for rank 4 Coxeter groups with all rings alternated (shown with empty circle nodes). The first is , s{2 1,1,1 } which represented an index 24 subgroup ( symmetry [2,2,2] + , order 8) form of the demitesseract , , h{4,3,3} (symmetry [1 + ,4,3,3] = [3 1,1,1 ], order 192). The second is , s{3 1,1,1 }, which is an index 6 subgroup (symmetry [3 1,1,1 ] + , order 96) form of the snub 24-cell , , s{3,4,3}, (symmetry [3 + ,4,3], order 576).

Other alternations, such as , as an alternation from the omnitruncated tesseract , can not be made uniform as solving for equal edge lengths are in general overdetermined (there are six equations but only four variables). Such nonuniform alternated figures can be constructed as vertex-transitive 4-polytopes by the removal of one of two half sets of the vertices of the full ringed figure, but will have unequal edge lengths. Just like uniform alternations, they will have half of the symmetry of uniform figure, like [4,3,3] + , order 192, is the symmetry of the alternated omnitruncated tesseract .

[ 24 ] Wythoff constructions with alternations produce vertex-transitive figures that can be made equilateral, but not uniform because the alternated gaps (around the removed vertices) create cells that are not regular or semiregular. A proposed name for such figures is scaliform polytopes .

[ 25 ] This category allows a subset of Johnson solids as cells, for example triangular cupola .

Each vertex configuration within a Johnson solid must exist within the vertex figure. For example, a square pyramid has two vertex configurations: 3.3.4 around the base, and 3.3.3.3 at the apex.

The nets and vertex figures of the four convex equilateral cases are given below, along with a list of cells around each vertex.

The other forty can be derived from the regular polychora by geometric operations which preserve most or all of their symmetries , and therefore may be classified by the symmetry groups that they have in common.

Summary chart of truncation operations Example locations of kaleidoscopic generator point on fundamental domain.

The geometric operations that derive the 40 uniform 4-polytopes from the regular 4-polytopes are truncating operations. A 4-polytope may be truncated at the vertices, edges or faces, leading to addition of cells corresponding to those elements, as shown in the columns of the tables below.

The Coxeter-Dynkin diagram shows the four mirrors of the Wythoffian kaleidoscope as nodes, and the edges between the nodes are labeled by an integer showing the angle between the mirrors ( π / n radians or 180/ n degrees). Circled nodes show which mirrors are active for each form; a mirror is active with respect to a vertex that does not lie on it.

If two polytopes are duals of each other (such as the tesseract and 16-cell, or the 120-cell and 600-cell), then bitruncating , runcinating or omnitruncating either produces the same figure as the same operation to the other.  Thus where only the participle appears in the table it should be understood to apply to either parent.

Summary of constructions by extended symmetry [ edit ] The 46 uniform polychora constructed from the A 4 , B 4 , F 4 , H 4 symmetry are given in this table by their full extended symmetry and Coxeter diagrams. The D 4 symmetry is also included, though it only creates duplicates. Alternations are grouped by their chiral symmetry. All alternations are given, although the snub 24-cell , with its 3 constructions from different families is the only one that is uniform. Counts in parentheses are either repeats or nonuniform. The Coxeter diagrams are given with subscript indices 1 through 46. The 3-3 and 4-4 duoprismatic family is included, the second for its relation to the B 4 family.

In 1852, Ludwig Schläfli discovered four regular star polychora: {5,3,5/2}, {5/2,3,5}, {3,3,5/2}, and {5/2,3,3}. In 1883, Edmund Hess found the other six: {3,5,5/2}, {5/2,5,3}, {5,5/2,5}, {5/2,5,5/2}, {5,5/2,3}, and {3,5/2,5}. Norman Johnson described three uniform antiprism-like star polychora in his doctoral dissertation of 1966: they are based on the three ditrigonal polyhedra sharing the edges and vertices of the regular dodecahedron. Many more have been found since then by other researchers, including Jonathan Bowers and George Olshevsky, creating a total count of 2127 known uniform star polychora at present (not counting the infinite set of duoprisms based on star polygons). There is currently no proof of the set's completeness.
