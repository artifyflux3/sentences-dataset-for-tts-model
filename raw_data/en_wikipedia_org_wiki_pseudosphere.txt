A pseudosphere of radius R is a surface in R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} having curvature −1/ R 2 at each point. Its name comes from the analogy with the sphere of radius R , which is a surface of curvature 1/ R 2 . The term was introduced by Eugenio Beltrami in his 1868 paper on models of hyperbolic geometry .

[ 1 ] Tractroid [ edit ] Tractroid The same surface can be also described as the result of revolving a tractrix about its asymptote .
For this reason the pseudosphere is also called a tractroid . As an example, the (half) pseudosphere (with radius 1) is the surface of revolution of the tractrix parametrized by [ 2 ] t ↦ ↦ ( t − − tanh ⁡ ⁡ t , sech t ) , 0 ≤ ≤ t < ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle t\mapsto \left(t-\tanh t,\operatorname {sech} \,t\right),\quad \quad 0\leq t<\infty .} It is a singular space (the equator is a singularity), but away from the singularities, it has constant negative Gaussian curvature and therefore is locally isometric to a hyperbolic plane .

The name "pseudosphere" comes about because it has a two-dimensional surface of constant negative Gaussian curvature, just as a sphere has a surface with constant positive Gaussian curvature.
Just as the sphere has at every point a positively curved geometry of a dome the whole pseudosphere has at every point the negatively curved geometry of a saddle .

As early as 1693 Christiaan Huygens found that the volume and the surface area of the pseudosphere are finite, [ 3 ] despite the infinite extent of the shape along the axis of rotation. For a given edge radius R , the area is 4π R 2 just as it is for the sphere, while the volume is ⁠ 2 / 3 ⁠ π R 3 and therefore half that of a sphere of that radius.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The pseudosphere is an important geometric precursor to mathematical fabric arts and pedagogy .

[ 6 ] Universal covering space [ edit ] The pseudosphere and its relation to three other models of hyperbolic geometry The half pseudosphere of curvature −1 is covered by the interior of a horocycle . In the Poincaré half-plane model one convenient choice is the portion of the half-plane with y ≥ 1 .

[ 7 ] Then the covering map is periodic in the x direction of period 2 π , and takes the horocycles y = c to the meridians of the pseudosphere and the vertical geodesics x = c to the tractrices that generate the pseudosphere.  This mapping is a local isometry, and thus exhibits the portion y ≥ 1 of the upper half-plane as the universal covering space of the pseudosphere.  The precise mapping is ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ ( v ( arcosh ⁡ ⁡ y ) cos ⁡ ⁡ x , v ( arcosh ⁡ ⁡ y ) sin ⁡ ⁡ x , u ( arcosh ⁡ ⁡ y ) ) , {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto {\big (}v(\operatorname {arcosh} y)\cos x,v(\operatorname {arcosh} y)\sin x,u(\operatorname {arcosh} y){\big )},} where t ↦ ↦ ( u ( t ) = t − − tanh ⁡ ⁡ t , v ( t ) = sech ⁡ ⁡ t ) {\displaystyle t\mapsto {\big (}u(t)=t-\operatorname {tanh} t,v(t)=\operatorname {sech} t{\big )}} is the parametrization of the tractrix above.

Hyperboloid [ edit ] Deforming the pseudosphere to a portion of Dini's surface . In differential geometry, this is a Lie transformation . In the corresponding solutions to the sine-Gordon equation , this deformation corresponds to a Lorentz Boost of the static 1- soliton solution.

In some sources that use the hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic plane, the hyperboloid is referred to as a pseudosphere .

[ 8 ] This usage of the word is because the hyperboloid can be thought of as a sphere of imaginary radius, embedded in a Minkowski space .

Pseudospherical surfaces [ edit ] A pseudospherical surface is a generalization of the pseudosphere. A surface which is piecewise smoothly immersed in R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} with constant negative curvature is a pseudospherical surface. The tractroid is the simplest example. Other examples include the Dini's surfaces , breather surfaces , and the Kuen surface .

Relation to solutions to the sine-Gordon equation [ edit ] Pseudospherical surfaces can be constructed from solutions to the sine-Gordon equation .

[ 9 ] A sketch proof starts with reparametrizing the tractroid with coordinates in which the Gauss–Codazzi equations can be rewritten as the sine-Gordon equation.

In particular, for the tractroid the Gauss–Codazzi equations are the sine-Gordon equation applied to the static soliton solution, so the Gauss–Codazzi equations are satisfied. In these coordinates the first and second fundamental forms are written in a way that makes clear the Gaussian curvature is −1 for any solution of the sine-Gordon equations.

Then any solution to the sine-Gordon equation can be used to specify a first and second fundamental form which satisfy the Gauss–Codazzi equations. There is then a theorem that any such set of initial data can be used to at least locally specify an immersed surface in R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} .

A few examples of sine-Gordon solutions and their corresponding surface are given as follows: Static 1-soliton: pseudosphere Moving 1-soliton: Dini's surface Breather solution: Breather surface 2-soliton: Kuen surface See also [ edit ] Hilbert's theorem (differential geometry) Dini's surface Gabriel's Horn Hyperboloid Hyperboloid structure Quasi-sphere Sine–Gordon equation Sphere Surface of revolution References [ edit ] ^ Beltrami, Eugenio (1868).
