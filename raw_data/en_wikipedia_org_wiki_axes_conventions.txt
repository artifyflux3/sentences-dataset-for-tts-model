Heading, elevation and bank angles (Z-Y’-X’’) for an aircraft. The aircraft's pitch and yaw axes Y and Z are not shown, and its fixed reference frame xyz has been shifted backwards from its center of gravity (preserving angles) for clarity. Axes named according to the air norm [DIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Institut_f%C3%BCr_Normung "Deutsches Institut für Normung") 9300

In [ballistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics "Ballistics") and [flight dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics "Flight dynamics"), **axes conventions** are standardized ways of establishing the location and orientation of [coordinate axes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_axes "Coordinate axes") for use as a [frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference"). Mobile objects are normally tracked from an external frame considered fixed. Other frames can be defined on those mobile objects to deal with relative positions for other objects. Finally, attitudes or [orientations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") can be described by a relationship between the external frame and the one defined over the mobile object.

The orientation of a vehicle is normally referred to as _attitude_. It is described normally by the [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") of a frame fixed in the body relative to a fixed reference frame. The attitude is described by _attitude coordinates_, and consists of at least three coordinates.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes_conventions#cite_note-Schaub-1)

While from a geometrical point of view the different methods to describe orientations are defined using only some reference frames, in engineering applications it is important also to describe how these frames are attached to the lab and the body in motion.

Due to the special importance of international conventions in air vehicles, several organizations have published standards to be followed. For example, German DIN has published the [DIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Institut_f%C3%BCr_Normung "Deutsches Institut für Normung") 9300 norm for aircraft[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes_conventions#cite_note-2) (adopted by ISO as [ISO 1151–2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_standards_1%E2%80%931999#ISO_1000_%E2%80%93_ISO_1499 "List of ISO standards 1–1999"):1985).

Representation of the Earth with parallels and meridians

### World reference frames: ENU and NED

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Axes_conventions&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: World reference frames: ENU and NED")]

Basically, as lab frame or reference frame, there are two kinds of conventions for the frames:

*   East, North, Up (ENU), used in geography
*   North, East, Down (NED), used specially in aerospace

This frame referenced w.r.t. Global Reference frames like Earth Center Earth Fixed (ECEF) non-inertial system.

#### World reference frames for attitude description

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Axes_conventions&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: World reference frames for attitude description")]

To establish a standard convention to describe attitudes, it is required to establish at least the axes of the reference system and the axes of the rigid body or vehicle. When an ambiguous notation system is used (such as [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles")) the convention used should also be stated. Nevertheless, most used notations (matrices and quaternions) are unambiguous.

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/ECEF_ENU_Longitude_Latitude_relationships.svg/250px-ECEF_ENU_Longitude_Latitude_relationships.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ECEF_ENU_Longitude_Latitude_relationships.svg)

Earth Centered Earth Fixed and East, North, Up coordinates.

[Tait–Bryan angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tait%E2%80%93Bryan_angles "Tait–Bryan angles") are often used to describe a vehicle's attitude with respect to a chosen reference frame, though any other notation can be used. The positive _x_-axis in vehicles points always in the direction of movement. For positive _y_- and _z_-axis, we have to face two different conventions:

*   In case of land vehicles like cars, tanks etc., which use the ENU-system (East-North-Up) as external reference (_World frame_), the vehicle's (body's) positive _y_- or pitch axis always points to its left, and the positive _z_- or yaw axis always points up. World frame's origin is fixed at the center of gravity of the vehicle.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes_conventions#cite_note-3)
*   By contrast, in case of air and sea vehicles like submarines, ships, airplanes etc., which use the NED-system (North-East-Down) as external reference (_World frame_), the vehicle's (body's) positive _y_- or pitch axis always points to its right, and its positive _z_- or yaw axis always points down. World frame's origin is fixed at the center of gravity of the vehicle.
*   Finally, in case of space vehicles like the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") etc., a modification of the latter convention is used, where the vehicle's (body's) positive _y_- or pitch axis again always points to its right, and its positive z- or yaw axis always points down, but “down” now may have two different meanings: If a so-called _local frame_ is used as external reference, its positive z-axis points “down” to the center of the Earth as it does in case of the earlier mentioned NED-system,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes_conventions#cite_note-4) but if the _inertial frame_ is used as reference, its positive z-axis will point now to the [north celestial pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_celestial_pole "North celestial pole"), and its positive x-axis to the Vernal [Equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox "Equinox")[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes_conventions#cite_note-5) or some other reference meridian.

### Frames mounted on vehicles

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Axes_conventions&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Frames mounted on vehicles")]

Specially for aircraft, these frames do not need to agree with the earth-bound frames in the up-down line. It must be agreed what ENU and NED mean in this context.

#### Conventions for land vehicles

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Axes_conventions&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Conventions for land vehicles")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/RPY_angles_of_cars.png/250px-RPY_angles_of_cars.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RPY_angles_of_cars.png)

RPY angles of cars and other land vehicles

For land vehicles it is rare to describe their complete orientation, except when speaking about [electronic stability control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_stability_control "Electronic stability control") or [satellite navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation "Satellite navigation"). In this case, the convention is normally the one of the adjacent drawing, where RPY stands for [roll-pitch-yaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-pitch-yaw "Roll-pitch-yaw").

#### Conventions for sea vehicles

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Axes_conventions&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Conventions for sea vehicles")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/RPY_angles_of_ships.png/250px-RPY_angles_of_ships.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RPY_angles_of_ships.png)

RPY angles of ships and other sea vehicles

As well as aircraft, the same terminology is used for the [motion of ships and boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_motions "Ship motions"). Some words commonly used were introduced in maritime navigation. For example, the _yaw_ angle or heading, has a [nautical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation "Navigation") origin, with the meaning of "bending out of the course". Etymologically, it is related with the verb 'to go'.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes_conventions#cite_note-6) It is related to the concept of [bearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(navigation) "Bearing (navigation)"). It is typically assigned the shorthand notation ψ.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes_conventions#cite_note-7)

#### Conventions for aircraft local reference frames

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Axes_conventions&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Conventions for aircraft local reference frames")]

Mnemonics to remember angle names

Coordinates to describe an aircraft attitude (Heading, Elevation and Bank) are normally given relative to a reference control frame located in a control tower, and therefore ENU, relative to the position of the control tower on the earth surface.

Coordinates to describe observations made from an aircraft are normally given relative to its intrinsic axes, but normally using as positive the coordinate pointing downwards, where the interesting points are located. Therefore, they are normally NED.

These axes are normally taken so that X axis is the longitudinal axis pointing ahead, Z axis is the vertical axis pointing downwards, and the Y axis is the lateral one, pointing in such a way that the frame is [right-handed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule "Right-hand rule").

The _motion_ of an aircraft is often described in terms of rotation about these axes, so rotation about the _X_-axis is called rolling, rotation about the _Y_-axis is called pitching, and rotation about the _Z_-axis is called yawing.

Frames for space navigation
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Axes_conventions&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Frames for space navigation")]

Different reference systems for coordinates in space

For satellites orbiting the Earth it is normal to use the [Equatorial coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system "Equatorial coordinate system"). The projection of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere is called the [celestial equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator "Celestial equator"). Similarly, the projections of the Earth's north and south geographic poles become the north and south [celestial poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_pole "Celestial pole"), respectively.

Deep space satellites use other [Celestial coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_coordinate_system "Celestial coordinate system"), like the [Ecliptic coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic_coordinate_system "Ecliptic coordinate system").

### Local conventions for space ships as satellites

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Axes_conventions&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Local conventions for space ships as satellites")]

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/RPY_angles_of_spaceships_%28local_frame%29.png/250px-RPY_angles_of_spaceships_%28local_frame%29.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RPY_angles_of_spaceships_(local_frame).png)

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/RPY_angles_of_spaceships_%28inertial_frame%29.png/250px-RPY_angles_of_spaceships_%28inertial_frame%29.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RPY_angles_of_spaceships_(inertial_frame).png)

RPY angles of the Space Shuttle and other space vehicles, first using a local frame as reference and second using an inertial frame as reference.

If the goal is to keep the shuttle during its orbits in a constant attitude with respect to the sky, e.g. in order to perform certain astronomical observations, the preferred reference is the _inertial frame_, and the RPY angle vector (0|0|0) describes an attitude then, where the shuttle's wings are kept permanently parallel to the Earth's equator, its nose points permanently to the vernal [equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox "Equinox"), and its belly towards the northern [polar star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_star "Polar star") (see picture). (Note that rockets and missiles more commonly follow the conventions for aircraft where the RPY angle vector (0|0|0) points north, rather than toward the vernal equinox).

On the other hand, if the goal is to keep the shuttle during its orbits in a constant attitude with respect to the surface of the Earth, the preferred reference will be the _local frame_, with the RPY angle vector (0|0|0) describing an attitude where the shuttle's wings are parallel to the Earth's surface, its nose points to its heading, and its belly down towards the centre of the Earth (see picture).

Frames used to describe attitudes
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Axes_conventions&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Frames used to describe attitudes")]

Normally the frames used to describe a vehicle's local observations are the same frames used to describe its attitude with respect to the ground tracking stations. i.e. if an ENU frame is used in a tracking station, also ENU frames are used onboard and these frames are also used to refer local observations.

An important case in which this does not apply is aircraft. Aircraft observations are performed downwards and therefore normally NED axes convention applies. Nevertheless, when attitudes with respect to ground stations are given, a relationship between the local earth-bound frame and the onboard ENU frame is used.
