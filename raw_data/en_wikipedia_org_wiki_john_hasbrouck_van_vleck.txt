Schwarz H. Eugene Stanley Other notable students John Bardeen [ 2 ] John Hasbrouck Van Vleck ( / v æ n v l ɛ k / ; [ 3 ] March 13, 1899 – October 27, 1980) was an American physicist and mathematician . He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977, for his contributions to the understanding of the behavior of electronic magnetism in solids .

Early life and education [ edit ] Van Vleck was born to mathematician Edward Burr Van Vleck and Hester L. Raymond in Middletown, Connecticut , while his father was an assistant professor at Wesleyan University , and where his grandfather, astronomer John Monroe Van Vleck , was also a professor. He grew up in Madison, Wisconsin , and received an A.B.

degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1920, before earning his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1922 under the supervision of Edwin C. Kemble .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Career and research [ edit ] He joined the University of Minnesota as an assistant professor in 1923, then moved to the University of Wisconsin before settling at Harvard. He also earned Honorary D. Sc.

, or D.

Honoris Causa , degree from Wesleyan University in 1936.

[ 6 ] J. H. Van Vleck established the fundamentals of the quantum mechanical theory of magnetism , crystal field theory and ligand field theory ( chemical bonding in metal complexes ). He is regarded as the Father of Modern Magnetism .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] During World War II , J. H. Van Vleck worked on radar at the MIT Radiation Lab . He was half time at the Radiation Lab and half time on the staff at Harvard . He showed that at about 1.25-centimeter wavelength water molecules in the atmosphere would lead to troublesome absorption and that at 0.5-centimeter wavelength there would be a similar absorption by oxygen molecules .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] This was to have important consequences not just for military (and civil) radar systems but later for the new science of radioastronomy .

J. H. Van Vleck participated in the Manhattan Project . In June 1942 , J. Robert Oppenheimer held a summer study for confirming the concept and feasibility of a nuclear weapon at the University of California, Berkeley . Eight theoretical scientists, including J. H. Van Vleck, attended it. From July to September, the theoretical study group examined and developed the principles of atomic bomb design.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] J. H. Van Vleck's theoretical work led to the establishment of the Los Alamos Nuclear Weapons Laboratory . He also served on the Los Alamos Review committee in 1943. The committee, established by General Leslie Groves , also consisted of W. K. Lewis of MIT , Chairman; E. L. Rose, of Jones & Lamson; E. B. Wilson of Harvard ; and Richard C. Tolman , Vice Chairman of NDRC .  The committee's important contribution (originating with Rose) was a reduction in the size of the firing gun for the Little Boy atomic bomb, a concept that eliminated additional design weight and sped up production of the bomb for its eventual release over Hiroshima . However, it was not employed for the Fat Man bomb at Nagasaki , which relied on implosion of a plutonium shell to reach critical mass.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] The philosopher and historian of science Thomas Kuhn completed a Ph.D. in physics under Van Vleck's supervision at Harvard.

[ 19 ] From 1951, Van Vleck was Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard. He concurrently held the first deanship of Harvard's Division of Engineering and Applied Physics until 1957.

[ 20 ] Van Vleck's grave (back right) at Forest Hill Cemetery In 1961/62 he was George Eastman Visiting Professor at University of Oxford [ 21 ] and held a professorship at Balliol College .

[ 22 ] In 1950 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences .

[ 23 ] He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1966 [ 24 ] and the Lorentz Medal in 1974.

[ 25 ] For his contributions to the understanding of the behavior of electrons in magnetic solids , Van Vleck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 1977, along with Philip W. Anderson and Sir Nevill Mott .

[ 26 ] Van Vleck transformations, Van Vleck paramagnetism and Van Vleck formula [ 27 ] are named after him.

Van Vleck died in Cambridge, Massachusetts , aged 81.

[ 28 ] He was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery .

Awards and honors [ edit ] Van Vleck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1934, [ 29 ] the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1935, [ 30 ] and the American Philosophical Society in 1939.

[ 31 ] He was awarded the Irving Langmuir Award in 1965, the National Medal of Science in 1966 and elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1967 .

[ 1 ] He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1971, the Lorentz Medal in 1974 and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977.

Personal life [ edit ] J. H. Van Vleck met Abigail Pearson, a student at University of Minnesota, during his professorship there, and married her on June 10, 1927.

[ 6 ] He and his wife Abigail were also important art collectors, particularly in the medium of Japanese woodblock prints (principally Ukiyo-e ), known as Van Vleck Collection . It was inherited from his father Edward Burr Van Vleck .  They donated the collection to the Chazen Museum of Art in Madison, Wisconsin in 1980s.
