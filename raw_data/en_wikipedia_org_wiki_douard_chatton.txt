(botany) Chatton Édouard Chatton ( French: [edwaʁ ʃatɔ̃] ; 11 October 1883 – 23 April 1947) [ 1 ] was a French biologist who first characterized the distinction between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular types.

[ 2 ] Chatton was born in Romont , Switzerland. His initial interest was in various human pathogenic protozoa , members of the Apicomplexa and Trypanosomatids . He later expanded his studies to include marine protists , helping to contribute to the description of the dinoflagellate protists .

[ 3 ] He first coined the terms "eukaryote" and "prokaryote" in a 1925 paper, [ 4 ] but did not elaborate on the concept; Roger Stanier and C. B. van Niel later adopted the nomenclature and popularized the classification of cellular organisms into prokaryotes and eukaryotes in a 1962 article.

[ 2 ] At the Pasteur Institute , Chatton met and became a mentor to André Michel Lwoff , future Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine . The two scientists remained associates until Chatton's death in 1947, in Banyuls-sur-Mer , France.

Chromidina chattoni , a species named in the honour of Édouard Chatton.

The standard author abbreviation Chatton is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .
