A derivative of the Thor-Able , it was a member of the Thor family of rockets, and the first member of the Delta family.

[ 1 ] The first stage was a Thor missile in the DM-19 configuration. The second stage was the Delta , which had been derived from the earlier Able stage. An Altair solid rocket motor was used as a third stage.

[ 2 ] The basic design of the original Vanguard upper stages, featuring a pressure-fed nitric acid/UDMH, regeneratively cooled engine, was kept in place, but with an improved AJ10-118 engine. More significantly, the Delta stage featured cold gas attitude control jets allowing it to be stabilized in orbit for restart and more precise burns.

The Thor-Delta was the first rocket to use the combination of a Thor missile and a Delta upper stage. This configuration was reused for many later rockets, and a derivative, the Delta II , remained in service until 2018.

The Thor-Delta launched a number of significant payloads, including the first communications satellite , Echo 1A ; the first British satellite, Ariel 1 ; and the first active direct-relay communications satellite, Telstar 1 . All 12 launches occurred from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17 . The launch of Telstar 1 used pad B, while all other launches were from pad A. All launches were successful except the maiden flight, which failed to place Echo 1 into orbit due to a problem with the second stage.
