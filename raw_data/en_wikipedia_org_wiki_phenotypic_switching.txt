David R. Soll described two such systems:  the first high frequency switching system between several morphological stages and a second high frequency switching system between opaque and white cells. The latter is an epigenetic switching system [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Phenotypic switching in Candida albicans is often used to refer to the epigenetic white-to-opaque switching system.

C. albicans needs this switch for sexual mating.

[ 3 ] Next to the two above mentioned switching systems many other switching systems are known in C. albicans .

[ 4 ] A second example occurs in melanoma , where malignantly transformed pigment cells switch back-and-forth between phenotypes of proliferation and invasion in response to changing microenvironments, driving metastatic progression.
