[ 1 ] He flourished at the time of the Abbasid caliphs al-Ma'mun ( r.

813–833 ) and al-Mu'tasim ( r.

833–842 ), serving as private physician to the latter.

[ 2 ] It is reported that al-Mu'tasim trusted Salmawaih to such an extent that he called him "father", and that he prayed in person over Salmawaih's grave when he died.

[ 3 ] He was a patron of the fellow Nestorian physician and translator Hunayn ibn Ishaq , helping him in his translation of Galen 's On The Therapeutic Method .

[ 4 ] His scientific work included studies on the harmful effects of aphrodisiacs .

[ 5 ] He was a rival of the fellow Nestorian physician Ibn Masawayh .
