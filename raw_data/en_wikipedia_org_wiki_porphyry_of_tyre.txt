234 – c.

AD 305 ) was a Semitic Neoplatonic philosopher born in Tyre , Roman Phoenicia [ 1 ] during Roman rule .

[ a ] [ 1 ] [ 2 ] He edited and published the Enneads , the only collection of the work of Plotinus , his teacher.

He wrote original works in the Greek language on a wide variety of topics, ranging from music theory to Homer to vegetarianism .

[ b ] His Isagoge or Introduction , an introduction to logic and philosophy, [ c ] was the standard textbook on logic throughout the Middle Ages in its Latin and Arabic translations.

[ 3 ] Porphyry was, and still is, also well-known for his anti-Christian polemics.

[ 4 ] Through works such as Philosophy from Oracles and Against the Christians (which was banned by Constantine the Great ), [ 5 ] he was involved in a controversy with early Christians .

[ 6 ] Life [ edit ] The Suda (a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia based on many sources now lost) reports that Porphyry was born in Tyre , however, other sources report that he was born in Batanaea, present-day Syria .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] His parents named him Malkos or Malchus (cf.

Aramaic malkā 'king'). However, he changed it to " Basileus " "King", and into his nickname "Porphyrius" "[clad] in purple" later in his life.

[ 4 ] In his work The Life of Plotinus, he refers to Aramaic as his "native tongue." [ 11 ] Under Cassius Longinus , in Athens, he studied grammar and rhetoric, and became acquainted with Middle Platonism .

[ 4 ] In 262 he went to Rome , attracted by the reputation of Plotinus , and for six years devoted himself to the practice of Neoplatonism , during which time he severely modified his diet, at one point becoming suicidal.

[ 12 ] On the advice of Plotinus he went to live in Sicily for five years to recover his mental health. On returning to Rome, he lectured on philosophy and completed an edition of the writings of Plotinus (who had died in the meantime) together with a biography of his teacher.

Iamblichus is mentioned in ancient Neoplatonic writings as his disciple, but this is most likely only meant to indicate that he was the dominant figure in the next generation of philosophers succeeding him.

[ 13 ] The two men differed publicly on the issue of theurgy .

In his later years, he married Marcella, a widow with seven children and a student of philosophy.

[ 14 ] There are around sixty works connected to Porphyry's name, some in fragments or lost. Some pieces of his work are still being reconstructed today.

[ 15 ] Little more is known of his life, and the date of his death is uncertain.

305 AD ). Monfredo de Monte Imperiali Liber de herbis , 14th century.

[ 16 ] Porphyry is best known for his contributions to philosophy. Apart from writing the Aids to the Study of the Intelligibles (Ἀφορμαὶ πρὸς τὰ νοητά; Sententiae ad Intelligibilia Ducentes ), a basic summary of Neoplatonism, he is especially appreciated for his Introduction to Categories—also known in Latin as Introductio in Praedicamenta or Isagoge et in Aristotelis Categorias Commentarium —a very short work often considered to be a commentary on Aristotle 's Categories , hence the title.

[ d ] According to Barnes 2003 , however, the correct title is simply Introduction (Εἰσαγωγή Isagoge ), and the book is an introduction not to the Categories in particular, but to logic in general, as it includes the theories of predication, definition, and proof. The Introduction describes how qualities attributed to things may be classified, famously breaking down the philosophical concept of substance into the five components genus , species , difference , property , and accident . Porphyry's discussion of accident sparked a long-running debate on the application of accident and essence .

[ 17 ] As Porphyry's most influential contribution to philosophy, the Introduction to Categories incorporated Aristotle's logic into Neoplatonism, in particular the doctrine of the categories of being interpreted in terms of entities (in later philosophy, " universal ").

Boethius ' Isagoge , a Latin translation of Porphyry's Introduction , became a standard medieval textbook in European schools and universities, which set the stage for medieval philosophical-theological developments of logic and the problem of universals . In medieval textbooks, the all-important Arbor porphyriana ("Porphyrian Tree") illustrates his logical classification of substance. To this day, taxonomy benefits from concepts in Porphyry's Tree, in classifying living organisms (see cladistics ). Porphyry's invention of the "Porphyrian Tree" is noted as the first proper commentary made on Aristotle's work.

A replica of the Arbor porphyriana (Porphyrian tree) used to comment on Aristotle's work by Purchotius (1730), Boethius (6th century), and Ramon Llull (ca. 1305).

The Introduction was translated into Arabic by Abd-Allāh ibn al-Muqaffaʿ from a Syriac version. With the Arabicized name Isāghūjī (إيساغوجي) it long remained the standard introductory logic text in the Muslim world and influenced the study of theology, philosophy, grammar, and jurisprudence. Besides the adaptations and epitomes of this work, many independent works on logic by Muslim philosophers have been entitled Isāghūjī.

Philosophy from Oracles ( De Philosophia ex Oraculis Haurienda ) [ edit ] Porphyry is also known as an opponent of Christianity and defender of Paganism ; his precise contribution to the philosophical approach to traditional religion may be discovered in the fragments of Philosophy from Oracles (Περὶ τῆς ἐκ λογίων φιλοσοφίας; De Philosophia ex Oraculis Haurienda ), which was originally three books in length. There is debate as to whether it was written in his youth (as Eunapius reports [ 12 ] ) or closer in time to the persecutions of Christians under Diocletian and Galerius .

[ e ] Whether or not Porphyry was the pagan philosopher's opponent in Lactantius ' Divine Institutes , written at the time of the persecutions, has long been discussed. The fragments of the Philosophy from Oracles are only quoted by Christians, especially Eusebius , Theodoret , Augustine , and John Philoponus . The fragments contain oracles identifying proper sacrificial procedure, the nature of astrological fate, and other topics relevant to Greek and Roman religion in the third century. Whether this work contradicts his treatise defending vegetarianism , which also warned the philosopher to avoid animal sacrifice, is disputed among scholars.

[ 19 ] Due to Porphyry’s work being incomplete or lost, the understanding of the piece could be misconstrued.

[ 15 ] Against the Christians ( Adversus Christianos ) [ edit ] Main article: Against the Christians Porphyry, a detail of the Tree of Jesse , 1535, Sucevița Monastery .

During his retirement in Sicily , Porphyry wrote Against the Christians (Κατὰ Χριστιανῶν; Adversus Christianos ) which consisted of fifteen books. Some thirty Christian apologists, such as Methodius , Eusebius , Apollinaris , Augustine , Jerome , etc., responded to his challenge. In fact, everything known about Porphyry's arguments is found in these refutations, largely because Theodosius II ordered every copy burned in AD 435 and again in 448.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Augustine and the 5th-century ecclesiastical historian Socrates of Constantinople assert that Porphyry was once a Christian.

[ 23 ] It is said, however, that while Porphyry did engage with Christianity, he did not believe it. Augustine made comments to Porphyry as he said he was the "most learned of the philosophers, as the most bitter enemy of the Christians".

[ 24 ] Other works [ edit ] Porphyry was opposed to the theurgy of his disciple Iamblichus . Much of Iamblichus' mysteries is dedicated to the defense of mystic theurgic divine possession against the critiques of Porphyry. French philosopher Pierre Hadot maintains that for Porphyry, spiritual exercises are an essential part of spiritual development.

[ 25 ] Porphyry was, like Pythagoras , an advocate of vegetarianism on spiritual and ethical grounds. These two philosophers are perhaps the most famous vegetarians of classical antiquity. He wrote the On Abstinence from Animal Food (Περὶ ἀποχῆς ἐμψύχων; De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium ), advocating against the consumption of animals, and he is cited with approval in vegetarian literature up to the present day. He believed that everything was created for mutual advantage, and vegetarianism was a way to preserve universal harmony of nature.

[ 26 ] Porphyry also wrote widely on music theory , [ 27 ] astrology , religion, and philosophy. He produced a History of Philosophy ( Philosophos Historia ) with vitae of philosophers that included a life of his teacher, Plotinus. His life of Plato from book iv exists only in quotes by Cyril of Alexandria .

[ f ] His book Vita Pythagorae on the life of Pythagoras is not to be confused with the book of the same name by Iamblichus . His commentary on Ptolemy's Harmonics [ 28 ] ( Eis ta Harmonika Ptolemaiou hypomnēma ) is an important source for the history of ancient harmonic theory.

Porphyry also wrote about Homer . Apart from several lost texts known only from quotations by other authors, two texts survive at least in large parts: the Homeric Questions ( Homēriká zētḗmata , largely a philological comment on the Iliad and Odyssey ) and On the Cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey ( Peri tou en Odysseia tōn nymphōn antrou ).

Porphyry's commentary on Euclid 's Elements was used as a source by Pappus of Alexandria .

A Treatise Concerning the Secret Doctrines of the Philosophers.

Mentioned by Eunapius according to John Toland in "Clidophorus, or of the Exoteric and Esoteric Philosophy."  Eunapius says that Porphyry "commended the medicine of perspicuity, and tasting it by experience, wrote "A Treatise Concerning the Secret Doctrines of the Philosophers", which they involv'd in obscurity, as in the Fables of the Poets, but which he brought to light." [ 31 ] There is a fragment attributed to Porphyry in Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera 's De'ot ha-Filusufim , from the 13th century. It is a Hebrew translation from an unknown Arabic translation of a lost work. Gad Freudenthal and Aaron Johnson tentatively accept its authenticity.

Sarton 1936 , pp. 429–430 identifies Transjordania as Porphyry's place of birth.

^ For a comprehensive list see Beutler (1894–1980); Guthrie 1988 , p. 91 provides another list ^ Barnes 2003 , p. xv clarifies that the Isagoge "[was] not an Introduction to the Categories , rather "[since it was] an introduction to the study of logic, [it] was... an introduction to philosophy—and hence accidentally an introduction to the Categories ." ^ Barnes 2003 , p. xiv outlines the history of the opinion that Porphyry meant for his Isagoge to be an introductory work to the Categories .

^ The Christian apologist Eusebius states that "some Greek" might say "How can these people be thought worthy of forbearance? They have not only turned away from those who from earliest time have been thought of as divine among all Greeks and barbarians... but by emperors, law-givers and philosophers— all of a given mind... And to what sort of penalties might they not be subjected who... are fugitives from the things of their Fathers?"  This material, once thought to be part of Against the Christians , but reassigned by Wilken 1979 to Philosophy from Oracles , is quoted in Digeser 1998 , p. 129. However, it may not have been by Porphyry at all.

[ 18 ] ^ Notopoulos 1940 , pp. 284–293 attempted a reconstruction from Apuleius' use of it.
