In addition to being concerned with microtonal and electronic music , he was perhaps the first to use the prepared guitar . "Fongaard's output is considerable...Due to the partly experimental notation , these works have not become widely known." [ 1 ] Life [ edit ] Fongaard grew up in the Oslo borough of Nordstrand . He studied at the Oslo Conservatory of Music with teachers including Per Steenberg , Sigurd Islandsmoen , Bjarne Brustad , and Karl Andersen .

[ 1 ] He started off by constructing a quarter tone guitar with adaption of the fretboard , but very early left this in favor of a diverse set of prepared guitar techniques. His first pieces in this genre came in the mid 60's. A sampler CD of his own recordings entitled Elektrofoni: Works For Micro Intervallic Guitar 1965-1978 [ 2 ] was released in 2011. In 2015, a double disc of new recordings by Norwegian guitarist Anders Førisdal was released on Aurora Records.
