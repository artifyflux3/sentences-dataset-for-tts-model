"**Space**" is a song by American musician [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician) "Prince (musician)") from his fifteenth album, _[Come](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come\_(Prince\_album) "Come (Prince album)")_ (1994).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(Prince_song)#cite_note-5) The [B-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-side_and_B-side "A-side and B-side") of the single is actually the album track. The A-side is the **Universal Love Radio Remix** of "Space", with completely new [lyrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrics "Lyrics").

In the album version of "Space" Prince sings about being obsessed with a lover and wanting to take their love higher comparing to the likes of space whereas the Universal Love Remix features a rap from Prince at the end which is lyrically similar to his smash hit "[When Doves Cry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Doves_Cry "When Doves Cry")" with a new bridge saying "All the pain that a human has to go through, in a planet that's so bitter and cold / Universal love awaits you, baby all you got to say is that you really, really, really wanna go / And we're outta here".

Critical reception
------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_(Prince_song)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Critical reception")]

[Larry Flick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Flick "Larry Flick") from _[Billboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard\_(magazine) "Billboard (magazine)")_ magazine wrote that the song follows the "cozy [funk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk "Funk")/[pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music "Pop music")" of the previous "[Letitgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitgo "Letitgo")". He added, "Unlike his past releases, this track reflects current trends rather than dictating them. Of the five mixes included on the [CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD "CD") pressing, the strumming "Acoustic" remix works the best, giving the salacious, sex-happy lyrics some much-needed warmth."[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(Prince_song)#cite_note-Flick1994-2) Chuck Campbell from _[Knoxville News Sentinel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville\_News\_Sentinel "Knoxville News Sentinel")_ felt the "ensuing smooth cadence of 'Space' elevates the [album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_(Prince_album) "Come (Prince album)") a bit (though there's not much going on here, either)."[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(Prince_song)#cite_note-6)
