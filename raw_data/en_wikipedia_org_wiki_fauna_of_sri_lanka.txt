Sri Lanka has one of the highest rates of biological endemism (16% of the fauna and 23% of flowering plants are endemic [ 1 ] ).

Ecological zones [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Sri Lanka Ecological zones of Sri Lanka [ 2 ] The mountains and the southwestern part of the country, known as the "wet zone", receive ample rainfall (an annual average of 2500 millimeters). Most of the southeast, east, and northern parts of the country comprise the "dry zone", which receives between 1200 and 1900 mm of rain annually.

Forestry [ edit ] Main article: Forestry in Sri Lanka Faunal diversity [ edit ] Described species of fauna [ edit ] The most recent update on the Sri Lankan biodiversity was the 6th National Report of the Convention on Biological Diversity . This report provided an updated list of species as of the end 2018. However, in 2019, 54 new species were described: including 26 spiders, (14 cellar spiders, 7 jumping spiders, 4 crab spiders and 1 tarantula), 1 scorpion species, 5 mites and ticks, 14 reptiles (13 day geckos and 1 snake), 1 shrub frog, 1 orchid and 6 lichens. Later in 2021, Professors Devaka Weerakoon and Amila Sumanapala released an updated list of taxa as of the end of 2020.

Reptiles [ edit ] Main article: List of reptiles of Sri Lanka Chrysopelea taprobanica - once endemic, but now found in India as well Sri Lanka currently contains 185 species of reptiles , of which 60 are threatened and 115 are endemic. Most of the reptiles are snakes and the largest two are the mugger crocodile and saltwater crocodile .

[ 5 ] Flooding has led to increased human-crocodile conflict around the Nilwala River , with crocodiles often becoming trapped as floodwaters recede. Such floods are becoming exacerbated by climate change .

[ 6 ] Amphibians [ edit ] Main article: List of amphibians of Sri Lanka Taruga eques - an endemic amphibian Sri Lanka has one of the richest diversity of amphibians in the world, containing 122 species of amphibians up to January 2019 with many recent discoveries, with 112 endemic species.

He also collected few specimen of order Phasmatodea around central hills. 66 species of order Blattodea are found, but not taxonomic evidences. Few species of the order Mantodea were studied by Henry in 1931. Clear documentation of the species within Dermaptera can be found, which was initiated by Burr (1901) and Brindle (1972). Within the termite infraorder Isoptera , 56 species are recorded. In 1913, Green compiled a concise catalogue for termites in Sri Lanka.

[ 8 ] Only 4 species of order Embioptera are recorded. In the order Psocoptera , two subfamilies, Epipsocidae and Pseudocaeciliidae have been studied.

[ 14 ] Myriapods [ edit ] Main article: List of myriapods of Sri Lanka The diversity of subphylum Myriapoda , is not well studied in Sri Lanka. The facts and checklists of these creatures date back to Newport in 1845, which is the first known study about centipedes . Many centipede works are more than a century old.

[ 15 ] Millipede diversity is much better studied. Currently, 104 species of millipedes and 19 species of centipedes are known from Sri Lanka.

[ 16 ] Arachnids [ edit ] Spiders [ edit ] Main article: List of spiders of Sri Lanka The detailed work on Sri Lankan spiders was through the Checklist of Spiders of South Asia Including 2006 Revision of Indian Spider Checklist by Manju Siliwal and Sanjay Molur. This checklist provided all the described spider species of South Asia and part of South-East Asia as well.

[ 17 ] According to this checklist, Sri Lanka has 501 species of spiders belonging to 45 families and 213 genera. Out of these, 250 are endemic with 22 endemic genera.

According to 2014 research, 47 species of pseudoscorpions have been identified in Sri Lanka. Out of this 43 species, 20 species are endemic to Sri Lanka.

The diversity of lesser arachnids within Sri Lanka is not extensive. Some observations on particular species have been undertaken by some local and foreign scientists.

Diversity and endemism of plants in Sri Lanka are quite high.

[ 20 ] There are 3,210 flowering plants belonging to 1,052 genera. 916 species and 18 genera are endemic to the island. Additionally, all but one of the island's more than 55 dipterocarps are confined to Sri Lanka. Although not lately assessed, Sri Lanka's ferns are estimated at 350 species. Diversity, richness, and endemism across all taxa groups are much higher in the wet zone than in the dry zone. Wet zone, which accounts for only a quarter of Sri Lanka's land area, harbours 88 percent of the flowering plants, and 95 percent of country's flowering plant endemics. The natural forests of Sri Lanka are categorized into eight types.

[ 21 ] Loxococcus , a monotypic genus consisting of the sole species Loxococcus rupicola , is the only palm ( Arecaceae ) genus that is endemic to Sri Lanka.

[ 22 ] A new Gesneriaceae species Henckelia wijesundarae , endemic to Hiniduma, Galle , was described and illustrated in 2016 by Subhani Ranasinghe et al.

[ 23 ] In 2020, a species of orchid Gastrodia gunatillekeorum was described from Sinharaja.

[ 27 ] Currently, more than 400 species of lichens are found in Sri Lanka.
