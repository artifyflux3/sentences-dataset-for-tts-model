It has been suggested that this article be merged with Characteristic state function . ( Discuss ) Proposed since July 2025.

In thermodynamics , the Massieu function (sometimes called Massieu–Gibbs function , Massieu potential , or Gibbs function , or characteristic (state) function in its original terminology), symbol Ψ ( Psi ), is defined by the following relation: Ψ Ψ = Ψ Ψ ( X 1 , … … , X i , Y i + 1 , … … Y r ) {\displaystyle \Psi =\Psi {\big (}X_{1},\dots ,X_{i},Y_{i+1},\dots Y_{r}{\big )}\,} where for every system with degree of freedom r one may choose r variables, e.g.

( X 1 , … … , X i , Y i + 1 , … … Y r ) , {\displaystyle {\big (}X_{1},\dots ,X_{i},Y_{i+1},\dots Y_{r}{\big )},} to define a coordinate system , where X and Y are extensive and intensive variables , respectively, and where at least one extensive variable must be within this set in order to define the size of the system. The ( r + 1) -th variable, Ψ , is then called the Massieu function.

[ 1 ] The Massieu function was introduced in the 1869 paper "On the Characteristic Functions of Various Fluids" by French engineer François Massieu (1832-1896).  The  name "Gibbs function" is the eponym of American physicist Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), who cited Massieu in his 1876 On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances . Massieu, as discussed in the first footnote to the abstract of Gibbs' Equilibrium , “appears to have been the first to solve the problem of representing all the properties of a body of invariable composition which are concerned in reversible processes by means of a single function.” Massieu's 1869 paper seems to be the source for the generalized mathematical conception of the energy of a system being equal to summations of the products of pairs of conjugate variables .
