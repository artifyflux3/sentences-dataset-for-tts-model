Crimson Color coordinates Hex triplet #DC143C sRGB B ( r , g , b ) (220, 20, 60) HSV ( h , s , v ) (348°, 91%, 86%) CIELCh uv ( L , C , h ) (47, 140, 8°) Source HTML/CSS [ 1 ] ISCC–NBS descriptor Vivid red B : Normalized to [0–255] (byte) Crimson is a rich, deep red color, inclining to purple .

[ 2 ] It originally meant the color of the kermes dye produced from a scale insect , Kermes vermilio , but the name is now sometimes also used as a generic term for slightly bluish-red colors that are between red and rose . It is the national color of Nepal .

History [ edit ] Crimson (NR4) is produced using the dried bodies of a scale insect , Kermes , which were gathered commercially in Mediterranean countries, where they live on the kermes oak , and sold throughout Europe.

[ 3 ] Kermes dyes have been found in burial wrappings in Anglo-Scandinavian York . They fell out of use with the introduction of cochineal , also made from scale insects, because although the dyes were comparable in quality and color intensity, ten to twelve times as much kermes is needed to produce the same effect as cochineal.

Carmine is a slightly different shade of red, extracted from a different insect (female cochineal), although these denominations are sometimes confused or exchanged on purpose. Cochineal appears to have been brought to Europe by the Spaniard Hernán Cortés during the conquest of the Aztec Empire and the name 'carmine' is derived from the French carmin . It was first described by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1549. The pigment is also called cochineal after the insect from which it is made.

Alizarin crimson was invented in 1868.

[ 4 ] Alizarin (PR83) is a pigment that was first synthesized in 1868 by the German chemists Carl Gräbe and Carl Liebermann and replaced the natural pigment madder lake . Alizarin crimson is a dye bonded onto alum which is then used as a pigment and mixed with ochre , sienna and umber . It is not totally colorfast.

Several historical color models have described crimson as a basic color: Aristotle listed phoinikoun as one of the basic colors, which is customarily translated as crimson.

[ 5 ] He described it as having harmony with the color purple in his Sense and Sensibilia .

[ 6 ] The 1708 edition of Traité de la Peinture en Mignature listed crimson red as a secondary color made up of red and blue, which is used to create other colors. It is listed alongside fire red, which mixes red and yellow.

[ 7 ] Entomologist Ignaz Schiffermüller included crimson red in his 12-color color wheel in 1772. He placed it between red and violet red, with fire red included on the other side of red.

[ 8 ] Physicist Thomas Young listed crimson as one of seven basic colors in 1807, distinguishing it from red.

[ 9 ] Printing technologist Frederic Eugene Ives defined the color as the opposite of green in 1902, naming it "minus green".

[ 10 ] Art historian Arthur Upham Pope described alizarine crimson as well as rose madder as the ideal pigment for a basic red in 1929.

[ 11 ] Etymology [ edit ] Crimson is a type of red .

[ 12 ] English dictionaries define crimson as a deep red, a rich red, or a purplish red.

[ 13 ] The word crimson refers to the kermes insect used to create the kermes dye . It comes from the Arabic word for the kermes insect, which was adapted to Medieval Latin and then Middle English , where it referred to both the insect and the dye c.

1400 .

[ 14 ] Earlier forms include cremesin , crymysyn and cramoysin (cf. cramoisy, a crimson cloth). These were adapted via Old Spanish from the Medieval Latin cremesinus (also kermesinus or carmesinus ), the dye produced from Kermes scale insects, and can be traced back to Arabic qirmizi ( قرمزي ) ("red") [qrmzj] ( listen ⓘ ), also borrowed in Turkic languages kırmız and many other languages, e.g. German Karmesin , Italian cremisi , French cramoisi , Portuguese carmesim , Dutch karmozijn , etc. (via Latin). The ultimate source from Classical Persian کرمست ( kirmist ), from Middle Persian; see Proto-Indo-Iranian *kŕ̥miš . Cognate with Sanskrit कृमिज ( kṛmija ). Doublet of kermes ; also see carmine .

[ 15 ] A shortened form of carmesinus also gave the Latin carminus , from which comes carmine .

Other cognates include the Persian ghermez "red" derived from "kermest" the red worm, [ 16 ] Old Church Slavonic чрьвл҄ѥнъ ( črьvl'enъ ), archaic Russian чермный ( čermnyj ), Bulgarian червен ( cherven ), and Serbo-Croatian crven "red". Cf. also vermilion .

Connotations [ edit ] Crimson is sometimes used to describe the color of blood.

[ 17 ] Crimson sometimes described the color of blushing , though brighter reds such as scarlet may also be used in this context.

[ 13 ] In descriptive writing, crimson is sometimes used to emphasize the color red in a more intense usage and invoke a stronger emotional connotation.

[ 18 ] The color can be used negatively to describe anger or malice. It may alternatively be associated with style or class, especially in the context of fashion or interior design.

[ 17 ] Dyes [ edit ] Main articles: Carmine and Kermes (dye) Carminic acid Carmine dyes , which give crimson and related red and purple colors, are based on an aluminium and calcium salt of carminic acid .

Carmine lake is an aluminium or aluminium-tin lake of cochineal extract, and crimson lake is prepared by striking down an infusion of cochineal with a 5 percent solution of alum and cream of tartar .

Purple lake is prepared like carmine lake with the addition of lime to produce the deep purple tone. Carmine dyes tend to fade quickly.

Carmine dyes were once widely prized in both the Americas and in Europe. They were used in paints by Michelangelo and for the crimson fabrics of the Hussars , the Turks , the British Redcoats , and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .

Nowadays carmine dyes are used for coloring foodstuffs, medicines and cosmetics. As a food additive in the European Union, carmine dyes are designated E120 , and are also called cochineal and Natural Red 4 . Carmine dyes are also used in some oil paints and watercolors used by artists.
