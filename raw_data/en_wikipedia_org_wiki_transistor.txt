[Metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal%E2%80%93oxide%E2%80%93semiconductor_field-effect_transistor "Metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor") (MOSFET), showing [gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_gate "Metal gate") (G), body (B), source (S) and drain (D) terminals. The gate is separated from the body by an insulating layer (white).

A **transistor** is a [semiconductor device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device "Semiconductor device") used to [amplify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_amplifier "Electronic amplifier") or [switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_switch "Electronic switch") electrical signals and [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power "Electric power"). It is one of the basic building blocks of modern [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-1) It is composed of [semiconductor material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_material "Semiconductor material"), usually with at least three [terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(electronics) "Terminal (electronics)") for connection to an [electronic circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit "Electronic circuit"). A [voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage") or [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Some transistors are packaged individually, but many more in miniature form are found embedded in [integrated circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit"). Because transistors are the key active components in practically all modern [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"), many people consider them one of the 20th century's greatest inventions.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-auto1-2)

[Physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist")[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Edgar_Lilienfeld "Julius Edgar Lilienfeld") proposed the concept of a [field-effect transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor "Field-effect transistor") (FET) in 1925,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-3) but it was not possible to construct a working device at that time.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-4) The first working device was a [point-contact transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-contact_transistor "Point-contact transistor") invented in 1947 by physicists [John Bardeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen "John Bardeen"), [Walter Brattain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Brattain "Walter Brattain"), and [William Shockley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley "William Shockley") at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs "Bell Labs") who shared the 1956 [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") for their achievement.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-5) The most widely used type of transistor, the [metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal%E2%80%93oxide%E2%80%93semiconductor_field-effect_transistor "Metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor") (MOSFET), was invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-:0-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-auto2-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-auto3-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-auto4-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Lojek1202-11) Transistors revolutionized the field of electronics and paved the way for smaller and cheaper [radios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_receiver "Radio receiver"), [calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator "Calculator"), [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer"), and other electronic devices.

Most transistors are made from very pure [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon"), and some from [germanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium "Germanium"), but certain other semiconductor materials are sometimes used. A transistor may have only one kind of [charge carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_carrier "Charge carrier") in a [field-effect transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor "Field-effect transistor"), or may have two kinds of charge carriers in [bipolar junction transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor "Bipolar junction transistor") devices. Compared with the [vacuum tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube"), transistors are generally smaller and require less power to operate. Certain vacuum tubes have advantages over transistors at very high operating frequencies or high operating voltages, such as [traveling-wave tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling-wave_tube "Traveling-wave tube") and [gyrotrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrotron "Gyrotron"). Many types of transistors are made to standardized specifications by multiple manufacturers.

[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Edgar_Lilienfeld "Julius Edgar Lilienfeld") proposed the concept of a [field-effect transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor "Field-effect transistor") in 1925.

The [thermionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermionic "Thermionic")[triode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triode "Triode"), a [vacuum tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube") invented in 1907, enabled amplified [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio "Radio") technology and long-distance [telephony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephony "Telephony"). The triode, however, was a fragile device that consumed a substantial amount of power. In 1909, [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist")[William Eccles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Eccles_(physicist) "William Eccles (physicist)") discovered the [crystal diode oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator "Crystal oscillator").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-12) Physicist [Julius Edgar Lilienfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Edgar_Lilienfeld "Julius Edgar Lilienfeld") filed a patent for a [field-effect transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor "Field-effect transistor") (FET) in Canada in 1925,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-13) intended as a [solid-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_electronics "Solid-state electronics") replacement for the triode.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-auto-15) He filed identical patents in the United States in 1926[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-16) and 1928.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-18) However, he did not publish any research articles about his devices nor did his patents cite any specific examples of a working prototype. Because the production of high-quality [semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor "Semiconductor") materials was still decades away, Lilienfeld's solid-state amplifier ideas would not have found practical use in the 1920s and 1930s, even if such a device had been built.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-todaysengineer.org-19) In 1934, inventor [Oskar Heil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Heil "Oskar Heil") patented a similar device in Europe.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-20)

### Bipolar transistors

[John Bardeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen "John Bardeen"), [William Shockley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley "William Shockley"), and [Walter Brattain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Brattain "Walter Brattain") at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs "Bell Labs") in 1948; Bardeen and Brattain invented the [point-contact transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-contact_transistor "Point-contact transistor") in 1947 and Shockley invented the [bipolar junction transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor "Bipolar junction transistor") in 1948.

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg/250px-Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg)

[Herbert Mataré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Matar%C3%A9 "Herbert Mataré") (pictured in 1950) independently invented a point-contact transistor in June 1948.

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Philco_Surface_Barrier_transistor%3D1953.jpg/250px-Philco_Surface_Barrier_transistor%3D1953.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Philco_Surface_Barrier_transistor%3D1953.jpg)

A Philco surface-barrier transistor developed and produced in 1953

From November 17 to December 23, 1947, [John Bardeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen "John Bardeen") and [Walter Brattain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Brattain "Walter Brattain") at [AT&T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Corporation "AT&T Corporation")'s [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs "Bell Labs") in [Murray Hill, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Hill,_New_Jersey "Murray Hill, New Jersey"), performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of [germanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium "Germanium"), a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-21) Solid State Physics Group leader [William Shockley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley "William Shockley") saw the potential in this, and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor "Semiconductor"). The term _transistor_ was coined by [John R. Pierce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Pierce "John R. Pierce") as a contraction of the term _[transresistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transresistance "Transresistance")_.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-24) According to [Lillian Hoddeson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Hoddeson "Lillian Hoddeson") and Vicki Daitch, Shockley proposed that Bell Labs' first patent for a transistor should be based on the field-effect and that he be named as the inventor. Having unearthed Lilienfeld's patents that went into obscurity years earlier, lawyers at Bell Labs advised against Shockley's proposal because the idea of a field-effect transistor that used an electric field as a _grid_ was not new. Instead, what Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley invented in 1947 was the first [point-contact transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-contact_transistor "Point-contact transistor").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-todaysengineer.org-19) To acknowledge this accomplishment, Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain jointly received the 1956 [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") "for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect".[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Guarnieri_1-26)

Shockley's team initially attempted to build a field-effect transistor (FET) by trying to modulate the conductivity of a semiconductor, but was unsuccessful, mainly due to problems with the [surface states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_states "Surface states"), the [dangling bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_bond "Dangling bond"), and the [germanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium "Germanium") and [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper "Copper") compound materials. Trying to understand the mysterious reasons behind this failure led them instead to invent the bipolar [point-contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-contact_transistor "Point-contact transistor") and [junction transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_transistor "Junction transistor").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Lee-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Puers-28)

In 1948, the point-contact transistor was independently invented by physicists [Herbert Mataré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Matar%C3%A9 "Herbert Mataré") and [Heinrich Welker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Welker "Heinrich Welker") while working at the _[Compagnie des Freins et Signaux Westinghouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compagnie\_des\_Freins\_et\_Signaux\_Westinghouse&action=edit&redlink=1 "Compagnie des Freins et Signaux Westinghouse (page does not exist)")_, a [Westinghouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westinghouse_Electric_(1886) "Westinghouse Electric (1886)") subsidiary in Paris. Mataré had previous experience in developing [crystal rectifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_detector "Crystal detector") from [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon") and germanium in the German [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar") effort during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). With this knowledge, he began researching the phenomenon of _interference_ in 1947. By June 1948, witnessing currents flowing through point-contacts, he produced consistent results using samples of germanium produced by Welker, similar to what Bardeen and Brattain had accomplished earlier in December 1947. Realizing that Bell Labs' scientists had already invented the transistor, the company rushed to get its _transistron_ into production for amplified use in France's telephone network, filing his first transistor patent application on August 13, 1948.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-31)

The first [bipolar junction transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor "Bipolar junction transistor") were invented by Bell Labs' William Shockley, who applied for patent (2,569,347) on June 26, 1948. On April 12, 1950, Bell Labs chemists [Gordon Teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Teal "Gordon Teal") and [Morgan Sparks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Sparks "Morgan Sparks") successfully produced a working bipolar NPN junction amplifying germanium transistor. Bell announced the discovery of this new _sandwich_ transistor in a press release on July 4, 1951.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-33)

The first high-frequency transistor was the [surface-barrier germanium transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-barrier_transistor "Surface-barrier transistor") developed by [Philco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philco "Philco") in 1953, capable of operating at frequencies up to 60 MHz.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-34) They were made by etching depressions into an n-type germanium base from both sides with jets of [indium(III) sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium(III)_sulfate "Indium(III) sulfate") until it was a few ten-thousandths of an inch thick. [Indium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium "Indium") electroplated into the depressions formed the collector and emitter.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-36)

AT&T first used transistors in telecommunications equipment in the No.4A Toll Crossbar Switching System in 1953, for selecting trunk circuits from routing information encoded on translator cards.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-37) Its predecessor, the Western Electric No.3A [phototransistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototransistor "Phototransistor"), read the mechanical encoding from punched metal cards.

The first prototype pocket [transistor radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_radio "Transistor radio") was shown by INTERMETALL, a company founded by [Herbert Mataré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Matar%C3%A9 "Herbert Mataré") in 1952, at the [_Internationale Funkausstellung Düsseldorf_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationale_Funkausstellung_Berlin "Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin") from August 29 to September 6, 1953.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-39) The first production-model pocket transistor radio was the [Regency TR-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_TR-1 "Regency TR-1"), released in October 1954.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Guarnieri_1-26) Produced as a joint venture between the Regency Division of Industrial Development Engineering Associates, I.D.E.A. and [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments "Texas Instruments") of Dallas, Texas, the TR-1 was manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was a near pocket-sized radio with four transistors and one germanium diode. The industrial design was outsourced to the Chicago firm of Painter, Teague and Petertil. It was initially released in one of six colours: black, ivory, mandarin red, cloud grey, mahogany and olive green. Other colours shortly followed.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-42)

The first production all-transistor car radio was developed by Chrysler and [Philco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philco "Philco") corporations and was announced in the April 28, 1955, edition of _The Wall Street Journal_. Chrysler made the Mopar model 914HR available as an option starting in fall 1955 for its new line of 1956 Chrysler and Imperial cars, which reached dealership showrooms on October 21, 1955.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-44)

The [Sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony "Sony") TR-63, released in 1957, was the first mass-produced transistor radio, leading to the widespread adoption of transistor radios.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Skrabec-45) Seven million TR-63s were sold worldwide by the mid-1960s.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-46) Sony's success with transistor radios led to transistors replacing vacuum tubes as the dominant [electronic technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_technology "Electronic technology") in the late 1950s.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-47)

The first working silicon transistor was developed at Bell Labs on January 26, 1954, by [Morris Tanenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Tanenbaum "Morris Tanenbaum"). The first production commercial silicon transistor was announced by [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments "Texas Instruments") in May 1954. This was the work of [Gordon Teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Teal "Gordon Teal"), an expert in growing crystals of high purity, who had previously worked at Bell Labs.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-50)

### Field-effect transistors

The basic principle of the [field-effect transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor "Field-effect transistor") (FET) was first proposed by physicist [Julius Edgar Lilienfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Edgar_Lilienfeld "Julius Edgar Lilienfeld") when he filed a [patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent "Patent") for a device similar to [MESFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESFET "MESFET") in 1926, and for an insulated-gate field-effect transistor in 1928.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-auto-15)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-51) The FET concept was later also theorized by engineer [Oskar Heil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Heil "Oskar Heil") in the 1930s and by [William Shockley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley "William Shockley") in the 1940s.

In 1945, [JFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFET "JFET") was patented by [Heinrich Welker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Welker "Heinrich Welker").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-52) Following Shockley's theoretical treatment on JFET in 1952, a working practical JFET was made in 1953 by [George C. Dacey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Dacey "George C. Dacey") and [Ian M. Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Munro_Ross "Ian Munro Ross").[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-53)

In 1948, Bardeen and Brattain patented the progenitor of MOSFET at Bell Labs, an insulated-gate FET (IGFET) with an inversion layer. Bardeen's patent, and the concept of an inversion layer, forms the basis of CMOS and DRAM technology today.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-54)

In the early years of the [semiconductor industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_industry "Semiconductor industry"), companies focused on the [junction transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_transistor "Junction transistor"), a relatively bulky device that was difficult to [mass-produce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-production "Mass-production"), limiting it to several specialized applications. [Field-effect transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor "Field-effect transistor") (FETs) were theorized as potential alternatives, but researchers could not get them to work properly, largely due to the [surface state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_state "Surface state") barrier that prevented the external [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") from penetrating the material.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Moskowitz-55)

In 1955, [Carl Frosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Frosch "Carl Frosch") and Lincoln Derick accidentally grew a layer of silicon dioxide over the silicon wafer, for which they observed surface passivation effects.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-:0-6)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-56) By 1957 Frosch and Derick, using masking and predeposition, were able to manufacture silicon dioxide field effect transistors; the first planar transistors, in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-auto2-7) They showed that silicon dioxide insulated, protected silicon wafers and prevented dopants from diffusing into the wafer.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-:0-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-auto2-7) After this, J.R. Ligenza and W.G. Spitzer studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides, fabricated a high quality Si/[SiO 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide "Silicon dioxide") stack and published their results in 1960.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-57)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Deal2-58)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-59)

Following this research, [Mohamed Atalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Atalla "Mohamed Atalla") and [Dawon Kahng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawon_Kahng "Dawon Kahng") proposed a silicon MOS transistor in 1959[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Bassett22-60) and successfully demonstrated a working MOS device with their Bell Labs team in 1960.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-61)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-62) Their team included E. E. LaBate and E. I. Povilonis who fabricated the device; M. O. Thurston, L. A. D’Asaro, and J. R. Ligenza who developed the diffusion processes, and H. K. Gummel and R. Lindner who characterized the device.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-auto3-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-auto4-9) With its [high scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET_scaling "MOSFET scaling"),[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-63) much lower power consumption, and higher density than bipolar junction transistors,[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-64) the MOSFET made it possible to build [high-density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_scale_integration "Large scale integration") integrated circuits,[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-computer_history-transistor-65) allowing the integration of more than 10,000 transistors in a single IC.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-66)

Bardeen and Brattain's 1948 inversion layer concept forms the basis of CMOS technology today.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-67) The [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS "CMOS") (complementary [MOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET "MOSFET")) was invented by [Chih-Tang Sah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chih-Tang_Sah "Chih-Tang Sah") and [Frank Wanlass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wanlass "Frank Wanlass") at [Fairchild Semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor "Fairchild Semiconductor") in 1963.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-computerhistory1963-68) The first report of a [floating-gate MOSFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-gate_MOSFET "Floating-gate MOSFET") was made by Dawon Kahng and [Simon Sze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Sze "Simon Sze") in 1967.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-69)

In 1967, Bell Labs researchers Robert Kerwin, [Donald Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_L._Klein "Donald L. Klein") and John Sarace developed the [self-aligned gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-aligned_gate "Self-aligned gate") (silicon-gate) MOS transistor, which Fairchild Semiconductor researchers [Federico Faggin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Faggin "Federico Faggin") and Tom Klein used to develop the first [silicon-gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon-gate "Silicon-gate") MOS [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit").[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-computerhistory1968-70)

A [double-gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-gate "Double-gate") MOSFET was first demonstrated in 1984 by [Electrotechnical Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrotechnical_Laboratory "Electrotechnical Laboratory") researchers Toshihiro Sekigawa and Yutaka Hayashi.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-71)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-72) The [FinFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FinFET "FinFET") (fin field-effect transistor), a type of 3D non-planar [multi-gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigate_device "Multigate device") MOSFET, originated from the research of Digh Hisamoto and his team at [Hitachi Central Research Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi "Hitachi") in 1989.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-73)[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-74)

Importance
----------

Because transistors are the key active components in practically all modern [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"), many people consider them one of the 20th century's greatest inventions.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-auto1-2)

The invention of the first transistor at Bell Labs was named an [IEEE Milestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IEEE_milestones "List of IEEE milestones") in 2009.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-75) Other Milestones include the inventions of the [junction transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_transistor "Junction transistor") in 1948 and the MOSFET in 1959.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-76)

The MOSFET is by far the most widely used transistor, in applications ranging from [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") and [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics")[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-kahng-77) to [communications technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_technology "Communications technology") such as [smartphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone "Smartphone").[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-uspto-78) It has been considered the most important transistor,[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-79) possibly the most important invention in electronics,[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-80) and the device that enabled modern electronics.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-81) It has been the basis of modern [digital electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics "Digital electronics") since the late 20th century, paving the way for the [digital age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_age "Digital age").[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-triumph-82) The [US Patent and Trademark Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Patent_and_Trademark_Office "US Patent and Trademark Office") calls it a "groundbreaking invention that transformed life and culture around the world".[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-uspto-78) Its ability to be [mass-produced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production "Mass production") by a highly automated process ([semiconductor device fabrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication "Semiconductor device fabrication")), from relatively basic materials, allows astonishingly low per-transistor costs. MOSFETs are the most numerously produced artificial objects in history, with more than 13 sextillion manufactured by 2018.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-83)

Although several companies each produce over a billion individually packaged (known as _[discrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete\_transistor "Discrete transistor")_) MOS transistors every year,[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-84) the vast majority are produced in [integrated circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuits "Integrated circuits") (also known as _ICs_, _microchips,_ or simply _chips_), along with [diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode "Diode"), [resistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor "Resistor"), [capacitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor "Capacitor") and other [electronic components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_component "Electronic component"), to produce complete electronic circuits. A [logic gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate "Logic gate") consists of up to about 20 transistors, whereas an advanced [microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor"), as of 2023, may contain as many as 134 billion transistors (and for exceptional chips, 2.6 trillion transistors, as of 2020).[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-85) Transistors are often organized into logic gates in microprocessors to perform computation.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-86)

The transistor's low cost, flexibility and reliability have made it ubiquitous. Transistorized [mechatronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics "Mechatronics") circuits have replaced [electromechanical devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_timer "Cam timer") in controlling appliances and machinery. It is often easier and cheaper to use a standard [microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller "Microcontroller") and write a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") to carry out a control function than to design an equivalent mechanical system.

Simplified operation
--------------------

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Transistor_Simple_Circuit_Diagram_with_NPN_Labels.svg/250px-Transistor_Simple_Circuit_Diagram_with_NPN_Labels.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Transistor_Simple_Circuit_Diagram_with_NPN_Labels.svg)

A simple circuit diagram showing the labels of an n–p–n bipolar transistor

A transistor can use a small signal applied between one pair of its terminals to control a much larger signal at another pair of terminals, a property called [gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain_(electronics) "Gain (electronics)"). It can produce a stronger output signal, a voltage or current, proportional to a weaker input signal, acting as an [amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier "Amplifier"). It can also be used as an electrically controlled [switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch "Switch"), where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-87)

There are two types of transistors, with slight differences in how they are used:

*   A _[bipolar junction transistor (BJT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar\_transistor "Bipolar transistor")_ has terminals labeled **base**, **collector** and **emitter**. A small current at the base terminal, flowing between the base and the emitter, can control or switch a much larger current between the collector and emitter.

*   A _[field-effect transistor (FET)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect\_transistor "Field-effect transistor")_ has terminals labeled **gate**, **source** and **drain**. A voltage at the gate can control a current between source and drain.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Pulfrey-88)

The top image in this section represents a typical bipolar transistor in a circuit. A charge flows between emitter and collector terminals depending on the current in the base. Because the base and emitter connections behave like a semiconductor diode, a voltage drop develops between them. The amount of this drop, determined by the transistor's material, is referred to as _V_ BE.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Pulfrey-88) (Base Emitter Voltage)

### Transistor as a switch

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Transistor_as_switch.svg/250px-Transistor_as_switch.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Transistor_as_switch.svg)

BJT used as an electronic switch in grounded-emitter configuration

Transistors are commonly used in [digital circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_circuit "Digital circuit") as [electronic switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_switches "Electronic switches") which can be either in an _on_ or _off_ state, both for high-power applications such as [switched-mode power supplies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply "Switched-mode power supply") and for low-power applications such as [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate "Logic gate"). Important parameters for this application include the current switched, the voltage handled, and the switching speed, characterized by the [rise and fall times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_time "Rise time").[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Pulfrey-88)

In a switching circuit, the goal is to simulate, as near as possible, the ideal switch having the properties of an open circuit when off, the short circuit when on, and an instantaneous transition between the two states. Parameters are chosen such that the _off_ output is limited to leakage currents too small to affect connected circuitry, the resistance of the transistor in the _on_ state is too small to affect circuitry, and the transition between the two states is fast enough not to have a detrimental effect.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Pulfrey-88)

In a grounded-emitter transistor circuit, such as the light-switch circuit shown, as the base voltage rises, the emitter and collector currents rise exponentially. The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from the collector to the emitter. If the voltage difference between the collector and emitter were zero (or near zero), the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance (light bulb) and the supply voltage. This is called _saturation_ because the current is flowing from collector to emitter freely. When saturated, the switch is said to be _on_.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-89)

The use of bipolar transistors for switching applications requires biasing the transistor so that it operates between its cut-off region in the off-state and the saturation region (_on_). This requires sufficient base drive current. As the transistor provides current gain, it facilitates the switching of a relatively large current in the collector by a much smaller current into the base terminal. The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the collector current. In the example of a light-switch circuit, as shown, the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor is saturated.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Pulfrey-88) The base resistor value is calculated from the supply voltage, transistor C-E junction voltage drop, collector current, and amplification factor beta.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-90)

### Transistor as an amplifier

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/NPN_common_emitter_AC.svg/250px-NPN_common_emitter_AC.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NPN_common_emitter_AC.svg)

An amplifier circuit, a common-emitter configuration with a voltage-divider bias circuit

The [common-emitter amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-emitter_amplifier "Common-emitter amplifier") is designed so that a small change in voltage (_V_ in) changes the small current through the base of the transistor whose current amplification combined with the properties of the circuit means that small swings in _V_ in produce large changes in _V_ out.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Pulfrey-88)

Various configurations of single transistor amplifiers are possible, with some providing current gain, some voltage gain, and some both.

From [mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone "Mobile phone") to [televisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television "Television"), vast numbers of products include amplifiers for [sound reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_reproduction "Sound reproduction"), [radio transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter "Transmitter"), and [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing "Signal processing"). The first discrete-transistor audio amplifiers barely supplied a few hundred milliwatts, but power and audio fidelity gradually increased as better transistors became available and amplifier architecture evolved.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Pulfrey-88)

Modern transistor audio amplifiers of up to a few hundred [watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt") are common and relatively inexpensive.

Comparison with vacuum tubes
----------------------------

Before transistors were developed, [vacuum (electron) tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube") (or in the UK _thermionic valves_ or just _valves_) were the main active components in electronic equipment.

### Advantages

The key advantages that have allowed transistors to replace vacuum tubes in most applications are

*   No cathode heater (which produces the characteristic orange glow of tubes), reducing power consumption, eliminating delay as tube heaters warm up, and immune from [cathode poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_poisoning "Cathode poisoning") and depletion.
*   Very small size and weight, reducing equipment size.
*   Large numbers of extremely small transistors can be manufactured as a single [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit").
*   Low operating voltages compatible with batteries of only a few cells.
*   Circuits with greater energy efficiency are usually possible. For low-power applications (for example, voltage amplification) in particular, energy consumption can be very much less than for tubes.
*   Complementary devices available, providing design flexibility including complementary-symmetry circuits, not possible with vacuum tubes.
*   Very low sensitivity to mechanical shock and vibration, providing physical ruggedness and virtually eliminating shock-induced spurious signals (for example, [microphonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphonics "Microphonics") in audio applications).
*   Not susceptible to breakage of a glass envelope, leakage, outgassing, and other physical damage.

### Limitations

Transistors may have the following limitations:

*   They lack the higher [electron mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_mobility "Electron mobility") afforded by the vacuum of vacuum tubes, which is desirable for high-power, high-frequency operation– such as that used in some over-the-air [television transmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_transmitter "Television transmitter") and in [travelling-wave tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling-wave_tube "Travelling-wave tube") used as amplifiers in some satellites
*   Transistors and other solid-state devices are susceptible to damage from very brief electrical and thermal events, including [electrostatic discharge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge "Electrostatic discharge") in handling. Vacuum tubes are electrically much more rugged.
*   They are sensitive to radiation and [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray") (special [radiation-hardened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening "Radiation hardening") chips are used for spacecraft devices).
*   In audio applications, transistors lack the lower-harmonic distortion– the so-called [tube sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_sound "Tube sound")– which is characteristic of vacuum tubes, and is preferred by some.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Veen1-91)

Hence, a particular transistor may be described as _silicon, surface-mount, BJT, NPN, low-power, high-frequency switch_.

### Mnemonics

Convenient [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic") to remember the type of transistor (represented by an [electrical symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_symbol "Electrical symbol")) involves the direction of the arrow. For the [BJT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor "Bipolar junction transistor"), on an **n–p–n** transistor symbol, the arrow will "**N**ot **P**oint i**N"**. On a **p–n–p** transistor symbol, the arrow "**P**oints i**N****P**roudly". However, this does not apply to MOSFET-based transistor symbols as the arrow is typically reversed (i.e. the arrow for the n–p–n points inside).

As gate voltage increases, the inversion electron density in the channel increases, the current increases, and the device turns on.

The _[field-effect transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect\_transistor "Field-effect transistor")_, sometimes called a _unipolar transistor_, uses either electrons (in _n-channel FET_) or holes (in _p-channel FET_) for conduction. The four terminals of the FET are named _source_, _gate_, _drain_, and _body_ (_substrate_). On most FETs, the body is connected to the source inside the package, and this will be assumed for the following description.

In a FET, the drain-to-source current flows via a conducting channel that connects the _source_ region to the _drain_ region. The conductivity is varied by the electric field that is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals, hence the current flowing between the drain and source is controlled by the voltage applied between the gate and source. As the gate–source voltage (V GS) is increased, the drain–source current (I DS) increases exponentially for V GS below threshold, and then at a roughly quadratic rate: (_I DS_ ∝ (_V GS_ − _V T_)2, where V T is the threshold voltage at which drain current begins)[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-horowitz-hill-94) in the [space-charge-limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_charge "Space charge") region above threshold. A quadratic behavior is not observed in modern devices, for example, at the [65 nm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65_nanometer "65 nanometer") technology node.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Sansen-95)

For low noise at narrow [bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing) "Bandwidth (signal processing)"), the higher input resistance of the FET is advantageous.

FETs are divided into two families: _junction FET_ ([JFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFET "JFET")) and _insulated gate FET_ (IGFET). The IGFET is more commonly known as a _metal–oxide–semiconductor FET_ ([MOSFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET "MOSFET")), reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (the gate), oxide (the insulation), and semiconductor. Unlike IGFETs, the JFET gate forms a [p–n diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_diode "P–n diode") with the channel which lies between the source and drains. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube [triode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triode "Triode") which, similarly, forms a diode between its [grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_grid "Control grid") and [cathode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode "Cathode"). Also, both devices operate in the _depletion-mode_, they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current under the control of an input voltage.

Metal–semiconductor FETs ([MESFETs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESFET "MESFET")) are JFETs in which the [reverse biased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-biased "Reverse-biased") p–n junction is replaced by a [metal–semiconductor junction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal%E2%80%93semiconductor_junction "Metal–semiconductor junction"). These, and the HEMTs (high-electron-mobility transistors, or HFETs), in which a two-dimensional electron gas with very high carrier mobility is used for charge transport, are especially suitable for use at very high frequencies (several GHz).

FETs are further divided into _depletion-mode_ and _enhancement-mode_ types, depending on whether the channel is turned on or off with zero gate-to-source voltage. For enhancement mode, the channel is off at zero bias, and a gate potential can _enhance_ the conduction. For the depletion mode, the channel is on at zero bias, and a gate potential (of the opposite polarity) can _deplete_ the channel, reducing conduction. For either mode, a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a higher current for n-channel devices and a lower current for p-channel devices. Nearly all JFETs are depletion-mode because the diode junctions would forward bias and conduct if they were enhancement-mode devices, while most IGFETs are enhancement-mode types.

#### Metal–oxide–semiconductor FET (MOSFET)

The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor ([MOSFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET "MOSFET"), MOS-FET, or MOS FET), also known as the metal–oxide–silicon transistor (MOS transistor, or MOS),[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-computer_history-transistor-65) is a type of field-effect transistor that is [fabricated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication "Semiconductor device fabrication") by the [controlled oxidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_oxidation "Thermal oxidation") of a semiconductor, typically [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon"). It has an insulated [gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_gate "Metal gate"), whose voltage determines the conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic [signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electrical_engineering) "Signal (electrical engineering)"). The MOSFET is by far the most common transistor, and the basic building block of most modern [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics").[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-triumph-82) The MOSFET accounts for 99.9% of all transistors in the world.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-computerhistory2018-96)

### Bipolar junction transistor (BJT)

Bipolar transistors are so named because they conduct by using both majority and minority [carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_carrier "Charge carrier"). The bipolar junction transistor, the first type of transistor to be mass-produced, is a combination of two junction diodes and is formed of either a thin layer of p-type semiconductor sandwiched between two n-type semiconductors (an n–p–n transistor), or a thin layer of n-type semiconductor sandwiched between two p-type semiconductors (a p–n–p transistor). This construction produces two [p–n junctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction "P–n junction"): a base-emitter junction and a base-collector junction, separated by a thin region of semiconductor known as the base region. (Two junction diodes wired together without sharing an intervening semiconducting region will not make a transistor.)

BJTs have three terminals, corresponding to the three layers of semiconductor—an _emitter_, a _base_, and a _collector_. They are useful in [amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier "Amplifier") because the currents at the emitter and collector are controllable by a relatively small base current.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Streetman-97) In an n–p–n transistor operating in the active region, the emitter-base junction is forward-biased ([electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and [holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole "Electron hole") recombine at the junction), and the base-collector junction is reverse-biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and move away from, the junction), and electrons are injected into the base region. Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased base-collector junction and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current. As well, as the base is lightly doped (in comparison to the emitter and collector regions), recombination rates are low, permitting more carriers to diffuse across the base region. By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Streetman-97) Collector current is approximately β (common-emitter current gain) times the base current. It is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.

Unlike the field-effect transistor (see below), the BJT is a low-input-impedance device. Also, as the base-emitter voltage (_V_ BE) is increased the base-emitter current and hence the collector-emitter current (_I_ CE) increase exponentially according to the [Shockley diode model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode_modelling#Shockley_diode_model "Diode modelling") and the [Ebers-Moll model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebers-Moll_model "Ebers-Moll model"). Because of this exponential relationship, the BJT has a higher [transconductance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transconductance "Transconductance") than the FET.

Bipolar transistors can be made to conduct by exposure to light because the absorption of photons in the base region generates a photocurrent that acts as a base current; the collector current is approximately β times the photocurrent. Devices designed for this purpose have a transparent window in the package and are called [phototransistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototransistor "Phototransistor").

### Usage of MOSFETs and BJTs

The [MOSFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET "MOSFET") is by far the most widely used transistor for both [digital circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_circuit "Digital circuit") as well as [analog circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_circuit "Analog circuit"),[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-98) accounting for 99.9% of all transistors in the world.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-computerhistory2018-96) The [bipolar junction transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor "Bipolar junction transistor") (BJT) was previously the most commonly used transistor during the 1950s to 1960s. Even after MOSFETs became widely available in the 1970s, the BJT remained the transistor of choice for many analog circuits such as amplifiers because of their greater linearity, up until MOSFET devices (such as [power MOSFETs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_MOSFET "Power MOSFET"), [LDMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDMOS "LDMOS") and [RF CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_CMOS "RF CMOS")) replaced them for most [power electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_electronic "Power electronic") applications in the 1980s. In [integrated circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit"), the desirable properties of MOSFETs allowed them to capture nearly all market share for digital circuits in the 1970s. Discrete MOSFETs (typically power MOSFETs) can be applied in transistor applications, including analog circuits, voltage regulators, amplifiers, power transmitters, and motor drivers.

Device identification
---------------------

Three major identification standards are used for designating transistor devices. In each, the alphanumeric prefix provides clues to the type of the device.

### Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC)

The [JEDEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEDEC "JEDEC") part numbering scheme evolved in the 1960s in the United States. The JEDEC _EIA-370_ transistor device numbers usually start with _2N_, indicating a three-terminal device.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-113) Dual-gate [field-effect transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor "Field-effect transistor") are four-terminal devices, and begin with 3N. The prefix is followed by a two-, three- or four-digit number with no significance as to device properties, although early devices with low numbers tend to be germanium devices. For example, [2N3055](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2N3055 "2N3055") is a silicon n–p–n power transistor, 2N1301 is a p–n–p germanium switching transistor. A letter suffix, such as A, is sometimes used to indicate a newer variant, but rarely gain groupings.

JEDEC prefix table | Prefix | Type and usage |
| --- | --- |
| 1N | two-terminal device, such as diodes |
| 2N | three-terminal device, such as transistors or single-gate [field-effect transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor "Field-effect transistor") |
| 3N | four-terminal device, such as dual-gate field-effect transistors |

### Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS)

In Japan, the [JIS semiconductor designation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_semiconductor_designation "JIS semiconductor designation") (|JIS-C-7012), labels transistor devices starting with _2S_,[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-114) e.g., 2SD965, but sometimes the 2S prefix is not marked on the package–a 2SD965 might only be marked _D965_ and a 2SC1815 might be listed by a supplier as simply _C1815_. This series sometimes has suffixes, such as R, O, BL, standing for red, orange, blue, etc., to denote variants, such as tighter _h_ FE (gain) groupings.

JIS transistor prefix table | Prefix | Type and usage |
| --- | --- |
| 2SA | high-frequency p–n–p BJT |
| 2SB | audio-frequency p–n–p BJT |
| 2SC | high-frequency n–p–n BJT |
| 2SD | audio-frequency n–p–n BJT |
| 2SJ | P-channel FET (both JFET and MOSFET) |
| 2SK | N-channel FET (both JFET and MOSFET) |

### European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association (EECA)

The European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association (EECA) uses a numbering scheme that was inherited from [Pro Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Electron "Pro Electron") when it merged with EECA in 1983. This scheme begins with two letters: the first gives the semiconductor type (A for germanium, B for silicon, and C for materials like GaAs); the second letter denotes the intended use (A for diode, C for general-purpose transistor, etc.). A three-digit sequence number (or one letter and two digits, for industrial types) follows. With early devices this indicated the case type. Suffixes may be used, with a letter (e.g. C often means high _h_ FE, such as in: BC549C[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-115)) or other codes may follow to show gain (e.g. BC327-25) or voltage rating (e.g. BUK854-800A[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-116)). The more common prefixes are:

### Proprietary

Manufacturers of devices may have their proprietary numbering system, for example [CK722](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CK722 "CK722"). Since devices are [second-sourced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_source "Second source"), a manufacturer's prefix (like MPF in MPF102, which originally would denote a [Motorola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola "Motorola")[FET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FET "FET")) now is an unreliable indicator of who made the device. Some proprietary naming schemes adopt parts of other naming schemes, for example, a PN2222A is a (possibly [Fairchild Semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor "Fairchild Semiconductor")) 2N2222A in a plastic case (but a PN108 is a plastic version of a BC108, not a 2N108, while the PN100 is unrelated to other xx100 devices).

Military part numbers sometimes are assigned their codes, such as the [British Military CV Naming System](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UK_CV_series&action=edit&redlink=1 "UK CV series (page does not exist)").

Manufacturers buying large numbers of similar parts may have them supplied with _house numbers_, identifying a particular purchasing specification and not necessarily a device with a standardized registered number. For example, an HP part 1854,0053 is a (JEDEC) 2N2218 transistor[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-117)[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-118) which is also assigned the CV number: CV7763[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-119)

### Naming problems

With so many independent naming schemes, and the abbreviation of part numbers when printed on the devices, ambiguity sometimes occurs. For example, two different devices may be marked J176 (one the J176 low-power [JFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFET "JFET"), the other the higher-powered [MOSFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET "MOSFET") 2SJ176).

As older through-hole transistors are given surface-mount packaged counterparts, they tend to be assigned many different part numbers because manufacturers have their systems to cope with the variety in [pinout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinout "Pinout") arrangements and options for dual or matched n–p–n + p–n–p devices in one pack. So even when the original device (such as a 2N3904) may have been assigned by a standards authority, and well known by engineers over the years, the new versions are far from standardized in their naming.

Construction

### Semiconductor material

Semiconductor material characteristics | Semiconductor material | Junction forward voltage @ 25°C, V | Electron mobility @ 25°C, m 2/(V·s) | Hole mobility @ 25°C, m 2/(V·s) | Max. junction temp., °C |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ge | 0.27 | 0.39 | 0.19 | 70 to 100 |
| Si | 0.71 | 0.14 | 0.05 | 150 to 200 |
| GaAs | 1.03 | 0.85 | 0.05 | 150 to 200 |
| Al–Si junction | 0.3 | — | — | 150 to 200 |

The first BJTs were made from [germanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium "Germanium") (Ge). [Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon") (Si) types currently predominate but certain advanced microwave and high-performance versions now employ the _compound semiconductor_ material [gallium arsenide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_arsenide "Gallium arsenide") (GaAs) and the _semiconductor alloy_[silicon–germanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon%E2%80%93germanium "Silicon–germanium") (SiGe). Single-element semiconductor material (Ge and Si) is described as _elemental_.

Rough parameters for the most common semiconductor materials used to make transistors are given in the adjacent table. These parameters will vary with an increase in temperature, electric field, impurity level, strain, and sundry other factors.

The _junction forward voltage_ is the voltage applied to the emitter-base junction of a BJT to make the base conduct a specified current. The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to drive the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with an increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction, the change is −2.1 mV/°C.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Sedra-120) In some circuits special compensating elements ([sensistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensistor "Sensistor")) must be used to compensate for such changes.

The density of mobile carriers in the channel of a MOSFET is a function of the electric field forming the channel and of various other phenomena such as the impurity level in the channel. Some impurities, called dopants, are introduced deliberately in making a MOSFET, to control the MOSFET electrical behavior.

The _[electron mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron\_mobility "Electron mobility")_ and _[hole mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole\_mobility "Hole mobility")_ columns show the average speed that electrons and holes diffuse through the semiconductor material with an [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") of 1 volt per meter applied across the material. In general, the higher the electron mobility the faster the transistor can operate. The table indicates that Ge is a better material than Si in this respect. However, Ge has four major shortcomings compared to silicon and gallium arsenide:

1.   Its maximum temperature is limited.
2.   It has relatively high [leakage current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_leakage_current "Reverse leakage current").
3.   It cannot withstand high voltages.
4.   It is less suitable for fabricating integrated circuits.

Because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar [n–p–n transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%E2%80%93p%E2%80%93n_transistor "N–p–n transistor") tends to be swifter than an equivalent [p–n–p transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n%E2%80%93p_transistor "P–n–p transistor"). GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications. A relatively recent[_[when?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] FET development, the _[high-electron-mobility transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-electron-mobility\_transistor "High-electron-mobility transistor")_ (HEMT), has a [heterostructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterojunction "Heterojunction") (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz. HEMTs based on [gallium nitride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_nitride "Gallium nitride") and [aluminum gallium nitride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum_gallium_nitride "Aluminum gallium nitride") (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications.

Maximum [junction temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_temperature "Junction temperature") values represent a cross-section taken from various manufacturers' datasheets. This temperature should not be exceeded or the transistor may be damaged.

_Al–Si junction_ refers to the high-speed (aluminum-silicon) metal–semiconductor barrier diode, commonly known as a [Schottky diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schottky_diode "Schottky diode"). This is included in the table because some silicon power IGFETs have a [parasitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_structure "Parasitic structure") reverse Schottky diode formed between the source and drain as part of the fabrication process. This diode can be a nuisance, but sometimes it is used in the circuit.

### Packaging

Assorted discrete transistors

[![Image 30](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Kt315b.jpg/250px-Kt315b.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kt315b.jpg)

[Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")-manufactured [KT315b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KT315 "KT315") transistors

Discrete transistors can be individually packaged transistors or unpackaged transistor chips.

Transistors come in many different [semiconductor packages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_package "Semiconductor package") (see image). The two main categories are _[through-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole\_technology "Through-hole technology")_ (or _leaded_), and _surface-mount_, also known as _surface-mount device_ ([SMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology "Surface-mount technology")). The _ball grid array_ ([BGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array "Ball grid array")) is the latest surface-mount package. It has solder balls on the underside in place of leads. Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections, SMDs have better high-frequency characteristics but lower power ratings.

Transistor packages are made of glass, metal, ceramic, or plastic. The package often dictates the power rating and frequency characteristics. Power transistors have larger packages that can be clamped to [heat sinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_sink "Heat sink") for enhanced cooling. Additionally, most power transistors have the collector or drain physically connected to the metal enclosure. At the other extreme, some surface-mount _microwave_ transistors are as small as grains of sand.

Often a given transistor type is available in several packages. Transistor packages are mainly standardized, but the assignment of a transistor's functions to the terminals is not: other transistor types can assign other functions to the package's terminals. Even for the same transistor type the terminal assignment can vary (normally indicated by a suffix letter to the part number, q.e. BC212L and BC212K).

Nowadays most transistors come in a wide range of SMT packages. In comparison, the list of available through-hole packages is relatively small. Here is a short list of the most common through-hole transistors packages in alphabetical order: ATV, E-line, MRT, HRT, SC-43, SC-72, TO-3, TO-18, TO-39, TO-92, TO-126, TO220, TO247, TO251, TO262, ZTX851.

Unpackaged transistor chips (die) may be assembled into hybrid devices.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Greig-121) The [IBM SLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_SLT "IBM SLT") module of the 1960s is one example of such a hybrid circuit module using glass passivated transistor (and diode) die. Other packaging techniques for discrete transistors as chips include _direct chip attach_ (DCA) and _chip-on-board_ (COB).[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-Greig-121)

#### Flexible transistors

Researchers have made several kinds of flexible transistors, including [organic field-effect transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_field-effect_transistor "Organic field-effect transistor").[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-122)[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-123)[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#cite_note-124) Flexible transistors are useful in some kinds of [flexible displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_display "Flexible display") and other [flexible electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_electronics "Flexible electronics").
