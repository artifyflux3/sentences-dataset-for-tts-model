In mathematics , the word constant conveys multiple meanings. As an adjective, it refers to non-variance (i.e. unchanging with respect to some other value ); as a noun, it has two different meanings: A fixed and well-defined number or other non-changing mathematical object , or the symbol denoting it.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The terms mathematical constant or physical constant are sometimes used to distinguish this meaning.

[ 3 ] A function whose value remains unchanged (i.e., a constant function ).

[ 4 ] Such a constant is commonly represented by a variable which does not depend on the main variable(s) in question.

For example, a general quadratic function is commonly written as: a x 2 + b x + c , {\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c\,,} where a , b and c are constants ( coefficients or parameters), and x a variable —a placeholder for the argument of the function being studied. A more explicit way to denote this function is x ↦ ↦ a x 2 + b x + c , {\displaystyle x\mapsto ax^{2}+bx+c\,,} which makes the function-argument status of x (and by extension the constancy of a , b and c ) clear. In this example a , b and c are coefficients of the polynomial . Since c occurs in a term that does not involve x , it is called the constant term of the polynomial and can be thought of as the coefficient of x 0 . More generally, any polynomial term or expression of degree zero (no variable) is a constant.

[ 5 ] : 18 Constant function [ edit ] Main articles: Constant function and Nullary A constant may be used to define a constant function that ignores its arguments and always gives the same value.

[ 6 ] A constant function of a single variable, such as f ( x ) = 5 {\displaystyle f(x)=5} , has a graph of a horizontal line parallel to the x -axis.

[ 7 ] Such a function always takes the same value (in this case 5), because the variable does not appear in the expression defining the function.

Graph of f ( x ) = 5 {\displaystyle f(x)=5} .

Context-dependence [ edit ] The context-dependent nature of the concept of "constant" can be seen in this example from elementary calculus: d d x 2 x = lim h → → 0 2 x + h − − 2 x h = lim h → → 0 2 x 2 h − − 1 h = 2 x lim h → → 0 2 h − − 1 h since x is constant (i.e. does not depend on h ) = 2 x ⋅ ⋅ c o n s t a n t , where c o n s t a n t means not depending on x .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {d}{dx}}2^{x}&=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {2^{x+h}-2^{x}}{h}}=\lim _{h\to 0}2^{x}{\frac {2^{h}-1}{h}}\\[8pt]&=2^{x}\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {2^{h}-1}{h}}&&{\text{since }}x{\text{ is constant (i.e. does not depend on }}h{\text{)}}\\[8pt]&=2^{x}\cdot \mathbf {constant,} &&{\text{where }}\mathbf {constant} {\text{ means not depending on }}x.\end{aligned}}} "Constant" means not depending on some variable; not changing as that variable changes. In the first case above, it means not depending on h ; in the second, it means not depending on x . A constant in a narrower context could be regarded as a variable in a broader context.

Notable mathematical constants [ edit ] Main article: Mathematical constant Some values occur frequently in mathematics and are conventionally denoted by a specific symbol. These standard symbols and their values are called mathematical constants. Examples include: 0 ( zero ).

1 ( one ), the natural number after zero.

π ( pi ), the constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.141592653589793238462643.

[ 8 ] e , approximately equal to 2.718281828459045235360287.

[ 9 ] i , the imaginary unit such that i 2 = −1 .

[ 10 ] 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} ( square root of 2 ), the length of the diagonal of a square with unit sides, approximately equal to 1.414213562373095048801688.

[ 11 ] φ ( golden ratio ), approximately equal to 1.618033988749894848204586, or algebraically, 1 + 5 2 {\displaystyle 1+{\sqrt {5}} \over 2} .

[ 12 ] Constants in calculus [ edit ] In calculus , constants are treated in several different ways depending on the operation. For example, the derivative (rate of change) of a constant function is zero. This is because constants, by definition, do not change. Their derivative is hence zero.

Conversely, when integrating a constant function, the constant is multiplied by the variable of integration.

During the evaluation of a limit , a constant remains the same as it was before and after evaluation.

Integration of a function of one variable often involves a constant of integration . This arises because the integral is the inverse (opposite) of the derivative meaning that the aim of integration is to recover the original function before differentiation. The derivative of a constant function is zero, as noted above, and the differential operator is a linear operator, so functions that only differ by a constant term have the same derivative. To acknowledge this, a constant of integration is added to an indefinite integral ; this ensures that all possible solutions are included. The constant of integration is generally written as 'c', and represents a constant with a fixed but undefined value.

Examples [ edit ] If f is the constant function such that f ( x ) = 72 {\displaystyle f(x)=72} for every x then f ′ ( x ) = 0 ∫ ∫ f ( x ) d x = 72 x + c lim x → → 0 f ( x ) = 72 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f'(x)&=0\\\int f(x)\,dx&=72x+c\\\lim _{x\rightarrow 0}f(x)&=72\end{aligned}}} See also [ edit ] Constant (disambiguation) Expression Level set List of mathematical constants Physical constant References [ edit ] ^ Sobolev, S.
