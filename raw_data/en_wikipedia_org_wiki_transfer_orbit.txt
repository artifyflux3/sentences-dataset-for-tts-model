There are several types of transfer orbits, which vary in their energy efficiency and speed of transfer. These include: Hohmann transfer orbit , an elliptical orbit used to transfer a spacecraft between two circular orbits of different altitudes in the same plane Bi-elliptic transfer , a slower method of transfer, but one that may be more efficient than a Hohmann transfer orbit Geostationary transfer orbit or geosynchronous transfer orbit is usually also a Hohmann transfer orbit Lunar transfer orbit is an orbit that touches Low Earth orbit and a lunar orbit .
