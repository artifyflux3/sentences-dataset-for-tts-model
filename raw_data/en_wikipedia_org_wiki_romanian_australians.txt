According to ABS (2021 census) figures, there are 15,268 people in Australia who were born in Romania [ 1 ] and 28,103 people with Romanian ancestry in Australia.

[ 2 ] Romanians were registered in Australia for the first time more than 80 years ago having emigrated for work seeking a more prosperous economic status, or as missionaries.

[ 3 ] But the first wave of Romanian emigrants to Australia came after World War II , when Romania was experiencing severe economic and political problems. The Romanians who were then emigrating to Australia principally settled in areas around Sydney , Melbourne and Brisbane . The number of Romanians who came to Australia at the time is estimated to be around 2,000 people.

[ 4 ] The second wave of Romanian emigration to the Australian continent began after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 , when the Communist regime fell and citizens received the right to leave Romania . They came in large numbers for the same reasons as the first-wave immigrants.

A diverse range of ethnic backgrounds can be found among the Romanian-born population in Australia, including Roma (Gypsies), Germans, Hungarians, Serbians, Russians, Greeks, Jews, Turks, and Bulgarians.

[ 5 ] History [ edit ] Vasile Teodorescu, born in Galați in 1853, was one of the early Romanian settlers in Australia. He was the son of an Orthodox priest.
