**Heber Doust Curtis** (June 27, 1872 – January 9, 1942) was an American [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer"). He participated in 11 expeditions for the study of [solar eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse "Solar eclipse"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis#cite_note-obit-2) and, as an advocate and theorist that additional galaxies existed outside of the Milky Way, was involved in the 1920 [Shapley–Curtis Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley%E2%80%93Curtis_Debate "Shapley–Curtis Debate") concerning the size and galactic structure of the universe.

Curtis was born on June 27, 1872, the elder son of Orson Blair Curtis and Sarah Eliza Doust.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis#cite_note-3)

He studied at the [University of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan "University of Michigan") and at the [University of Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia "University of Virginia"), earning a degree in astronomy from the latter.

From 1902 to 1920 Curtis worked at [Lick Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lick_Observatory "Lick Observatory"), continuing the survey of [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula") initiated by [Keeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Edward_Keeler "James Edward Keeler"). He headed up the [Lick southern station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Foster_Observatory "Manuel Foster Observatory") in Chile from 1905 until 1909, when he returned to take charge of the [Crossley telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossley_telescope "Crossley telescope").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis#cite_note-4) In 1912 he was elected president of the [Astronomical Society of the Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_Society_of_the_Pacific "Astronomical Society of the Pacific").

In 1918 he observed [Messier 87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87 "Messier 87") and was the first to notice the [astrophysical jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet "Astrophysical jet") which he described as a "curious straight ray ... apparently connected with the nucleus by a thin line of matter."[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis#cite_note-plo13-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis#cite_note-6)

In 1920 he was appointed director of the [Allegheny Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_Observatory "Allegheny Observatory"). In the same year he participated in the [Great Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy) "Great Debate (astronomy)") with [Harlow Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley "Harlow Shapley") (also called the Shapley–Curtis Debate) on the nature of nebulae and [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy"), and the size of the universe. Curtis advocated the now-accepted view that other galaxies apart from the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") existed.

Curtis also invented a type of film plate comparator in about 1925, allowing 2 plates, each 8×10[in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch "Inch"), to be compared using a set of prisms and placing the plates on stacked and aligned stages rather than next to one another as was the norm, this allowed the body of the device to measure just 60×51[cm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre "Centimetre"). This device is packed in crates and resided at UCO [Lick Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lick_Observatory "Lick Observatory") as of Aug 2011. His article describing the device appears in the _Publications of the Allegheny Observatory_, vol.VIII, no.2.

In 1930 Curtis was appointed director of the University of Michigan observatories, but the shortage of funds following the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") prevented the construction of a large reflector he had designed for the university at [Ann Arbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor "Ann Arbor"). He contributed to develop the McMath–Hulbert private observatory at [Lake Angelus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Angelus "Lake Angelus").

Curtis was an opponent of [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis#cite_note-8)

He died on January 9, 1942.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis#cite_note-obit-2)

The Heber Doust Curtis Memorial Telescope at the [Portage Lake Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage_Lake_Observatory "Portage Lake Observatory") was dedicated in 1950 in Curtis' memory. It no longer operates, but remains as a memorial to Curtis.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis#cite_note-11) A small lunar crater east of the larger crater Picard in [Mare Crisium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Crisium "Mare Crisium") received the official name Curtis.

Ever since Heber Curtis, a University of California astronomer, spied a ray of light shooting out of M87's core in 1918, astronomers have puzzled over the nature and origin of this jet and dozens of others discovered over the years shooting from the cores of active galaxies and quasars.
