Within the European Parliament , its MEPs form the Renew Europe group, together with those of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe party and the French Renaissance party. The President is François Bayrou .

The youth wing of the EDP is the Young Democrats for Europe (YDE).

As of 2025, EDP members participate in the national government of three EU member states : EDP President François Bayrou leading the government in France, Les Engagés in Belgium, which participates in the government of Prime Minister Bart De Wever and, EDP individual member Marian Harkin , who participates in the government of Prime Minister Micheál Martin .

The European Democratic Party is also a member of the European Movement International and was a member of the World Alliance of Democrats until its dissolution in 2012.

History [ edit ] The European Democratic Party was initiated on 16 April 2004 and formally founded on 9 December 2004 in Brussels .

In 2005, the European Democratic Party, together with the United States Democratic Party and the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats , co-founded the Alliance of Democrats international.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] François Bayrou of the Union for French Democracy and later the Democratic Movement (MoDem) and Francesco Rutelli , former leader of the Democracy is Freedom and Alliance for Italy parties, served as the two co-presidents until 2019. Now, François Bayrou serves as the only president.

The EDP was founded in reaction to the rising influence of Eurosceptic parties within European institutions.  It drew pro-European centrist parties from the European People's Party (EPP) group to form a new centrist multinational bloc. Its co-founder François Bayrou described it as a party for people being neither conservative nor socialist." Since the beginning of the 6th European Parliament of 2004–2009, the EDP has formed a joint European parliamentary group with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party called the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) group. This parliamentary group was renamed in 2019 as Renew Europe .

The European Democratic Party is ideologically centrist and federalist .

[ 10 ] Some major members and affiliated parties like EAJ-PNV , Free Voters , MoDem , MCC , Canarian Coalition and the disbanded Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy follow a Christian democratic or liberal conservative line.

At its 20th anniversary congress in Brussels in December 2024, the party adopted a new orange brand identity and logo, taking on the short name ‘Democrats’.

Membership [ edit ] Members are national and regional political parties as well as members of the European Parliament, national and regional parliaments.
