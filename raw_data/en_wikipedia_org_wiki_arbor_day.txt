Origins and history [ edit ] The naturalist Miguel Herrero Uceda at the monument to the first Arbor Day in the world, Villanueva de la Sierra ( Spain ), 1805 First Arbor Day [ edit ] The Spanish village of Mondoñedo held the first documented arbor plantation festival in the world organized by its mayor in 1594. The place remains as Alameda de los Remedios and it is still planted with lime and horse-chestnut trees. A humble granite marker and a bronze plate recall the event. Additionally, the small Spanish village of Villanueva de la Sierra held the first modern Arbor Day, an initiative launched in 1805 by the local priest with the enthusiastic support of the entire population.

While Napoleon was ravaging Europe with his ambition in this village in the Sierra de Gata lived a priest, don Juan Abern Samtrés, which, according to the chronicles, "convinced of the importance of trees for health, hygiene, decoration, nature, environment and customs, decides to plant trees and give a festive air. The festival began on Carnival Tuesday with the ringing of two bells of the church, and the Middle and the Big. After the Mass, and even coated with church ornaments, don Juan, accompanied by clergies, teachers and a large number of neighbours, planted the first tree, a poplar, in the place known as Valley of the Ejido. Tree plantations continued by Arroyada and Fuente de la Mora. Afterwards, there was a feast, and did not miss the dance. The party and plantations lasted three days. He drafted a manifesto in defence of the trees that was sent to surrounding towns to spread the love and respect for nature, and also he advised to make tree plantations in their localities.

— Miguel Herrero Uceda , Arbor Day First American Arbor Day [ edit ] Birdsey Northrop The first American Arbor Day was originated by J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska City, Nebraska , at an annual meeting of the Nebraska State board of agriculture held in Lincoln .

[ 2 ] On April 10, 1872, an estimated one million trees were planted in Nebraska .

[ 3 ] In 1883, the American Forestry Association made Birdsey Northrop of Connecticut the chairman of the committee to campaign for Arbor Day nationwide; Northrop further globalized the idea when he visited Japan in 1895 and delivered his Arbor Day and Village Improvement message. He also brought his enthusiasm for Arbor Day to Australia , Canada , and other countries in Europe .

[ 4 ] McCreight and Theodore Roosevelt [ edit ] Beginning in 1906, Pennsylvania conservationist Major Israel McCreight of DuBois, Pennsylvania , argued that President Theodore Roosevelt 's conservation speeches were limited to businessmen in the lumber industry and recommended a campaign of youth education and a national policy on conservation education.

[ 5 ] McCreight urged Roosevelt to make a public statement to school children about trees and the destruction of American forests.  Conservationist Gifford Pinchot , Chief of the United States Forest Service , embraced McCreight's recommendations and asked the President to speak to the public school children of the United States about conservation. On April 15, 1907, Roosevelt issued an "Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States" [ 6 ] about the importance of trees and that forestry deserves to be taught in U.S. schools. Pinchot wrote McCreight, "we shall all be indebted to you for having made the suggestion." [ 7 ] Around the world [ edit ] Arbor Day in Algeria Australia [ edit ] Arbor Day has been observed in Australia since the first event took place in Adelaide, South Australia on the 20th June 1889.

According to the Ontario Teachers' Manuals "History of Education" (1915), Ross established both Arbour Day and Empire Day—"the former to give the school children an interest in making and keeping the school grounds attractive, and the latter to inspire the children with a spirit of patriotism" (p. 222). This predates the claimed founding of the day by Don Clark of Schomberg, Ontario for his wife Margret Clark in 1906.

From 1929, by decree of the Nationalist government , Arbor Day was changed to March 12 [ zh ] , to commemorate the death of Sun Yat-sen , who had been a major advocate of afforestation in his life.

[ 38 ] Netherlands [ edit ] Since conference and of the Food and Agriculture Organization 's publication World Festival of Trees , and a resolution of the United Nations in 1954: "The Conference, recognising the need of arousing mass consciousness of the aesthetic, physical and economic value of trees, recommends a World Festival of Trees to be celebrated annually in each member country on a date suited to local conditions"; it has been adopted by the Netherlands . In 1957, the National Committee Day of Planting Trees/Foundation of National Festival of Trees ( Nationale Boomplantdag / Nationale Boomfeestdag ) was created.

On the third Wednesday in March each year (near the spring equinox), three-quarters of Dutch schoolchildren aged 10/11 and Dutch celebrities plant trees. Stichting Nationale Boomfeestdag organizes all the activities in the Netherlands for this day. Some municipalities, however, plant the trees around 21 September because of the planting season.

New Zealand [ edit ] New Zealand 's first Arbor Day planting was on 3 July 1890 at Greytown , in the Wairarapa , [ 40 ] The first official celebration was scheduled to take place in Wellington in August 1892, with the planting of pōhutukawa and Norfolk pines along Thorndon Esplanade.

[ 40 ] It was instigated by William Nation .

[ 41 ] Prominent New Zealand botanist Dr Leonard Cockayne worked extensively on native plants throughout New Zealand and wrote many notable botanical texts. As early as the 1920s, he held a vision for school students of New Zealand to be involved in planting native trees and plants in their school grounds. This vision bore fruit and schools in New Zealand have long planted native trees on Arbor Day.

Since 1977, New Zealand has celebrated Arbor Day on 5 June, which is also World Environment Day . Prior to then, Arbor Day was celebrated on 4 August, which is rather late in the year for tree planting in New Zealand, hence the date change.

Many of the Department of Conservation 's Arbor Day activities focus on ecological restoration projects using native plants to restore habitats that have been damaged or destroyed by humans or invasive pests and weeds. There are great restoration projects underway around New Zealand and many organisations including community groups, landowners, conservation organisations, iwi , volunteers, schools, local businesses, nurseries and councils are involved in them. These projects are part of a vision to protect and restore the indigenous biodiversity.

Two trees, [ 56 ] one common and one rare, are highlighted to increase public awareness of indigenous trees, while various "greening" activities are undertaken by schools, businesses and other organizations. For example, the social enterprise Greenpop, which focusses on sustainable urban greening , forest restoration and environmental awareness in Sub-Saharan Africa, [ 57 ] leverages Arbor Day each year to call for tree planting action. During Arbor Month 2019, responding to recent studies that underscore the importance of tree restoration, they launched their new goal of planting 500,000 by 2025.

In Villanueva de la Sierra ( Extremadura ), where the first Arbor Day in the world was held in 1805, it is celebrated, as on that occasion, on Tuesday Carnaval. It is a great day in the local festive calendar.
