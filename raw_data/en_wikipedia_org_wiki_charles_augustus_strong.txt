Strong was a student of Latin and Greek, and edited the school paper. In July 1881 he travelled to Germany , where he studied at the Gütersloh Gymnasium.

[ 1 ] At Harvard, c. 1885 In 1883 Strong returned to America and entered the University of Rochester , where he received an AB in 1884 and an LLD in 1919. Strong graduated from Harvard in 1885 with a second AB. At Harvard he was influenced by philosopher and psychologist, William James , and became friends with George Santayana ; and together they founded the Harvard Philosophical Club.

[ 1 ] From 1885 to 1886 he returned to the Rochester Theological Seminary, which his father still led. In 1886 Strong headed to Berlin with George Santayana on a James Walker Fellowship from Harvard. Strong turned away from a career as a clergyman. In Berlin he studied psychology, philosophy, and physiology with professors Carl Stumpf and Friedrich Paulsen .

[ 3 ] Philosophy [ edit ] In The Origin of Consciousness (1918), Strong advocated a form of panpsychism . The book expanded on William Kingdon Clifford 's mind-stuff theory. Philosopher David Skrbina has noted that "Strong stands out as one of the more consistent and open advocates of panpsychism in the first part of the century." [ 4 ] Personal life [ edit ] On March 22, 1889, Strong married Bessie , the eldest of four daughters of John D. Rockefeller and his wife Laura Celestia "Cettie" Spelman (1839–1915).
