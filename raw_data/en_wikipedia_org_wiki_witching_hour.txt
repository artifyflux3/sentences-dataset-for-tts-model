Witches' Sabbath Medieval portrayal of an unclean spirit In folklore , the witching hour or devil's hour is a time of night that is associated with supernatural events, whereby witches , demons and ghosts are thought to appear and be at their most powerful. Definitions vary, and include the hour immediately after midnight and the time between 3:00 am and 4:00 am. The term now has a widespread colloquial and idiomatic usage that is associated with human physiology and behaviour to more superstitious phenomena, such as luck .

Origins [ edit ] The phrase "witching hour" began at least as early as 1762, when it appeared in Elizabeth Carolina Keene's Miscellaneous Poems . It alludes to Hamlet 's line "Tis now the very witching time of night, When Churchyards yawne, and hell it selfe breakes out Contagion to this world." [ 1 ] Time [ edit ] There are multiple times that can be considered the witching hour. Some claim the time is between 12:00 am and 1:00 am, while others claim there is increased supernatural activity between sunset and sunrise. The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary identifies midnight as the time when witches are supposedly active.

[ 2 ] During the time in which this term originated, many people had sleeping schedules that meant they were awake during the middle of the night.

[ 3 ] Nonetheless, there is psychological literature suggesting that apparitional experiences and sensed presences are most common between the hours of 2:00 am and 4:00 am, corresponding with a 3:00 am peak in the amount of melatonin in the body.

[ 4 ] Physiology [ edit ] A 19th-century version of Füssli 's The Nightmare (1781) The idea of the witching hour may stem from the human sleep cycle and circadian rhythm – the body is going through REM sleep at that time, where the heart rate is slower, body temperature reduced, breathing pattern and blood pressure irregular.

[ 5 ] Sudden awakening from REM sleep could cause agitation , fear and disorientation in an individual.

[ 6 ] During REM sleep, which usually occurs within the witching hour, unpleasant and frightful sleep disturbances such as parasomnias can be experienced, which include nightmares , rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder , night terrors , sleepwalking , homicidal sleepwalking and sleep paralysis .

[ 7 ] During the night and well into the witching hour, symptoms of illnesses and conditions such as lung disease , asthma , flu and common cold seem to exacerbate because there is less cortisol in the blood late at night and especially during sleep.

[ 8 ] As such, the immune system becomes very active and white blood cells fight infections in the body during sleep, and this would thereby worsen the symptoms of fever , nasal congestion , cough, chills and sweating.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Colloquial usage [ edit ] The term may be used colloquially to refer to any period of bad luck, or in which something bad is seen as having a greater likelihood of occurring.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] In investing, it is the last hour of stock trading between 3:00 pm (when the U.S.

bond market closes) and 4:00 pm EST (when the U.S. stock market closes), a period of above-average volatility.

[ 13 ] The term can also refer to a phenomenon where infants or young children cry for an extended period of time during the hour (or two) before their bedtime, becoming irritable and unwieldy with no known cause.

[ 14 ] To reduce gun violence , curfew hours in Washington D.C.

have been in force between 11:00 pm and 12:00 am to lower juvenile gunfire incidents. Influenced by the idea of "witching hour", this occurs between 11:00 pm and 11:59 pm on weekdays and is referred to as the "switching hour".

[ 15 ] Furthermore, violent crimes like rape and sexual assault would peak at midnight on average and DUI police incidents would usually tend to occur at around 2:00 am.
