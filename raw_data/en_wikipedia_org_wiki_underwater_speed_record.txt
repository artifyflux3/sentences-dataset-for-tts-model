As these are typically for military vehicles, most are unconfirmed.

The USS Albacore , with its teardrop hull , is claimed to have reached an underwater speed of 33 knots (61 km/h; 38 mph).

Submarines [ edit ] Established reports and manufacturer's claims indicate that a handful of submarines are capable of speeds exceeding 30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph). In 1960, HMS Explorer S30 achieved an underwater speed of over 30 knots.

[ 1 ] In 1965, the experimental USS Albacore reported a speed of 33 knots (61 km/h; 38 mph).

[ 2 ] The Soviet November-class submarine was found in 1968 to have a speed of  31 knots (57 km/h; 36 mph).

[ 3 ] In response the United States Navy developed the Los Angeles -class submarine, with a reported speed of 30–32 knots (56–59 km/h; 35–37 mph). The Akula (Russian: shark )-class vessel is reportedly capable of travelling submerged at 35 knots (65 km/h; 40 mph). Its predecessor, the Alfa class , could attain short speed bursts of 40–45 knots (74–83 km/h; 46–52 mph) while submerged.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] There are also claims that the Soviet twin-propeller submarine K-222 , with titanium inner and outer hulls , reached 44.7 knots (83 km/h; 51 mph), fully submerged, during sea trials in 1969.

Torpedoes [ edit ] The British Spearfish torpedo , designed to counter high-speed Russian submarines such as the Alfa class, is reputed to reach speeds in excess of 70 knots (130 km/h; 81 mph). The Russian VA-111 Shkval rocket-powered supercavitating torpedo is reportedly capable of speeds over 200 knots (370 km/h; 230 mph).

[ 6 ] The German press reported on an underwater anti-torpedo missile, formerly named Barracuda , allegedly capable of reaching 430 knots (800 km/h).
