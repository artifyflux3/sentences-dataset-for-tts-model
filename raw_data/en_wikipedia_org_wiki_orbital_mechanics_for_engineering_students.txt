Curtis Series Elsevier Aerospace Engineering Series Subject Orbital mechanics Published 2010 (Butterworth-Heinemann) Pages 792 (4th ed.) ISBN 978-0-08-102133-0 (4th ed.) Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students is an aerospace engineering textbook by Howard D. Curtis, in its fourth edition as of 2019 [update] .

[ 1 ] The book provides an introduction to orbital mechanics , while assuming an undergraduate-level background in physics, rigid body dynamics , differential equations , and linear algebra .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Topics covered by the text include a review of kinematics and Newtonian dynamics , the two-body problem , Kepler's laws of planetary motion , orbit determination , orbital maneuvers , relative motion and rendezvous , and interplanetary trajectories.

[ 3 ] The text focuses primarily on orbital mechanics, but also includes material on rigid body dynamics, rocket vehicle dynamics, and attitude control .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Control theory and spacecraft control systems are less thoroughly covered.

[ 3 ] The textbook includes exercises at the end of each chapter, and supplemental material is available online, including MATLAB code for orbital mechanics projects.
