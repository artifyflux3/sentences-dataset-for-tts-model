The compressed fluid region is located to the left of the blue line (the liquid-vapor phase boundary).

The international pictogram for compressed gases.

A compressed fluid (also called a compressed or unsaturated liquid , [ 1 ] subcooled fluid or liquid ) is a fluid under mechanical or thermodynamic conditions that force it to be a liquid .

[ 2 ] At a given pressure , a fluid is a compressed fluid if it is at a temperature lower than the saturation temperature . This is the case, for example, for liquid water at atmospheric pressure and room temperature . In a plot that compares pressure and specific volume (commonly called a p-v diagram ), compressed fluid is the state to the left of the saturation curve.

Conditions that cause a fluid to be compressed include: Specific volume and enthalpy inferior to that of a saturated liquid ; Temperature below the saturation temperature ; Pressure above the saturation pressure .

The term compressed liquid emphasizes that the pressure is greater than the saturation pressure for the given temperature. Compressed liquid properties are relatively independent of pressure.
