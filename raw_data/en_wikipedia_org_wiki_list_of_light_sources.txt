Light sources produce photons from another energy source, such as heat, chemical reactions, or conversion of mass or a different frequency of electromagnetic energy, and include light bulbs and stars like the Sun. Reflectors (such as the moon, cat's eyes , and mirrors) do not actually produce the light that comes from them.

Incandescence [ edit ] Incandescence is the emission of light from a hot body as a result of its temperature.
