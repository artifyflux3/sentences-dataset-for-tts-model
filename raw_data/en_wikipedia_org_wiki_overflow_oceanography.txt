This process is significant in thermohaline circulation , contributing to the global ocean's deep water mass formation.

[ 1 ] Overflows influence global climate by transporting heat and salt , impacting sea levels , and affecting marine ecosystems .

Overflows are driven by differences in water density, usually due to variations in temperature and salinity . A classic example is the Denmark Strait overflow , where cold, dense water from the Nordic Seas flows into the North Atlantic Ocean .
