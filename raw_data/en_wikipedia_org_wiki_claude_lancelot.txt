Lancelot was born in Paris . He participated in the creation of the Petites écoles de Port-Royal in May 1638 (then under the spiritual guidance of Jean Duvergier de Hauranne , the abbot of Saint-Cyran). Lancelot was in charge of the education of the duke of Chevreuse and of the princes of Conti . From 1638 until 1660, Lancelot continued to be associated with the religious community around the Abbey of Port-Royal-des-Champs .

Lancelot authored Nouvelle méthode pour apprendre la langue latine or New Method of Learning Latin (1644); Nouvelle méthode pour apprendre la langue grecque or New Method of Learning Greek (1655); Jardin des racines grecques or Garden of Greek Roots (1657), first published under the name Racines Grecques de Port-Royal ; and, with Antoine Arnauld , Grammaire générale et raisonnée or General and Rational Grammar (1660), otherwise known as the Port-Royal Grammar .

In early 1660, Lancelot was forced to leave the Abbey, and was ultimately exiled to Brittany .

Lancelot died near the Holy-Cross Abbey , in Quimperlé , in 1695.
