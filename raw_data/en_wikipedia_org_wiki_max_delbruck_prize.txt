The Max Delbruck Prize , formerly known as the Biological physics prize , is awarded by the Division of Biological Physics of the American Physical Society , to recognize and encourage outstanding achievement in biological physics research. The prize was established in 1981, and renamed for Max Delbrück in 2006. The award consists of $10,000, an allowance for travel to the meeting where the prize is awarded, and a certificate. It was presented biennially in even-numbered years until 2014, and will be presented annually starting 2015.

[ 1 ] Past winners [ edit ] Source: [ 2 ] 2023: Arup K. Chakraborty [ 3 ] For the leading role in initiating the field of computational immunology, aimed at applying approaches from physical sciences and engineering to unravel the mechanistic underpinnings of the adaptive immune response to pathogens, and to harness this understanding to help design vaccines and therapy.

2022: Terence Tai-Li Hwa [ 4 ] For developing quantitative studies that reveal fundamental constraints on bacterial physiology, and for formulating simple phenomenological theories that quantitatively predict bacterial responses to genetic and environmental changes.

2021: Andrea Cavagna , [ 5 ] Irene Giardina [ 6 ] For the incisive combination of observation, analysis, and theory to elucidate the beautiful statistical physics problems underlying collective behavior in natural flocks and swarms.

2020: James Collins For pioneering contributions at the interface of physics and biology, in particular the establishment of the field of synthetic biology and applications of statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics in biology and medicine.

2019: Jose Nelson Onuchic , Ken A. Dill For independent contributions to a new view of protein folding, from the introduction and exploration of simple models, to detailed confrontations between theory and experiment.

2018: William S. Bialek , Princeton University For the application of general theoretical principles of physics and information theory to help understand and predict how biological systems function across a variety of scales, from molecules and cells, to brains and animal collectives.

2017: Alan S. Perelson [ de ] , Los Alamos National Laboratory For profound contributions to theoretical immunology, which bring insight and save lives.

2016: Stephen R. Quake , Stanford University For invention of large-scale microfluidic integration and its use to gain new insights into protein crystallography, transcription factor binding, and microbial ecology, and for seminal discoveries in single cell and single molecule genome analysis.

2015: Stanislas Leibler , Rockefeller University For establishing the study of genetic network design principles as a foundation for the field of systems biology, and for pioneering work on the robustness of biological systems.
