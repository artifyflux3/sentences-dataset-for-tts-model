Background [ edit ] The Taihang Mountains were formed during the Jurassic .

Brown forest and Cinnamon soils are found here.

[ 2 ] The name of Shanxi Province , meaning "west of the mountains", derives from its location west of the Taihang Mountains.

[ 3 ] The name of Shandong Province (east of the mountains) originally applied to the area east of the Xiao Mountains , but by the Tang dynasty it refers to the area east of the Taihang Mountains; this entity evolved into the modern-day Shandong Province, though the actual border of the province has moved considerably to the east.

[ 4 ] The Hai River system runs through the Taihang Mountains.

[ 2 ] The Red Flag Canal is located on the south edge of the Taihang Mountains.

The Shijiazhuang–Taiyuan high-speed railway crosses under the Taihang Mountains via the Taihang Tunnel , the third longest rail tunnel in China.

Many references to this range in “Fanshen” by William Hinton, with their significance in the Chinese Socialist revolution.
