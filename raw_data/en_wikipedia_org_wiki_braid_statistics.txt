While for fermions (bosons) the corresponding statistics is associated to a phase gain of π π {\displaystyle \pi } ( 2 π π {\displaystyle 2\pi } ) under the exchange of identical particles, a particle with braid statistics leads to a rational fraction of π π {\displaystyle \pi } under such exchange [ 1 ] [ 2 ] or even a non-trivial unitary transformation in the Hilbert space (see non-Abelian anyons ). A similar notion exists using a loop braid group .

Plektons [ edit ] Braid statistics are applicable to theoretical particles such as the two-dimensional anyons and plektons.

A plekton is a hypothetical type of particle that obeys a different style of statistics with respect to the interchange of identical particles . It obeys the causality rules of algebraic quantum field theory , where only observable quantities need to commute at spacelike separation, where anyons  follow the stronger rules of traditional quantum field theory; this leads, for example, to (2+1) D anyons being massless.
