[ 1 ] The recipient is chosen for "outstanding achievement in computational physics research" and it is the highest award given by the APS for work in computational physics.

[ 2 ] The prize is named after Aneesur Rahman (1927–1987), pioneer of the molecular dynamics simulation method. The prize was valued at $5,000 from 2007 to 2014, and is currently valued at $10,000.
