During the Siege of Ryazan , it became one of the first cities in Russia to be besieged and completely razed to the ground. The capital was subsequently moved to Pereyaslavl-Ryazansky ( Russian : Переяславль-Рязанский ), and later renamed to Ryazan by order of Catherine the Great in 1778.

[ 9 ] The city is known for the Ryazan Kremlin , a historic museum; the Pozhalostin Museum , one of the oldest art museums in Russia; the Memorial Museum-Estate of Academician I.P. Pavlov ; and the Ryazan Museum of Long-Range Aviation .

[ 10 ] History [ edit ] Principality of Ryazan [ edit ] See also: Principality of Ryazan Old map of Ryazan (1909) The first written mention of the city, under the name of Pereslavl , dates to 1095. The city became part of the independent Principality of Ryazan , which had existed since 1129, centered on the old city of Ryazan. The first ruler of Ryazan was supposedly Yaroslav Sviatoslavich , Prince of Ryazan and Murom (cities of Kievan Rus' ).

[ citation needed ] Invasion by Mongols [ edit ] Further information: Mongol invasion of Europe In the 12th century, the lands of Ryazan – being located on the border between woodlands and the steppe – suffered numerous invasions from the southern and northern parts of European Russia. Southern invasions were usually carried out by the Cumans ; on the northern side Ryazan was in conflict with Vladimir-Suzdal , who by the end of the 12th century had burnt the capital of Ryazan several times.

In the 13th century, Ryazan was the first Russian city to face Mongolian invasion by the hordes of Batu Khan . On December 21, 1237, after a short siege, it was completely destroyed and never recovered. As a result of the takeover, the seat of the principality was moved about 55 km (34 mi) to the town of Pereslavl-Ryazansky, which subsequently took the name of the destroyed capital. The site of the old capital now carries the name of Staraya Ryazan ( Old Ryazan ), close to Spassk-Ryazansky . Maps of the 16th-18th centuries show Ryazan (Old Ryazan) and Pereslavl-Ryazan together.

Chumakova oversaw the construction of social and cultural amenities, more than 20 urban areas, and hundreds of kilometers of trolleybus, tram and bus routes. Landscaping became a fundamental strategy for the development of the city at that time. A "green" ring of forests, parks, and garden associations surrounded Ryazan, with large parks located in each area of the city, and compositions of flowers and vertical gardening became customary, not only for the main streets, but also for industrial zones and factory buildings. Ryazan repeatedly won recognition among the cities of the Soviet Union for its landscaping.
