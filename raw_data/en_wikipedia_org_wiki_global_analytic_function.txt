Global analytic functions arise naturally in considering the possible analytic continuations of an analytic function, since analytic continuations may have a non-trivial monodromy .  They are one foundation for the theory of Riemann surfaces .

The definition of a global analytic function goes back to Karl Weierstrass .

Definition [ edit ] The following definition may be found in Ahlfors (1979) .  An analytic function in an open set U is called a function element.  Two function elements ( f 1 , U 1 ) and ( f 2 , U 2 ) are said to be analytic continuations of one another if U 1 ∩ U 2 ≠ ∅ and f 1 = f 2 on this intersection.  A chain of analytic continuations is a finite sequence of function elements ( f 1 , U 1 ), …, ( f n , U n ) such that each consecutive pair are analytic continuations of one another; i.e., ( f i +1 , U i +1 ) is an analytic continuation of ( f i , U i ) for i = 1, 2, …, n − 1.

A global analytic function is a family f of function elements such that, for any ( f , U ) and ( g , V ) belonging to f , there is a chain of analytic continuations in f beginning at ( f , U ) and finishing at ( g , V ).

A complete global analytic function is a global analytic function f which contains every analytic continuation of each of its elements.

Sheaf-theoretic definition [ edit ] Using ideas from sheaf theory , the definition can be streamlined.  In these terms, a complete global analytic function is a path-connected sheaf of germs of analytic functions which is maximal in the sense that it is not contained (as an etale space ) within any other path connected sheaf of germs of analytic functions.
