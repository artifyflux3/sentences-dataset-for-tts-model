( June 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A continuous function f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} on the closed interval [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} showing the absolute max (red) and the absolute min (blue).

In real analysis , a branch of mathematics , the extreme value theorem states that if a real-valued function f {\displaystyle f} is continuous on the closed and bounded interval [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} , then f {\displaystyle f} must attain a maximum and a minimum , each at least once.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] That is, there exist numbers c {\displaystyle c} and d {\displaystyle d} in [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} such that: f ( c ) ≤ ≤ f ( x ) ≤ ≤ f ( d ) ∀ ∀ x ∈ ∈ [ a , b ] .

{\displaystyle f(c)\leq f(x)\leq f(d)\quad \forall x\in [a,b].} The extreme value theorem is more specific than the related boundedness theorem , which states merely that a continuous function f {\displaystyle f} on the closed interval [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} is bounded on that interval; that is, there exist real numbers m {\displaystyle m} and M {\displaystyle M} such that: m ≤ ≤ f ( x ) ≤ ≤ M ∀ ∀ x ∈ ∈ [ a , b ] .

{\displaystyle m\leq f(x)\leq M\quad \forall x\in [a,b].} This does not say that M {\displaystyle M} and m {\displaystyle m} are necessarily the maximum and minimum values of f {\displaystyle f} on the interval [ a , b ] , {\displaystyle [a,b],} which is what the extreme value theorem stipulates must also be the case.

The extreme value theorem is used to prove Rolle's theorem .  In a formulation due to Karl Weierstrass , this theorem states that a continuous function from a non-empty compact space to a subset of the real numbers attains a maximum and a minimum.

History [ edit ] The extreme value theorem was originally proven by Bernard Bolzano in the 1830s in a work Function Theory but the work remained unpublished until 1930. Bolzano's proof consisted of showing that a continuous function on a closed interval was bounded, and then showing that the function attained a maximum and a minimum value.  Both proofs involved what is known today as the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem .

[ 3 ] Functions to which the theorem does not apply [ edit ] The following examples show why the function domain must be closed and bounded in order for the theorem to apply.  Each fails to attain a maximum on the given interval.

f ( x ) = x {\displaystyle f(x)=x} defined over [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle [0,\infty )} is not bounded from above.

f ( x ) = x 1 + x {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {x}{1+x}}} defined over [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle [0,\infty )} is bounded from below but does not attain its least upper bound 1 {\displaystyle 1} .

f ( x ) = 1 x {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{x}}} defined over ( 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle (0,1]} is not bounded from above.

f ( x ) = 1 − − x {\displaystyle f(x)=1-x} defined over ( 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle (0,1]} is bounded but never attains its least upper bound 1 {\displaystyle 1} .

Defining f ( 0 ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(0)=0} in the last two examples shows that both theorems require continuity on [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} .

Generalization to metric and topological spaces [ edit ] When moving from the real line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } to metric spaces and general topological spaces , the appropriate generalization of a closed bounded interval is a compact set . A set K {\displaystyle K} is said to be compact if it has the following property: from every collection of open sets U α α {\displaystyle U_{\alpha }} such that ⋃ ⋃ U α α ⊃ ⊃ K {\textstyle \bigcup U_{\alpha }\supset K} , a finite subcollection U α α 1 , … … , U α α n {\displaystyle U_{\alpha _{1}},\ldots ,U_{\alpha _{n}}} can be chosen such that ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n U α α i ⊃ ⊃ K {\textstyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{n}U_{\alpha _{i}}\supset K} . This is usually stated in short as "every open cover of K {\displaystyle K} has a finite subcover". The Heine–Borel theorem asserts that a subset of the real line is compact if and only if it is both closed and bounded.  Correspondingly, a metric space has the Heine–Borel property if every closed and bounded set is also   compact.

The concept of a continuous function can likewise be generalized.  Given topological spaces V , W {\displaystyle V,\ W} , a function f : V → → W {\displaystyle f:V\to W} is said to be continuous if for every open set U ⊂ ⊂ W {\displaystyle U\subset W} , f − − 1 ( U ) ⊂ ⊂ V {\displaystyle f^{-1}(U)\subset V} is also open.  Given these definitions, continuous functions can be shown to preserve compactness: [ 4 ] Theorem — If V , W {\displaystyle V,\ W} are topological spaces, f : V → → W {\displaystyle f:V\to W} is a continuous function, and K ⊂ ⊂ V {\displaystyle K\subset V} is compact, then f ( K ) ⊂ ⊂ W {\displaystyle f(K)\subset W} is also compact.

In particular, if W = R {\displaystyle W=\mathbb {R} } , then this theorem implies that f ( K ) {\displaystyle f(K)} is closed and bounded for any compact set K {\displaystyle K} , which in turn implies that f {\displaystyle f} attains its supremum and infimum on any (nonempty) compact set K {\displaystyle K} .  Thus, we have the following generalization of the extreme value theorem: [ 4 ] Theorem — If K {\displaystyle K} is a nonempty compact set and f : K → → R {\displaystyle f:K\to \mathbb {R} } is a continuous function, then f {\displaystyle f} is bounded and there exist p , q ∈ ∈ K {\displaystyle p,q\in K} such that f ( p ) = sup x ∈ ∈ K f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(p)=\sup _{x\in K}f(x)} and f ( q ) = inf x ∈ ∈ K f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(q)=\inf _{x\in K}f(x)} .

Slightly more generally, this is also true for an upper semicontinuous function. (see compact space#Functions and compact spaces ).

Proving the theorems [ edit ] We look at the proof for the upper bound and the maximum of f {\displaystyle f} . By applying these results to the function − − f {\displaystyle -f} , the existence of the lower bound and the result for the minimum of f {\displaystyle f} follows. Also note that everything in the proof is done within the context of the real numbers .

We first prove the boundedness theorem, which is a step in the proof of the extreme value theorem. The basic steps involved in the proof of the extreme value theorem are: Prove the boundedness theorem.

Find a sequence so that its image converges to the supremum of f {\displaystyle f} .

Show that there exists a subsequence that converges to a point in the domain .

Use continuity to show that the image of the subsequence converges to the supremum.

Proof of the boundedness theorem [ edit ] Boundedness Theorem — If f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is continuous on [ a , b ] , {\displaystyle [a,b],} then it is bounded on [ a , b ] .

{\displaystyle [a,b].} Proof Suppose the function f {\displaystyle f} is not bounded above on the interval [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} . Pick a sequence ( x n ) n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle (x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }} such that x n ∈ ∈ [ a , b ] {\displaystyle x_{n}\in [a,b]} and f ( x n ) > n {\displaystyle f(x_{n})>n} . Because [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} is bounded, the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem implies that there exists a convergent subsequence ( x n k ) k ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle (x_{n_{k}})_{k\in \mathbb {N} }} of ( x n ) {\displaystyle ({x_{n}})} . Denote its limit by x {\displaystyle x} . As [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} is closed, it contains x {\displaystyle x} .  Because f {\displaystyle f} is continuous at x {\displaystyle x} , we know that f ( x n k ) {\displaystyle f(x_{{n}_{k}})} converges to the real number f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} (as f {\displaystyle f} is sequentially continuous at x {\displaystyle x} ). But f ( x n k ) > n k ≥ ≥ k {\displaystyle f(x_{{n}_{k}})>n_{k}\geq k} for every k {\displaystyle k} , which implies that f ( x n k ) {\displaystyle f(x_{{n}_{k}})} diverges to + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } , a contradiction. Therefore, f {\displaystyle f} is bounded above on [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} .

∎ Alternative proof Consider the set B {\displaystyle B} of points p {\displaystyle p} in [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} such that f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is bounded on [ a , p ] {\displaystyle [a,p]} .  We note that a {\displaystyle a} is one such point, for f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is bounded on [ a , a ] {\displaystyle [a,a]} by the value f ( a ) {\displaystyle f(a)} .  If e > a {\displaystyle e>a} is another point, then all points between a {\displaystyle a} and e {\displaystyle e} also belong to B {\displaystyle B} .  In other words B {\displaystyle B} is an interval closed at its left end by a {\displaystyle a} .

Now f {\displaystyle f} is continuous on the right at a {\displaystyle a} , hence there exists δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} such that | f ( x ) − − f ( a ) | < 1 {\displaystyle |f(x)-f(a)|<1} for all x {\displaystyle x} in [ a , a + δ δ ] {\displaystyle [a,a+\delta ]} . Thus f {\displaystyle f} is bounded by f ( a ) − − 1 {\displaystyle f(a)-1} and f ( a ) + 1 {\displaystyle f(a)+1} on the interval [ a , a + δ δ ] {\displaystyle [a,a+\delta ]} so that all these points belong to B {\displaystyle B} .

So far, we know that B {\displaystyle B} is an interval of non-zero length, closed at its left end by a {\displaystyle a} .

Next, B {\displaystyle B} is bounded above by b {\displaystyle b} .  Hence the set B {\displaystyle B} has a supremum in [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} ; let us call it s {\displaystyle s} . From the non-zero length of B {\displaystyle B} we can deduce that s > a {\displaystyle s>a} .

Suppose s < b {\displaystyle s<b} .  Now f {\displaystyle f} is continuous at s {\displaystyle s} , hence there exists δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} such that | f ( x ) − − f ( s ) | < 1 {\displaystyle |f(x)-f(s)|<1} for all x {\displaystyle x} in [ s − − δ δ , s + δ δ ] {\displaystyle [s-\delta ,s+\delta ]} so that f {\displaystyle f} is bounded on this interval.  But it follows from the supremacy of s {\displaystyle s} that there exists a point belonging to B {\displaystyle B} , e {\displaystyle e} say, which is greater than s − − δ δ / 2 {\displaystyle s-\delta /2} .  Thus f {\displaystyle f} is bounded on [ a , e ] {\displaystyle [a,e]} which overlaps [ s − − δ δ , s + δ δ ] {\displaystyle [s-\delta ,s+\delta ]} so that f {\displaystyle f} is bounded on [ a , s + δ δ ] {\displaystyle [a,s+\delta ]} .  This however contradicts the supremacy of s {\displaystyle s} .

We must therefore have s = b {\displaystyle s=b} .  Now f {\displaystyle f} is continuous on the left at s {\displaystyle s} , hence there exists δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} such that | f ( x ) − − f ( s ) | < 1 {\displaystyle |f(x)-f(s)|<1} for all x {\displaystyle x} in [ s − − δ δ , s ] {\displaystyle [s-\delta ,s]} so that f {\displaystyle f} is bounded on this interval.  But it follows from the supremacy of s {\displaystyle s} that there exists a point belonging to B {\displaystyle B} , e {\displaystyle e} say, which is greater than s − − δ δ / 2 {\displaystyle s-\delta /2} .  Thus f {\displaystyle f} is bounded on [ a , e ] {\displaystyle [a,e]} which overlaps [ s − − δ δ , s ] {\displaystyle [s-\delta ,s]} so that f {\displaystyle f} is bounded on [ a , s ] {\displaystyle [a,s]} .

∎ Proofs of the extreme value theorem [ edit ] Proof of the Extreme Value Theorem By the boundedness theorem, f is bounded from above, hence, by the Dedekind-completeness of the real numbers, the least upper bound (supremum) M of f exists. It is necessary to find a point d in [ a , b ] such that M = f ( d ). Let n be a natural number. As M is the least upper bound, M − 1/ n is not an upper bound for f . Therefore, there exists d n in [ a , b ] so that M − 1/ n < f ( d n ). This defines a sequence { d n }. Since M is an upper bound for f , we have M − 1/ n < f ( d n ) ≤ M for all n .  Therefore, the sequence { f ( d n )} converges to M .

The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem tells us that there exists a subsequence { d n k {\displaystyle d_{n_{k}}} }, which converges to some d and, as [ a , b ] is closed, d is in [ a , b ]. Since f is continuous at d , the sequence { f ( d n k {\displaystyle d_{n_{k}}} )} converges to f ( d ). But { f ( d n k )} is a subsequence of { f ( d n )} that converges to M , so M = f ( d ). Therefore, f attains its supremum M at d .

∎ Alternative Proof of the Extreme Value Theorem The set { y ∈ R : y = f ( x ) for some x ∈ [ a , b ]} is a bounded set. Hence, its least upper bound exists by least upper bound property of the real numbers. Let M = sup( f ( x )) on [ a , b ] .  If there is no point x on [ a , b ] so that f ( x ) = M , then f ( x ) < M on [ a , b ].  Therefore, 1/( M − f ( x )) is continuous on [ a , b ].

However, to every positive number ε , there is always some x in [ a , b ] such that M − f ( x ) < ε because M is the least upper bound. Hence, 1/( M − f ( x )) > 1/ ε , which means that 1/( M − f ( x )) is not bounded.  Since every continuous function on [ a , b ] is bounded, this contradicts the conclusion that 1/( M − f ( x )) was continuous on [ a , b ].  Therefore, there must be a point x in [ a , b ] such that f ( x ) = M .

∎ Proof using the hyperreals [ edit ] Proof In the setting of non-standard calculus , let N be an infinite hyperinteger .  The interval [0, 1] has a natural hyperreal extension.  Consider its partition into N subintervals of equal infinitesimal length 1/ N , with partition points x i = i / N as i "runs" from 0 to N .  The function ƒ is also naturally extended to a function ƒ * defined on the hyperreals between 0 and 1.  Note that in the standard setting (when N is finite), a point with the maximal value of ƒ can always be chosen among the N +1 points x i , by induction.  Hence, by the transfer principle , there is a hyperinteger i 0 such that 0 ≤ i 0 ≤ N and f ∗ ∗ ( x i 0 ) ≥ ≥ f ∗ ∗ ( x i ) {\displaystyle f^{*}(x_{i_{0}})\geq f^{*}(x_{i})} for all i = 0, ..., N .  Consider the real point c = s t ( x i 0 ) {\displaystyle c=\mathbf {st} (x_{i_{0}})} where st is the standard part function .  An arbitrary real point x lies in a suitable sub-interval of the partition, namely x ∈ ∈ [ x i , x i + 1 ] {\displaystyle x\in [x_{i},x_{i+1}]} , so that st ( x i ) = x .  Applying st to the inequality f ∗ ∗ ( x i 0 ) ≥ ≥ f ∗ ∗ ( x i ) {\displaystyle f^{*}(x_{i_{0}})\geq f^{*}(x_{i})} , we obtain s t ( f ∗ ∗ ( x i 0 ) ) ≥ ≥ s t ( f ∗ ∗ ( x i ) ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {st} (f^{*}(x_{i_{0}}))\geq \mathbf {st} (f^{*}(x_{i}))} .  By continuity of ƒ we have s t ( f ∗ ∗ ( x i 0 ) ) = f ( s t ( x i 0 ) ) = f ( c ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {st} (f^{*}(x_{i_{0}}))=f(\mathbf {st} (x_{i_{0}}))=f(c)} .

Hence ƒ ( c ) ≥ ƒ ( x ), for all real x , proving c to be a maximum of ƒ .

[ 5 ] ∎ Proof from first principles [ edit ] Statement If f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is continuous on [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} then it attains its supremum on [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} Proof By the Boundedness Theorem, f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is bounded above on [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} and by the completeness property of the real numbers has a supremum in [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} .  Let us call it M {\displaystyle M} , or M [ a , b ] {\displaystyle M[a,b]} .  It is clear that the restriction of f {\displaystyle f} to the subinterval [ a , x ] {\displaystyle [a,x]} where x ≤ ≤ b {\displaystyle x\leq b} has a supremum M [ a , x ] {\displaystyle M[a,x]} which is less than or equal to M {\displaystyle M} , and that M [ a , x ] {\displaystyle M[a,x]} increases from f ( a ) {\displaystyle f(a)} to M {\displaystyle M} as x {\displaystyle x} increases from a {\displaystyle a} to b {\displaystyle b} .

If f ( a ) = M {\displaystyle f(a)=M} then we are done.  Suppose therefore that f ( a ) < M {\displaystyle f(a)<M} and let d = M − − f ( a ) {\displaystyle d=M-f(a)} .   Consider the set L {\displaystyle L} of points x {\displaystyle x} in [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} such that M [ a , x ] < M {\displaystyle M[a,x]<M} .

Clearly a ∈ ∈ L {\displaystyle a\in L} ; moreover if e > a {\displaystyle e>a} is another point in L {\displaystyle L} then all points between a {\displaystyle a} and e {\displaystyle e} also belong to L {\displaystyle L} because M [ a , x ] {\displaystyle M[a,x]} is monotonic increasing.  Hence L {\displaystyle L} is a non-empty interval, closed at its left end by a {\displaystyle a} .

Now f {\displaystyle f} is continuous on the right at a {\displaystyle a} , hence there exists δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} such that | f ( x ) − − f ( a ) | < d / 2 {\displaystyle |f(x)-f(a)|<d/2} for all x {\displaystyle x} in [ a , a + δ δ ] {\displaystyle [a,a+\delta ]} . Thus f {\displaystyle f} is less than M − − d / 2 {\displaystyle M-d/2} on the interval [ a , a + δ δ ] {\displaystyle [a,a+\delta ]} so that all these points belong to L {\displaystyle L} .

Next, L {\displaystyle L} is bounded above by b {\displaystyle b} and has therefore a supremum in [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} :  let us call it s {\displaystyle s} .   We see from the above that s > a {\displaystyle s>a} .  We will show that s {\displaystyle s} is the point we are seeking i.e. the point where f {\displaystyle f} attains its supremum, or in other words f ( s ) = M {\displaystyle f(s)=M} .

Suppose the contrary viz.

f ( s ) < M {\displaystyle f(s)<M} .  Let d = M − − f ( s ) {\displaystyle d=M-f(s)} and consider the following two cases: s < b {\displaystyle s<b} .   As f {\displaystyle f} is continuous  at s {\displaystyle s} , there exists δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} such that | f ( x ) − − f ( s ) | < d / 2 {\displaystyle |f(x)-f(s)|<d/2} for all x {\displaystyle x} in [ s − − δ δ , s + δ δ ] {\displaystyle [s-\delta ,s+\delta ]} .    This means that f {\displaystyle f} is less than M − − d / 2 {\displaystyle M-d/2} on the interval [ s − − δ δ , s + δ δ ] {\displaystyle [s-\delta ,s+\delta ]} .   But it follows from the supremacy of s {\displaystyle s} that there exists a point, e {\displaystyle e} say, belonging to L {\displaystyle L} which is greater than s − − δ δ {\displaystyle s-\delta } .  By the definition of L {\displaystyle L} , M [ a , e ] < M {\displaystyle M[a,e]<M} .  Let d 1 = M − − M [ a , e ] {\displaystyle d_{1}=M-M[a,e]} then for all x {\displaystyle x} in [ a , e ] {\displaystyle [a,e]} , f ( x ) ≤ ≤ M − − d 1 {\displaystyle f(x)\leq M-d_{1}} .  Taking d 2 {\displaystyle d_{2}} to be the minimum of d / 2 {\displaystyle d/2} and d 1 {\displaystyle d_{1}} , we have f ( x ) ≤ ≤ M − − d 2 {\displaystyle f(x)\leq M-d_{2}} for all x {\displaystyle x} in [ a , s + δ δ ] {\displaystyle [a,s+\delta ]} .

Hence M [ a , s + δ δ ] < M {\displaystyle M[a,s+\delta ]<M} so that s + δ δ ∈ ∈ L {\displaystyle s+\delta \in L} .  This however contradicts the supremacy of s {\displaystyle s} and completes the proof.

s = b {\displaystyle s=b} .    As f {\displaystyle f} is continuous on the left at s {\displaystyle s} , there exists δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} such that | f ( x ) − − f ( s ) | < d / 2 {\displaystyle |f(x)-f(s)|<d/2} for all x {\displaystyle x} in [ s − − δ δ , s ] {\displaystyle [s-\delta ,s]} .    This means that f {\displaystyle f} is less than M − − d / 2 {\displaystyle M-d/2} on the interval [ s − − δ δ , s ] {\displaystyle [s-\delta ,s]} .   But it follows from the supremacy of s {\displaystyle s} that there exists a point, e {\displaystyle e} say, belonging to L {\displaystyle L} which is greater than s − − δ δ {\displaystyle s-\delta } .  By the definition of L {\displaystyle L} , M [ a , e ] < M {\displaystyle M[a,e]<M} .  Let d 1 = M − − M [ a , e ] {\displaystyle d_{1}=M-M[a,e]} then for all x {\displaystyle x} in [ a , e ] {\displaystyle [a,e]} , f ( x ) ≤ ≤ M − − d 1 {\displaystyle f(x)\leq M-d_{1}} .  Taking d 2 {\displaystyle d_{2}} to be the minimum of d / 2 {\displaystyle d/2} and d 1 {\displaystyle d_{1}} , we have f ( x ) ≤ ≤ M − − d 2 {\displaystyle f(x)\leq M-d_{2}} for all x {\displaystyle x} in [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} .  This contradicts the supremacy of M {\displaystyle M} and completes the proof.

∎ Extension to semi-continuous functions [ edit ] If the continuity of the function f is weakened to semi-continuity ,
then the corresponding half of the boundedness theorem and the extreme value theorem hold and the values −∞ or +∞, respectively, from the extended real number line can be allowed as possible values.

[ clarification needed ] A function f : [ a , b ] → → [ − − ∞ ∞ , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle f:[a,b]\to [-\infty ,\infty )} is said to be upper semi-continuous if lim sup y → → x f ( y ) ≤ ≤ f ( x ) ∀ ∀ x ∈ ∈ [ a , b ] .

{\displaystyle \limsup _{y\to x}f(y)\leq f(x)\quad \forall x\in [a,b].} Theorem — If a function f : [ a , b ] → [–∞, ∞) is upper semi-continuous, then f is bounded above and attains its supremum.

Proof If f ( x ) = − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle f(x)=-\infty } for all x in [ a , b ], then the supremum is also − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } and the theorem is true. In all other cases, the proof is a slight modification of the proofs given above. In the proof of the boundedness theorem, the  upper semi-continuity of f at x only implies that the limit superior of the subsequence { f ( x n k )} is bounded above by f ( x ) < ∞, but that is enough to obtain the contradiction. In the proof of the extreme value theorem, upper semi-continuity of f at d implies that the limit superior of the subsequence { f ( d n k )} is bounded above by f ( d ), but this suffices to conclude that f ( d ) = M .

∎ Applying this result to − f proves a similar result for the infimums of lower semicontinuous functions. 
A function f : [ a , b ] → → [ − − ∞ ∞ , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle f:[a,b]\to [-\infty ,\infty )} is said to be lower semi-continuous if lim inf y → → x f ( y ) ≥ ≥ f ( x ) ∀ ∀ x ∈ ∈ [ a , b ] .

{\displaystyle \liminf _{y\to x}f(y)\geq f(x)\quad \forall x\in [a,b].} Theorem — If a function f : [ a , b ] → (–∞, ∞] is lower semi-continuous, then f is bounded below and attains its infimum .

A real-valued function is upper as well as lower semi-continuous, if and only if it is continuous in the usual sense. Hence these two theorems imply the boundedness theorem and the extreme value theorem.
