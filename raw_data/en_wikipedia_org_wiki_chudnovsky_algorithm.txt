Published by the Chudnovsky brothers in 1988, [ 1 ] it was used to calculate π to a billion decimal places.

[ 2 ] It was used in the world record calculations of 2.7 trillion digits of π in December 2009, [ 3 ] 10 trillion digits in October 2011, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] 22.4 trillion digits in November 2016, [ 6 ] 31.4 trillion digits in September 2018–January 2019, [ 7 ] 50 trillion digits on January 29, 2020, [ 8 ] 62.8 trillion digits on August 14, 2021, [ 9 ] 100 trillion digits on March 21, 2022, [ 10 ] 105 trillion digits on March 14, 2024, [ 11 ] and 202 trillion digits on June 28, 2024.

[ 12 ] Recently, the record was broken yet again on April 2nd 2025 with 300 trillion digits of pi.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] This was done through the usage of the algorithm on y-cruncher .

Algorithm [ edit ] The algorithm is based on the negated Heegner number d = − − 163 {\displaystyle d=-163} , the j -function j ( 1 + i − − 163 2 ) = − − 640320 3 {\displaystyle j\left({\tfrac {1+i{\sqrt {-163}}}{2}}\right)=-640320^{3}} , and on the following rapidly convergent generalized hypergeometric series : [ 15 ] 1 π π = 12 ∑ ∑ k = 0 ∞ ∞ ( − − 1 ) k ( 6 k ) !

( 545140134 k + 13591409 ) ( 3 k ) !

( k !

) 3 ( 640320 ) 3 k + 3 / 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\pi }}=12\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{k}(6k)!(545140134k+13591409)}{(3k)!(k!)^{3}(640320)^{3k+3/2}}}} This identity is similar to some of Ramanujan 's formulas involving π , [ 15 ] and is an example of a Ramanujan–Sato series .

The time complexity of the algorithm is O ( n ( log ⁡ ⁡ n ) 3 ) {\displaystyle O\left(n(\log n)^{3}\right)} , where n is the number of digits desired.

[ 16 ] Optimizations [ edit ] The optimization technique used for the world record computations is called binary splitting .
