Legality is the state of being consistent with the law , the construct of legal power , or lawfulness in a given jurisdiction .

[ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] Feminist jurisprudence [ edit ] Feminist theories of law define legality a distinct but related concept to the law, consisting of socially-constructed meanings and practices that depend on social forces , such as race, gender, and class.

[ 2 ] Ewick and Sibley define "legality" as "those meanings, sources of authority, and cultural practices that are commonly recognized as legal, although not necessarily approved nor acknowledged by law." [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Legal doctrine [ edit ] In contract law , legality of purpose is required of every enforceable contract. One can not validate or enforce a contract to do activity with unlawful purpose.

It is known in Latin as nulla poena sine lege .

Nulla poena sine lege is a principle of international human rights law and is incorporated into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights . Exceptionally under international law , criminal offences may include violations of "the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations", such as genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , even if such offences are not codified or affirmed in judicial precedent. Following the Nuremberg trials , scholars of jurisprudence have debated whether such exceptions are valid for apparently applying retrospective criminal sanctions in the absence of written law.

Natural-law theorists argue that crimes such as genocide are, and have always been, illegal under natural law.

By jurisdiction [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources .

United States [ edit ] In the United States , laws may not violate the stated provisions of the United States Constitution , which includes a prohibition on retrospective laws.
