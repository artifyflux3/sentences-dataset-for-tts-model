c. 320 BCE [ 1 ] ) of Olynthus was a philosopher of the Megarian school as well as a historian and tragic poet. He was the disciple of Eubulides of Miletus , and the instructor of Antigonus II Gonatas king of Macedonia . He wrote many tragedies, which were well received at the games. He also wrote a very highly esteemed work, On Kingship ( Greek : Περὶ Βασιλείας ), addressed to Antigonus, and a history of his own times. He lived to a great age.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Athenaeus [ 4 ] refers to Euphantus relating a detail about Ptolemy III Euergetes of Egypt , who reigned much later. The discrepancy has been explained variously, by supposing the existence of an Egyptian Euphantus, [ 5 ] or by amending "III" to "I".
