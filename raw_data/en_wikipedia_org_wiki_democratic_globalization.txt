[ 1 ] One of its proponents is the British political thinker David Held . In the last decade, Held published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of global governance that encompasses the entire world. For some, democratic mundialisation (from the French term mondialisation) is a variant of democratic globalisation that emphasizes the need for citizens worldwide to directly elect world leaders and members of global institutions; for others, it is just democratic globalization by another name.

[ 2 ] These proponents state that democratic globalisation's purpose is to: Expand globalisation and make people closer and more united. This expansion should differ from economic globalization and "make people closer, more united and protected" because of a variety of opinions and proposals it is still unclear what this would mean in practice and how it could be realized.

Have it reach all fields of activity and knowledge, including governmental and economic, since the economic one is crucial to develop the well-being of world citizens.

Give world citizens democratic access and a say in those global activities. For example, presidential voting for United Nations Secretary-General by citizens and direct election of members of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly .

Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens via their participation in world democratic institutions. Some proponents in the anti-globalization movement do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, George Monbiot , normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term global justice movement ), has proposed in his work Age of Consent similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies and a form of world government .

( September 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Democratic globalization supports the extension of political democratization to economic and financial globalization . It is based upon an idea that free international transactions benefit the global society as a whole. They believe in financially
open economies, where the government and central bank must be transparent in order to retain the confidence of the markets, since transparency spells doom for autocratic regimes . They promote democracy that makes leaders more accountable to the citizenry through the removal of restrictions on such transactions.

( September 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The democratic globalization movement started to get public attention when New York Times reported its demonstration to contest a World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle, Washington, November 1999. This gathering was to criticize unfair trade and undemocratic globalization of the WTO, World Bank , World Economic Forum (WEF), the International Monetary Fund . Its primary tactics were public rallies, street theater and civil disobedience .

Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by world citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.

( September 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens , via their participation in world democratic institutions and direct vote for world presidents (see presidentialism ).

Some supporters of the " anti-globalization movement " do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, George Monbiot , normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term Global Justice Movement ) in his work Age of Consent has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies by citizens, and suggests a form of " federal world government ".

They propose the creation of world services for citizens, like world civil protection and prevention (from natural hazards ) services.

Proponents [ edit ] The concept of democratic globalization has supporters from all fields. Many of the campaigns and initiatives for global democracy, such as the UNPA campaign, list quotes by and names of their supporters on their websites.

[ 3 ] Academics [ edit ] Some of the most prolific proponents are the British political thinker David Held and the Italian political theorist Daniele Archibugi .  In the last decade they published several books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of global governance that encapsulates the entire planet.

Richard Falk has developed the idea from an international law perspective, Ulrich Beck from a sociological approach and JÃ¼rgen Habermas has elaborate the normative principles.

Politicians [ edit ] In 2003, Bob Brown, the leader of the Australian Green Party, has tabled a move for global democracy in the Australian Senate: "I move: That the Senate supports global democracy based on the principle of 'one person, one vote, one value'; and supports the vision of a global parliament which empowers all the world's people equally to decide on matters of international significance." [ 4 ] Graham Watson (Former member of the European Parliament and former leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe ) and Jo Leinen (Member of the European Parliament) are strong supporter of global democracy. They were among those presenting the "Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy" on February 23, 2010, at an event inside the European Parliament.

[ 5 ] The appeals of the campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly has already been endorsed by more than 700 parliamentarians from more than 90 countries.
