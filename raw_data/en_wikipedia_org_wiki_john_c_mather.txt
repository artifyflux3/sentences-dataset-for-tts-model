John Cromwell Mather Mather in 2015 Born ( 1946-08-07 ) August 7, 1946 (age 79) Roanoke, Virginia , U.S.

Alma mater Swarthmore College ( BS ) University of California, Berkeley ( PhD ) Known for Cosmic microwave background radiation studies Awards Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics (1993) Nobel Prize in Physics (2006) Scientific career Fields Astrophysics , cosmology Institutions NASA University of Maryland Columbia University Thesis Far Infrared Spectrometry of the Cosmic Background Radiation (1974) Doctoral advisor Paul L. Richards Signature John Cromwell Mather (born August 7, 1946) is an American astrophysicist , cosmologist and Nobel Prize in Physics laureate for his work on the Cosmic Background Explorer Satellite (COBE) with George Smoot .

This work helped cement the Big Bang theory of the universe. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the COBE-project can also be regarded as the starting point for cosmology as a precision science." [ 1 ] Mather is a senior astrophysicist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland and adjunct professor of physics at the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences . In 2007, Time magazine listed Mather among the 100 Most Influential People in The World. In October 2012, he was listed again by Time magazine in a special issue on New Space Discoveries as one of the 25 most influential people in space.

Mather is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy 's Office of Science , the National Science Foundation , and the National Institute of Standards and Technology .

[ 2 ] Mather served as the senior project scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) from 1995 until 2023, when he was succeeded by Jane Rigby .

[ 3 ] In 2014, Mather delivered an address on the James Webb Space Telescope at the second Starmus Festival in the Canary Islands.
