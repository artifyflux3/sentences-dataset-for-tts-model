Measures of goodness of fit typically summarize the discrepancy between observed values and the values expected under the model in question. Such measures can be used in statistical hypothesis testing , e.g. to test for normality of residuals , to test whether two samples are drawn from identical distributions  (see Kolmogorov–Smirnov test), or whether outcome frequencies follow a specified distribution (see Pearson's chi-square test ).  In the analysis of variance , one of the components into which the variance is partitioned may be a lack-of-fit sum of squares .

Fit of distributions [ edit ] In assessing whether a given distribution is suited to a data-set, the following tests and their underlying measures of fit can be used: Bayesian information criterion Kolmogorov–Smirnov test Cramér–von Mises criterion Anderson–Darling test Berk-Jones tests [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Shapiro–Wilk test Chi-squared test Akaike information criterion Hosmer–Lemeshow test Kuiper's test Kernelized Stein discrepancy [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Zhang's Z K , Z C and Z A tests [ 5 ] Moran test Density Based Empirical Likelihood Ratio tests [ 6 ] Regression analysis [ edit ] In regression analysis , more specifically regression validation , the following topics relate to goodness of fit: Coefficient of determination (the R-squared measure of goodness of fit); Lack-of-fit sum of squares ; Mallows's Cp criterion Prediction error Reduced chi-square Categorical data [ edit ] The following are examples that arise in the context of categorical data .

Pearson's chi-square test [ edit ] Pearson's chi-square test uses a measure of goodness of fit which is the sum of differences between observed and expected outcome frequencies (that is, counts of observations), each squared and divided by the expectation: χ χ 2 = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ( O i − − E i ) E i 2 {\displaystyle \chi ^{2}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{{\frac {(O_{i}-E_{i})}{E_{i}}}^{2}}} where: O i = an observed count for bin i E i = an expected count for bin i , asserted by the null hypothesis .

The expected frequency is calculated by: E i = ( F ( Y u ) − − F ( Y l ) ) N {\displaystyle E_{i}\,=\,{\bigg (}F(Y_{u})\,-\,F(Y_{l}){\bigg )}\,N} where: F = the cumulative distribution function for the probability distribution being tested.

Y u = the upper limit for bin i , Y l = the lower limit for bin i , and N = the sample size The resulting value can be compared with a chi-square distribution to determine the goodness of fit. The chi-square distribution has ( k − c ) degrees of freedom , where k is the number of non-empty bins and c is the number of estimated parameters (including location and scale parameters and shape parameters) for the distribution plus one. For example, for a 3-parameter Weibull distribution , c = 4.

Binomial case [ edit ] Further information: Binomial test A binomial experiment is a sequence of independent trials in which the trials can result in one of two outcomes, success or failure.  There are n trials each with probability of success, denoted by p .  Provided that np i ≫ 1 for every i (where i = 1, 2, ..., k ), then χ χ 2 = ∑ ∑ i = 1 k ( N i − − n p i ) 2 n p i = ∑ ∑ a l l b i n s ( O − − E ) 2 E .

{\displaystyle \chi ^{2}=\sum _{i=1}^{k}{\frac {(N_{i}-np_{i})^{2}}{np_{i}}}=\sum _{\mathrm {all\ bins} }^{}{\frac {(\mathrm {O} -\mathrm {E} )^{2}}{\mathrm {E} }}.} This has approximately a chi-square distribution with k − 1 degrees of freedom.  The fact that there are k − 1 degrees of freedom is a consequence of the restriction ∑ ∑ N i = n {\textstyle \sum N_{i}=n} .  We know there are k observed bin counts, however, once any k − 1 are known, the remaining one is uniquely determined.  Basically, one can say, there are only k − 1 freely determined binn counts, thus k − 1 degrees of freedom.

G -test [ edit ] G -tests are likelihood-ratio tests of statistical significance that are increasingly being used in situations where Pearson's chi-square tests were previously recommended.

[ 7 ] The general formula for G is G = 2 ∑ ∑ i O i ⋅ ⋅ ln ⁡ ⁡ ( O i E i ) , {\displaystyle G=2\sum _{i}{O_{i}\cdot \ln \left({\frac {O_{i}}{E_{i}}}\right)},} where O i {\textstyle O_{i}} and E i {\textstyle E_{i}} are the same as for the chi-square test, ln {\textstyle \ln } denotes the natural logarithm , and the sum is taken over all non-empty bins. Furthermore, the total observed count should be equal to the total expected count: ∑ ∑ i O i = ∑ ∑ i E i = N {\displaystyle \sum _{i}O_{i}=\sum _{i}E_{i}=N} where N {\textstyle N} is the total number of observations.

G -tests have been recommended at least since the 1981 edition of the popular statistics textbook by Robert R. Sokal and F. James Rohlf .
