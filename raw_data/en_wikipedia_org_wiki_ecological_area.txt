[ 2 ] Like sanctuary areas , most ecological areas were set aside by the now defunct New Zealand Forest Service in the 1970s and 1980s in response to activism by the conservationist movement .

[ 1 ] Historically, ecological areas have mostly been in Southland and the West Coast of the South Island , and the Bay of Plenty Region of the North Island .
