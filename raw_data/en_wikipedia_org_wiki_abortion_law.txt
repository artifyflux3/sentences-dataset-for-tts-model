Abortion laws vary widely among countries and territories, and have changed over time. Such laws range from abortion being freely available on request, to regulation or restrictions of various kinds, to outright prohibition in all circumstances. Many countries and territories that allow abortion have gestational limits for the procedure depending on the reason; with the majority being up to 12 weeks for abortion on request, up to 24 weeks for rape , incest , or socioeconomic reasons , and more for fetal impairment or risk to the woman's health or life . As of 2025, countries that legally allow abortion on request or for socioeconomic reasons comprise about 60% of the world's population. In 2024, France became the first country to explicitly protect abortion rights in its constitution , [ 1 ] while Yugoslavia implicitly inscribed abortion rights in its constitution in 1974.

[ 2 ] Abortion continues to be a controversial subject in many societies on religious , moral , ethical, practical, and political grounds. Though it has been banned and otherwise limited by law in many jurisdictions, abortions continue to be common in many areas, even where they are illegal. According to a 2007 study conducted by the Guttmacher Institute and the World Health Organization , abortion rates are similar in countries where the procedure is legal and in countries where it is not, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] due to unavailability of modern contraceptives in areas where abortion is illegal.

[ 5 ] Also according to the study, the number of abortions worldwide is declining due to increased access to contraception.

The earliest known records of abortion techniques and general reproductive regulation date as far back as 2700 BC in China , and 1550 BC in Egypt .

[ 6 ] Early texts contain little mention of abortion or abortion law. When it does appear, it is entailed in concerns about male property rights , preservation of social order, and the duty to produce fit citizens for the state or community. The harshest penalties were generally reserved for a woman who procured an abortion against her husband's wishes, and for slaves who produced abortion in a woman of high status. Religious texts often contained severe condemnations of abortion, recommending penance but seldom enforcing secular punishment. As a matter of common law in England and the United States , abortion was illegal anytime after quickening —when the movements of the fetus could first be felt by the woman. Under the born alive rule , the fetus was not considered a "reasonable being" in rerum natura ; and abortion was not treated as murder in English law .

In the 19th century, many Western countries began to codify abortion laws or place further restrictions on the practice.

Anti-abortion movements were led by a combination of groups opposed to abortion on moral grounds, and by medical professionals who were concerned about the danger presented by the procedure and the regular involvement of non-medical personnel in performing abortions. Nevertheless, it became clear that illegal abortions continued to take place in large numbers even where abortions were rigorously restricted. It was difficult to obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute the women and abortion doctors, and judges and juries were often reluctant to convict. For example, Henry Morgentaler , a Canadian pro-choice advocate, was never convicted by a jury. He was acquitted by a jury in the 1973 court case, but the acquittal was overturned by five judges on the Quebec Court of Appeal in 1974. He went to prison, appealed, and was again acquitted. In total, he served 10 months, suffering a heart attack while in solitary confinement . Many were also outraged at the invasion of privacy and the medical problems resulting from abortions taking place illegally in medically dangerous circumstances. Political movements soon coalesced around the legalization of abortion and liberalization of existing laws.

By the first half of the 20th century, many countries had begun to liberalize abortion laws, at least when performed to protect the woman's life and in some cases on the woman's request. Under Vladimir Lenin , the Soviet Union became the first modern state in legalizing abortions on request—the law was first introduced in the Russian SFSR in 1920, in the Ukrainian SSR in July 1921, and then in the whole country.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The Bolsheviks saw abortion as a social evil created by the capitalist system, which left women without the economic means to raise children, forcing them to perform abortions. The Soviet state initially preserved the tsarist ban on abortion, which treated the practice as premeditated murder . However, abortion had been practiced by Russian women for decades and its incidence skyrocketed further as a result of the Russian Civil War , which had left the country economically devastated and made it extremely difficult for many people to have children. The Soviet state recognized that banning abortion would not stop the practice because women would continue using the services of private abortionists. In rural areas, these were often old women who had no medical training, which made their services very dangerous to women's health. In November 1920, the Soviet government legalized abortion in state hospitals. The state considered abortion as a temporary necessary evil, which would disappear in the future communist society, which would be able to provide for all the children conceived.

[ 9 ] [ page needed ] In 1936, Joseph Stalin placed prohibitions on abortions, which restricted them to medically recommended cases only, in order to increase population growth after the enormous loss of life in World War I and the Russian Civil War .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 8 ] In the 1930s, several countries ( Poland , Turkey , Denmark , Sweden , Iceland , Mexico ) legalized abortion in some special cases ( pregnancy from rape , threat to mother's health, fetal malformation). In Japan , abortion was legalized in 1948 by the Eugenic Protection Law, [ 12 ] amended in May 1949 to allow abortions for economic reasons.

[ 13 ] Abortion was legalized in 1952 in Yugoslavia (on a limited basis [ which?

] ), and again in 1955 in the Soviet Union on request. Some Soviet allies (Poland, Hungary , Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , Romania ) legalized abortion in the late 1950s under pressure from the Soviets.

[ how?

] [ 14 ] [ additional citation(s) needed ] In the United Kingdom , the Abortion Act of 1967 clarified and prescribed abortions as legal up to 28 weeks (later reduced to 24 weeks). Other countries soon followed, including Canada (1969), the United States (1973 in most states, pursuant to Roe v. Wade —the U.S. Supreme Court decision which legalized abortion nationwide), Tunisia and Denmark (1973), Austria (1974), France and Sweden (1975), New Zealand (1977), Italy (1978), the Netherlands (1984), and Belgium (1990). However, these countries vary greatly in the circumstances under which abortion was to be permitted. In 1975, the West German Supreme Court struck down a law legalizing abortion, holding that they contradict the constitution 's human rights guarantees. In 1976, a law was adopted which enabled abortions up to 12 weeks. After Germany's reunification , despite the legal status of abortion in former East Germany , a compromise was reached which deemed most abortions up to 12 weeks legal, but this law was struck down by the Federal Constitutional Court and amended to only remove the punishment in such cases, without any statement to legality. In jurisdictions governed under sharia law , abortion after the 120th day from conception (19 weeks from LMP ) is illegal, especially for those who follow the recommendations of the Hanafi legal school, while most jurists of the Maliki legal school "believe that ensoulment occurs at the moment of conception , and they tend to forbid abortion at any point [similar to the Roman Catholic Church]. The other schools hold intermediate positions. ... The penalty prescribed for an illegal abortion varies according to particular circumstances involved. According to sharia, it should be limited to a fine that is paid to the father or heirs of the fetus." [ 15 ] Timeline of abortion on request See also: Timeline of reproductive rights legislation The table below lists in chronological order the United Nations member states that have legalized abortion on request in at least some initial part of the pregnancy, or that have fully decriminalized abortion. As of 2025, 67 countries have legalized or decriminalized abortion on request.

Notes Where a country has legalized abortion on request, prohibited it, and legalized it again (e.g., former Soviet Union , Romania ), only the later year is included. Countries that result from the merger of states where abortion on request was legal at the moment of unification show the year when it became legal across the whole national territory (e.g., Germany , Vietnam ). Similarly, countries where not all subnational jurisdictions have legalized abortion on request are not included, leading to the exclusion of Australia , Mexico , and the United Kingdom . Countries where abortion on request was once legalized nationwide but has since been prohibited in at least part of the country, such as the United States and Poland , are also excluded. Countries are counted even if they were not yet independent at the time. The year refers to when the relevant law or judicial decision came into force , which may be different from the year when it was approved.

The Nuremberg Military Tribunal decided the case of United States v Greifelt and Others (1948) on the basis that abortion was a crime within its jurisdiction according to the law defining crimes against humanity and thus within its definition of murder and extermination.

[ 37 ] The Catholic Church remains highly influential in Latin America , and opposes the legalisation of abortion.

[ 38 ] The American Convention on Human Rights , which in 2013 had 23 Latin American parties, declares human life as commencing with conception. In Latin America, abortion on request is only legal in Cuba (1965), Uruguay (2012), [ 39 ] Argentina (2021), [ 36 ] Colombia (2022) [ 40 ] and in parts of Mexico .

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] Abortions are completely banned in the Dominican Republic , El Salvador , Honduras and Nicaragua , and only allowed in certain restricted circumstances in most other Latin American nations.

[ 38 ] In the 2010 case of A, B and C v Ireland , the European Court of Human Rights found that the European Convention on Human Rights did not include a right to an abortion.

In 2005, the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UN HRC) ordered Peru to compensate a woman (known as K.L.) for denying her a medically indicated abortion ; this was the first time a United Nations Committee had held any country accountable for not ensuring access to safe, legal abortion, and the first time the committee affirmed that abortion is a human right.

[ 43 ] K.L. received the compensation in 2016.

[ 43 ] In the 2016 case of Mellet v Ireland , the UN HRC found Ireland's abortion laws violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights because Irish law banned abortion in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities.

National laws While abortions are legal at least under certain conditions in almost all countries, these conditions vary widely. According to a United Nations (UN) report with data gathered up to 2019, [ 44 ] abortion is allowed in 98% of countries in order to save a woman's life. Other commonly accepted reasons are preserving physical (72%) or mental health (69%), in cases of rape or incest (61%), and in cases of fetal impairment (61%). Performing an abortion because of economic or social reasons is accepted in 37% of countries. Performing abortion only on the basis of a woman's request is allowed in 34% of countries, including in Canada, most European countries and China.

[ 44 ] The exact scope of each legal ground also varies. For example, the laws of some countries cite health risks and fetal impairment as general grounds for abortion and allow a broad interpretation of such terms in practice, while other countries restrict them to a specific list of medical conditions or subcategories. Many countries that allow abortion have gestational limits for the procedure depending on the reason; with the majority being up to 12 weeks for abortion on request, up to 24 weeks for social, economic, rape, or incest reasons, and more for fetal impairment or threats to the woman's health or life.

[ 44 ] : 26 In some countries, additional procedures must be followed before the abortion can be carried out even if the basic grounds for it are met. How strictly all of the procedures dictated in the legislation are followed in practice is another matter. For example, in the United Kingdom, a Care Quality Commission 's report in 2012 found that several NHS clinics were circumventing the law, using forms pre-signed by one doctor, thus allowing abortions to patients who only met with one doctor.

This color-coded map illustrates the current legal status of elective-specific abortion procedures in each of the individual states, U.S. territories, and federal district.

[ fv ] State supreme courts and other high courts may mandate that abortions either are able or are not able to be performed, even if law allows or does not allow it. A colored border indicates a more stringent restriction or ban that is blocked by legal injunction.

Countries with more restrictive laws Supporter of legalized abortion at a rally in Paraná, Argentina . Argentina had restrictive laws until 2021.

According to a report by Women on Waves , [ better source needed ] approximately 25% of the world's population [ as of?

] lives in countries with "highly restrictive abortion laws"—that is, laws which either completely ban abortion, or allow it only to save the mother's life . This category includes several countries in Latin America , Africa , Asia and Oceania , as well as Andorra and Malta in Europe .

[ 568 ] The Center for Reproductive Rights report that "[t]he inability to access safe and legal abortion care impacts 700 million women of reproductive age." [ 569 ] Some of the countries of Central America , notably El Salvador , have also come to international attention due to very forceful enforcement of the laws, including the incarceration of a gang-rape victim for homicide when she gave birth to a stillborn son and was accused of attempting an illegal abortion.

[ 570 ] [ 571 ] [ 572 ] El Salvador has some of the strictest abortion laws of any country. Abortion under all circumstances, including rape, incest, and risk to the mother's health, is illegal. Women can be criminalized and penalized to up to 40 years in prison after being found guilty of an abortion. El Salvador's abortion laws are so severe that miscarriages and stillbirths can sometimes be enough for conviction. The Inter-American Court has already ruled that El Salvador was responsible for the death of Manuela, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2008 for aggravated homicide after suffering an obstetric emergency that resulted in her losing her pregnancy.

[ 573 ] Beginning of pregnancy controversy Main article: Beginning of pregnancy controversy Controversy over the beginning of pregnancy occurs in different contexts, particularly in a legal context, and is particularly discussed within the abortion debate from the point of measuring the gestational age of the pregnancy. Pregnancy can be measured from a number of convenient points, including the day of last menstruation , ovulation , fertilization , implantation and chemical detection. A common medical way to calculate gestational age is to measure pregnancy from the first day of the last menstrual cycle.

[ fz ] However, not all legal systems use this measure for the purpose of abortion law; for example countries such as Belgium , France , and Luxembourg use the term "pregnancy" in the abortion law to refer to the time elapsed from the sexual act that led to conception , which is presumed to be 2 weeks after the end of the last menstrual period.

[ ga ] Exceptions in abortion law Exceptions in abortion laws occur either in countries where abortion is as a general rule illegal or in countries that have abortion on request with gestational limits. For example, if a country allows abortion on request until 12 weeks, it may create exceptions to this general gestation limit for later abortions in specific circumstances.

[ 579 ] There are a few exceptions commonly found in abortion laws. Legal domains which do not have abortion on demand will often allow it when the health of the mother is at stake. "Health of the mother" may mean something different in different areas: for example, prior to December 2018, Ireland allowed abortion only to save the mother's life, whereas abortion opponents in the United States argue health exceptions are used so broadly as to render a ban essentially meaningless.

[ 580 ] Laws allowing abortion in cases of rape or incest often differ. For example, before Roe v. Wade , thirteen U.S. states allowed abortion in the case of either rape or incest, but only Mississippi permitted abortion of pregnancies due to rape, and no state permitted it for just incest.

[ 581 ] Many [ vague ] countries allow abortion only through the first or second trimester , and some may allow abortion in cases of fetal defects, e.g., Down syndrome , or where the pregnancy is the result of a sexual crime .

Other related laws Main article: Legal protection of access to abortion Laws in some countries with liberal abortion laws protect access to abortion services. Such legislation often seeks to guard abortion clinics against obstruction , vandalism , picketing , and other actions, or to protect patients and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment.
Other laws create a perimeter around a facility, known variously as a "buffer zone", "bubble zone", or "access zone", where demonstrations opposing abortion are not permitted. Protests and other displays are restricted to a certain distance from the building, which varies depending on the law. Similar zones have also been created to protect the homes of abortion providers and clinic staff. Bubble zone laws are divided into "fixed" and "floating" categories. Fixed bubble zone laws apply to the static area around the facility itself, and floating laws to objects in transit, such as people or cars .

[ 582 ] Because of conflicts between anti-abortion activists on one side and women seeking abortion and medical staff who provides abortion on the other side, some laws are quite strict: in South Africa for instance, any person who prevents the lawful termination of a pregnancy or obstructs access to a facility for the termination of a pregnancy faces up to 10 years in prison (section 10.1 (c) of the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act [ 583 ] ).

On 3 November 2020, an association of 20 Kenyan charities urged the government of Kenya to withdraw from the Geneva Consensus Declaration (GCD), a US-led international accord that sought to limit access to abortion for girls and women around the world. GCD was signed by 33 nations, on 22 October 2020.

[ 326 ] ^ The law prohibits abortion done "unlawfully" without defining it, and it explicitly permits abortion to preserve the woman's life.

[ 329 ] An opinion of the State Solicitor in 1982, based on court decisions on identical laws in the former parent country, considered that preservation of the woman's health was also a legal ground for abortion.

[ 330 ] [ 331 ] However, in 2018, in the case of a woman who had aborted at four months of pregnancy due to risk to health, the Supreme Court acquitted her because she had been wrongly charged for the crime of killing an unborn child, which only applies shortly before birth (section 312), but ruled that she should have still been charged for the crime of abortion (section 225).

[ 332 ] ^ The law prohibits abortion without explicitly mentioning any exception, [ 335 ] but in 2014 the Supreme Court ruled that indirect abortion done to save the woman's life was permitted under the principle of double effect .

[ 366 ] One of these laws prohibited abortion done "unlawfully" without defining it.

[ 367 ] A judicial decision in England in 1938 clarified that this law always implicitly allowed abortion at least to save the woman's life, and the decision allowed it also to preserve her health.

[ 368 ] It is unclear whether Sierra Leone applies only the original legal principle or also the judicial decision.

[ 369 ] [ 370 ] In 2015 the parliament of Sierra Leone passed a law allowing abortion on request but it was not signed by the president so it did not come into force .

[ 382 ] On 11 April 2019, the Constitutional Court ruled that the abortion restrictions were unconstitutional, giving the legislature until the end of 2020 to amend the laws to allow abortion on request with some gestational limit. In October 2020 the government proposed a limit of 14 weeks for abortion on request and 24 weeks for certain other cases, but the legislature did not approve this or any other proposal on the subject before the end of the year, so the abortion laws became automatically invalid on 1 January 2021.

[ 510 ] [ 511 ] [ 512 ] ^ The law prohibits abortion in case of rape within marriage or under age 18, [ 517 ] but it is invalidated by judicial decision.

[ 518 ] ^ a b The 2014 Guidelines for Comprehensive Abortion Care says "In Zimbabwe termination of pregnancy may be permitted for HIV-positive women if they choose to do so." [ 519 ] ^ a b c d e f g This ground is not explicitly mentioned in the law, but the identical text in the law of the parent country is considered to include this ground in a ground for preserving physical or mental health.

[ 422 ] [ 423 ] [ 424 ] ^ a b c This ground is not explicitly mentioned in the law but it is accepted as a general legal principle .

[ 61 ] ^ The parliament has proposed a law allowing abortion also in case of risk to health, rape and fetal impairment, [ 528 ] but it has not yet been approved.

[ 529 ] ^ This ground is not explicitly mentioned in the law, but it is established by a judicial decision in the parent country. A UN source states this it in unclear whether this judicial precedent also applies to the Cook Islands, but it lists this ground as permitted there.

[ 530 ] ^ a b c d e Although illegal, the government does not prosecute abortions performed under rules similar to other countries, including on request.

[ 532 ] ^ Permitted up to 16 weeks of gestation if medical circumstances make the woman unfit to care for her child.

[ 534 ] ^ This ground is not explicitly mentioned in the law but it is considered to be included in the ground for preserving physical or mental health.

[ 535 ] [ 536 ] ^ a b c d e Although the law permits abortions on request, no medical providers in the territory perform them except to save the woman's life.

[ 540 ] [ 541 ] ^ a b c d e f In Alderney and Sark , this ground is not explicitly mentioned in the law.

[ 542 ] A judicial decision on an identical law in the parent country clarified that the law always implicitly allowed abortion at least to save the woman's life, and the decision allowed it also to preserve her health.

[ 368 ] It is unclear whether Alderney and Sark apply only the original legal principle or also the judicial decision.

^ a b c Abortion for this ground is permitted in the jurisdiction of Guernsey , but not in Alderney or Sark .

[ 542 ] [ 543 ] ^ a b c d Although not allowed by Alderney law, abortions are provided in Alderney under the same conditions as in Guernsey, as health services in Alderney operate under Guernsey law.

[ 544 ] To resolve the legal contradiction, in 2022 the States of Alderney passed an abortion law identical to the one in Guernsey, and it awaits a regulation to establish the effective date.

[ 545 ] ^ a b A law enacted by New Zealand for Niue in 1966 prohibited abortion done "unlawfully", without defining it, [ 549 ] but a judicial decision applicable in New Zealand allowed abortion in case of risk to the woman's life or health, and a UN source states this judicial precedent probably applies to Niue as well.

[ 550 ] In 2007, New Zealand repealed the sections of law that prohibited abortion in Niue, [ 551 ] but they remain in force in Niue [ 552 ] as legislation enacted by New Zealand after 1974 does not apply to Niue without its consent.

[ 553 ] ^ a b c d e f The territory's constitution prohibits abortion "except as provided by law", and the territory has no law about the subject.

[ 554 ] A law from the predecessor of the territory prohibited abortion done "unlawfully" without defining it, and although predecessor laws remain in force in the territory unless modified, a judicial decision ruled this abortion law invalid for being too vague.

[ 555 ] As a result, although abortion remains prohibited in principle by the constitution, abortion providers cannot be prosecuted for it as there is no law specifying a penalty. Still, in practice, authorized medical providers in the territory perform abortions only to save the woman's life and possibly in case of rape.

[ 556 ] In 1995, an opinion issued by the territory's attorney general concluded that U.S. judicial decisions allowing abortion on request also applied to the territory, but these decisions were overturned in 2022 .

[ 554 ] ^ Applies English law in force in 2010 unless locally modified.

[ 557 ] ^ a b c d The penal code prohibits abortion except in case of risk to the woman's life or health.

[ 558 ] In 1980, a decision by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico expanded the health criteria to also include mental health, including emotional, psychological, family and age aspects, with no gestational limit. However, the decision still maintained the prohibition on abortion if done without any therapeutic consideration.

[ 559 ] [ 560 ] ^ Applies English law in force on 1 January 2006 unless locally modified, in each part of the territory.

[ 561 ] Tristan da Cunha explicitly applies the abortion law of the United Kingdom with minor modifications.

[ 562 ] ^ a b c d e Although illegal, the government does not prosecute abortions performed under rules similar to other countries, including on request.

[ 61 ] ^ a b This ground is not explicitly mentioned in the law. The judicial handbook says that abortion is permitted for medical reasons but is unclear whether it means only to save the woman's life or also to preserve her health.

[ 565 ] ^ a b This ground is not explicitly mentioned in the law. A judicial decision on an identical law in the parent country clarified that the law always implicitly allowed abortion at least to save the woman's life, and the decision allowed it also to preserve her health.

[ 368 ] It is unclear whether the territory applies only the original legal principle or also the judicial decision.

^ a b All states allow abortion to prevent the woman's imminent death, and some if the pregnancy is a less-immediate threat to their life.

• Additional allowance for risk to the woman's physical health : Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

• Allowance for risk to the woman's general health : California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington.

• Allowance for pregnancy due to rape or incest : Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Carolina, West Virginia, Utah, and Wyoming.

• Allowance for lethal fetal abnormality : Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, South Carolina, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Utah.

Note that these allowances may have a time limit, which may be as early as cardiac-cell activity (approximately 6 weeks LMP); others may have no limit. Different allowances may have different limits in the same state.

^ Cardiac-cell activity is generally detectable in the 6th week LMP .

Allowance beyond this limit is made, at minimum, for an immediate threat to the woman's life. In general, states that permit limited elective abortion may allow abortion beyond that limit for some or all of the reasons listed above.

^ Typically, fetal viability begins in the 23rd or 24th week LMP.

^ The second trimester is variously defined as through 27th or 28th week LMP. In Massachusetts, the law allows elective abortion up to 24 weeks from implantation, which is approx. 27 weeks LMP.

^ Some examples of gestational age calculated from the first day of the last menstrual cycle: [ 574 ] [ 575 ] [ 576 ] [ 577 ] [ 578 ] [ excessive citations ] ^ For example Luxembourg abortion law states: "Avant la fin de la 12e semaine de grossesse ou avant la fin de la 14e semaine d'aménorrhée ...", which translates to "Before the end of the 12th week of pregnancy or before the end of the 14th week of amenorrhea ".

Adding It Up: The Costs and Benefits of Investing in Family Planning and Newborn Health (PDF) . New York: Guttmacher Institute and United Nations Population Fund . pp. 17, 19, 27.

Some 215 million women in the developing world as a whole have an unmet need for modern contraceptives ... If the 215 million women with unmet need used modern family planning methods ... [that] would result in about 22 million fewer unplanned births; 25 million fewer abortions; and seven million fewer miscarriages....If women's contraceptive needs were addressed (and assuming no changes in abortion laws) ... the number of unsafe abortions would decline by 73% from 20 million to 5.5 million.

This government publication, reflecting laws up to 2017 (including the Termination of Pregnancy Law Reform Act 2017 in the Northern Territory), lists New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory as the subdivisions of Australia not allowing abortion on request. Since then, laws allowing abortion on request have entered into force in Queensland (2018), New South Wales (2019) and South Australia (2022). The abortion law in the Northern Territory was amended in 2021 but still requires approval by a medical professional based on the same criteria as in 2017, thus it is still not considered as allowing abortion on request.

However, Sufan, the shelter director in Nablus, said, 'it is difficult, the mufti [religious jurist], hospital, and court all have to agree to allow the abortion.' Salhieh, the chief prosecutor, said that prosecutors obtained permission for seven women to have abortions in 2017, all in cases in which the women alleged that the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest and they were in the early stages of pregnancy." ^ Palestine's Abortion Problem , Foreign Policy, 4 December 2015.

"On the agreed proposal of the parliamentary commissions, the provision that was read in the bill, according to which it was declared 'not punishable the doctor or surgeon, when he justifies having acted in order to save the woman's life, endangered by the pregnancy or by childbirth', was deleted"; "The vote expressed in agreement in parliament led me to the aforesaid deletion, not to exclude the application of the concept that was expressed there, but because it was superfluous and inappropriate to declare it, providing if needed article 49 number 3, the application of which would be only, and without reason, restricted." (in Italian) ^ Criminal abortion in the Italian penal code , Pasquale Tuozzi, Filippo Serafini Legal Archive, 1902, vol. 10, no. 3, p. 29. "However, if you want to search for a provision in our code that covers the surgeon, in addition to article 45, in which the aforesaid reason is rooted, there is also number 3 of article 49, where it is declared the nonresponsibility of one who acts compelled by the need to save himself or others from a serious and imminent danger to the person, to which he did not voluntarily give cause, and which he could not otherwise avoid. Well, these extremes of the state of necessity all apply in the case of the surgeon, who, put in the harsh condition, not created by him, extinguishes an imperfect and perhaps uncertain existence, to save a certain and real existence, which is that of the woman in childbirth."
