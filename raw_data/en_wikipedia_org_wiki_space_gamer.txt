**Indy Halpern** (born March 28, 2000), better known by his online alias **SPACE**, is an American professional _[Overwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch\_(video\_game) "Overwatch (video game)")_ player in the [Overwatch League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_League "Overwatch League") (OWL). He began his career in 2017, playing with teams such as Arc 6 and [Cloud9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud9 "Cloud9") in late 2017. Halpern signed with the [Los Angeles Valiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Valiant "Los Angeles Valiant") of the OWL ahead of the league's [inaugural season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Overwatch_League_season "2018 Overwatch League season"). After two seasons with the Valiant, he signed with the [Los Angeles Gladiators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Gladiators "Los Angeles Gladiators").

Halpern has won two midseason playoff titles—one in 2018 and one in 2021. He is a three-time OWL All-Star and was awarded with a Role Star commendation in 2021. Outside of the OWL, Halpern played in the [2018 Overwatch World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Overwatch_World_Cup "2018 Overwatch World Cup") (OWWC) and won the [2019 Overwatch World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Overwatch_World_Cup "2019 Overwatch World Cup") as a member of Team USA.

Halpern was born on March 28, 2000, to his mother Diane Mella and father Mike Halpern.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(gamer)#cite_note-Lingle-2)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(gamer)#cite_note-Khan-3) From around age 7–8 until 14, he was a [child model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_model "Child model") for companies such as [Gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_Inc. "Gap Inc."), [Ralph Lauren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren "Ralph Lauren"), and [Nike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc. "Nike, Inc.").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(gamer)#cite_note-4) Growing up, Halpern lived with his mother and grandmother on the [Upper East Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_East_Side "Upper East Side") of [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"), while attending [Léman Manhattan Preparatory School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9man_Manhattan_Preparatory_School "Léman Manhattan Preparatory School") in [Lower Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan "Lower Manhattan") on a scholarship. However, being far away from where he grew up, as well as the commute to Lemen, was difficult for him, so his mother transferred him to Life Sciences, a public school on the [Upper East Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_East_Side "Upper East Side"). Halpern regularly skipped classes at Life Sciences to go home and play _[Overwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch\_(video\_game) "Overwatch (video game)")_, which led to him nearing academic probation at school. Performing well on the [competitive mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)#Competitive_mode "Overwatch (video game)") in _Overwatch_, he dropped out of school to pursue a career as a professional _Overwatch_ player, although he planned to take online classes to get his [GED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GED "GED").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(gamer)#cite_note-Khan-3)

Halpern was featured in [CBS News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News "CBS News")' 2018 documentary _Esports: The Price of the Grind_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(gamer)#cite_note-5)
