He was known for his work on Marxism , and later, egalitarianism and distributive justice in normative political philosophy.

Background [ edit ] Born into an ethnically Jewish but "militantly anti-religious" and communist family in Montreal , Quebec, on 14 April 1941, [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Cohen was educated at the Morris Winchevsky School , Strathcona Academy , and Outremont High School .

[ 8 ] He then attended McGill University , obtaining a BA in philosophy and political science, and the University of Oxford , where he studied under Gilbert Ryle (and was also taught by Isaiah Berlin ) and obtained a BPhil in philosophy.

[ 7 ] [ 9 ] Academic career [ edit ] Cohen was assistant lecturer (1963–1964), lecturer (1964–1979), then reader (1979–1984) in the Department of Philosophy at University College London , before being appointed to the Chichele chair at Oxford in 1985.

[ 10 ] Several of his students, such as Christopher Bertram, Simon Caney , Alan Carter , Cécile Fabre , Will Kymlicka , John McMurtry , David Leopold, Michael Otsuka , Seana Shiffrin , and Jonathan Wolff went on to be important moral and political philosophers. He retired from the Chichele chair in 2008. At the time of his death, he was a visiting Quain Professor of Jurisprudence at UCL Faculty of Laws .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Cohen was a proponent of analytical Marxism [ 13 ] [ 14 ] and a founding member of the September Group . His 1978 work Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence defends an interpretation of Karl Marx 's historical materialism its critics often call technological determinism .

[ 15 ] In Self-Ownership, Freedom, and Equality , Cohen offers an extensive moral argument in favour of socialism, contrasting his views with those of John Rawls and Robert Nozick by articulating an extensive critique of the Lockean principle of self-ownership as well as the use of that principle to defend right as well as left-libertarianism .

[ 16 ] In If You're an Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich?

(which covers the topic of his Gifford Lectures ), Cohen addresses the question of what egalitarian political principles imply for the personal behaviour of those who hold them.

Cohen was known for his flamboyant style during philosophical debates. According to his best friend, the philosopher Gerald Dworkin , "Nothing was too inappropriate, private, bizarre, or embarrassing to be suddenly brought into the conversation".

[ 17 ] Personal life and death [ edit ] In 1965, Cohen married Margaret Pearce; they had three children and divorced in 1996.

[ 10 ] Three years later, he married Michèle Jacottet.

[ 10 ] He personally abjured technology, a stance he called "technological conservatism"; Michèle answered all his email.

Cohen was close friends with Marxist political philosopher Marshall Berman .

On 5 August 2009, Cohen died from a stroke at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, aged 68.
