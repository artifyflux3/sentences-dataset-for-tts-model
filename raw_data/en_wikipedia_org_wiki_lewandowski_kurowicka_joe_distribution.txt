[ 1 ] Introduction [ edit ] The LKJ distribution was first introduced in 2009 in a more general context [ 2 ] by Daniel Lewandowski, Dorota Kurowicka, and Harry Joe. It is an example of the vine copula , an approach to constrained high-dimensional probability distributions.

The distribution has a single shape parameter η η {\displaystyle \eta } and the probability density function for a d × × d {\displaystyle d\times d} matrix R {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} } is p ( R ; η η ) = C × × [ det ( R ) ] η η − − 1 {\displaystyle p(\mathbf {R} ;\eta )=C\times [\det(\mathbf {R} )]^{\eta -1}} with normalizing constant C = 2 ∑ ∑ k = 1 d − − 1 ( 2 η η − − 2 + d − − k ) ( d − − k ) ∏ ∏ k = 1 d − − 1 [ B ( η η + ( d − − k − − 1 ) / 2 , η η + ( d − − k − − 1 ) / 2 ) ] d − − k {\displaystyle C=2^{\sum _{k=1}^{d-1}(2\eta -2+d-k)(d-k)}\prod _{k=1}^{d-1}\left[B\left(\eta +(d-k-1)/2,\eta +(d-k-1)/2\right)\right]^{d-k}} , a complicated expression including a product over Beta functions . For η η = 1 {\displaystyle \eta =1} , the distribution is uniform over the space of all correlation matrices; i.e. the space of positive definite matrices with unit diagonal.

Usage [ edit ] The LKJ distribution is commonly used as a prior for correlation matrix in Bayesian hierarchical modeling . Bayesian hierarchical modeling often tries to make an inference on the covariance structure of the data, which can be decomposed into a scale vector and correlation matrix.

[ 3 ] Instead of the prior on the covariance matrix such as the inverse-Wishart distribution , LKJ distribution can serve as a prior on the correlation matrix along with some suitable prior distribution on the scale vector. It has been implemented in several probabilistic programming languages , including Stan and PyMC .
