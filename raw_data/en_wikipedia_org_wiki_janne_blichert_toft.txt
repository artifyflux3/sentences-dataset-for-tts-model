[ 2 ] Scientific career Fields Geochemistry Institutions École normale supérieure de Lyon Janne Blichert-Toft is a geochemist , specializing in the use of isotopes with applications in understanding  planetary mantle - crust evolution, as well as the chemical composition of matter in the universe . To further this research, Blichert-Toft has developed techniques for high-precision Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry measurements.
