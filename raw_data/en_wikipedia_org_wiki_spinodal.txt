In thermodynamics , the limit of local stability against phase separation with respect to small fluctuations is clearly defined by the condition that the second derivative of Gibbs free energy is zero.

d 2 G d x 2 = 0 {\displaystyle {\operatorname {d} ^{2}\!G \over \operatorname {d} \!x^{2}}{=}0} The locus of these points (the inflection point within a G-x or G-c curve, Gibbs free energy as a function of composition ) is known as the spinodal curve.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] For compositions within this curve, infinitesimally small fluctuations in composition and density will lead to phase separation via spinodal decomposition . Outside of the curve, the solution will be at least metastable with respect to fluctuations.

[ 3 ] In other words, outside the spinodal curve some careful process may obtain a single phase system.

[ 3 ] Inside it, only processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium , such as physical vapor deposition , will enable one to prepare single phase compositions.

[ 4 ] The local points of coexisting compositions, defined by the common tangent construction, are known as a binodal coexistence curve , which denotes the minimum-energy equilibrium state of the system. Increasing temperature results in a decreasing difference between mixing entropy and mixing enthalpy, and thus the coexisting compositions come closer. The binodal curve forms the basis for the miscibility gap in a phase diagram. The free energy of mixing changes with temperature and concentration, and the binodal and spinodal meet at the critical or consolute temperature and composition.

[ 5 ] Criterion [ edit ] For binary solutions, the thermodynamic criterion which defines the spinodal curve is that the second derivative of free energy with respect to density or some composition variable is zero.

[ 3 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Critical point [ edit ] Extrema of the spinodal in a temperature vs composition plot coincide with those of the binodal curve, and are known as critical points .

[ 7 ] The spinodal itself can be thought of as a line of pseudocritical points, with the correlation function taking a scaling form with non-classical critical exponents .

[ 8 ] Strictly speaking, a spinodal is defined as a mean field theoretic object . As such, the spinodal does not exist in real systems, [ 9 ] but one can extrapolate to infer the existence of a pseudospinodal that exhibits critical-like behavior such as critical slowing down .

[ 10 ] Isothermal liquid-liquid equilibria [ edit ] In the case of ternary isothermal liquid-liquid equilibria, the spinodal curve (obtained from the Hessian matrix) and the corresponding critical point can be used to help the experimental data correlation process.
