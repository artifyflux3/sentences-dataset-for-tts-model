Look up _**[caret](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/caret "wiktionary:caret")**_ in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

**Caret** (from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language")_caret_'there is lacking')[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret#cite_note-3) is the name used familiarly for the [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)")^ provided on most [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY") keyboards by typing ⇧ Shift+6. The symbol has a variety of uses in programming and mathematics. The name "caret" arose from its visual similarity to the original [proofreader's caret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret_(proofreading) "Caret (proofreading)"), ‸, a mark used in [proofreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading "Proofreading") to indicate where a punctuation mark, word, or phrase should be inserted into a document. The [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") standard (X3.64.1977) calls it a "[circumflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex "Circumflex")";[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret#cite_note-4) the Unicode standard calls it a "circumflex accent", although it is no longer practicable for that purpose.

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Write_machine.jpg/250px-Write_machine.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Write_machine.jpg)

Typewriter with French (AZERTY) keyboard: à, è, é, ç ù have dedicated keys; the [circumflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex "Circumflex") and [diaeresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeresis_(diacritic) "Diaeresis (diacritic)") accents have [dead keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key "Dead key")

On typewriters designed for languages that routinely use [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic") (accent marks), there are two possible ways to type these: keys can be dedicated to [precomposed characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomposed_character "Precomposed character") (with the diacritic included); alternatively a [dead key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key "Dead key") mechanism can be provided. With the latter, a mark is made when a dead key is typed but, unlike normal keys, the paper carriage does not move on and thus the next letter to be typed is printed under the accent. The ^ symbol was originally provided in typewriters and computer printers so that [circumflex accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex "Circumflex") could be overprinted on letters (as in ô or ŵ).

### Transposition into ISO/IEC 646 and ASCII

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caret&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Transposition into ISO/IEC 646 and ASCII")]

The incorporation of the circumflex symbol into ASCII is a consequence of this prior existence on typewriters: this symbol did not exist independently as a [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(typesetting) "Sort (typesetting)") or [hot-lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_metal_typesetting "Hot metal typesetting") printing character. The original [1963 version of the ASCII standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#1963 "ASCII") used the code point 0x5E for an [up-arrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(symbol) "Arrow (symbol)")↑. However, the 1965 [ISO/IEC 646](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_646 "ISO/IEC 646") standard defined code point 0x5E as one of five available for national variation,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret#cite_note-5) with the circumflex ^ diacritic as the default and the up-arrow as one of the alternative uses.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret#cite_note-6) In 1967, the second revision of ASCII followed suit.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret#cite_note-Jennings-7)

Caret compared to lower-case circumflex accent

Overprinting to add an accent mark was not always supported well by printers, and was almost never possible on video terminals. The freestanding circumflex (which had come to be called a caret) quickly became reused for many other purposes, such as in [computer languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language "Computer language") and mathematical notation. As the mark did not need to fit above a letter any more, it became larger in appearance such that it can no longer be used to overprint an accent in most fonts.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret#cite_note-Korpela-8) Support for accented characters eventually came to be provided by including [precomposed characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomposed_character "Precomposed character") in character sets,[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret#cite_note-9) rather than by using overprinting.

### Programming languages

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caret&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Programming languages")]

The symbol ^ has many uses in [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language"), where it is typically called a caret. It can signify [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation"), the bitwise [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR "XOR") operator, [string concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_concatenation "String concatenation")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_], and [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character "Control character") in [caret notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret_notation "Caret notation"), among other uses. In [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression"), the caret is used to match the beginning of a string or line; if it begins a character class, then the inverse of the class is to be matched.

[ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C "ANSI C") can transcribe the caret in the form of the [trigraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_trigraph "C trigraph")`??'`, as the character was originally not available in all character sets and keyboards. [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") additionally supports tokens like `xor` (for `^`) and `xor_eq` (for `^=`) to avoid the character altogether. [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)")[1345](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1345) recommends that the character be transcribed as [digraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(computing) "Digraph (computing)")`'>` when required.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret#cite_note-RFC1345-10)

[Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal (programming language)") uses the caret for declaring and dereferencing [pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming) "Pointer (computer programming)"). In [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk "Smalltalk"), the caret is the method return statement. In [C++/CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B/CLI "C++/CLI"), .NET reference types are accessed through a handle using the `ClassName^` syntax. In Apple's [C extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocks_(C_language_extension) "Blocks (C language extension)") for Mac OS X and iOS, carets are used to create [blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocks_(C_language_extension) "Blocks (C language extension)") and to denote block types. [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language) "Go (programming language)") uses it as a [bitwise NOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_NOT "Bitwise NOT") operator.

[Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js "Node.js") uses the caret in [package.json](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_file "Manifest file") files to signify dependency resolution behavior being used for each particular dependency. In the case of Node.js, a caret allows any kind of update, unless it is seen as a "major" update as defined by [semver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semver "Semver").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret#cite_note-11)

### Surrogate symbol for superscript and exponentiation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caret&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Surrogate symbol for superscript and exponentiation")]

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the caret can signify [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation") (e.g. `3^5` for 3 5) where the usual [superscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscript_and_superscript "Subscript and superscript") is not readily usable (as on some [graphing calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphing_calculator "Graphing calculator")). It is also used to indicate a superscript in [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX "TeX") typesetting.

The use of the caret for exponentiation can be traced back to [ALGOL 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60 "ALGOL 60"),[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] which expressed the exponentiation operator as an upward-pointing arrow, intended to evoke the superscript notation common in mathematics. The upward-pointing arrow is now used to signify [hyperoperations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoperations "Hyperoperations") in [Knuth's up-arrow notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation "Knuth's up-arrow notation"), with a single arrow representing exponentiation and multiple adjacent arrows representing higher-level operations.

It is often seen in [caret notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret_notation "Caret notation") to show control characters: for instance, `^A` means the control character with value 1.

The Windows command-line interpreter ([cmd.exe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe "Cmd.exe")) uses the caret to [escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character "Escape character") reserved characters[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] (most other shells use the [backslash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backslash "Backslash")). For example, to pass a 'less-than' sign as an argument to a program, one would type `^<`.

### Upward-pointing arrow

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caret&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Upward-pointing arrow")]

In [internet forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum "Internet forum"), on [social networking sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_sites "Social networking sites") such as Facebook, or in [online chats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_chat "Online chat"), one or more carets may be used beneath the text of another post, representing an upward-pointing arrow to that post;[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret#cite_note-Computer_Hope-12) in addition to the arrow usage, it can also mean that the user who posted the ^ agrees with the above post. Multiple carets may be used to indicate that the comment is replying to, or relating to, the post above that correlates with the number of carets used, or to "underscore" the correct portion of the previous post, or simply for emphasis.

A similar use has been adopted by programming language [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler"), such as the Java compiler, to point out where a [compilation error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilation_error "Compilation error") has occurred.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The compiler prints out the faulty line of code and uses a single caret on the next line, padded by spaces, to give a visual indication of the error location.

The ASCII assignment to 0x5E was inherited by Unicode. Carets and related and similar characters in Unicode include:

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret#cite_ref-5 "Jump up")**ISO 646 (and ASCII, which it includes) is a standard for 7-bit encoding, providing just 96 printable characters (and 32 [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_characters "Control characters")).
