A vertex of an angle is the endpoint where two lines or rays come together.

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **vertex** (pl.: **vertices** or **vertexes**), also called a **corner**, is a [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") where two or more [curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve"), [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), or [line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment")[meet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangency "Tangency") or [intersect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(geometry) "Intersection (geometry)"). For example, the point where two lines meet to form an [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") and the point where [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(geometry) "Edge (geometry)") of [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon") and [polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") meet are vertices.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-Sciencing-3)

The _vertex_ of an [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") is the point where two [rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(mathematics)#Ray "Line (mathematics)") begin or meet, where two line segments join or meet, where two lines intersect (cross), or any appropriate combination of rays, segments, and lines that result in two straight "sides" meeting at one place.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-Sciencing-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-Euclid-4)

A vertex is a corner point of a [polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon"), [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron"), or other higher-dimensional [polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope "Polytope"), formed by the [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(Euclidean_geometry) "Intersection (Euclidean geometry)") of [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(geometry) "Edge (geometry)"), [faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry) "Face (geometry)") or facets of the object.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-Euclid-4)

In a polygon, a vertex is called "[convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set "Convex set")" if the [internal angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_angle "Internal angle") of the polygon (i.e., the [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") formed by the two edges at the vertex with the polygon inside the angle) is less than π radians (180°, two [right angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle")); otherwise, it is called "concave" or "reflex".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-5) More generally, a vertex of a polyhedron or polytope is convex, if the intersection of the polyhedron or polytope with a sufficiently small [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") centered at the vertex is convex, and is concave otherwise.

Polytope vertices are related to [vertices of graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)"), in that the [1-skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_(topology) "Skeleton (topology)") of a polytope is a graph, the vertices of which correspond to the vertices of the polytope,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-6) and in that a graph can be viewed as a 1-dimensional simplicial complex the vertices of which are the graph's vertices.

However, in [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"), vertices may have fewer than two incident edges, which is usually not allowed for geometric vertices. There is also a connection between geometric vertices and the [vertices of a curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(curve) "Vertex (curve)"), its points of extreme curvature: in some sense the vertices of a polygon are points of infinite curvature, and if a polygon is approximated by a smooth curve, there will be a point of extreme curvature near each polygon vertex.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-7)

A vertex of a plane tiling or [tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation "Tessellation") is a point where three or more tiles meet;[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-8) generally, but not always, the tiles of a tessellation are polygons and the vertices of the tessellation are also vertices of its tiles. More generally, a tessellation can be viewed as a kind of topological [cell complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_complex "Cell complex"), as can the faces of a polyhedron or polytope; the vertices of other kinds of complexes such as [simplicial complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex "Simplicial complex") are its zero-dimensional faces.

Parts of a simple polygon

A polygon vertex _x_ i of a [simple polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_polygon "Simple polygon")P is a principal polygon vertex if the diagonal [_x_(i − 1), _x_(i + 1)] intersects the boundary of P only at _x_(i − 1) and _x_(i + 1). There are two types of principal vertices: _ears_ and _mouths_.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-9)

A principal vertex _x_ i of a simple polygon P is called an ear if the diagonal [_x_(i − 1), _x_(i + 1)] that bridges _x_ i lies entirely in P. (see also [convex polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon "Convex polygon")) According to the [two ears theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_ears_theorem "Two ears theorem"), every simple polygon has at least two ears.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-10)

A principal vertex _x_ i of a simple polygon P is called a mouth if the diagonal [_x_(i − 1), _x_(i + 1)] lies outside the boundary of P.

Number of vertices of a polyhedron
----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertex_(geometry)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Number of vertices of a polyhedron")]

Any [convex polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polyhedron "Convex polyhedron")'s surface has [Euler characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic "Euler characteristic")

![Image 3: {\displaystyle V-E+F=2,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f8ab564115bf2f7f7d12a9f873d9c6c7a50190e)
where _V_ is the number of vertices, _E_ is the number of [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(geometry) "Edge (geometry)"), and _F_ is the number of [faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry) "Face (geometry)"). This equation is known as [Euler's polyhedron formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_polyhedron_formula "Euler's polyhedron formula"). Thus the number of vertices is 2 more than the excess of the number of edges over the number of faces. For example, since a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_(geometry) "Cube (geometry)") has 12 edges and 6 faces, the formula implies that it has eight vertices.

Vertices in computer graphics
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertex_(geometry)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Vertices in computer graphics")]

In [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics"), objects are often represented as triangulated [polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") in which the [object vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(computer_graphics) "Vertex (computer graphics)") are associated not only with three spatial coordinates but also with other graphical information necessary to render the object correctly, such as colors, [reflectance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectance "Reflectance") properties, textures, and [surface normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_normal "Vertex normal").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#cite_note-opengl-11) These properties are used in rendering by a [vertex shader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_shader "Vertex shader"), part of the [vertex pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_pipeline "Vertex pipeline").
