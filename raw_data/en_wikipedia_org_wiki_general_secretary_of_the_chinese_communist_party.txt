secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party ( Chinese : 中国共产党中央委员会总书记 ; pinyin : Zhōngguó Gòngchǎndǎng Zhōngyāng Wěiyuánhuì Zǒngshūjì ) is the leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the sole ruling party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Since 1989, the CCP general secretary has been the paramount leader of the PRC.

The position of the general secretary of the Central Committee was established at the 4th Party National Congress in 1925, when Chen Duxiu , one of the founders of the CCP, was elected as the first General Secretary. After the 7th National Congress , the position was replaced by the Chairman of the Central Committee , which was held by Mao Zedong until his death in 1976. The post was re-established at the 12th National Congress in 1982 and replaced the Party Chairman as the highest leadership position of the CCP; Hu Yaobang was the first General Secretary. Since the 1990s, the holder of the post has been, except for transitional periods, the president of China , making the holder the state representative, and the chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the supreme commander of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).

[ note 1 ] According to the CCP constitution , the general secretary is elected during a plenary session of the Central Committee . The general secretary serves as an ex officio member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China's de facto top decision-making body. The general secretary is also the head of the Secretariat , and sets the agenda of Central Committee, Politburo and PSC meetings. As the leader of the world's largest economy by GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) , the second largest economy by GDP nominal , the largest military in the world by personnel, a recognized nuclear weapons state , UN Security Council permanent member , and a great power , the general secretary is considered to be one of the world's most powerful political figures.

[ 2 ] The incumbent general secretary is Xi Jinping , who took office on 15 November 2012 and was re-elected twice on 25 October 2017 and 23 October 2022.

History [ edit ] Chen Duxiu , one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, served as Secretary of the Central Bureau from 1921 to 1922, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee from 1922 to 1925, and became the first general secretary of the Central Committee in 1925. Between 1928 and 1943, Xiang Zhongfa , Wang Ming , Bo Gu , Zhang Wentian and others successively served as General Secretaries of the Party. At a Politburo meeting in March 1943, the Central Committee was reorganized and the position of Chairman of the Central Secretariat was established.

Mao Zedong was elected Chairman of the Politburo and Chairman of the Central Secretariat, thus establishing his unified leadership. On 19 June 1945, the 7th Central Committee held its first plenary session where Mao was elected Chairman of the Central Committee at the meeting, abolishing the post of general secretary.

[ 3 ] The post was re-established by the 12th Central Committee in 1982, replacing the post of Chairman of the Central Committee. Since its revival in 1982, the post of general secretary has been the highest office in the CCP, though it did not become the most powerful post until Deng Xiaoping 's retirement in 1989.

[ 4 ] Since the mid-1990s, starting with Jiang Zemin , the general secretary has traditionally also held the post of president of China .

[ 4 ] While the presidency is a ceremonial post, it is customary for the general secretary to assume the presidency to confirm his status as state representative . It has additionally been held together with the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission , making the holder the supreme commander of the People's Liberation Army .

[ 4 ] Election [ edit ] The CCP general secretary is nominally elected by a plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party from among the members of the Politburo Standing Committee .

[ 5 ] In practice, the de facto method of selecting the general secretary has varied over time.

[ citation needed ] The two most recent general secretaries, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping , were first elevated to the position of first Secretary of the Secretariat in the same process used to determine the membership and roles of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee. Under this informal process, the first secretary would be chosen during deliberations by incumbent Politburo members and retired Politburo Standing Committee members in the lead up to a Party Congress . The first secretary would later succeed the retiring general secretary as part of a generational leadership transition at the subsequent party congress.

[ citation needed ] Powers and position [ edit ] The powers and roles of the general secretary are vaguely defined, with no term limits or written rules for selecting a successor.

[ 4 ] However, as China is a one-party state , the general secretary holds ultimate power and authority over state and government, [ 6 ] and is usually considered the " paramount leader " of China.

[ 7 ] The general secretary has been the highest-ranking official in China's political system since 1982.

[ note 2 ] According to the Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party , the general secretary serves as an ex officio member of the Politburo Standing Committee.

[ 8 ] According to regulations of the CCP, the general secretary is responsible for convening the meetings of the Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee. The general secretary additionally presides over the work of the Secretariat. The general secretary also sets the topics of Central Committee, Politburo and Politburo Standing Committee meetings.

[ 9 ] A Politburo meeting in October 2017 after the first plenary session of the 19th CCP Central Committee stipulated that all Politburo members must make an annual written presentation to the CCP General Secretary and the Central Committee.

[ 10 ] At the opening of a CCP National Congress , the general secretary delivers the political report of the incumbent Central Committee, which details the work of the Central Committee in the last five years as well as the goals for the upcoming years.

[ 11 ] According to Hong Kong media reports, according to the implementation rules of the Central Committee's Eight-point Regulation , the status of the general secretary is superior to that of other members of the Politburo Standing Committee, enjoying a number of special treatments, which highlight the position's supreme status. There is no limit on the length of news reports, live television broadcasts can be arranged, synchronized audio can be broadcast, and the number of accompanying reporters is not limited for the general secretary.

[ 12 ] The general secretary can take a special plane when visiting foreign countries, and reports on foreign visits can be accompanied by side notes, features, and summaries, with no limit on the number of words.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] See also [ edit ] Office of the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Leadership core Order of precedence in China Notes [ edit ] ^ Xi Jinping was named general secretary of the CCP and took over the chairmanship of the Central Military Commission from Hu Jintao in November 2012.

[ 1 ] ^ The de facto leader Deng Xiaoping was 3rd ranking official in the 12th Politburo Standing Committee , and 2nd ranking official in the 13th Central Committee, after General Secretary Zhao Ziyang , but before President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng . Deng at the time served as Chairman of the Central Military Commission and was ranked third or second overall in the leadership hierarchy.

In China, the political job that matters most is the general secretary of the Communist Party. The party controls the military and domestic security forces, and sets the policies that the government carries out. China's presidency lacks the authority of the American and French presidencies.

Mr. Xi's most important title is general secretary, the most powerful position in the Communist Party. In China's one-party system, this ranking gives him virtually unchecked authority over the government.
