[ 1 ] Initial reports [ edit ] The fireball, reportedly accompanied by a sonic boom , was noticed across the sky in parts of Thrissur , Ernakulam , Palakkad , Kozhikode and Malappuram districts of Kerala at around 22:00 PM IST (local time, UTC +5.30 hours) for about 5 to 6 seconds.

[ 2 ] Initial reports suggested that it may have been a part of a rocket body used to launch the Yaogan Weixing-26, a Chinese satellite launched in December 2014.

[ citation needed ] Later, the Meteorology Department and Disaster Management Authority of Kerala refuted the theory stating that if this was the case, it should have been spotted by the meteorology radars.

[ 3 ] Impact sites [ edit ] Meteorites (meteoroid debris) hit multiple places in Ernakulam district. Small fragments which are believed to be parts of the meteoroid were recovered from Valamboor, near Kolenchery , and Kuruppampady , near Perumbavoor .

[ 4 ] A team of scientists from the State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) and Geological Survey of India visited the impact sites and collected samples for analysis. A preliminary report  indicated that the fragments' chemical composition consist of nickel and iron ore .
