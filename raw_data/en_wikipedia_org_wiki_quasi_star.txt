Size comparison of a hypothetical quasi-star to some of the largest known stars .

A quasi-star rendered with Celestia A quasi-star (also called black hole star ) is a hypothetical type of extremely large and luminous star that may have existed early in the history of the Universe . Unlike modern stars, which are powered by nuclear fusion in their cores, a quasi-star's energy would come from material falling into a black hole at its core. Due to their immense mass , they would have had a relatively short lifespan of around 7 to 10 million years.

Quasi-stars were first proposed in the 1960s; [ citation needed ] there has not yet been a confirmed observation, though potential sightings of these objects have been made by the James Webb Space Telescope since it was launched.

[ 1 ] The study of quasi-stars would provide valuable insight into the early universe , galaxy formation, and the behavior of black holes , namely because they are considered as possible progenitors of the supermassive black holes that formed soon after the Big Bang .

[ 2 ] Formation and properties [ edit ] Formation of quasi-stars could only happen early in the development of the universe before hydrogen and helium were contaminated by heavier elements; thus, they may have been very massive Population III stars.

[ 3 ] A quasi-star would have resulted from the core of a protostar of at least 1,000 solar masses (2.0 × 10 33 kg) collapsing into a black hole, where the outer layers of the protostar are massive enough to absorb the resulting supernova without being blown away.

[ 4 ] Quasi-stars may have also formed from dark matter halos drawing in enormous amounts of gas via gravity, which can produce supermassive stars with tens of thousands of solar masses.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] In either case, quasi-stars would have ballooned to enormous sizes, dwarfing the largest known modern stars and approaching the Solar System in size.

[ 1 ] They are predicted to have had surface temperatures higher than 10,000 K (9,700 °C).

[ 7 ] At these temperatures, each one would be about as luminous as a small galaxy.

[ 2 ] Once the black hole had formed at the core of a new quasi-star, it would continue generating a large amount of radiant energy from the infall of stellar material. This constant outburst of energy would counteract the force of gravity , creating an equilibrium similar to the one that supports modern fusion-based stars.

[ 7 ] Quasi-stars would have had a short maximum lifespan, approximately 7 to 10 million years, [ 8 ] during which the core black hole would have grown to about 1,000–10,000 solar masses (2 × 10 33 –2 × 10 34 kg).

[ 2 ] [ 7 ] As a quasi-star cooled over time, its outer envelope would become transparent, until further cooling to a limiting temperature of 4,000 K (3,730 °C).

[ 7 ] This would mark the end of the quasi-star's life since there is no hydrostatic equilibrium at or below this limiting temperature.

[ 7 ] It would then dissipate without a supernova , leaving behind an intermediate-mass black hole .

[ 7 ] These intermediate-mass black holes are theorized as the progenitors of modern supermassive black holes , and would help explain how supermassive black holes formed so early in the history of the universe.
