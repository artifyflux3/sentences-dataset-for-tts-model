History [ edit ] 19th century [ edit ] 1915 railroad map of Sedgwick County When the Kansas territory was first mapped, the original Andover area was called Minneha (native american name).  Later it was changed to Cloud City .

[ 6 ] The first Euro-American settlement in Bruno Township was in February 1869, when Vincent Smith arrived on Dry Creek (2 miles east of Andover Road on 21st Street). He filed his claim on May 10, 1869. Other early settlers began to arrive in spring 1870, and soon all the land was claimed. The first Bruno Township election was held April 9, 1872. The first township officers were N.B. Daniels, Trustee; Jacob Brown, Treasurer; J.D. Reber, Clerk; Isaac Newland and Samuel Reed, Justices of the Peace; William Riser and Isaac Stroup, Constables. Bonds totaling $18,000 were issued for the extension of the Frisco Railway through Bruno Township. The railway was completed in 1880.

[ citation needed ] G. M. Pattison homesteaded the land that became the original plot on which Andover was built. In August 1872, Pattison was given title to this property. In February 1876, the land was sold to Mr. and Mrs. Ephraim Waggoner.

[ citation needed ] Andover's first church was what is known today as the United Methodist Church . The church started as a Sunday school in 1873.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Andover was named after Andover, Massachusetts .

[ 10 ] In January 1880, Mr. and Mrs. Waggoner deeded 40 acres (160,000 m 2 ) to Charles Glancey. Mr. Glancey platted the original townsite in February 1880. The legally established townsite was known as Cloud City, named after Mr. Cloud, a railroad engineer. He helped build the St. Louis–San Francisco Railroad through town. The name of the town was changed from Cloud City to Andover on June 7, 1880, when Mr. Cloud had a "falling out" with residents of the area.

[ 7 ] Early businesses during the 1882–83 period were a hotel, a grocery and lumber company, a shoemaker, a business that handled livestock, coal and grain, a general store, a meat market, two other grocery stores, and the railway agent. In 1883, the population of Andover was about 150 people. The first passenger train went through Andover in 1885 and the last passenger train in October 1960.

McClaren escaped and ran to the nearby Methodist Church —where an ice cream social was being held—to spread the alarm. Will Belford, 28 years old, was shot while trying to stop the bandits and died five weeks later. The robbers escaped, but were captured on August 12, 1898, in Maize, Kansas . Both were tried in Butler County Court. Sam Smith was charged with first-degree murder and hanged. Thomas Wind was charged with second-degree murder and sent back to prison.

[ citation needed ] 20th century [ edit ] The class of 1914 was the first class to graduate from Andover High School . The class of four students to receive diplomas were Josie Boyer, Virgil Grier, Ola Peacock, and Perry Hiskin. The school itself started in the fall of 1909 as a consolidated school which had been formed by combining four school districts, and qualified as an accredited high school.

[ citation needed ] Andover did not incorporate into a third class city until February 4, 1957. The population of the city proper was 166. Up until this time, Andover was a small unincorporated community surrounded by farmland. Homes began to spring up south of the original townsite.

[ citation needed ] At the first city election on April 2, 1957, Hugo Epp won by one vote over Charles Clay for the position of mayor .

On April 26, 1991, an F5 tornado left a trail of destruction through parts of Kansas , including south Wichita and Andover. Widening to nearly one-half mile, with winds over 260 mph (420 km/h), the deadliest blow was to Andover. The twister ripped through the town, killing 13 people. A third of the 4,300 residents were left homeless. Over 300 homes, 10 businesses and two churches were destroyed. The Golden Spur Mobile Home Park and the St. Vincent De Paul Catholic Church were leveled. It was rated F5; had the tornado hit the heart of Wichita the death toll would likely have been higher.

21st century [ edit ] In 2000, Andover passed a bond issue allowing the school system to double in size. Andover grew to two high schools, two middle schools, and 4 elementary schools. Andover High School and Andover Middle School both use the Trojans as their mascot, sporting blue and white for their colors. Andover Central High School and Andover Central Middle School are the newer of the schools, established in 2001. Their mascots are the Jaguars and school colors are black and gold. Both schools have outstanding athletic, academic, music, drama, and art programs. Both programs are also crosstown rivals of each other.

[ citation needed ] Six schools; Cottonwood, Meadowlark, Robert Martin, Wheatland, Prairie Creek, and Sunflower have been the Elementary buildings serving the community. In 2005, Andover residents approved in bond election to build three additional elementary schools. The first of which, Robert Martin Elementary, which was named after Robert M. Martin, moved from a shared building with Meadowlark into a new location in the fall of 2007. The remaining two new buildings opened in the fall of 2008 as Wheatland Elementary and Prairie Creek Elementary.
