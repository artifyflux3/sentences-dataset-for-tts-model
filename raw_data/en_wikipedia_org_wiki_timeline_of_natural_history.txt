Dating of the geologic record [ edit ] The geologic record is the strata (layers) of rock in the planet's crust and the science of geology is much concerned with the age and origin of all rocks to determine the history and formation of Earth and to understand the forces that have acted upon it.

Geologic time is the timescale used to calculate dates in the planet's geologic history from its origin (currently estimated to have been some 4,600 million years ago) to the present day.

Radiometric dating measures the steady decay of radioactive elements in an object to determine its age. It is used to calculate dates for the older part of the planet's geological record. The theory is very complicated but, in essence, the radioactive elements within an object decay to form isotopes of each chemical element . Isotopes are atoms of the element that differ in mass but share the same general properties. Geologists are most interested in the decay of isotopes carbon-14 (into nitrogen-14 ) and potassium-40 (into argon-40 ). Carbon-14 aka radiocarbon dating works for organic materials that are less than about 50,000 years old. For older periods, the potassium-argon dating process is more accurate.

Radiocarbon dating is carried out by measuring how much of the carbon-14 and nitrogen-14 isotopes are found in a material. The ratio between the two is used to estimate the material's age. Suitable materials include wood , charcoal , paper , fabrics , fossils and shells . It is assumed that rock exists in layers according to age, with older beds below later ones. This is the basis of stratigraphy .

The ages of more recent layers are calculated primarily by the study of fossils, which are remains of ancient life preserved in the rock. These occur consistently and so a theory is feasible. Most of the boundaries in recent geologic time coincide with extinctions (e.g., the dinosaurs ) and with the appearances of new species (e.g., hominids ).

The inner Solar System aggregated more slowly than the outer, so the terrestrial planets were not yet formed, including Earth and Moon .

c. 4,570 Ma – A supernova explosion (known as the primal supernova) seeds our galactic neighborhood with heavy elements that will be incorporated into the Earth, and results in a shock wave in a dense region of the Milky Way galaxy. The Ca-Al-rich inclusions , which formed 2 million years before the chondrules , [ 1 ] are a key signature of a supernova explosion.

c. 4,567 ±3 Ma – Rapid collapse of hydrogen molecular cloud , forming a third-generation Population I star , the Sun , in a region of the Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ), about 25,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way Galaxy .

[ 2 ] c. 4,566 ±2 Ma – A protoplanetary disc (from which Earth eventually forms) emerges around the young Sun , which is in its T Tauri stage.

c. 4,560–4,550 Ma – Proto-Earth forms at the outer (cooler) edge of the habitable zone of the Solar System . At this stage the solar constant of the Sun was only about 73% of its current value, but liquid water may have existed on the surface of the Proto-Earth, probably due to the greenhouse warming of high levels of methane and carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere.

Early bombardment phase begins: because the solar neighbourhood is rife with large planetoids and debris, Earth experiences a number of giant impacts that help to increase its overall size.

Precambrian Supereon [ edit ] Main article: Precambrian c. 4,533 Ma – The Precambrian (to c. 539 Ma [ 3 ] ), now termed a "supereon" but formerly an era , is split into three geological time intervals called eons : Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic. The latter two are sub-divided into several eras as currently defined. In total, the Precambrian comprises some 85% of geological time from the formation of Earth to the time when creatures first developed exoskeletons (i.e., hard outer parts) and thereby left abundant fossil remains.

Hadean Eon [ edit ] Main article: Hadean c. 4,533 Ma – Hadean Eon, Precambrian Supereon and unofficial Cryptic era start as the Earth – Moon system forms, possibly as a result of a glancing collision between proto-Earth and the hypothetical protoplanet Theia (the Earth was considerably smaller than now, before this impact).  This impact vaporized a large amount of the crust, and sent material into orbit around Earth, which lingered as rings, similar to those of Saturn, for a few million years, until they coalesced to become the Moon. The Moon geology pre-Nectarian period starts. Earth was covered by a magmatic ocean 200 kilometres (120 mi) deep resulting from the impact energy from this and other planetesimals during the early bombardment phase , and energy released by the planetary core forming. Outgassing from crustal rocks gives Earth a reducing atmosphere of methane , nitrogen , hydrogen , ammonia , and water vapour , with lesser amounts of hydrogen sulfide , carbon monoxide , then carbon dioxide . With further full outgassing over 1000–1500 K, nitrogen and ammonia become lesser constituents, and comparable amounts of methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water vapour, and hydrogen are released.

Photosynthesizing cyanobacteria evolve; they use water as a reducing agent, thereby producing oxygen as a waste product.
