[ 1 ] It is possible to make an association between such a basis and directional derivative operators.  Given a parameterized curve C on the manifold defined by x α ( λ ) with the tangent vector u = u α e α , where u α = ⁠ dx α / dλ ⁠ , and a function f ( x α ) defined in a neighbourhood of C , the variation of f along C can be written as d f d λ λ = d x α α d λ λ ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ x α α = u α α ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x α α f .

{\displaystyle {\frac {df}{d\lambda }}={\frac {dx^{\alpha }}{d\lambda }}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x^{\alpha }}}=u^{\alpha }{\frac {\partial }{\partial x^{\alpha }}}f.} Since we have that u = u α e α , the identification is often made between a coordinate basis vector e α and the partial derivative operator ⁠ ∂ / ∂ x α ⁠ , under the interpretation of vectors as operators acting on functions.

[ 2 ] A local condition for a basis { e 1 , ..., e n } to be holonomic is that all mutual Lie derivatives vanish: [ 3 ] [ e α α , e β β ] = L e α α e β β = 0.

{\displaystyle \left[\mathbf {e} _{\alpha },\mathbf {e} _{\beta }\right]={\mathcal {L}}_{\mathbf {e} _{\alpha }}\mathbf {e} _{\beta }=0.} A basis that is not holonomic is called an anholonomic, [ 4 ] non-holonomic or non-coordinate basis.

Given a metric tensor g on a manifold M , it is in general not possible to find a coordinate basis that is orthonormal in any open region U of M .

[ 5 ] An obvious exception is when M is the real coordinate space R n considered as a manifold with g being the Euclidean metric δ ij e i ⊗ e j at every point.
