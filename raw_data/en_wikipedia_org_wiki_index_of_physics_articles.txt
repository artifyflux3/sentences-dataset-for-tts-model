[ 2 ] More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature , conducted in order to understand how the world and universe behave.

[ 3 ] The index of physics articles is split into multiple pages due to its size.

Sands (1963), The Feynman Lectures on Physics , ISBN 0-201-02116-1 Hard-cover. p.1-1 Feynman begins with the atomic hypothesis , as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that all things are made up of atoms–little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ...

Freedman, University Physics with Modern Physics : 11th Edition: International Edition (2004), Addison Wesley. Chapter 1, section 1.1, page 2 has this to say: "Physics is an experimental science. Physicists observe the phenomena of nature and try to find patterns and principles that relate these phenomena. These patterns are called physical theories or, when they are very well established and of broad use, physical laws or principles." Steve Holzner, Physics for Dummies (2006), Wiley. Chapter 1, page 7 says: "Physics is the study of your world and the world and universe around you."
