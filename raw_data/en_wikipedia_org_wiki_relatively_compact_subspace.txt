Find sources: "Relatively compact subspace" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , a relatively compact subspace (or relatively compact subset , or precompact subset ) Y of a topological space X is a subset whose closure is compact .

Properties [ edit ] Every subset of a compact topological space is relatively compact (since a closed subset of a compact space is compact). In an arbitrary topological space every subset of a relatively compact set is relatively compact.

Every compact subset of a Hausdorff space is relatively compact. In a non-Hausdorff space, such as the particular point topology on an infinite set, the closure of a compact subset is not necessarily compact; said differently, a compact subset of a non-Hausdorff space is not necessarily relatively compact.

Every compact subset of a (possibly non-Hausdorff) topological vector space is complete and relatively compact.

In the case of a metric topology , or more generally when sequences may be used to test for compactness, the criterion for relative compactness becomes that any sequence in Y has a subsequence convergent in X .

Some major theorems characterize relatively compact subsets, in particular in function spaces . An example is the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem . Other cases of interest relate to uniform integrability , and the concept of normal family in complex analysis .

Mahler's compactness theorem in the geometry of numbers characterizes relatively compact subsets in certain non-compact homogeneous spaces (specifically spaces of lattices ).

Counterexample [ edit ] As a counterexample take any finite neighbourhood of the particular point of an infinite particular point space . The neighbourhood itself is compact but is not relatively compact because its closure is the whole non-compact space.

Almost periodic functions [ edit ] Main article: Almost periodic function The definition of an almost periodic function F at a conceptual level has to do with the translates of F being a relatively compact set. This needs to be made precise in terms of the topology used, in a particular theory.
