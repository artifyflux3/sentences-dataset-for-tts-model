With few exceptions, animals consume organic material , breathe oxygen , are able to move , reproduce sexually , and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula , during embryonic development . Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described —of which around 1 million are insects —but it has been estimated there are over 7 million in total. Animals range in size from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft) long and have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs . The study of animals is called zoology .

Animals may be listed or indexed by many criteria, including taxonomy , status as endangered species , their geographical location, and their portrayal and/or naming in human culture.
