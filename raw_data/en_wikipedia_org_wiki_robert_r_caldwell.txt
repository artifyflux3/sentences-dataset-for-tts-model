Caldwell Nationality American Alma mater Washington University (A.B.) University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (Ph.D.) Known for Phantom dark energy Scientific career Fields Theoretical physics , Cosmology Institutions Dartmouth College Doctoral advisor Bruce Allen [ 1 ] Robert R. Caldwell is an American theoretical physicist and professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College .  His research interests include cosmology and gravitation .

[ 2 ] He is known primarily for his work on theories of cosmic acceleration , [ 3 ] in particular dark energy , quintessence , [ 4 ] and the Big Rip scenario.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] He coined the term phantom dark energy .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Career [ edit ] Caldwell received an A.B. from Washington University in St. Louis in physics and French in 1987, and a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1992. He was a postdoctoral fellow at Fermilab (1992-4), the University of Cambridge (1994-6, as a member of Hawking ’s group [ 9 ] ), the University of Pennsylvania (1996-8), and Princeton University (1998-2000). He has been on the faculty of Dartmouth College as an assistant professor (2000), associate professor (2005), and full professor (2010).

[ 10 ] He was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2008.
