The first high-precision radiometric datings of CAIs involved four samples examined through the Pb–Pb chronometer , yielding a weighted mean age of 4567.30 ± 0.16 Ma .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Subsequent studies including additional samples suggest a slightly older age of 4568.3 ± 0.7 Ma to rectify inconsistencies regarding Hf–W and Al–Mg chronometry methods.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] As CAIs are the oldest dated solids, this age is commonly used to define the age of the Solar System.

Description [ edit ] CAIs consist of minerals that are among the first solids condensed from the cooling protoplanetary disk . They are thought to have formed as fine-grained condensates from a high temperature (>1300 K) gas that existed in the protoplanetary disk at early stages of Solar System formations . Some of them were probably remelted later resulting in distinct coarser textures. The most common and characteristic minerals in CAIs include anorthite , melilite , perovskite , aluminous spinel , hibonite , calcic pyroxene , and forsterite -rich olivine .

Using the lead-lead isotope chronometer (‘Pb–Pb dating’), the absolute age of four CAIs have been calculated.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] They yield a weighted mean age of 4567.30 ± 0.16 Myr, which is often interpreted as representing the beginning of the formation of the planetary system (so-called ‘CAI time-zero). It is of note that all four Pb-Pb dated CAIs come from the same group of meteorite ( CV chondrites ).
