Public rights cannot be vindicated by private citizens . A right must normally be a private right to be vindicated in court.

An exception to this general proposition is found in Flast v. Cohen , 392 U.S. 83 (1968). In Flast , the U.S.

Supreme Court held that a private citizen could challenge the constitutionality of a federal tax if the citizen established "a logical link between [their] status [as a taxpayer] and the type of legislative enactment attacked [and] . . . a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged." In Australia, public rights is an entitlement enjoyed by the community, in contrast to a private or personal entitlement.

[ 1 ] Such as a claim to tolls on a public highway, [ 2 ] a right of ferry.

[ 3 ] Public rights may exist at common law or under statute. For example, the right of access to information held by the government is existing at common law.
