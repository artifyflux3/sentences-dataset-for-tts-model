(1996) Helene Hewitt OBE is a British climate scientist who is a research fellow at the Met Office . Her research considers climate and ocean models. Hewitt serves on the CLIVAR Ocean Model Development Panel. She was awarded an Order of the British Empire in the 2022 Birthday Honours .

Early life and education [ edit ] Hewitt grew up in Wombourne , Staffordshire, where she attended Ounsdale High School . She studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge , where she was a student at Fitzwilliam College . Hewitt was a doctoral researcher at the University of Southampton , where she studied the Western Equatorial Pacific Ocean.

[ 1 ] She worked on the World Ocean Circulation Experiment and at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as a doctoral student.

[ citation needed ] Research and career [ edit ] In 1996, Hewitt joined the Met Office , where she has developed and assessed climate models. In 2003, Hewitt was made Head of Ocean and Sea Ice model development. Hewitt's model, HadGEM3, combined NEMO and CICE , computational models which simulate the movement of sea ice and ocean circulation.

[ citation needed ] Hewitt coordinated the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on the Ocean, Cryosphere and Sea Level Change.

[ 2 ] She oversees the Ocean Modelling group at the Met Office Hadley Centre , where she develops global and shelf configurations for coupled predictions across multiple different timescales.

Hewitt was appointed an Order of the British Empire in the 2022 Birthday Honours .
