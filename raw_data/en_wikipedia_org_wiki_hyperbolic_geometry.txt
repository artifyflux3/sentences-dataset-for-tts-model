A triangle immersed in a saddle-shape plane (a [hyperbolic paraboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_paraboloid "Hyperbolic paraboloid")), along with two diverging ultra-parallel lines

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **hyperbolic geometry** (also called **Lobachevskian geometry** or **[Bolyai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai "János Bolyai")–[Lobachevskian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Lobachevsky "Nikolai Lobachevsky") geometry**) is a [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"). The [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate") of [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") is replaced with:

For any given line _R_ and point _P_ not on _R_, in the plane containing both line _R_ and point _P_ there are at least two distinct lines through _P_ that do not intersect _R_.
(Compare the above with [Playfair's axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom "Playfair's axiom"), the modern version of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate").)

The **hyperbolic plane** is a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") where every point is a [saddle point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point "Saddle point"). Hyperbolic plane [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") is also the geometry of [pseudospherical surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudosphere "Pseudosphere"), surfaces with a constant negative [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature"). [Saddle surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_surface "Saddle surface") have negative Gaussian curvature in at least some regions, where they [locally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_property "Local property") resemble the hyperbolic plane.

The [hyperboloid model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid_model "Hyperboloid model") of hyperbolic geometry provides a representation of [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(relativity) "Event (relativity)") one temporal unit into the future in [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"), the basis of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"). Each of these events corresponds to a [rapidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidity "Rapidity") in some direction.

When geometers first realised they were working with something other than the standard Euclidean geometry, they described their geometry under many different names; [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein") finally gave the subject the name **hyperbolic geometry** to include it in the now rarely used sequence [elliptic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry") ([spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry")), parabolic geometry ([Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry")), and hyperbolic geometry. In the [former Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states "Post-Soviet states"), it is commonly called Lobachevskian geometry, named after one of its discoverers, the Russian geometer [Nikolai Lobachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Lobachevsky "Nikolai Lobachevsky").

### Relation to Euclidean geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Relation to Euclidean geometry")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Comparison_of_geometries.svg/330px-Comparison_of_geometries.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Comparison_of_geometries.svg)

Comparison of elliptic, Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries in two dimensions

Hyperbolic geometry is more closely related to Euclidean geometry than it seems: the only [axiomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") difference is the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate"). When the parallel postulate is removed from Euclidean geometry the resulting geometry is [absolute geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_geometry "Absolute geometry"). There are two kinds of absolute geometry, Euclidean and hyperbolic. All theorems of absolute geometry, including the first 28 propositions of book one of [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements"), are valid in Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. Propositions 27 and 28 of Book One of Euclid's _Elements_ prove the existence of parallel/non-intersecting lines.

This difference also has many consequences: concepts that are equivalent in Euclidean geometry are not equivalent in hyperbolic geometry; new concepts need to be introduced. Further, because of the [angle of parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_parallelism "Angle of parallelism"), hyperbolic geometry has an [absolute scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_scale "Absolute scale"), a relation between distance and angle measurements.

Single lines in hyperbolic geometry have exactly the same properties as single straight lines in Euclidean geometry. For example, two points uniquely define a line, and line segments can be infinitely extended.

Two intersecting lines have the same properties as two intersecting lines in Euclidean geometry. For example, two distinct lines can intersect in no more than one point, intersecting lines form equal opposite angles, and adjacent angles of intersecting lines are [supplementary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_angles "Supplementary angles").

When a third line is introduced, then there can be properties of intersecting lines that differ from intersecting lines in Euclidean geometry. For example, given two intersecting lines there are infinitely many lines that do not intersect either of the given lines.

These properties are all independent of the [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#Models_of_the_hyperbolic_plane) used, even if the lines may look radically different.

#### Non-intersecting / parallel lines

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Non-intersecting / parallel lines")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Hyperbolic.svg/199px-Hyperbolic.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hyperbolic.svg)

Lines through a given point _P_ and asymptotic to line _R_

Non-intersecting lines in hyperbolic geometry also have properties that differ from non-intersecting lines in [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"):

For any line _R_ and any point _P_ which does not lie on _R_, in the plane containing line _R_ and point _P_ there are at least two distinct lines through _P_ that do not intersect _R_.
This implies that there are through _P_ an infinite number of coplanar lines that do not intersect _R_.

These non-intersecting lines are divided into two classes:

*   Two of the lines (_x_ and _y_ in the diagram) are [limiting parallels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_parallel "Limiting parallel") (sometimes called critically parallel, horoparallel or just parallel): there is one in the direction of each of the [ideal points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_point "Ideal point") at the "ends" of _R_, asymptotically approaching _R_, always getting closer to _R_, but never meeting it.
*   All other non-intersecting lines have a point of minimum distance and diverge from both sides of that point, and are called _ultraparallel_, _diverging parallel_ or sometimes _non-intersecting._

Some geometers simply use the phrase "_parallel_ lines" to mean "_limiting parallel_ lines", with _ultraparallel_ lines meaning just _non-intersecting_.

These [limiting parallels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_parallel "Limiting parallel") make an angle _θ_ with _PB_; this angle depends only on the [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature") of the plane and the distance _PB_ and is called the [angle of parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_parallelism "Angle of parallelism").

For ultraparallel lines, the [ultraparallel theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraparallel_theorem "Ultraparallel theorem") states that there is a unique line in the hyperbolic plane that is perpendicular to each pair of ultraparallel lines.

In hyperbolic geometry, the circumference of a circle of radius _r_ is greater than ![Image 5: {\displaystyle 2\pi r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/71e811131a9c6c5f45e6657e0fc506e7e2a37f06).

Let ![Image 6: {\displaystyle R={\frac {1}{\sqrt {-K}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cc1071e39b083e9cc93033a995203e1931eea083), where ![Image 7: {\displaystyle K}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0) is the [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature") of the plane. In hyperbolic geometry, ![Image 8: {\displaystyle K}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0) is negative, so the square root is of a positive number.

Then the circumference of a circle of radius _r_ is equal to:

![Image 9: {\displaystyle 2\pi R\sinh {\frac {r}{R}}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6030cb8e083443cee7474a56e777978def54c6a6)
And the area of the enclosed disk is:

![Image 10: {\displaystyle 4\pi R^{2}\sinh ^{2}{\frac {r}{2R}}=2\pi R^{2}\left(\cosh {\frac {r}{R}}-1\right)\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d1bb2e8dbf5a4797a2fad2d30382536e25cec82a)
Therefore, in hyperbolic geometry the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius is always strictly greater than ![Image 11: {\displaystyle 2\pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73efd1f6493490b058097060a572606d2c550a06), though it can be made arbitrarily close by selecting a small enough circle.

If the Gaussian curvature of the plane is −1 then the [geodesic curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_curvature "Geodesic curvature") of a circle of radius _r_ is: ![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\tanh(r)}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/611696f696b457b48fbd5ce7d780fc69c9e4cead)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-auto-1)

### Hypercycles and horocycles

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Hypercycles and horocycles")]

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Hyperbolic_pseudogon_example0.png/250px-Hyperbolic_pseudogon_example0.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hyperbolic_pseudogon_example0.png)

Hypercycle and pseudogon in the [Poincare disk model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincare_disk_model "Poincare disk model")

In hyperbolic geometry, there is no line whose points are all equidistant from another line. Instead, the points that are all the same distance from a given line lie on a curve called a [hypercycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercycle_(hyperbolic_geometry) "Hypercycle (hyperbolic geometry)").

Another special curve is the [horocycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horocycle "Horocycle"), whose [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry) "Normal (geometry)") radii ([perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") lines) are all [limiting parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_parallel "Limiting parallel") to each other (all converge asymptotically in one direction to the same [ideal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_point "Ideal point"), the centre of the horocycle).

Through every pair of points there are two horocycles. The centres of the horocycles are the [ideal points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_point "Ideal point") of the [perpendicular bisector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular_bisector "Perpendicular bisector") of the line-segment between them.

Given any three distinct points, they all lie on either a line, hypercycle, [horocycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horocycle "Horocycle"), or circle.

The **length** of a line-segment is the shortest length between two points.

The arc-length of a hypercycle connecting two points is longer than that of the line segment and shorter than that of the arc horocycle, connecting the same two points.

The lengths of the arcs of both horocycles connecting two points are equal, and are longer than the arclength of any hypercycle connecting the points and shorter than the arc of any circle connecting the two points.

If the Gaussian curvature of the plane is −1, then the [geodesic curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_curvature "Geodesic curvature") of a horocycle is 1 and that of a hypercycle is between 0 and 1.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-auto-1)

Unlike Euclidean triangles, where the angles always add up to π [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian") (180°, a [straight angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_angle "Straight angle")), in hyperbolic space the sum of the angles of a triangle is always strictly less than π radians (180°). The difference is called the [defect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_defect "Angular defect"). Generally, the defect of a convex hyperbolic polygon with ![Image 14: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) sides is its angle sum subtracted from ![Image 15: {\displaystyle (n-2)\cdot 180^{\circ }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f1bf4f86a416611a8b88e8761935b0278ace822).

The area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by its defect in radians multiplied by _R_ 2, which is also true for all convex hyperbolic polygons.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-2) Therefore all hyperbolic triangles have an area less than or equal to _R_ 2 π. The area of a hyperbolic [ideal triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_triangle "Ideal triangle") in which all three angles are 0° is equal to this maximum.

As in [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), each hyperbolic triangle has an [incircle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incircle "Incircle"). In hyperbolic space, if all three of its vertices lie on a [horocycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horocycle "Horocycle") or [hypercycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercycle_(hyperbolic_geometry) "Hypercycle (hyperbolic geometry)"), then the triangle has no [circumscribed circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribed_circle "Circumscribed circle").

As in [spherical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry") and [elliptical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_geometry "Elliptical geometry"), in hyperbolic geometry if two triangles are similar, they must be congruent.

### Regular apeirogon and pseudogon

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Regular apeirogon and pseudogon")]

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Hyperbolic_apeirogon_example.png/250px-Hyperbolic_apeirogon_example.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hyperbolic_apeirogon_example.png)

An [apeirogon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeirogon "Apeirogon") and circumscribed [horocycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horocycle "Horocycle") in the [Poincaré disk model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model "Poincaré disk model").

Special polygons in hyperbolic geometry are the regular [apeirogon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeirogon "Apeirogon") and **pseudogon**[uniform polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_polygon "Uniform polygon") with an infinite number of sides.

In [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), the only way to construct such a polygon is to make the side lengths tend to zero and the apeirogon is indistinguishable from a circle, or make the interior angles tend to 180° and the apeirogon approaches a straight line.

However, in hyperbolic geometry, a regular apeirogon or pseudogon has sides of any length (i.e., it remains a polygon with noticeable sides).

The side and angle [bisectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection "Bisection") will, depending on the side length and the angle between the sides, be limiting or diverging parallel. If the bisectors are limiting parallel then it is an apeirogon and can be inscribed and circumscribed by concentric [horocycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horocycle "Horocycle").

If the bisectors are diverging parallel then it is a pseudogon and can be inscribed and circumscribed by [hypercycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercycle_(geometry) "Hypercycle (geometry)") (since all its vertices are the same distance from a line, the axis, and the midpoints of its sides are also equidistant from that same axis).

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Rhombitriheptagonal_tiling.svg/250px-Rhombitriheptagonal_tiling.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rhombitriheptagonal_tiling.svg)

[Rhombitriheptagonal tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombitriheptagonal_tiling "Rhombitriheptagonal tiling") of the hyperbolic plane, seen in the [Poincaré disk model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model "Poincaré disk model")

Like the Euclidean plane it is also possible to tessellate the hyperbolic plane with [regular polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") as [faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry) "Face (geometry)").

There are an infinite number of uniform tilings based on the [Schwarz triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarz_triangles "Schwarz triangles") (_p_ _q_ _r_) where 1/_p_ + 1/_q_ + 1/_r_< 1, where _p_, _q_, _r_ are each orders of reflection symmetry at three points of the [fundamental domain triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_domain_triangle "Fundamental domain triangle"), the symmetry group is a hyperbolic [triangle group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_group "Triangle group"). There are also infinitely many uniform tilings that cannot be generated from Schwarz triangles, some for example requiring quadrilaterals as fundamental domains.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-3)

Standardized Gaussian curvature
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Standardized Gaussian curvature")]

Though hyperbolic geometry applies for any surface with a constant negative [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature"), it is usual to assume a scale in which the curvature _K_ is −1.

This results in some formulas becoming simpler. Some examples are:

*   The area of a triangle is equal to its angle defect in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian").
*   The area of a horocyclic sector is equal to the length of its horocyclic arc.
*   An arc of a [horocycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horocycle "Horocycle") so that a line that is tangent at one endpoint is [limiting parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_parallel "Limiting parallel") to the radius through the other endpoint has a length of 1.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-Sommerville2005-4)
*   The ratio of the arc lengths between two radii of two concentric [horocycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horocycle "Horocycle") where the horocycles are a distance 1 apart is [_e_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant) "E (mathematical constant)") : 1.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-Sommerville2005-4)

### Cartesian-like coordinate systems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Cartesian-like coordinate systems")]

Compared to Euclidean geometry, hyperbolic geometry presents many difficulties for a coordinate system: the angle sum of a [quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral "Quadrilateral") is always less than 360°; there are no equidistant lines, so a proper rectangle would need to be enclosed by two lines and two hypercycles; parallel-transporting a line segment around a quadrilateral causes it to rotate when it returns to the origin; etc.

There are however different coordinate systems for hyperbolic plane geometry. All are based around choosing a point (the origin) on a chosen directed line (the _x_-axis) and after that many choices exist.

The Lobachevsky coordinates _x_ and _y_ are found by dropping a perpendicular onto the _x_-axis. _x_ will be the label of the foot of the perpendicular. _y_ will be the distance along the perpendicular of the given point from its foot (positive on one side and negative on the other).

Another coordinate system measures the distance from the point to the [horocycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horocycle "Horocycle") through the origin centered around ![Image 18: {\displaystyle (0,+\infty )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/de77e40eb7e2582eef8a5a1da1bc027b7d9a8d6e) and the length along this horocycle.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-5)

Other coordinate systems use the Klein model or the Poincaré disk model described below, and take the Euclidean coordinates as hyperbolic.

A Cartesian-like[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] coordinate system (_x, y_) on the oriented hyperbolic plane is constructed as follows. Choose a line in the hyperbolic plane together with an orientation and an origin _o_ on this line. Then:

*   the _x_-coordinate of a point is the signed distance of its projection onto the line (the foot of the perpendicular segment to the line from that point) to the origin;
*   the _y_-coordinate is the signed [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_line "Distance from a point to a line") from the point to the line, with the sign according to whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the oriented line.

The distance between two points represented by (_x\_i, y\_i_), _i=1,2_ in this coordinate system is[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]![Image 19: {\displaystyle \operatorname {dist} (\langle x_{1},y_{1}\rangle ,\langle x_{2},y_{2}\rangle )=\operatorname {arcosh} \left(\cosh y_{1}\cosh(x_{2}-x_{1})\cosh y_{2}-\sinh y_{1}\sinh y_{2}\right)\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9eedf69ec11c340ab0b2b82303fb67beac51f379)

This formula can be derived from the formulas about [hyperbolic triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_triangle "Hyperbolic triangle").

The corresponding metric tensor field is: ![Image 20: {\displaystyle (\mathrm {d} s)^{2}=\cosh ^{2}y\,(\mathrm {d} x)^{2}+(\mathrm {d} y)^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f658469c6075ba6a1e1b345f6b4c0c45f1b22461).

In this coordinate system, straight lines take one of these forms ((_x_, _y_) is a point on the line; _x_ 0, _y_ 0, _A_, and _α_ are parameters):

ultraparallel to the _x_-axis

![Image 21: {\displaystyle \tanh(y)=\tanh(y_{0})\cosh(x-x_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4ff6cc442687715fe9023fe266a043ddba8a379a)
asymptotically parallel on the negative side

![Image 22: {\displaystyle \tanh(y)=A\exp(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cfb61b813a77a339b42a2ad561134dba706a074b)
asymptotically parallel on the positive side

![Image 23: {\displaystyle \tanh(y)=A\exp(-x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/096177bb52f9b86b107058184685ee883fac2277)
intersecting perpendicularly

![Image 24: {\displaystyle x=x_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/04e899fc6eba0b387b91f070adc7bc4fe5a706cb)
intersecting at an angle _α_

![Image 25: {\displaystyle \tanh(y)=\tan(\alpha )\sinh(x-x_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0bdf99aff1377a4212d13e49781d6b16f28f10d0)
Generally, these equations will only hold in a bounded domain (of _x_ values). At the edge of that domain, the value of _y_ blows up to ±infinity.

Since the publication of [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements") circa 300BC, many [geometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometers "Geometers") tried to prove the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate"). Some tried to prove it by [assuming its negation and trying to derive a contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction "Proof by contradiction"). Foremost among these were [Proclus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclus "Proclus"), [Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham") (Alhacen), [Omar Khayyám](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m "Omar Khayyám"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-6)[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nas%C4%ABr_al-D%C4%ABn_al-T%C5%ABs%C4%AB "Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī"), [Witelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witelo "Witelo"), [Gersonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides "Gersonides"), [Alfonso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abner_of_Burgos "Abner of Burgos"), and later [Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Gerolamo_Saccheri "Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri"), [John Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis "John Wallis"), [Johann Heinrich Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Lambert "Johann Heinrich Lambert"), and [Legendre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien-Marie_Legendre "Adrien-Marie Legendre").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-7) Their attempts were doomed to failure (as we now know, the parallel postulate is not provable from the other postulates), but their efforts led to the discovery of hyperbolic geometry.

The theorems of Alhacen, Khayyam and al-Tūsī on [quadrilaterals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral "Quadrilateral"), including the [Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham%E2%80%93Lambert_quadrilateral "Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral") and [Khayyam–Saccheri quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khayyam%E2%80%93Saccheri_quadrilateral "Khayyam–Saccheri quadrilateral"), were the first theorems on hyperbolic geometry. Their works on hyperbolic geometry had a considerable influence on its development among later European geometers, including Witelo, Gersonides, Alfonso, John Wallis and Saccheri.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-8)

In the 18th century, [Johann Heinrich Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Lambert "Johann Heinrich Lambert") introduced the [hyperbolic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions "Hyperbolic functions")[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-9) and computed the area of a [hyperbolic triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_triangle "Hyperbolic triangle").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-10)

### 19th-century developments

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: 19th-century developments")]

In the 19th century, hyperbolic geometry was explored extensively by [Nikolai Lobachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Lobachevsky "Nikolai Lobachevsky"), [János Bolyai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai "János Bolyai"), [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") and [Franz Taurinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Taurinus "Franz Taurinus"). Unlike their predecessors, who just wanted to eliminate the parallel postulate from the axioms of Euclidean geometry, these authors realized they had discovered a new geometry.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-12)

Gauss wrote in an 1824 letter to Franz Taurinus that he had constructed it, but Gauss did not publish his work. Gauss called it "[non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry")"[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-13) causing several modern authors to continue to consider "non-Euclidean geometry" and "hyperbolic geometry" to be synonyms. Taurinus published results on hyperbolic trigonometry in 1826, argued that hyperbolic geometry is self-consistent, but still believed in the special role of Euclidean geometry. The complete system of hyperbolic geometry was published by Lobachevsky in 1829/1830, while Bolyai discovered it independently and published in 1832.

In 1868, [Eugenio Beltrami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Beltrami "Eugenio Beltrami") provided models of hyperbolic geometry, and used this to prove that hyperbolic geometry was consistent [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") Euclidean geometry was.

The term "hyperbolic geometry" was introduced by [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein") in 1871.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-14) Klein followed an initiative of [Arthur Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley "Arthur Cayley") to use the transformations of [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry") to produce [isometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometries "Isometries"). The idea used a [conic section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section") or [quadric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric "Quadric") to define a region, and used [cross ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_ratio "Cross ratio") to define a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)"). The projective transformations that leave the conic section or quadric [stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics)#Invariant_set "Invariant (mathematics)") are the isometries. "Klein showed that if the [Cayley absolute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_absolute "Cayley absolute") is a real curve then the part of the projective plane in its interior is isometric to the hyperbolic plane..."[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-15)

### Philosophical consequences

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Philosophical consequences")]

The discovery of hyperbolic geometry had important [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical "Philosophical") consequences. Before its discovery many philosophers (such as [Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbes "Hobbes") and [Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinoza "Spinoza")) viewed philosophical rigor in terms of the "geometrical method", referring to the method of reasoning used in [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements").

[Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant "Kant") in [_Critique of Pure Reason_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_Pure_Reason#Space_and_time "Critique of Pure Reason") concluded that space (in [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry")) and time are not discovered by humans as objective features of the world, but are part of an unavoidable systematic framework for organizing our experiences.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-16)

It is said that Gauss did not publish anything about hyperbolic geometry out of fear of the "uproar of the [Boeotians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeotia "Boeotia")" (stereotyped as dullards by the ancient Athenians[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-17)), which would ruin his status as _princeps mathematicorum_ (Latin, "the Prince of Mathematicians").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-18) The "uproar of the Boeotians" came and went, and gave an impetus to great improvements in [mathematical rigour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_rigour "Mathematical rigour"), [analytical philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_philosophy "Analytical philosophy") and [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"). Hyperbolic geometry was finally proved consistent and is therefore another valid geometry.

### Geometry of the universe (spatial dimensions only)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Geometry of the universe (spatial dimensions only)")]

Because Euclidean, hyperbolic and elliptic geometry are all consistent, the question arises: which is the real geometry of space, and if it is hyperbolic or elliptic, what is its curvature?

Lobachevsky had already tried to measure the curvature of the universe by measuring the [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax "Parallax") of [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius "Sirius") and treating Sirius as the ideal point of an [angle of parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_parallelism "Angle of parallelism"). He realized that his measurements were [not precise enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error "Margin of error") to give a definite answer, but he did reach the conclusion that if the geometry of the universe is hyperbolic, then the [absolute length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#Standardized_Gaussian_curvature) is at least one million times the diameter of [Earth's orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit "Earth's orbit") (2 000 000[AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit"), 10 [parsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec "Parsec")).[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-19) Some argue that his measurements were methodologically flawed.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-20)

[Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré"), with his [sphere-world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere-world "Sphere-world")[thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment "Thought experiment"), came to the conclusion that everyday experience does not necessarily rule out other geometries.

The [geometrization conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture "Geometrization conjecture") gives a complete list of eight possibilities for the fundamental geometry of our space. The problem in determining which one applies is that, to reach a definitive answer, we need to be able to look at extremely large shapes – much larger than anything on Earth or perhaps even in our galaxy.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-21)

### Geometry of the universe (special relativity)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Geometry of the universe (special relativity)")]

[Special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") places space and time on equal footing, so that one considers the geometry of a unified [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") instead of considering space and time separately.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-23)[Minkowski geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space") replaces [Galilean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_geometry "Galilean geometry") (which is the 3-dimensional Euclidean space with time of [Galilean relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_relativity "Galilean relativity")).[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-24)

In relativity, rather than Euclidean, elliptic and hyperbolic geometry, the appropriate geometries to consider are [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"), [de Sitter space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Sitter_space "De Sitter space") and [anti-de Sitter space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-de_Sitter_space "Anti-de Sitter space"),[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-26) corresponding to zero, positive and negative curvature respectively.

Hyperbolic geometry enters special relativity through [rapidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidity "Rapidity"), which stands in for [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), and is expressed by a [hyperbolic angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_angle "Hyperbolic angle"). The study of this velocity geometry has been called [kinematic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry#Kinematic_geometries "Non-Euclidean geometry"). The space of relativistic velocities has a three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, where the distance function is determined from the relative velocities of "nearby" points (velocities).[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-27)

Physical realizations of the hyperbolic plane

The "hyperbolic soccerball", a paper model which approximates (part of) the hyperbolic plane as a [truncated icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron "Truncated icosahedron") approximates the sphere.

There exist various [pseudospheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudosphere "Pseudosphere") in Euclidean space that have a finite area of constant negative Gaussian curvature.

By [Hilbert's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_theorem_(differential_geometry) "Hilbert's theorem (differential geometry)"), one cannot isometrically [immerse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(mathematics) "Immersion (mathematics)") a complete hyperbolic plane (a complete regular surface of constant negative [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature")) in a 3-D Euclidean space.

Other useful [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#Models_of_the_hyperbolic_plane) of hyperbolic geometry exist in Euclidean space, in which the metric is not preserved. A particularly well-known paper model based on the [pseudosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudosphere "Pseudosphere") is due to [William Thurston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston "William Thurston").

The art of [crochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crochet "Crochet") has been [used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_and_fiber_arts#Knitting_and_crochet "Mathematics and fiber arts") to demonstrate hyperbolic planes, the first such demonstration having been made by [Daina Taimiņa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daina_Taimi%C5%86a "Daina Taimiņa").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-hyperbolicspace-28)

In 2000, Keith Henderson demonstrated a quick-to-make paper model dubbed the "[hyperbolic soccerball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_soccerball "Hyperbolic soccerball")" (more precisely, a [truncated order-7 triangular tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_order-7_triangular_tiling "Truncated order-7 triangular tiling")).[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-30)

Models of the hyperbolic plane
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Models of the hyperbolic plane")]

Various [pseudospheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudosphere "Pseudosphere") – surfaces with constant negative Gaussian curvature – can be embedded in 3-D space under the standard Euclidean metric, and so can be made into tangible models. Of these, the [tractoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudosphere#Tractroid "Pseudosphere") (or pseudosphere) is the best known; using the tractoid as a model of the hyperbolic plane is analogous to using a [cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone "Cone") or [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder "Cylinder") as a model of the Euclidean plane. However, the entire hyperbolic plane cannot be embedded into Euclidean space in this way, and various other models are more convenient for abstractly exploring hyperbolic geometry.

There are four [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") commonly used for hyperbolic geometry: the [Klein model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_model "Klein model"), the [Poincaré disk model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model "Poincaré disk model"), the [Poincaré half-plane model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_half-plane_model "Poincaré half-plane model"), and the Lorentz or [hyperboloid model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid_model "Hyperboloid model"). These models define a hyperbolic plane which satisfies the axioms of a hyperbolic geometry. Despite their names, the first three mentioned above were introduced as models of hyperbolic space by [Beltrami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Beltrami "Eugenio Beltrami"), not by [Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") or [Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein"). All these models are extendable to more dimensions.

### The Beltrami–Klein model

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: The Beltrami–Klein model")]

The [Beltrami–Klein model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltrami%E2%80%93Klein_model "Beltrami–Klein model"), also known as the projective disk model, Klein disk model and [Klein model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_model "Klein model"), is named after [Eugenio Beltrami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Beltrami "Eugenio Beltrami") and [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein").

For the two dimensions this model uses the interior of the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle") for the complete hyperbolic [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)"), and the [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(geometry) "Chord (geometry)") of this circle are the hyperbolic lines.

For higher dimensions this model uses the interior of the [unit ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_ball "Unit ball"), and the [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(geometry) "Chord (geometry)") of this _n_-ball are the hyperbolic lines.

*   This model has the advantage that lines are straight, but the disadvantage that [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") are distorted (the mapping is not [conformal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map "Conformal map")), and also circles are not represented as circles.
*   The distance in this model is half the logarithm of the [cross-ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-ratio "Cross-ratio"), which was introduced by [Arthur Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley "Arthur Cayley") in [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry").

### The Poincaré disk model

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: The Poincaré disk model")]

[![Image 28](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Hyperbolic_tiling_omnitruncated_3-7.png/250px-Hyperbolic_tiling_omnitruncated_3-7.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hyperbolic_tiling_omnitruncated_3-7.png)

Poincaré disk model with [truncated triheptagonal tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_triheptagonal_tiling "Truncated triheptagonal tiling")

The [Poincaré disk model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model "Poincaré disk model"), also known as the conformal disk model, also employs the interior of the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle"), but lines are represented by arcs of circles that are [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal "Orthogonal") to the boundary circle, plus diameters of the boundary circle.

*   This model preserves angles, and is thereby [conformal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map "Conformal map"). All isometries within this model are therefore [Möbius transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation "Möbius transformation").
*   Circles entirely within the disk remain circles although the Euclidean center of the circle is closer to the center of the disk than is the hyperbolic center of the circle.
*   [Horocycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horocycle "Horocycle") are circles within the disk which are [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent") to the boundary circle, minus the point of contact.
*   [Hypercycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercycle_(hyperbolic_geometry) "Hypercycle (hyperbolic geometry)") are open-ended chords and circular arcs within the disc that terminate on the boundary circle at non-orthogonal angles.

### The Poincaré half-plane model

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: The Poincaré half-plane model")]

The [Poincaré half-plane model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_half-plane_model "Poincaré half-plane model") takes one-half of the Euclidean plane, bounded by a line _B_ of the plane, to be a model of the hyperbolic plane. The line _B_ is not included in the model.

The Euclidean plane may be taken to be a plane with the [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") and the [x-axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-axis "X-axis") is taken as line _B_ and the half plane is the upper half (_y_> 0 ) of this plane.

*   Hyperbolic lines are then either half-circles orthogonal to _B_ or rays perpendicular to _B_.
*   The length of an interval on a ray is given by [logarithmic measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_measure "Logarithmic measure") so it is invariant under a [homothetic transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homothetic_transformation "Homothetic transformation")![Image 29: {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto (\lambda x,\lambda y),\quad \lambda >0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/894ebded73c0a97dbb48c04905f2e70b1f335fb3)
*   Like the Poincaré disk model, this model preserves angles, and is thus [conformal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map "Conformal map"). All isometries within this model are therefore [Möbius transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation "Möbius transformation") of the plane.
*   The half-plane model is the limit of the Poincaré disk model whose boundary is tangent to _B_ at the same point while the radius of the disk model goes to infinity.

### The hyperboloid model

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: The hyperboloid model")]

The [hyperboloid model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid_model "Hyperboloid model") or Lorentz model employs a 2-dimensional [hyperboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid "Hyperboloid") of revolution (of two sheets, but using one) embedded in 3-dimensional [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"). This model is generally credited to Poincaré, but Reynolds[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-33) says that [Wilhelm Killing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Killing "Wilhelm Killing") used this model in 1885

*   This model has direct application to [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"), as Minkowski 3-space is a model for [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), suppressing one spatial dimension. One can take the hyperboloid to represent the events (positions in spacetime) that various [inertially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference") moving observers, starting from a common event, will reach in a fixed [proper time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time "Proper time").
*   The hyperbolic distance between two points on the hyperboloid can then be identified with the relative [rapidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidity "Rapidity") between the two corresponding observers.
*   The model generalizes directly to an additional dimension: a hyperbolic 3-space three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry relates to Minkowski 4-space.

### The hemisphere model

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: The hemisphere model")]

The [hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere#Hemisphere "Sphere") model is not often used as model by itself, but it functions as a useful tool for visualizing transformations between the other models.

The hemisphere model uses the upper half of the [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere"): ![Image 30: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1,z>0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa3e99a27cc7bad6a904f4c528549ec8376b5163)

The hyperbolic lines are half-circles orthogonal to the boundary of the hemisphere.

The hemisphere model is part of a [Riemann sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere "Riemann sphere"), and different projections give different models of the hyperbolic plane:

### Connection between the models

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Connection between the models")]

[![Image 31](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Relation5models.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Relation5models.png)

Poincaré disk, hemispherical and hyperboloid models are related by [stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection "Stereographic projection") from −1. [Beltrami–Klein model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltrami%E2%80%93Klein_model "Beltrami–Klein model") is [orthographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection "Orthographic projection") from hemispherical model. [Poincaré half-plane model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_half-plane_model "Poincaré half-plane model") here projected from the hemispherical model by rays from left end of Poincaré disk model.

All models essentially describe the same structure. The difference between them is that they represent different [coordinate charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology) "Atlas (topology)") laid down on the same [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"), namely the hyperbolic plane. The characteristic feature of the hyperbolic plane itself is that it has a constant negative [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature"), which is indifferent to the coordinate chart used. The [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") are similarly invariant: that is, geodesics map to geodesics under coordinate transformation. Hyperbolic geometry is generally introduced in terms of the geodesics and their intersections on the hyperbolic plane.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-34)

Once we choose a coordinate chart (one of the "models"), we can always [embed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(mathematics) "Immersion (mathematics)") it in a Euclidean space of same dimension, but the embedding is clearly not isometric (since the curvature of Euclidean space is 0). The hyperbolic space can be represented by infinitely many different charts; but the embeddings in Euclidean space due to these four specific charts show some interesting characteristics.

Since the four models describe the same metric space, each can be transformed into the other.

### Other models of hyperbolic geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Other models of hyperbolic geometry")]

In 1966 David Gans proposed a [flattened hyperboloid model](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flattened_hyperboloid_model&action=edit&redlink=1 "Flattened hyperboloid model (page does not exist)") in the journal _[American Mathematical Monthly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Mathematical\_Monthly "American Mathematical Monthly")_.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-35) It is an [orthographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection "Orthographic projection") of the hyperboloid model onto the xy-plane. This model is not as widely used as other models but nevertheless is quite useful in the understanding of hyperbolic geometry.

*   Unlike the Klein or the Poincaré models, this model utilizes the entire [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane").
*   The lines in this model are represented as branches of a [hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-36)

#### The conformal square model

Conformal square model with [truncated triheptagonal tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_triheptagonal_tiling "Truncated triheptagonal tiling")

The conformal square model of the hyperbolic plane arises from using [Schwarz–Christoffel mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarz%E2%80%93Christoffel_mapping "Schwarz–Christoffel mapping") to convert the [Poincaré disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model "Poincaré disk model") into a square.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-37) This model has finite extent, like the Poincaré disk. However, all of the points are inside a square. This model is conformal, which makes it suitable for artistic applications.

The band model employs a portion of the Euclidean plane between two parallel lines.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-38) Distance is preserved along one line through the middle of the band. Assuming the band is given by ![Image 33: {\displaystyle \{z\in \mathbb {C} :|\operatorname {Im} z|<\pi /2\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/860d51593cce9c44d61d013d264b8c3251fc6f5b), the metric is given by ![Image 34: {\displaystyle |dz|\sec(\operatorname {Im} z)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cce681ca746737975a0edac679dc51cdc97724b3).

Isometries of the hyperbolic plane
----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Isometries of the hyperbolic plane")]

Every [isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry") ([transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation "Geometric transformation") or [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(geometry) "Motion (geometry)")) of the hyperbolic plane to itself can be realized as the composition of at most three [reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)"). In _n_-dimensional hyperbolic space, up to _n_+1 reflections might be required. (These are also true for Euclidean and spherical geometries, but the classification below is different.)

All isometries of the hyperbolic plane can be classified into these classes:

*   Orientation preserving 
    *   the [identity isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function "Identity function") – nothing moves; zero reflections; zero [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom "Degrees of freedom").
    *   [inversion through a point (half turn)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_reflection "Point reflection") – two reflections through mutually perpendicular lines passing through the given point, i.e. a rotation of 180 degrees around the point; two [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom "Degrees of freedom").
    *   [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)") around a normal point – two reflections through lines passing through the given point (includes inversion as a special case); points move on circles around the center; three degrees of freedom.
    *   "rotation" around an [ideal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_point "Ideal point") (horolation) – two reflections through lines leading to the ideal point; points move along horocycles centered on the ideal point; two degrees of freedom.
    *   translation along a straight line – two reflections through lines perpendicular to the given line; points off the given line move along hypercycles; three degrees of freedom.

*   Orientation reversing 
    *   reflection through a line – one reflection; two degrees of freedom.
    *   combined reflection through a line and translation along the same line – the reflection and translation commute; three reflections required; three degrees of freedom.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[M. C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher "M. C. Escher")'s famous prints _[Circle Limit III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle\_Limit\_III "Circle Limit III")_ and _Circle Limit IV_ illustrate the conformal disc model ([Poincaré disk model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model "Poincaré disk model")) quite well. The white lines in _III_ are not quite geodesics (they are [hypercycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercycle_(hyperbolic_geometry) "Hypercycle (hyperbolic geometry)")), but are close to them. It is also possible to see the negative [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature") of the hyperbolic plane, through its effect on the sum of angles in triangles and squares.

For example, in _Circle Limit III_ every vertex belongs to three triangles and three squares. In the Euclidean plane, their angles would sum to 450°; i.e., a circle and a quarter. From this, we see that the sum of angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane must be smaller than 180°. Another visible property is [exponential growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth "Exponential growth"). In _Circle Limit III_, for example, one can see that the number of fishes within a distance of _n_ from the center rises exponentially. The fishes have an equal hyperbolic area, so the area of a ball of radius _n_ must rise exponentially in _n_.

The art of [crochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crochet "Crochet") has [been used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_and_fiber_arts#Knitting_and_crochet "Mathematics and fiber arts") to demonstrate hyperbolic planes (pictured above) with the first being made by [Daina Taimiņa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daina_Taimi%C5%86a "Daina Taimiņa"),[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-hyperbolicspace-28) whose book _[Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocheting\_Adventures\_with\_Hyperbolic\_Planes "Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes")_ won the 2009 [_Bookseller_/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookseller/Diagram_Prize_for_Oddest_Title_of_the_Year "Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#cite_note-39)

_[HyperRogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperRogue "HyperRogue")_ is a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike "Roguelike") game set on various tilings of the hyperbolic plane.

Hyperbolic geometry is not limited to 2 dimensions; a hyperbolic geometry exists for every higher number of dimensions.

Homogeneous structure
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_geometry&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Homogeneous structure")]

[Hyperbolic space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space "Hyperbolic space") of dimension _n_ is a special case of a Riemannian [symmetric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_space "Symmetric space") of noncompact type, as it is [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic "Isomorphic") to the quotient

![Image 35: {\displaystyle \mathrm {O} (1,n)/(\mathrm {O} (1)\times \mathrm {O} (n)).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8637748b1dd1f3668dbe448fa6ca9ef46d1c65f0)
The [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group")O(1, _n_)[acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)") by norm-preserving transformations on [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space")**R**1,_n_, and it acts [transitively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#Types_of_actions "Group action (mathematics)") on the two-sheet hyperboloid of norm 1 vectors. Timelike lines (i.e., those with positive-norm tangents) through the origin pass through antipodal points in the hyperboloid, so the space of such lines yields a model of hyperbolic _n_-space. The [stabilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabilizer_subgroup "Stabilizer subgroup") of any particular line is isomorphic to the [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_product_of_groups "Direct product of groups") of the orthogonal groups O(_n_) and O(1), where O(_n_) acts on the tangent space of a point in the hyperboloid, and O(1) reflects the line through the origin. Many of the elementary concepts in hyperbolic geometry can be described in [linear algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") terms: geodesic paths are described by intersections with planes through the origin, dihedral angles between hyperplanes can be described by inner products of normal vectors, and hyperbolic reflection groups can be given explicit matrix realizations.

In small dimensions, there are exceptional isomorphisms of [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") that yield additional ways to consider symmetries of hyperbolic spaces. For example, in dimension 2, the isomorphisms SO+(1, 2) ≅ PSL(2, **R**) ≅ PSU(1, 1) allow one to interpret the upper half plane model as the quotient SL(2, **R**)/SO(2) and the Poincaré disc model as the quotient SU(1, 1)/U(1). In both cases, the symmetry groups act by fractional linear transformations, since both groups are the orientation-preserving stabilizers in PGL(2, **C**) of the respective subspaces of the Riemann sphere. The Cayley transformation not only takes one model of the hyperbolic plane to the other, but realizes the isomorphism of symmetry groups as conjugation in a larger group. In dimension 3, the fractional linear action of PGL(2, **C**) on the Riemann sphere is identified with the action on the conformal boundary of hyperbolic 3-space induced by the isomorphism O+(1, 3) ≅ PGL(2, **C**). This allows one to study isometries of hyperbolic 3-space by considering spectral properties of representative complex matrices. For example, parabolic transformations are conjugate to rigid translations in the upper half-space model, and they are exactly those transformations that can be represented by [unipotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unipotent "Unipotent")[upper triangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix "Triangular matrix") matrices.

> "Three scientists, Ibn al-Haytham, Khayyam and al-Tūsī, had made the most considerable contribution to this branch of geometry whose importance came to be completely recognized only in the 19th century. In essence their propositions concerning the properties of quadrangles which they considered assuming that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse, embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines – made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the 13th century, while revising Ibn al-Haytham's _[Book of Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")_ (_Kitab al-Manazir_) – was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the 14th century by the Jewish scholar [Levi ben Gerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides "Gersonides"), who lived in southern France, and by the above-mentioned Alfonso from Spain directly border on Ibn al-Haytham's demonstration. Above, we have demonstrated that _Pseudo-Tusi's Exposition of Euclid_ had stimulated both J. Wallis's and G. Saccheri's studies of the theory of parallel lines."
