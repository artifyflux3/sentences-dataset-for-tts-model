The Framework's main goal is to "achieve a reversal, across the entire landscape of the long-term decline in the extent and quality of native vegetation, leading to a net gain." [1] . The framework is notable for the inclusion of offsets, which allow authorised land clearing , providing there is a net gain in biodiversity , and for the fact that a monetary value is being placed on biodiversity. The "habitat hectare" has been defined as the trading currency of the framework, and provides a reliable and repeatable measurement of the quality of the native vegetation when correctly administered by an experienced assessor.

[2] The trading in "habitat hectares" is a form of biodiversity banking , which occurs in the private market responding to the supply and demand of the available remnant vegetation.

The act is administered by the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE).
