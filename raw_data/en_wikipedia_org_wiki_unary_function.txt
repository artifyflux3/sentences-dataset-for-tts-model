( December 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , a unary function is a function that takes one argument . A unary operator belongs to a subset of unary functions, in that its codomain coincides with its domain . In contrast, a unary function's domain need not coincide with its range.

Examples [ edit ] The successor function , denoted succ {\displaystyle \operatorname {succ} } , is a unary operator. Its domain and codomain are the natural numbers ; its definition is as follows: succ : N → → N n ↦ ↦ ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\operatorname {succ} :\quad &\mathbb {N} \rightarrow \mathbb {N} \\&n\mapsto (n+1)\end{aligned}}} In some programming languages such as C , executing this operation is denoted by postfixing ++ to the operand, i.e. the use of n++ is equivalent to executing the assignment n := succ ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) {\displaystyle n:=\operatorname {succ} (n)} .

Many of the elementary functions are unary functions, including the trigonometric functions , logarithm with a specified base, exponentiation to a particular power or  base, and hyperbolic functions .
