They were introduced by Robert Lowen in 1989, in a series of papers on approach theory between 1988 and 1995.

Definition [ edit ] Given a metric space ( X , d ), or more generally, an extended pseudo quasimetric (which will be abbreviated ∞pq-metric here), one can define an induced map d : X × P( X ) → [0,∞] by d ( x , A ) = inf { d ( x , a ) : a ∈ A }.  With this example in mind, a distance on X is defined to be a map X × P( X ) → [0,∞] satisfying for all x in X and A , B ⊆ X , d ( x , { x }) = 0, d ( x , Ø) = ∞, d ( x , A ∪ B ) = min( d ( x , A ), d ( x , B )), For all 0 ≤ ε ≤ ∞, d ( x , A ) ≤ d ( x , A (ε) ) + ε, where we define A (ε) = { x : d ( x , A ) ≤ ε}.

(The " empty infimum is positive infinity" convention is like the nullary intersection is everything convention.) An approach space is defined to be a pair ( X , d ) where d is a distance function on X . Every approach space has a topology , given by treating A → A (0) as a Kuratowski closure operator .

The appropriate maps between approach spaces are the contractions . A map f : ( X , d ) → ( Y , e ) is a contraction if e ( f ( x ), f [ A ]) ≤ d ( x , A ) for all x ∈ X and A ⊆ X .

Examples [ edit ] Every ∞pq-metric space ( X , d ) can be distanced to ( X , d ), as described at the beginning of the definition.

Given a set X , the discrete distance is given by d ( x , A ) = 0 if x ∈ A and d ( x , A ) = ∞ if x ∉ A . The induced topology is the discrete topology .

Given a set X , the indiscrete distance is given by d ( x , A ) = 0 if A is non-empty, and d ( x , A ) = ∞ if A is empty. The induced topology is the indiscrete topology.

Given a topological space X , a topological distance is given by d ( x , A ) = 0 if x ∈ A , and d ( x , A ) = ∞ otherwise. The induced topology is the original topology. In fact, the only two-valued distances are the topological distances.

Let P = [0, ∞] be the extended non-negative reals . Let d + ( x , A ) = max( x − sup A , 0) for x ∈ P and A ⊆ P . Given any approach space ( X , d ), the maps (for each A ⊆ X ) d (., A ) : ( X , d ) → ( P , d + ) are contractions.

On P , let e ( x , A ) = inf{| x − a | : a ∈ A } for x < ∞, let e (∞, A ) = 0 if A is unbounded, and let e (∞, A ) = ∞ if A is bounded. Then ( P , e ) is an approach space. Topologically, P is the one-point compactification of [0, ∞).  Note that e extends the ordinary Euclidean distance. This cannot be done with the ordinary Euclidean metric.

Let β N be the Stone–Čech compactification of the integers . A point U ∈ β N is an ultrafilter on N . A subset A ⊆ β N induces a filter F ( A ) = ∩ { U : U ∈ A }. Let b ( U , A ) = sup{ inf{ | n − j | : n ∈ X , j ∈ E } : X ∈ U , E ∈ F ( A ) }. Then (β N , b ) is an approach space that extends the ordinary Euclidean distance on N . In contrast, β N is not metrizable.

Equivalent definitions [ edit ] Lowen has offered at least seven equivalent formulations. Two of them are below.

Let XPQ( X ) denote the set of xpq-metrics on X . A subfamily G of XPQ( X ) is called a gauge if 0 ∈ G , where 0 is the zero metric, that is, 0( x , y ) = 0 for all x , y , e ≤ d ∈ G implies e ∈ G , d , e ∈ G implies max( d , e ) ∈ G (the "max" here is the pointwise maximum ), For all d ∈ XPQ( X ), if for all x ∈ X , ε > 0, N < ∞ there is e ∈ G such that min( d ( x , y ), N ) ≤ e ( x , y ) + ε for all y , then d ∈ G .

If G is a gauge on X , then d ( x , A ) = sup { e ( x , a ) } : e ∈ G } is a distance function on X . Conversely, given a distance function d on X , the set of e ∈ XPQ( X ) such that e ≤ d is a gauge on X . The two operations are inverse to each other.

A contraction f : ( X , d ) → ( Y , e ) is, in terms of associated gauges G and H respectively, a map such that for all d ∈ H , d ( f (.), f (.)) ∈ G .

A tower on X is a set of maps A → A [ε] for A ⊆ X , ε ≥ 0, satisfying for all A , B ⊆ X and δ, ε ≥ 0 A ⊆ A [ε] , Ø [ε] = Ø, ( A ∪ B ) [ε] = A [ε] ∪ B [ε] , A [ε][δ] ⊆ A [ε+δ] , A [ε] = ∩ δ>ε A [δ] .

Given a distance d , the associated A → A (ε) is a tower. Conversely, given a tower, the map d ( x , A ) = inf{ε : x ∈ A [ε] } is a distance, and these two operations are inverses of each other.

A contraction f :( X , d )→( Y , e ) is, in terms of associated towers, a map such that for all ε ≥ 0, f [ A [ε] ] ⊆ f [ A ] [ε] .

Categorical properties [ edit ] The main interest in approach spaces and their contractions is that they form a category with good properties, while still being quantitative like metric spaces. One can take arbitrary products , coproducts , and quotients, and the results appropriately generalize the corresponding results for topologies. One can even "distancize" such badly non-metrizable spaces like β N , the Stone–Čech compactification of the integers.

Certain hyperspaces, measure spaces , and probabilistic metric spaces turn out to be naturally endowed with a distance. Applications have also been made to approximation theory .
