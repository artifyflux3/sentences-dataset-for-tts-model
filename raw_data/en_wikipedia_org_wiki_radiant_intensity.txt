For ionizing radiation, see Radiation flux . For other measures of electromagnetic radiation, see Light intensity (disambiguation) .

In radiometry , radiant intensity is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit solid angle , and spectral intensity is the radiant intensity per unit frequency or wavelength , depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. These are directional quantities. The SI unit of radiant intensity is the watt per steradian ( W/sr ), while that of spectral intensity in frequency is the watt per steradian per hertz ( W·sr −1 ·Hz −1 ) and that of spectral intensity in wavelength is the watt per steradian per metre ( W·sr −1 ·m −1 )—commonly the watt per steradian per nanometre ( W·sr −1 ·nm −1 ). Radiant intensity is distinct from irradiance and radiant exitance , which are often called intensity in branches of physics other than radiometry. In radio-frequency engineering , radiant intensity is sometimes called radiation intensity .

Mathematical definitions [ edit ] Comparison of photometric and radiometric quantities Radiant intensity [ edit ] Radiant intensity , denoted I e,Ω ("e" for "energetic", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities, and "Ω" to indicate this is a directional quantity), is defined as [ 1 ] I e , Ω Ω = ∂ ∂ Φ Φ e ∂ ∂ Ω Ω , {\displaystyle I_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega }={\frac {\partial \Phi _{\mathrm {e} }}{\partial \Omega }},} where ∂ is the partial derivative symbol; Φ e is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received; Ω is the solid angle .

In general, I e,Ω is a function of viewing angle θ and potentially azimuth angle . For the special case of a Lambertian surface , I e,Ω follows the Lambert's cosine law I e,Ω = I 0 cos θ .

When calculating the radiant intensity emitted by a source, Ω refers to the solid angle into which the light is emitted. When calculating radiance received by a detector, Ω refers to the solid angle subtended by the source as viewed from that detector.

Spectral intensity [ edit ] Spectral intensity in frequency , denoted I e,Ω,ν , is defined as [ 1 ] I e , Ω Ω , ν ν = ∂ ∂ I e , Ω Ω ∂ ∂ ν ν , {\displaystyle I_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega ,\nu }={\frac {\partial I_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega }}{\partial \nu }},} where ν is the frequency.

Spectral intensity in wavelength , denoted I e,Ω,λ , is defined as [ 1 ] I e , Ω Ω , λ λ = ∂ ∂ I e , Ω Ω ∂ ∂ λ λ , {\displaystyle I_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega ,\lambda }={\frac {\partial I_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega }}{\partial \lambda }},} where λ is the wavelength.

Radio-frequency engineering [ edit ] Radiant intensity is used to characterize the emission of radiation by an antenna : [ 2 ] I e , Ω Ω = E e ( r ) r 2 , {\displaystyle I_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega }=E_{\mathrm {e} }(r)\,r^{2},} where E e is the irradiance of the antenna; r is the distance from the antenna.

Unlike power density, radiant intensity does not depend on distance: because radiant intensity is defined as the power through a solid angle, the decreasing power density over distance due to the inverse-square law is offset by the increase in area with distance.
