The theorem was proven for closed manifolds by Mostow ( 1968 ) and extended to  finite volume manifolds by Marden (1974) in 3 dimensions, and by Prasad ( 1973 ) in all dimensions at least 3.

Gromov (1981) gave an alternate proof using the Gromov norm .

Besson, Courtois & Gallot (1996) gave the simplest available proof.

While the theorem shows that the deformation space of (complete) hyperbolic structures on a finite volume hyperbolic n {\displaystyle n} -manifold (for n > 2 {\displaystyle n>2} ) is a point, for a hyperbolic surface of genus g > 1 {\displaystyle g>1} there is a moduli space of dimension 6 g − − 6 {\displaystyle 6g-6} that parameterizes all metrics of constant curvature (up to diffeomorphism ), a fact essential for Teichmüller theory . There is also a rich theory of deformation spaces of hyperbolic structures on infinite volume manifolds in three dimensions.

The theorem [ edit ] The theorem can be given in a geometric formulation (pertaining to finite-volume, complete manifolds), and in an algebraic formulation (pertaining to lattices in Lie groups ).

Geometric form [ edit ] Let H n {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{n}} be the n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional hyperbolic space . A complete hyperbolic manifold can be defined as a quotient of H n {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{n}} by a group of isometries acting freely and properly discontinuously (it is equivalent to define it as a Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature -1 which is complete ). It is of finite volume if the integral of a volume form is finite (which is the case, for example, if it is compact). The Mostow rigidity theorem may be stated as: Suppose M {\displaystyle M} and N {\displaystyle N} are complete finite-volume hyperbolic manifolds of dimension n ≥ ≥ 3 {\displaystyle n\geq 3} .  If there exists an isomorphism f : : π π 1 ( M ) → → π π 1 ( N ) {\displaystyle f\colon \pi _{1}(M)\to \pi _{1}(N)} then it is induced by a unique isometry from M {\displaystyle M} to N {\displaystyle N} .

Here π π 1 ( X ) {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(X)} is the fundamental group of a manifold X {\displaystyle X} . If X {\displaystyle X} is an hyperbolic manifold obtained as the quotient of H n {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{n}} by a group Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } then π π 1 ( X ) ≅ ≅ Γ Γ {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(X)\cong \Gamma } .

An equivalent statement is that any homotopy equivalence from M {\displaystyle M} to N {\displaystyle N} can be homotoped to a unique isometry.  The proof actually shows that if N {\displaystyle N} has greater dimension than M {\displaystyle M} then there can be no homotopy equivalence between them.

Algebraic form [ edit ] The group of isometries of hyperbolic space H n {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{n}} can be identified with the Lie group P O ( n , 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {PO} (n,1)} (the projective orthogonal group of a quadratic form of signature ( n , 1 ) {\displaystyle (n,1)} . Then the following statement is equivalent to the one above.

Let n ≥ ≥ 3 {\displaystyle n\geq 3} and Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } and Λ Λ {\displaystyle \Lambda } be two lattices in P O ( n , 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {PO} (n,1)} and suppose that there is a group isomorphism f : : Γ Γ → → Λ Λ {\displaystyle f\colon \Gamma \to \Lambda } . Then Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } and Λ Λ {\displaystyle \Lambda } are conjugate in P O ( n , 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {PO} (n,1)} . That is, there exists a g ∈ ∈ P O ( n , 1 ) {\displaystyle g\in \mathrm {PO} (n,1)} such that Λ Λ = g Γ Γ g − − 1 {\displaystyle \Lambda =g\Gamma g^{-1}} .

In greater generality [ edit ] Mostow rigidity holds (in its geometric formulation) more generally for fundamental groups of all complete, finite volume, non-positively curved (without Euclidean factors) locally symmetric spaces of dimension at least three, or in its algebraic formulation for all lattices in simple Lie groups not locally isomorphic to S L 2 ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {R} )} .

Applications [ edit ] It follows from the Mostow rigidity theorem that the group of isometries of a finite-volume hyperbolic n -manifold M (for n >2) is finite and isomorphic to Out ⁡ ⁡ ( π π 1 ( M ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Out} (\pi _{1}(M))} .

Mostow rigidity was also used by Thurston to prove the uniqueness of circle packing representations of triangulated planar graphs .

[ 1 ] A consequence of Mostow rigidity of interest in geometric group theory is that there exist hyperbolic groups which are quasi-isometric but not commensurable to each other.

See also [ edit ] Superrigidity , a stronger result for higher-rank spaces Local rigidity , a result about deformations that are not necessarily lattices.
