It is located in the southern portion of the Pannonian Plain on the border of the Bačka and Syrmia geographical regions, lying on the banks of the Danube river, and facing the northern slopes of Fruška Gora . According to the 2022 census [update] , the population of Novi Sad city proper stands at 260,438, its contiguous urban area has 325,511 inhabitants, and the population of its administrative area totals 368,967 people.

[ 3 ] It is the fifth largest city on the Danube river and the largest that is not a national capital.

Novi Sad was founded in 1694, when Serb merchants formed a colony across the Danube from the Petrovaradin Fortress , a strategic Habsburg military post. In subsequent centuries, it became an important trading, manufacturing and cultural centre, and has historically been dubbed the Serbian Athens .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The city was heavily devastated in the 1848 Revolution , but was subsequently rebuilt and restored. Today, along with the Serbian capital city of Belgrade, Novi Sad is an industrial and financial center important to the Serbian economy .

Novi Sad was the European Youth Capital in 2019 and the European Capital of Culture in 2022.

[ 6 ] It became a UNESCO Creative City of Media Arts in 2023.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Etymology [ edit ] The name Novi Sad means "new plantation" in Serbian . Its Latin name, stemming from the establishment of Habsburg city rights, is Neoplanta . The official names of Novi Sad in local administration are: [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Serbian : Нови Сад / Novi Sad Hungarian : Újvidék Slovak : Nový Sad Pannonian Rusyn : Нови-Сад In both Croatian and Romanian , which are official in provincial administration, the city is called Novi Sad . Historically, the city was called Neusatz and Neusatz an der Donau (translated as 'Novi Sad on the Danube') in German .

In its wider meaning, the name new plantation refers to the "City of Novi Sad", one of the city-level administrative units of Serbia , which includes Novi Sad proper on the left bank of the Danube, the towns of Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin on the right bank and the extensive suburbs of the left bank.

Novi Sad can also refer strictly to only the urban areas of the city (Novi Sad proper and the towns of Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin), or only to the historical core on the left bank, i.e. Novi Sad proper excluding Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin.

Several settlements and necropolises dating to 5000 BC were unearthed during the construction of a new boulevard in Avijatičarsko Naselje .

[ 14 ] A settlement was also identified on the right bank of the river Danube in present-day Petrovaradin .

In antiquity, the region was inhabited by Celtic tribes , most notably the Scordisci . Celts had been present in the area since the 4th century BC and founded the first fortress on the right bank of the Danube. Later, in the 1st century BC, the region was conquered by the Romans . During Roman rule, a larger fortress was built in the 1st century, named Cusum , and included in the Roman province of Pannonia .

In the 5th century, Cusum was devastated by Hunnic invasions . By the end of the century, the Byzantines had rebuilt the town and called it Petrikon or Petrikov ( Greek : Πέτρικον ) after Saint Peter .

Slavic tribes such as the Severians , the Obotrites and the Serbs (including the subtribes of the Braničevci and the Timočani ) settled the region around Novi Sad, mainly in the 6th and 7th centuries.

[ 15 ] [ unreliable source?

] The Serbs absorbed the aforementioned Slavic groups as well as the Paleo-Balkanic peoples of the region.

[ 15 ] In the Middle Ages, the area was controlled by the Ostrogoths , Gepids , Avars , Franks , West Slavic groups , again by the Byzantines, and finally by the Hungarians . It was a part of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary from its foundation in 1000 until the Ottoman invasion in the 16th century. Hungarians began to settle in the area, which before that time had been mostly populated by Slavs. The earliest known mention was as the Hungarian variant Peturwarad or Pétervárad (Serbian: Petrovaradin /Петроварадин), derived from the Byzantine variant, found in documents from 1237. That year, several other settlements were mentioned as existing in the territory of modern-day urban Novi Sad.

[ citation needed ] From the 13th century to the 16th century, the following settlements existed in the urban territory of the modern-day Novi Sad: [ 16 ] [ 17 ] on the right bank of the Danube: Pétervárad ( Serbian : Petrovaradin ) and Kamanc ( Serbian : Kamenica ).

on the left bank of the Danube: Baksa or Baksafalva ( Serbian : Bakša, Bakšić ), Kűszentmárton ( Serbian : Sent Marton ), Bivalyos or Bivalo ( Serbian : Bivaljoš, Bivalo ), Vásárosvárad or Várad ( Serbian : Vašaroš Varad, Varadinci ), Zajol I ( Serbian : Sajlovo I , Gornje Sajlovo, Gornje Isailovo ), Zajol II ( Serbian : Sajlovo II, Donje Sajlovo, Donje Isailovo ), Bistritz ( Serbian : Bistrica ). Some other settlements existed in the suburbs of Novi Sad: Mortályos (Serbian: Mrtvaljoš ), Csenei ( Serbian : Čenej ), Keménd ( Serbian : Kamendin ), Rév ( Serbian : Rivica ).

[ citation needed ] An etymology of settlement names reveals that some designations are of Slavic origin, which indicates that the areas were initially inhabited by Slavs, particularly the West Slavs . For example, Bivalo (Bivaljoš) had a large Slavic settlement dating from the 5th–6th centuries.

[ 16 ] Other names are of Hungarian origin (for example Bélakút, Kűszentmárton, Vásárosvárad, Rév), indicating that the settlements were inhabited by Hungarians before the Ottoman invasion in the 16th century.

[ 17 ] Some settlement names are of uncertain origin.

Tax records from 1522 show a mix of Hungarian and Slavic names among the inhabitants of these villages, including Slavic names like Bozso (Božo), Radovan, Radonya (Radonja), Ivo, etc. Following the Ottoman invasion in the 16th–17th centuries, some of these settlements were destroyed. Most of the surviving Hungarian inhabitants retreated from the area. Some of the settlements persisted under Ottoman rule and were populated by ethnic Serbs.

[ citation needed ] Between 1526 and 1687, the region was under Ottoman rule. In 1590, the population of all villages in the territory of present-day Novi Sad numbered 105 houses, inhabited exclusively by Serbs. Ottoman records mention only those who paid taxes, so the number of Serbs who lived in the area (for example, those that served in the Ottoman army ) was likely larger than was recorded.

[ 18 ] Founding of the city [ edit ] Habsburgs prohibited Orthodox Christians to settle in Petrovaradin . That policy pushed Serbs to form the Serb city which later became Novi Sad. The city was proclaimed to be a free royal city by Maria Theresa by 1748.

Habsburg rule was aligned with the Roman Catholic doctrine and, as it took over this area near the end of the 17th century, the government prohibited people of Orthodox faith from residing in Petrovaradin . Unable to build homes there, the Serbs of the area founded a new settlement in 1694 on the left bank of the Danube. They initially called it the 'Serb city' ( Serbian : Srpski Grad , German : Ratzen Stadt ). Another name used for the settlement was Petrovaradinski Šanac. In 1718, the inhabitants of the village of Almaš were resettled to Petrovaradinski Šanac, where they founded Almaški Kraj ('the Almaš quarter').

According to 1720 data, the population of Ratzen Stadt was composed of 112 Serbian, 14 German, and 5 Hungarian houses. The settlement officially gained the present names Novi Sad and Újvidék ( Neoplanta in Latin) in 1748 when it became a 'free royal city', in German language it was called Neusatz.

The edict that made Novi Sad a 'free royal city' was proclaimed on 1 February 1748. The edict reads: ' We, Maria Theresa , by the grace of God Holy Roman Empress , Queen of Hungary , Bohemia , Moravia , Dalmatia , Croatia , Slavonia , Rama , Serbia , Galicia , Lodomeria , Carinthia , [...] cast this proclamation to anyone, whom it might concern... so that the renowned Petrovaradinski Šanac, which lies on the other side of the Danube in the Bačka province on the Sajlovo land, by the might of our divine royal power and prestige...make this town a Free Royal City and to fortify, accept and acknowledge it as one of the free royal cities of our Kingdom of Hungary and other territories, by abolishing its previous name of Petrovaradinski Šanac, renaming it Neoplanta ( Latin ), Új-Vidégh ( Hungarian ), Neusatz (German) and Novi Sad ( Serbian ) ' In the 18th century, the Habsburg monarchy recruited Germans from the southern principalities of the Holy Roman Empire to relocate to the Danube valley. They wanted both to increase the population and to redevelop the river valley for agriculture, which had declined markedly under the Ottomans. To encourage such settlement, the government ensured that the German communities could practice their religion (mostly Catholicism) and use their original German dialect.

For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, Novi Sad remained the largest city inhabited by Serbs. The reformer of the Serbian language, Vuk Stefanović Karadžić , wrote in 1817 that Novi Sad was the 'largest Serb municipality in the world'. It was a cultural and political centre for Serbs (see also Serbian Revival ), who did not have their own national state at the time. Due to its cultural and political influence, the city became known as the 'Serbian Athens ' ( Srpska Atina in Serbian). According to 1843 data, Novi Sad had 17,332 inhabitants, of whom 9,675 were Orthodox Christians , 5,724 Catholics , 1,032 Protestants , 727 Jews, and 30 adherents of the Armenian church . The largest ethnic group in the city were Serbs, and the second largest were Germans .

Novi Sad panoramic view, 1920s Petrovaradin Podgrađe (Petrovaradin Inner City) and Petrovaradin Fortress , 1920s During the Revolution of 1848–49 , Novi Sad was part of Serbian Vojvodina , a Serbian autonomous region within the Austrian Empire. In 1849, the Hungarian garrison, located at the Petrovaradin Fortress, bombarded and devastated the city, which lost much of its population. According to the 1850 census, there were only 7,182 citizens left in the city, compared to 17,332 in 1843.

Marija Trandafil and her husband paid for some of the rebuilding including two churches.

[ 19 ] Between 1849 and 1860, Novi Sad was part of a separate Austrian crownland known as the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar . After the abolishment of this province, the city was included into the Batsch-Bodrog County. The post office was opened in 1853.

Following the compromise of 1867 , Novi Sad was located within the Kingdom of Hungary , the Transleithania , which comprised half of the new Austro-Hungarian Empire . During this time, the Magyarization policy of the Hungarian government drastically altered the demographic structure of the city as the formerly predominantly Serbian population became one with a more mixed character. In 1880, 41.2% of the city's inhabitants used the Serbian language most frequently and 25.9% employed Hungarian. In the following decades, the percentage of Serbian-speakers decreased, while the number of Hungarian-speakers increased. According to the 1910 census, the city had 33,590 residents, of whom 13,343 (39.72%) spoke Hungarian, 11,594 (34.52%) Serbian, 5,918 (17.62%) German and 1,453 (4.33%) Slovak. It is not certain whether Hungarians or Serbs were the larger ethnic group in the city in 1910, since the various ethnic groups ( Bunjevci , Romani , Jews, other South Slavic people, etc.) were classified in census results only according to the language they spoke.

[ 20 ] Similar demographic changes can be seen in the religious structure: in 1870, the population of Novi Sad included 8,134 Orthodox Christians, 6,684 Catholics, 1,725 Calvinists, 1,343 Lutherans, and others.

[ 21 ] In 1910, the population included 13,383 Roman Catholics and 11,553 Orthodox Christians, while 3,089 declared themselves as Lutheran , 2,751 as Calvinist , and 2,326 as Jewish.

[ 22 ] Serbia and Yugoslavia [ edit ] Great Assembly of Serbs , Bunjevci , and other Slavs proclaimed the unification of Vojvodina region with the Kingdom of Serbia in Novi Sad in 1918.

On 25 November 1918, the Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs of Vojvodina in Novi Sad proclaimed the union of the region of Vojvodina with the Kingdom of Serbia . From 1 December 1918, Novi Sad was part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes ; and in 1929, it became the capital of the Danube Banovina , a province of the newly named Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1921, the population of Novi Sad numbered 39,122 inhabitants, 16,293 of whom spoke the Serbian language, 12,991 Hungarian, 6,373 German, 1,117 Slovak, etc.

[ 23 ] In 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded and partitioned by the Axis powers , and its northern parts, including Novi Sad, were annexed by Hungary . During World War II , about 5,000 citizens were murdered and many others were resettled. During the three days of the Novi Sad raid (21–23 January 1942) alone, Hungarian police killed 1,246 citizens, among them more than 800 Jews, and threw their corpses into the icy waters of the Danube.

The total death toll of the raid was around 2,500.

[ 25 ] In 1975 the whole city was awarded the title People's Hero of Yugoslavia .

The Yugoslav Partisans of Syrmia and Bačka entered the city on 23 October 1944. During the military administration of Banat, Bačka and Baranja (17 October 1944 – 27 January 1945), the Partisans killed tens of thousands , mostly Serbs, Germans, and Hungarians, who were perceived as opponents to the new regime.

[ 26 ] [ better source needed ] Novi Sad became part of the new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . Since 1945, Novi Sad has been the capital of Vojvodina , a province of the Republic of Serbia . The city went through rapid industrialization and its population more than doubled in the period between World War II and the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.

After 1992, Novi Sad became a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . Devastated by NATO bombardment during the Kosovo War of 1999, Novi Sad was left without any of its three Danube bridges ( Žeželj Bridge , Varadin Bridge and Liberty Bridge ), communications, water, and electricity. Residential areas were cluster-bombed several times while the oil refinery was bombarded daily, causing severe pollution and widespread ecological damage. In 2003, FR Yugoslavia was transformed into the state union of Serbia and Montenegro . These two states separated in June 2006 (following the May 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum ), leaving Novi Sad part of the Republic of Serbia .

On 1 November 2024, the canopy of the main railway station in Novi Sad collapsed, killing sixteen people . The incident sparked a series of mass protests against government corruption.

[ 27 ] Geography [ edit ] Novi Sad, Stari Grad (Old Town) panoramic view, 2022 The city lies on the meander of the river Danube, which is only 350 meters wide beneath the marking stones of Petrovaradin.

[ 28 ] A section of the Danube-Tisza-Danube Canal marks the northern edge of the wider city centre. The main part of the city lies on the left bank of the Danube in the region of Bačka , while the smaller settlements of Petrovaradin and Sremska Kamenica lie on the right bank, in the region of Srem (Syrmia). The section situated on the left bank of the river lies on one of the southernmost and lowest parts of the Pannonian Plain , while Fruška Gora on the right bank is a horst mountain.

Alluvial plains along the Danube are well-formed, especially on the left bank, and in some parts 10 kilometres (6 miles) from the river. A large part of Novi Sad lies on a fluvial terrace with an elevation of between 80 and 83 metres (262 and 272 feet). The northern part of Fruška Gora is composed of massive landslide zones, although they are largely inactive with the exception of the Ribnjak neighbourhood between Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin Fortress .

[ 29 ] The total land area of the city is 699 square kilometres (270 sq mi), while its urban area spans 129.7 km 2 (50 sq mi).

[ 28 ] Climate [ edit ] Novi Sad has a humid subtropical climate ( Köppen climate classification : Cfa ) [ 30 ] closely bordering on humid continental climate ( Dfa ) with a January mean of 0.7 °C (33.3 °F). The city experiences four distinct seasons. Autumn is drier than spring, with long sunny and warm periods. Winter is not so severe, with an average of 22 days of complete sub-zero temperature, and averages 22 days of snowfall. January is the coldest month, with an average low of −2.5 °C (27.5 °F). Spring is usually short and rainy, while summer arrives abruptly. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Novi Sad was −30.7 °C (−23.3 °F) on 24 January 1963, and the hottest temperature ever recorded was 41.6 °C (106.9 °F) on 24 July 2007.

Panoramic view from the Petrovaradin Fortress The east-southeasterly wind, known as Košava , blows from the Carpathians and brings clear and dry weather. It mostly blows in autumn and winter, in 2 to 3-day intervals. The average speed of Košava is 25 to 43 km/h (16 to 27 mph), but gusts can sometimes reach up to 130 km/h (81 mph). In wintertime, accompanied by snow storms , the winds can cause large snow-drifts.

( June 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) See also: List of buildings in Novi Sad Liman residential towers, city's tallest buildings Novi Sad is a typical Central European town in terms of its architecture. The Town Hall and the Court House were built by Emmerich Kitzweger (1868–1917). The city was almost completely destroyed during the 1848/1849 revolution , so architecture from the 19th century dominates the city centre . Small, older houses used to surround the centre of town, but they are now being replaced by modern, multi-story buildings.

During the socialist period, new city blocks with wide streets and multi-story buildings were constructed around the city core. However, not many communist-style high-rise buildings were erected. The total number of apartment buildings , with ten or more floors, remained at about 50, the rest having mostly three to six floors. From 1962 to 1964, a new boulevard , today called Bulevar oslobođenja , was cut through the older neighbourhoods, establishing major communication lines. Several more boulevards were subsequently built in a similar manner, creating an orthogonal network which replaced the primarily radial structure of the old town. These interventions paved the way for a relatively unhampered growth of the city, which has almost tripled in population since the 1950s. Despite a huge increase in car ownership, traffic congestion is still relatively mild, apart from a few major arteries.

Neighbourhoods [ edit ] Main article: Neighborhoods of Novi Sad Dunavska street in Stari Grad Beogradska street in Petrovaradin Some of the oldest neighbourhoods in the city are Stari Grad (Old Town), Rotkvarija , Podbara , and Salajka . The areas of Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin , located on the right bank of the Danube, were separate towns in the past, but today belong to the urban area of Novi Sad.

Liman , as well as Bistrica , are neighbourhoods built during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, with contemporary style buildings and wide boulevards ( Liman was divided into four sections, numbered I–IV).

New neighbourhoods, like Liman , Detelinara , and Bistrica , emerged from the fields and forests surrounding the city. Following World War II, tall residential buildings were constructed to house the huge influx of people leaving the country side. Many old houses in the city centre, from the Rotkvarija and Bulevar neighbourhoods, were torn down in the 1950s and 1960s, to be replaced by multi-story buildings.  Since the city has experienced a major construction boom in the last 10 years, some neighbourhoods like Adamovićevo Naselje have completely been transformed.

Neighbourhoods with single-family homes are mostly located away from the city centre.

Telep , situated in the southwest, and Klisa , in the north, are the oldest such neighborhoods.

Adice and Veternik , both located west of the downtown area, have significantly expanded during the last 15 years, partly due to the influx of Serbian refugees fleeing the Yugoslav wars .

Suburbs [ edit ] Some 43,000 inhabitants or 11.7% of the administrative city's total population resides in the 11 rural settlements, ouside its urban area.

[ 34 ] Ledinci , Stari Ledinci , and Bukovac are all located on Fruška Gora slopes, with Stari Ledinci being the most isolated and least populated village. Towns and villages in the adjacent municipalities of Sremski Karlovci , Temerin , and Beočin share the same public transportation system and are economically tied to Novi Sad.

[ 63 ] During the 1990s, the city, like the rest of Serbia, was severely affected by an internationally imposed trade embargo and hyperinflation of the Yugoslav dinar . The embargo, along with economic mismanagement, led to a decay or demise of once important industrial combines, such as Novkabel (electric cable industry), Pobeda (metal industry), Jugoalat (tools), Albus and HINS (chemical industry). Practically the only viable large facilities remaining today are the oil refinery, located northeast of the city, and the thermal power plant .

The economy of Novi Sad has mostly recovered from that period and grown strongly since 2001, shifting from an industry-driven economy to the tertiary sector .
