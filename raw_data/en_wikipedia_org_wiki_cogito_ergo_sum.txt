[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"), who published the phrase in _[Discourse on the Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse\_on\_the\_Method "Discourse on the Method")_, in 1637

The Latin **_cogito, ergo sum_**, usually translated into English as "**I think, therefore I am**",[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-better_translation-1) is the "[first principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle "First principle")" of [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes")' philosophy. He originally published it in French as **_je pense_, _donc je suis_** in his 1637 _[Discourse on the Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse\_on\_the\_Method "Discourse on the Method")_, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-2) It later appeared in Latin in his _[Principles of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles\_of\_Philosophy "Principles of Philosophy")_, and a similar phrase also featured prominently in his _[Meditations on First Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations\_on\_First\_Philosophy "Meditations on First Philosophy")_. The [dictum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictum "Dictum") is also sometimes referred to as **the cogito**.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-3) As Descartes explained in a [margin note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia "Marginalia"), "we cannot [doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubt "Doubt") of our [existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence "Existence") while we doubt." In the posthumously published _[The Search for Truth by Natural Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Search\_for\_Truth\_by\_Natural\_Light "The Search for Truth by Natural Light")_, he expressed this insight as _**dubito, ergo sum**, vel, quod idem est, **cogito, ergo sum**_ ("I doubt, therefore I am — or what is the same — I think, therefore I am").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-AT-4)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-Hintikka-5)[Antoine Léonard Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_L%C3%A9onard_Thomas "Antoine Léonard Thomas"), in a 1765 essay in honor of Descartes presented it as _dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum_ ("I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am").[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-6)

Descartes's statement became a fundamental element of [Western philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy "Western philosophy"), as it purported to provide a [certain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certainty "Certainty")[foundation for knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") in the face of [radical doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemological_skepticism "Epistemological skepticism"). While other knowledge could be a figment of imagination, deception, or mistake, Descartes asserted that the very act of doubting one's own existence served—at minimum—as proof of the reality of one's own mind; there must be a [thinking entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness")—in this case the [self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self "Self")—for there to be a thought.

One critique of the dictum, first suggested by [Pierre Gassendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gassendi "Pierre Gassendi"), is that it presupposes that there is an "I" which must be doing the thinking. According to this line of criticism, the most that Descartes was entitled to say was that "thinking is occurring", not that "I am thinking".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-7)

In Descartes's writings
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cogito,_ergo_sum&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: In Descartes's writings")]

Descartes first wrote the phrase in French in his 1637 _[Discourse on the Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse\_on\_the\_Method "Discourse on the Method")_. He referred to it in Latin without explicitly stating the familiar form of the phrase in his 1641 _[Meditations on First Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations\_on\_First\_Philosophy "Meditations on First Philosophy")_. The earliest written record of the phrase in Latin is in his 1644 _[Principles of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles\_of\_Philosophy "Principles of Philosophy")_, where, in a margin note (see below), he provides a clear explanation of his intent: "[W]e cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt". Fuller forms of the phrase are attributable to other authors.

### _Discourse on the Method_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cogito,_ergo_sum&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Discourse on the Method")]

The phrase first appeared (in French) in Descartes's 1637 _[Discourse on the Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse\_on\_the\_Method "Discourse on the Method")_ in the first paragraph of its fourth part:

Ainsi, à cause que nos sens nous trompent quelquefois, je voulus supposer qu'il n'y avait aucune chose qui fût telle qu'ils nous la font imaginer; Et parce qu'il y a des hommes qui se méprennent en raisonnant, même touchant les plus simples matières de Géométrie, et y font des Paralogismes, jugeant que j'étais sujet à faillir autant qu'aucun autre, je rejetai comme fausses toutes les raisons que j'avais prises auparavant pour Démonstrations; Et enfin, considérant que toutes les mêmes pensées que nous avons étant éveillés nous peuvent aussi venir quand nous dormons, sans qu'il y en ait aucune raison pour lors qui soit vraie, je me résolus de feindre que toutes les choses qui m'étaient jamais entrées en l'esprit n'étaient non plus vraies que les illusions de mes songes. Mais aussitôt après je pris garde que, pendant que je voulais ainsi penser que tout était faux, il fallait nécessairement que moi qui le pensais fusse quelque chose; Et remarquant que cette vérité, _**je pense,donc je suis**_,[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-formatting-8) était si ferme et si assurée, que toutes les plus extravagantes suppositions des Sceptiques n'étaient pas capables de l'ébranler, je jugeai que je pouvais la recevoir sans scrupule pour le premier principe de la Philosophie que je cherchais.[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-formatting2-9)[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-10)Accordingly, seeing that our senses sometimes deceive us, I was willing to suppose that there existed nothing really such as they presented to us; And because some men err in reasoning, and fall into [Paralogisms](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paralogism "wiktionary:paralogism"), even on the simplest matters of Geometry, I, convinced that I was as open to error as any other, rejected as false all the reasonings I had hitherto taken for Demonstrations; And finally, when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations) which we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are asleep, while there is at that time not one of them true, I supposed that all the objects (presentations) that had ever entered into my mind when awake, had in them no more truth than the illusions of my dreams. But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus thought, should be something; And as I observed that this truth, _**I think,therefore I am**_,[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-formatting-8) was so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged by the Sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might, without scruple, accept it as the [first principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle "First principle") of the philosophy of which I was in search.[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-15)[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-18)

### _Meditations on First Philosophy_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cogito,_ergo_sum&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Meditations on First Philosophy")]

In 1641, Descartes published (in Latin) _[Meditations on first philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations\_on\_first\_philosophy "Meditations on first philosophy")_ in which he referred to the proposition, though not explicitly as "cogito, ergo sum" in Meditation II:

hoc pronuntiatum: **Ego sum, Ego existo**,[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-formatting3-19) quoties a me profertur, vel mente concipitur, necessario esse verum.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-Descartes1641-20)this proposition: **I am, I exist**,[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-formatting3-19) whenever it is uttered by me, or conceived by the mind, necessarily is true.[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-21)[[j]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-22)

In Response to an Objection from [Marin Mersenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Mersenne "Marin Mersenne"), he wrote "cogito, ergo sum” in an extended form and, again, prefaced with ‘ego’:

Cum advertimus nos esse res cogitantes, prima quædam notio est quæ ex nullo syllogismo concluditur; neque etiam cum quis dicit ‘**ego cogito, ergo sum, sive existo**,’[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-formatting3-19) existentiam ex cogitatione per syllogismum deducit, sed tanquam rem per se notam simplici mentis intuitu agnoscit.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDescartes1641189-23)And when we become aware that we are thinking things, this is a primary notion which is not derived by means of any syllogism. When someone says '**I am thinking, therefore I am, or I exist**’[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-formatting3-19) he does not deduce existence from thought by means of a syllogism, but recognizes it as something self-evident by a simple intuition of the mind.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-24)

### _Principles of Philosophy_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cogito,_ergo_sum&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Principles of Philosophy")]

In 1644, Descartes published (in Latin) his _[Principles of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles\_of\_Philosophy "Principles of Philosophy")_ which begins _Veritatem inquirenti semel in vita da omnibus, quantum fieri potest, esse dubitandum._ (That in order to seek truth, it is necessary once in the course of our life, to doubt, as far as possible, of all things.[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-GutPrinc4391-25)) The phrase "ego cogito, ergo sum" appears in Part 1, article 7:

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/1644_Principia_Philosophae.jpg/250px-1644_Principia_Philosophae.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1644_Principia_Philosophae.jpg)

"ego cogito, ergo sum" with margin note in original (1644) Principia Philosophae

Sic autem rejicientes illa omnia, de quibus aliquo modo possumus dubitare, ac etiam, falsa esse fingentes, facilè quidem, supponimus nullum esse Deum, nullum coelum, nulla corpora; nosque etiam ipsos, non habere manus, nec pedes, nec denique ullum corpus, non autem ideò nos qui talia cogitamus nihil esse: repugnat enim ut putemus id quod cogitat eo ipso tempore quo cogitat non existere. Ac proinde haec cognitio, _**ego cogito, ergo sum**_,[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-formatting-8) est omnium prima & certissima, quae cuilibet ordine philosophanti occurrat.[[l]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-26)While we thus reject all of which we can entertain the smallest doubt, and even imagine that it is false, we easily indeed suppose that there is neither God, nor sky, nor bodies, and that we ourselves even have neither hands nor feet, nor, finally, a body; but we cannot in the same way suppose that we are not while we doubt of the truth of these things; for there is a repugnance in conceiving that what thinks does not exist at the very time when it thinks. Accordingly, the knowledge,[[m]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-29)_**I think, therefore I am**_,[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-formatting-8) is the first and most certain that occurs to one who philosophizes orderly.[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-GutPrinc4391-25)

Descartes's [margin note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia "Marginalia") for the above paragraph is:

Non posse à nobis dubitari, quin existamus dum dubitamus; atque hoc esse primum, quod ordine philosophando cognoscimus.That we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt, and that this is the first knowledge we acquire when we philosophize in order.[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-GutPrinc4391-25)

### _The Search for Truth by Natural Light_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cogito,_ergo_sum&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: The Search for Truth by Natural Light")]

Descartes, in a lesser-known posthumously published work written ca. 1647,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-30) originally in French with the title _La Recherche de la Vérité par La Lumiere Naturale_ (_[The Search for Truth by Natural Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Search\_for\_Truth\_by\_Natural\_Light "The Search for Truth by Natural Light")_)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-AT-4) and later in Latin with the title _Inquisitio Veritatis per Lumen Naturale_,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-31) provides his only known phrasing of **the cogito** as _**cogito, ergo sum**_ and admits that his insight is also expressible as _**dubito, ergo sum**_:[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-Hintikka-5)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Dubito%2C_ergo_sum.jpg/250px-Dubito%2C_ergo_sum.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dubito,_ergo_sum.jpg)

"dubito, ergo sum, vel, quod idem est, cogito, ergo sum" in _Inquisitio Veritatis per Lumen Naturale_

... [S]entio, oportere, ut quid dubitatio, quid cogitatio, quid exsistentia sit antè sciamus, quàm de veritate hujus ratiocinii: _**dubito, ergo sum**_, vel, quod idem est, _**cogito, ergo sum**_[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-formatting-8): plane simus persuasi.… [I feel that] it is necessary to know what doubt is, and what thought is, [what existence is], before we can be fully persuaded of this reasoning — _**I doubt, therefore I am**_ — or what is the same — _**I think, therefore I am**_.[[n]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-33)

### "_ego cogito, ergo sum_" or "_cogito, ergo sum_"?

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cogito,_ergo_sum&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: \"ego cogito, ergo sum\" or \"cogito, ergo sum\"?")]

Peter J. Markie notes: "Descartes stresses the first person in his premise twice in the Principles and once in his Reply to Mersenne. _ego cogito, ergo sum_ . . . . (AT VIII, 7; AT VIII, 8; AT VII, 140)" and adds "It is unlikely that Descartes would stress the first person in his premise, if he wanted us to read the premise as 'Thought is taking place' rather than 'I think.'"[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-34) Gary Hatfield writes: "[I]n Latin the first-person voice need not be expressed through a separate pronoun, but may be included in the verb form; nonetheless, Descartes used the Latin first-person pronoun _ego_ more than thirty times in the six Meditations."[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-35)

The proposition is sometimes given as _dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum_. This form was penned by the French literary critic, [Antoine Léonard Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_L%C3%A9onard_Thomas "Antoine Léonard Thomas"),[[o]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-37) in an award-winning 1765 essay in praise of Descartes, where it appeared as "_Puisque je doute, je pense; puisque je pense, j'existe_" ('Since I doubt, I think; since I think, I exist'). With rearrangement and compaction, the passage translates to "I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am," or in Latin, "_dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum_."[[p]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-42) This aptly captures Descartes's intent as expressed in his posthumously published _La Recherche de la Vérité par La Lumiere Naturale_ as noted above: _**I doubt, therefore I am**_ — or what is the same — _**I think, therefore I am**_.

A further expansion, _dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum—res cogitans_ ("…—a thinking thing") extends the _cogito_ with Descartes's statement in the subsequent _Meditation_, _"Ego sum res cogitans, id est dubitans, affirmans, negans, pauca intelligens, multa ignorans, volens, nolens, imaginans etiam et sentiens…"_ ("I am a thinking [conscious] thing, that is, a being who doubts, affirms, denies, knows a few objects, and is ignorant of many, [who loves, hates,][[q]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-43) wills, refuses, who imagines likewise, and perceives").[[r]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-45) This has been referred to as "the expanded _cogito_."[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-Kline1967-46)[[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-49)

### "I am thinking" vs. "I think"

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cogito,_ergo_sum&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: \"I am thinking\" vs. \"I think\"")]

While the Latin _cōgitō_ may be translated rather easily as "I think/ponder/visualize", _je pense_ does not indicate whether the verb form corresponds to the English [simple present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_present "Simple present") ("think") or [progressive aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_and_progressive_aspects "Continuous and progressive aspects") ("is thinking").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-50) Following [John Lyons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lyons_(linguist) "John Lyons (linguist)") (1982),[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-51) Vladimir Žegarac notes, "The temptation to use the simple present is said to arise from the lack of progressive forms in Latin and French, and from a misinterpretation of the meaning of _cogito_ as habitual or generic" (cf. [gnomic aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomic_aspect "Gnomic aspect")).[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-52) Also following Lyons, [Ann Banfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Banfield "Ann Banfield") writes, "In order for the statement on which Descartes's argument depends to represent certain knowledge,… its tense must be a true present—in English, a progressive,… not as 'I think' but as 'I am thinking, in conformity with the general translation of the Latin or French present tense in such nongeneric, nonstative contexts."[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-53) Or in the words of [Simon Blackburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Blackburn "Simon Blackburn"), "Descartes's premise is not 'I think' in the sense of 'I ski', which can be true even if you are not at the moment skiing. It is supposed to be parallel to 'I am skiing'."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-Blackburn1999-54)

The similar translation "I am thinking, therefore I exist" of Descartes's correspondence in French ("_je pense_, _donc je suis_") appears in _The Philosophical Writings of Descartes_ by Cottingham et al. (1988).[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-CSMK_III-55): 247

The earliest known translation as "I am thinking, therefore I am" is from 1872 by [Charles Porterfield Krauth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Porterfield_Krauth "Charles Porterfield Krauth").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-Krauth-56)[[t]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-58)

Fumitaka Suzuki writes "Taking consideration of Cartesian theory of continuous creation, which theory was developed especially in the Meditations and in the Principles, we would assure that 'I am thinking, therefore I am/exist' is the most appropriate English translation of 'ego cogito, ergo sum'."[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-59)

### "I exist" vs. "I am"

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cogito,_ergo_sum&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: \"I exist\" vs. \"I am\"")]

Alexis Deodato S. Itao notes that _cogito, ergo sum_ is "literally 'I think, therefore I am'."[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-60) Others differ: 1) "[A] precise English translation will read as 'I am thinking, therefore I exist';[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-61) and 2) "[S]ince Descartes ... emphasized that existence is such an important 'notion,' a better translation is 'I am thinking, therefore I exist.'"[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-62)

Descartes wrote this phrase as such only once, in the posthumously published lesser-known work noted above, _[The Search for Truth by Natural Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Search\_for\_Truth\_by\_Natural\_Light "The Search for Truth by Natural Light")_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-AT-4) It appeared there mid-sentence, uncapitalized, and with a comma. (Commas were not used in [Classical Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Latin "Classical Latin")[[u]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-64) but were a regular feature of scholastic Latin,[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-65) the Latin Descartes "had learned in a Jesuit college at La Flèche.")[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-66) Most modern reference works show it with a comma, but it is often presented without a comma in academic work and in popular usage. In Descartes's [_Principia Philosophiae_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Philosophy "Principles of Philosophy"), the proposition appears as _**ego cogito, ergo sum**_.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-Descartes1644-67)

As put succinctly by [Krauth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Porterfield_Krauth "Charles Porterfield Krauth") (1872), "That cannot doubt which does not think, and that cannot think which does not exist. I doubt, I think, I exist."[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-Krauth-56)

The phrase _cogito, ergo sum_ is not used in Descartes's _[Meditations on First Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations\_on\_First\_Philosophy "Meditations on First Philosophy")_, but the term "the _cogito_" is used to refer to an argument from it. In the _Meditations_, Descartes phrases the conclusion of the argument as "that the proposition, _I am, I exist,_ is [necessarily true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_truth "Logical truth") whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind" (_Meditation_ II). [George Henry Lewes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Henry_Lewes "George Henry Lewes") says Descartes "has told us that [his objective] was to find a starting point from which to reason—to find an irreversible certainty. And where did he find this? In his own consciousness. Doubt as I may, I cannot doubt of my own existence, because my very doubts reveal to me a something which doubts. You may call this an assumption, if you will; I point out the fact as one above and beyond all logic; which logic can neither prove nor disprove; but which must always remain an irreversible certainty, and as such a fitting basis of philosophy."[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-68)

At the beginning of the second meditation, having reached what he considers to be the ultimate level of doubt—his argument from the existence of a deceiving god—Descartes examines his beliefs to see if any have survived the doubt. In his belief in his own existence, he finds that it is impossible to doubt that he exists. Even if there were a deceiving god (or an [evil demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon "Evil demon")), one's belief in their own existence would be secure, for there is no way one could be deceived unless one existed in order to be deceived.

> But I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I, too, do not exist? No. If I convinced myself of something [or thought anything at all], then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who deliberately and constantly deceives me. In that case, I, too, undoubtedly exist, if he deceives me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as I think that I am something. So, after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that the proposition, _I am, I exist,_ is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind. (AT VII 25; CSM II 16–17)[[v]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-abbreviations-70)

There are three important notes to keep in mind here. First, he claims only the certainty of _his own_ existence from the first-person point of view — he has not proved the existence of other minds at this point. This is something that has to be thought through by each of us for ourselves, as we follow the course of the meditations. Second, he does not say that his existence is necessary; he says that _if he thinks_, then necessarily he exists (see the [instantiation principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantiation_principle "Instantiation principle")). Third, this proposition "I am, I exist" is held true not based on a deduction (as mentioned above) or on empirical induction but on the clarity and self-evidence of the proposition. Descartes does not use this first certainty, the _cogito_, as a foundation upon which to build further knowledge; rather, it is the firm ground upon which he can stand as he works to discover further truths.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-71) As he puts it:

> [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order to shift the entire earth; so I too can hope for great things if I manage to find just one thing, however slight, that is certain and unshakable. (AT VII 24; CSM II 16)[[v]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-abbreviations-70)

According to many Descartes specialists, including [Étienne Gilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Gilson "Étienne Gilson"), the goal of Descartes in establishing this first truth is to demonstrate the capacity of his criterion — the immediate clarity and distinctiveness of self-evident propositions — to establish true and justified propositions despite having adopted a method of generalized doubt. As a consequence of this demonstration, Descartes considers science and mathematics to be justified to the extent that their proposals are established on a similarly immediate clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence that presents itself to the mind. The originality of Descartes's thinking, therefore, is not so much in expressing the _cogito_—a feat accomplished by other predecessors, as we shall see—but on using the _cogito_ as demonstrating the most fundamental epistemological principle, that science and mathematics are justified by relying on clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence. [Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza "Baruch Spinoza") in "_[Principia philosophiae cartesianae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia\_philosophiae\_cartesianae "Principia philosophiae cartesianae")_" at its _Prolegomenon_ identified "cogito ergo sum" the "_ego sum cogitans_" (I am a thinking being) as the thinking [substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory "Substance theory") with his [ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") interpretation.

Although the idea expressed in _cogito, ergo sum_ is widely attributed to Descartes, he was not the first to mention it. In the late sixth or early fifth century BC, [Parmenides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides "Parmenides") is quoted as saying "For to be aware and to be are the same". (Fragment B3) [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") spoke about the "knowledge of knowledge" ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): νόησις νοήσεως, _nóesis noéseos_) and [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") explains the idea in full length:

> But if life itself is good and pleasant…and if one who sees is conscious that he sees, one who hears that he hears, one who walks that he walks and similarly for all the other human activities there is a faculty that is conscious of their exercise, so that whenever we perceive, we are conscious that we perceive, and whenever we think, we are conscious that we think, and to be conscious that we are perceiving or thinking is to be conscious that we exist... (_[Nicomachean Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean\_Ethics "Nicomachean Ethics")_, 1170a 25 ff.)

The Cartesian statement was interpreted to be an Aristotelian [syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism "Syllogism") where the premise that all thinkers are also [beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being "Being") is not made explicit.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-72)

In the early fifth century AD, [Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo") in _[De Civitate Dei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City\_of\_God\_(book) "City of God (book)")_ (book XI, 26) affirmed his certain knowledge of his own existence, and added: "So far as these truths are concerned, I do not at all fear the arguments of the Academics when they say, What if you are mistaken? For if I am mistaken, I exist."[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-73)[[w]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-74) This formulation (_si fallor, sum_) is sometimes called the Augustinian _cogito_.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-75) In 1640, Descartes wrote to thank Andreas Colvius (a friend of Descartes's mentor, [Isaac Beeckman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Beeckman "Isaac Beeckman")) for drawing his attention to Augustine:

> I am obliged to you for drawing my attention to the passage of St Augustine relevant to my _I am thinking, therefore I exist_. I went today to the library of this town to read it, and I do indeed find that he does use it to prove the certainty of our existence. He goes on to show that there is a certain likeness of the Trinity in us, in that we exist, we know that we exist, and we love the existence and the knowledge we have. I, on the other hand, use the argument to show that this _I_ which is thinking is an immaterial substance with no bodily element. These are two very different things. In itself it is such a simple and natural thing to infer that one exists from the fact that one is doubting that it could have occurred to any writer. But I am very glad to find myself in agreement with St Augustine, if only to hush the little minds who have tried to find fault with the principle.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-CSMK_III-55): 159

The 8th century Hindu philosopher [Adi Shankara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara "Adi Shankara") wrote, in a similar fashion, that no one thinks 'I am not', arguing that one's existence cannot be doubted, as there must be someone there to doubt.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-Radhakrishnan.S-77)

In _Descartes, The Project of Pure Enquiry_, English philosopher [Bernard Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Williams "Bernard Williams") provides a history and full evaluation of this issue.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-:1-80) The first to raise the "I" problem was [Pierre Gassendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gassendi "Pierre Gassendi"), who in his _Disquisitio Metaphysica_,[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-81) as noted by Saul Fisher, "points out that recognition that one has a set of thoughts does not imply that one is a particular thinker or another. …[T]he only claim that is indubitable here is the agent-independent claim that there is cognitive activity present."[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-82)

The objection, as presented by [Georg Lichtenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Christoph_Lichtenberg "Georg Christoph Lichtenberg"), is that rather than supposing an entity that is thinking, Descartes should have said: "thinking is occurring." That is, whatever the force of the _cogito_, Descartes draws too much from it; the existence of a thinking thing, the reference of the "I," is more than the _cogito_ can justify. [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche "Friedrich Nietzsche") criticized the phrase in that it presupposes that there is an "I", that there is such an activity as "thinking", and that "I" know what "thinking" is. He suggested a more appropriate phrase would be "it thinks" wherein the "it" could be an [impersonal subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_pronoun "Dummy pronoun") as in the sentence "It is raining."[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-thinkingisoccurring-83)

The Danish philosopher [Søren Kierkegaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard "Søren Kierkegaard") called the phrase a [tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic) "Tautology (logic)") in his _[Concluding Unscientific Postscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concluding\_Unscientific\_Postscript "Concluding Unscientific Postscript")_.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-:0-84): 38–42  He argues that the _cogito_ already presupposes the existence of "I", and therefore concluding with existence is logically trivial. Kierkegaard's argument can be made clearer if one extracts the premise "I think" into the premises "'x' thinks" and "I am that 'x'", where "x" is used as a placeholder in order to disambiguate the "I" from the thinking thing.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-85)

Here, the _cogito_ has already assumed the "I"'s existence as that which thinks. For Kierkegaard, Descartes is merely "developing the content of a concept", namely that the "I", which already exists, thinks.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-:0-84): 40  As Kierkegaard argues, the proper logical flow of argument is that existence is already assumed or presupposed in order for thinking to occur, not that existence is concluded from that thinking.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-86)

Williams himself claimed that what we are dealing with when we talk of thought, or when we say "I am thinking," is something conceivable from a [third-person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person "Grammatical person") perspective—namely objective "thought-events" in the former case, and an [objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy) "Objectivity (philosophy)") thinker in the latter. He argues, first, that it is impossible to make sense of "there is thinking" without relativizing it to _something._ However, this something cannot be Cartesian egos, because it is impossible to differentiate objectively between things just on the basis of the pure content of consciousness. The obvious problem is that, through [introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection "Introspection"), or our experience of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness"), we have no way of moving to conclude the existence of any third-personal fact, to conceive of which would require something above and beyond just the purely subjective contents of the mind.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-:1-80)

As a critic of [Cartesian subjectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_Self "Cartesian Self"), German philosopher [Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger "Martin Heidegger") sought to ground human subjectivity in death as that certainty which individualizes and authenticates our Being ([Dasein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein "Dasein")). As he wrote in 1925 in _History of the Concept of Time_:[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-87)

> This certainty, that "I myself _am_, in that I will die," is the basic certainty of [Dasein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein "Dasein") itself. It is a genuine statement of Dasein, while _cogito sum_ is only the semblance of such a statement. If such pointed formulations mean anything at all, then the appropriate statement pertaining to Dasein in its being would have to be _sum moribundus_ [I am in dying], _moribundus_ not as someone gravely ill or wounded, but insofar as I am, I am _moribundus_. The _MORIBUNDUS_ first gives the _SUM_ its sense.

The Scottish philosopher [John Macmurray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Macmurray "John Macmurray") rejected the _cogito_ outright in order to place action at the center of a philosophical system he entitled the Form of the Personal. "We must reject this, both as standpoint and as method. If this be philosophy, then philosophy is a bubble floating in an atmosphere of unreality."[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-88) The reliance on thought creates an irreconcilable dualism between thought and action in which the [unity](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unity "wikt:unity") of experience is lost, thus dissolving the integrity of our selves and destroying any connection with reality. In order to formulate a more adequate _cogito_, Macmurray proposes the substitution of "I do" for "I think," ultimately leading to a belief in God as an agent to whom all persons stand in relation.

### Alfred North Whitehead

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cogito,_ergo_sum&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Alfred North Whitehead")]

In _Process and Reality_, Whitehead wrote "Descartes in his own philosophy conceives the thinker as creating the occasional thought. The philosophy of organism inverts the order, and conceives the thought as a constituent operation in the creation of the occasional thinker. The thinker is the final end whereby there is the thought. In this inversion we have the final contrast between a philosophy of substance and a philosophy of organism."[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#cite_note-89)
