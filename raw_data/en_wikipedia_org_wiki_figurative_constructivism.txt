The term was introduced by Franz Seiwert in 1929 using the phrase "gegenständlichen constructive", and this was subsequently taken up by Gerd Arntz and then by art historians more generally.

[ 1 ] It is closely related to the development of the Isotype . As Seiwert wrote "From the expressionist-cubist art-form abstract constructivism was developed, which in turn led into Figurative Constructivism".

[ 2 ] a bis z [ edit ] In October 1929 Seiwert, Heinrich Hoerle and Walter Stern produced the first issue of A bis Z , subtitled "organ of the progressive artists group". It featured five artists from four towns: Seiwert and Hoerle ( Cologne ), Augustin Tschinkel ( Prague ), Peter Alma ( Amsterdam ) and Arntz ( Vienna ).

[ 1 ] Tschinkel and Alma were both colleagues of Arntz at the Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum run by Otto Neurath in Vienna.

[ 1 ] Isostat [ edit ] The Figurative constructivist approach was adopted by Ivan Ivanitsky of Lenizogiz in Moscow .
