Fellow of American Council of Learned Societies, 1994–95 2015 USC MFA Controversy [ edit ] Approximately one year after moving to USC to take the position of Vice Dean of Research at USC's Roski School of Art and Design, Jones was embroiled in a controversy regarding the school's MFA program in visual arts. Facing an administrative restructuring of the program, including significant retroactive changes in the funding initially offered to MFA candidates and the departures of then-director A.L. Steiner and faculty member Frances Stark, the entire MFA class of 2016 withdrew from the program.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In October of 2015, these events were discussed in a roundtable in Artforum, which included Steiner, Stark, program faculty member Charlie White, program alumna Amanda Ross-Ho, and former MFA candidate Lee Relvas. The goal of this roundtable, in part, was to address "the drastic restructuring and reduction in funding for the school's renowned graduate program by a new dean's administration." [ 17 ] In her role as administrator, Jones responded to what she perceived as "inaccurate claims about Roski and USC" published in this roundtable. Rebutting this response, a number of faculty, alumni, and former MFA candidate accused Jones of a series of misrepresentations and omissions. "The Roski school’s current administration," they argued, "has undermined the fabric of contemporary art practice through a consolidation of power and singularity of voice," asserting that such a process was "emblematized by Jones’s letter." [ 18 ] By 2016, the last-remaining student in the MFA program—HaeAhn Kwon—had also dropped out. In a letter to USC Provost Michael Quick, she stated that it was "it was absurd to read the published words of Vice Dean Jones claiming the MFA program to be “alive and well” in Artforum ," and referred to Jones as part of a "delusional administration."
