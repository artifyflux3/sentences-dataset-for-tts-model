[ 1 ] Education [ edit ] Cleaver began his undergraduate studies at Antioch College in 1962, graduating with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1967. At Antioch, Cleaver became involved in the American Civil Rights Movement and began his lifelong engagement with political activism.

In 1967, Cleaver enrolled at Stanford University to begin a PhD in economics. While at Stanford, Cleaver was active in the Anti-war Movement . As a student activist opposed to the Vietnam War , Cleaver protested the Stanford Research Institute 's connection to the United States Department of Defense , which became the impetus for his dissertation research into the connections between the Green Revolution and social engineering .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Cleaver's frustrations with mainstream economic theory during this period in his studies led him to embrace Marxism .

From 1974 to 1976, Cleaver was a visiting assistant professor at the New School for Social Research in the department of economics.
