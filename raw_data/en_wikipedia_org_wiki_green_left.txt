Find sources: "Green left" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( October 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The term green left refers primarily to a political affiliation that combines elements of green politics and left-wing politics in countries where the term is used.

[ 1 ] It is primarily a social justice and human rights oriented ideology, with an expansion in focus to the rights of other species . It is often used in contrast with center-left green parties , that attempt to reconcile their environmental goals with a capitalistic framework, and, rarely, center-right green parties (like the Latvian Green Party and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico ), that hold anti-feminist views.

Examples of "green left" parties include GroenLinks in the Netherlands, the Green Party of the United States , the Left-Green Movement in Iceland, and the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand .

The name " Green Left " is also used by a variety of organisations which espouse socialist or Marxist principles, but with a greater emphasis on environmental preservation than previous iterations of socialism and communism .

Politics [ edit ] Europe [ edit ] In Europe , the green left arose partly out of the declining Eurocommunist tendency that has been mostly associated with various communist parties in the continent. As a result, many former communist parties and remnants of communist parties were either reestablished or fused into existing green parties .

Far-left political parties or joint electoral lists have been formed over the years, most often between Marxist and radical greens. In the Netherlands , the GroenLinks party was formed in 1989 by a merger of a communist , pacifist , left-wing Christian and green parties. In December 2007, an Italian electoral coalition of the radical left was formed known as The Left – The Rainbow , comprising Federation of the Greens , two communist parties and a small democratic socialist party.

Elsewhere [ edit ] The green left has also been prominent in the green politics outside of Europe, especially in the United States , Australia and New Zealand .
