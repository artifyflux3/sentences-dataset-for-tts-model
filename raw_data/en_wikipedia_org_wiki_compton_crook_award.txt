BSFS confers the award at their annual science fiction convention, Balticon , held in Baltimore on Memorial Day weekend. The award, also known as the Compton Crook/Stephen Tall Award , has been presented since 1983.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Compton Crook, who wrote under the name of Stephen Tall , was a long-time Baltimore resident, Towson University professor, and science fiction author who died in 1981.

The list of eligible books is published in the monthly newsletter so that all club members will have a chance to read and vote.  The winning author receives a cash award of $1,000 as well as a plaque, and their Balticon attendance is sponsored for two years; in the second year, the author presents the award to their successor. The invitation to Balticon is intended in part as a professional networking opportunity for the new author.
