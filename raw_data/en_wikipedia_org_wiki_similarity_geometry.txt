Similar figures

In [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), two objects are **similar** if they have the same [shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape "Shape"), or if one has the same shape as the mirror image of the other. More precisely, one can be obtained from the other by uniformly [scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_(geometry) "Scaling (geometry)") (enlarging or reducing), possibly with additional [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)"), [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)") and [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)"). This means that either object can be rescaled, repositioned, and reflected, so as to coincide precisely with the other object. If two objects are similar, each is [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)") to the result of a particular uniform scaling of the other.

For example, all [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") are similar to each other, all [squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square "Square") are similar to each other, and all [equilateral triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle") are similar to each other. On the other hand, [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") are not all similar to each other, [rectangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle "Rectangle") are not all similar to each other, and [isosceles triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_triangle "Isosceles triangle") are not all similar to each other. This is because two ellipses can have different width to height ratios, two rectangles can have different length to breadth ratios, and two isosceles triangles can have different base angles.

Figures shown in the same color are similar

If two angles of a triangle have measures equal to the measures of two angles of another triangle, then the triangles are similar. Corresponding sides of similar polygons are in proportion, and corresponding angles of similar polygons have the same measure.

Two [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)") shapes are similar, with a scale factor of 1. However, some school textbooks specifically exclude congruent triangles from their definition of similar triangles by insisting that the sizes must be different if the triangles are to qualify as similar.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Two triangles, △_ABC_ and △_A'B'C'_ are similar if and only if corresponding angles have the same measure: this implies that they are similar if and only if the lengths of [corresponding sides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corresponding_sides "Corresponding sides") are [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTESibley199835-1) It can be shown that two triangles having congruent angles (_equiangular triangles_) are similar, that is, the corresponding sides can be proved to be proportional. This is known as the AAA similarity theorem.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStahl2003127._This_is_also_proved_in_[[Euclid's_Elements|Euclid's_''Elements'']],_Book_VI,_Proposition_4-2) Note that the "AAA" is a mnemonic: each one of the three A's refers to an "angle". Due to this theorem, several authors simplify the definition of similar triangles to only require that the corresponding three angles are congruent.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-3)

There are several criteria each of which is necessary and sufficient for two triangles to be similar:

*   Any two pairs of angles are congruent,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-4) which in Euclidean geometry implies that all three angles are congruent:[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-5)

If ∠_BAC_ is equal in measure to ∠_B'A'C',_ and ∠_ABC_ is equal in measure to ∠_A'B'C',_ then this implies that ∠_ACB_ is equal in measure to ∠_A'C'B'_ and the triangles are similar.
*   All the corresponding sides are proportional:[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-6)

![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\frac {\overline {AB}}{\overline {A'B'}}}={\frac {\overline {BC}}{\overline {B'C'}}}={\frac {\overline {AC}}{\overline {A'C'}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/63bf1860a8c2e7de4d57c4de1be33d806e7088f6)

This is equivalent to saying that one triangle (or its mirror image) is an [enlargement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homothetic_transformation "Homothetic transformation") of the other.
*   Any two pairs of sides are proportional, and the angles included between these sides are congruent:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-7)

![Image 4: {\displaystyle {\frac {\overline {AB}}{\overline {A'B'}}}={\frac {\overline {BC}}{\overline {B'C'}}},\quad \angle ABC\cong \angle A'B'C'.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b47c3bb803d914e4a26b42ea18c103b55edc1122)

This is known as the SAS similarity criterion.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVenema2006143-8) The "SAS" is a mnemonic: each one of the two S's refers to a "side"; the A refers to an "angle" between the two sides.
Symbolically, we write the similarity and dissimilarity of two triangles △_ABC_ and △_A'B'C'_ as follows:[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-PL-9)

![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\triangle ABC&\sim \triangle A'B'C'\\\triangle ABC&\nsim \triangle A'B'C'\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3802d405e17710cc17203bf7995d44935b411f8d)

There are several elementary results concerning similar triangles in Euclidean geometry:[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJacobs1974384%E2%80%93393-10)

*   Any two [equilateral triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle") are similar.
*   Two triangles, both similar to a third triangle, are similar to each other ([transitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation "Transitive relation") of similarity of triangles).
*   Corresponding [altitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_(triangle) "Altitude (triangle)") of similar triangles have the same ratio as the corresponding sides.
*   Two [right triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle") are similar if the [hypotenuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotenuse "Hypotenuse") and one other side have lengths in the same ratio.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-11) There are several equivalent conditions in this case, such as the right triangles having an acute angle of the same measure, or having the lengths of the legs (sides) being in the same proportion.

Given a triangle △_ABC_ and a line segment _DE_ one can, with a [ruler and compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction "Straightedge and compass construction"), find a point F such that △_ABC_ ~ △_DEF_. The statement that point F satisfying this condition exists is [Wallis's postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis#Geometry "John Wallis")[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-12) and is logically equivalent to Euclid's [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVenema2006122-13) In [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry") (where Wallis's postulate is false) similar triangles are congruent.

In the axiomatic treatment of Euclidean geometry given by [George David Birkhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_David_Birkhoff "George David Birkhoff") (see [Birkhoff's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkhoff%27s_axioms "Birkhoff's axioms")) the SAS similarity criterion given above was used to replace both Euclid's parallel postulate and the SAS axiom which enabled the dramatic shortening of [Hilbert's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms "Hilbert's axioms").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVenema2006143-8)

Similar triangles provide the basis for many [synthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry") (without the use of coordinates) proofs in Euclidean geometry. Among the elementary results that can be proved this way are: the [angle bisector theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_bisector_theorem "Angle bisector theorem"), the [geometric mean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean_theorem "Geometric mean theorem"), [Ceva's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceva%27s_theorem "Ceva's theorem"), [Menelaus's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menelaus%27s_theorem "Menelaus's theorem") and the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem"). Similar triangles also provide the foundations for [right triangle trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVenema2006145-14)

Other similar polygons
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Similarity_(geometry)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Other similar polygons")]

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/SimilarRectangles.svg/250px-SimilarRectangles.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SimilarRectangles.svg)

Similar rectangles

The concept of similarity extends to [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon") with more than three sides. Given any two similar polygons, corresponding sides taken in the same sequence (even if clockwise for one polygon and counterclockwise for the other) are [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)") and corresponding angles taken in the same sequence are equal in measure. However, proportionality of corresponding sides is not by itself sufficient to prove similarity for polygons beyond triangles (otherwise, for example, all [rhombi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombus "Rhombus") would be similar). Likewise, equality of all angles in sequence is not sufficient to guarantee similarity (otherwise all [rectangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle "Rectangle") would be similar). A sufficient condition for similarity of polygons is that corresponding sides and diagonals are proportional.

For given n, all [regular n-gons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") are similar.

Several types of curves have the property that all examples of that type are similar to each other. These include:

*   [Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") (any two lines are even [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)"))
*   [Line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment")
*   [Circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle")
*   [Parabolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola")[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-15)
*   [Hyperbolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola") of a specific [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(mathematics) "Eccentricity (mathematics)")[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-uluc-16)
*   [Ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") of a specific eccentricity[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-uluc-16)
*   [Catenaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary "Catenary")
*   Graphs of the [logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm "Logarithm") function for different bases
*   Graphs of the [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function "Exponential function") for different bases
*   [Logarithmic spirals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_spiral "Logarithmic spiral") are self-similar

A **similarity** (also called a **similarity transformation** or **similitude**) of a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") is a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection")f from the space onto itself that multiplies all distances by the same positive [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")r, so that for any two points x and y we have

![Image 7: {\displaystyle d(f(x),f(y))=r\,d(x,y),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a5444afd3be14575be1d19039b7d6cbb421082e)
where _d_(_x_,_y_) is the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance") from x to y.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmart199892-17) The [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)")r has many names in the literature including; the _ratio of similarity_, the _stretching factor_ and the _similarity coefficient_. When _r_ = 1 a similarity is called an [isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane_isometry "Euclidean plane isometry") ([rigid transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_transformation "Rigid transformation")). Two sets are called **similar** if one is the image of the other under a similarity.

As a map ⁠![Image 8: {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef9feb331dbbef0a272bf8267be4449091bcf2c4)⁠ a similarity of ratio r takes the form

![Image 9: {\displaystyle f(x)=rAx+t,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45c9fbef0332cbdd8ec47a5c308d2769322976b2)
where ⁠![Image 10: {\displaystyle A\in O^{n}(\mathbb {R} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc781bd14d40c50780c574e3983f6d5756a7fc23)⁠ is an _n_ × _n_[orthogonal matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix "Orthogonal matrix") and ⁠![Image 11: {\displaystyle t\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e2f17bda90bdd7d98cf449af6fd88fc67ae7b0d1)⁠ is a translation vector.

Similarities preserve planes, lines, perpendicularity, parallelism, midpoints, inequalities between distances and line segments.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEYale196847_Theorem_2.1-18) Similarities preserve angles but do not necessarily preserve orientation, _direct similitudes_ preserve orientation and _opposite similitudes_ change it.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPedoe1988179%E2%80%93181-19)

The similarities of Euclidean space form a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") under the operation of composition called the _similarities group_ S.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEYale196846-20) The direct similitudes form a [normal subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_subgroup "Normal subgroup") of S and the [Euclidean group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group "Euclidean group")_E_(_n_) of isometries also forms a normal subgroup.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPedoe1988182-21) The similarities group S is itself a subgroup of the [affine group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_group "Affine group"), so every similarity is an [affine transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation").

One can view the Euclidean plane as the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane"),[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-22) that is, as a 2-dimensional space over the [reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"). The 2D similarity transformations can then be expressed in terms of complex arithmetic and are given by

*   ![Image 12: {\displaystyle f(z)=az+b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff7599b4e9ba027ea14b6681fe3b0fe82ae41735) (direct similitudes), and
*   ![Image 13: {\displaystyle f(z)=a{\overline {z}}+b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/752a5c93607a5a69536ee1efb44cbbba2cea83e6) (opposite similitudes),

where a and b are complex numbers, _a_ ≠ 0. When |_a_|= 1, these similarities are isometries.

Area ratio and volume ratio
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Similarity_(geometry)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Area ratio and volume ratio")]

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/A_proportion_to_conceive_square_root_of_5.svg/330px-A_proportion_to_conceive_square_root_of_5.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_proportion_to_conceive_square_root_of_5.svg)

The [tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation "Tessellation") of the large triangle shows that it is similar to the small triangle with an area ratio of 5. The similarity ratio is ![Image 15: {\displaystyle {\tfrac {5}{h}}={\tfrac {h}{1}}={\sqrt {5}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cde97c2a15b490033a548418de2a77f65836fdfb) This can be used to construct a [non-periodic infinite tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwheel_tiling "Pinwheel tiling").

The ratio between the [areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area") of similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of corresponding lengths of those figures (for example, when the side of a square or the radius of a circle is multiplied by three, its area is multiplied by nine — i.e. by three squared). The altitudes of similar triangles are in the same ratio as corresponding sides. If a triangle has a side of length b and an altitude drawn to that side of length h then a similar triangle with corresponding side of length kb will have an altitude drawn to that side of length kh. The area of the first triangle is ![Image 16: {\displaystyle A={\tfrac {1}{2}}bh,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d63b4ec08a02c43dc299ff712c1ec924a5245eb0) while the area of the similar triangle will be ![Image 17: {\displaystyle A'={\frac {1}{2}}\cdot kb\cdot kh=k^{2}A.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30ed29513134e3735b5a7760c0c5abda0663fa62) Similar figures which can be decomposed into similar triangles will have areas related in the same way. The relationship holds for figures that are not rectifiable as well.

The ratio between the [volumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") of similar figures is equal to the cube of the ratio of corresponding lengths of those figures (for example, when the edge of a cube or the radius of a sphere is multiplied by three, its volume is multiplied by 27 — i.e. by three cubed).

Galileo's square–cube law concerns similar solids. If the ratio of similitude (ratio of corresponding sides) between the solids is k, then the ratio of surface areas of the solids will be _k_ 2, while the ratio of volumes will be _k_ 3.

Similarity with a center
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Similarity_(geometry)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Similarity with a center")]

Example where each similarity

[composed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") with itself several times successively

has a **center** at the center of a [regular polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") that it shrinks.

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Academ_Example_of_similarity_with_ratio_square_root_of_2.svg/330px-Academ_Example_of_similarity_with_ratio_square_root_of_2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Academ_Example_of_similarity_with_ratio_square_root_of_2.svg)

Example of direct similarity of center S

[decomposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") into a rotation of 135° angle

and a homothety that halves [areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area").

Examples of direct similarities that have each a **center**.

If a similarity has exactly one [invariant point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)"): a point that the similarity keeps unchanged, then this only point is called "**center**" of the similarity.

On the first image below the title, on the left, one or another similarity shrinks a [regular polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") into a [concentric one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric_objects "Concentric objects"), the vertices of which are each on a side of the previous polygon. This rotational reduction [is repeated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function "Iterated function"), so the initial polygon is extended into an [abyss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_abyme "Mise en abyme") of regular polygons. The **center** of the similarity is the common center of the successive polygons. A red [segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") joins a vertex of the initial polygon to its [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics)#Image_of_an_element "Image (mathematics)") under the similarity, followed by a red segment going to the following image of vertex, and so on to form a [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral "Spiral"). Actually we can see more than three direct similarities on this first image, because every regular polygon is invariant under certain direct similarities, more precisely certain rotations the center of which is the center of the polygon, and a composition of direct similarities is also a direct similarity. For example we see the image of the initial regular [pentagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon "Pentagon") under a [homothety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homothety "Homothety") of negative ratio −k, which is a similarity of ±180° angle and a positive ratio equal to k.

Below the title on the right, the second image shows a similarity [decomposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") into a [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)") and a homothety. Similarity and rotation have the same angle of +135 degrees [modulo 360 degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic "Modular arithmetic"). Similarity and homothety have the same ratio of ⁠![Image 20: {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\sqrt {2}}{2}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e656560f85888b2c968625b6dbfd72181cf414d)⁠[multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") of the ratio ⁠![Image 21: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4afc1e27d418021bf10898eb44a7f5f315735ff)⁠ ([square root of 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2 "Square root of 2")) of the [inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function") similarity. Point S is the common **center** of the three transformations: rotation, homothety and similarity. For example point W is the image of F under the rotation, and point T is the image of W under the homothety, more briefly ![Image 22: {\displaystyle T=H(W)=(R(F))=(H\circ R)(F)=D(F),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d240da5133f341415ea0826d2c03043b5aef2f53) by naming R, H and D the previous rotation, homothety and similarity, with “D" like "Direct".

This direct similarity that transforms triangle △_EFA_ into triangle △_ATB_ can be decomposed into a rotation and a homothety of same center S in several manners. For example, _D_ = _R_ ○ _H_ = _H_ ○ _R_, the last decomposition being only represented on the image. To get D we can also compose in any order a rotation of −45° angle and a homothety of ratio ⁠![Image 23: {\displaystyle {\tfrac {-{\sqrt {2}}}{2}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d1719f80bcdf6a168614f9cf7c9e8c9424eea91f)⁠

With "M" like "Mirror" and "I" like "Indirect", if M is the [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)") with respect to line CW, then _M_ ○ _D_ = _I_ is the **indirect** similarity that transforms segment BF like D into segment CT, but transforms point E into B and point A into A itself.

The set of points P such that ![Image 28: {\displaystyle {\overset {}{{\overrightarrow {PE}},{\overrightarrow {PA}}=+135^{\circ }}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/23dbb5d44c74deebb0ba85f486e01f6c22752904) is an arc of circle EA that joins E and A, of which the two radius leading to E and A form a [central angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_angle "Central angle") of 2(180° − 135°) = 2 × 45° = 90°. This set of points is the blue quarter of circle of center F inside square ABEF. In the same manner, point S[is a member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of the blue quarter of circle of center T inside square BCAT. So point S is the [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(Euclidean_geometry) "Intersection (Euclidean geometry)") point of these two quarters of circles.

In general metric spaces
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Similarity_(geometry)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: In general metric spaces")]

[![Image 29](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Sierpinski_deep.svg/330px-Sierpinski_deep.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sierpinski_deep.svg)

[Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle "Sierpiński triangle"). A space having self-similarity dimension ![Image 30: {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\log 3}{\log 2}}=\log _{2}3,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e709953e659400964183ae854511697f471703de) which is approximately 1.58. (From [Hausdorff dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension "Hausdorff dimension").)

In a general [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space")(_X_, _d_), an exact **similitude** is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")f from the metric space X into itself that multiplies all distances by the same positive [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)")r, called f 's contraction factor, so that for any two points x and y we have

![Image 31: {\displaystyle d(f(x),f(y))=rd(x,y).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/069eb8a1cadb1c3b8d9aa4eabccc7a0afc19cddb)

Weaker versions of similarity would for instance have f be a bi-[Lipschitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity "Lipschitz continuity") function and the scalar r a limit

![Image 32: {\displaystyle \lim {\frac {d(f(x),f(y))}{d(x,y)}}=r.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f78717c145887fc6fb13c2c5a950f8441dddc55e)

This weaker version applies when the metric is an effective resistance on a topologically self-similar set.

A self-similar subset of a metric space (_X_, _d_) is a set K for which there exists a finite set of similitudes { _f s_}_s_∈_S_ with contraction factors 0 ≤ _r s_< 1 such that K is the unique compact subset of X for which

[![Image 33](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Epi17.png/250px-Epi17.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Epi17.png)

A self-similar set constructed with two similitudes: ![Image 34: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}z'&=0.1[(4+i)z+4]\\z'&=0.1[(4+7i)z^{*}+5-2i]\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cffbc7f9e2cd9e842daa1aa54ef288410d78b19c)

![Image 35: {\displaystyle \bigcup _{s\in S}f_{s}(K)=K.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/842100978a7f941b3c9e637879942aed253286ef)

These self-similar sets have a self-similar [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics) "Measure (mathematics)")_μ D_ with dimension D given by the formula

![Image 36: {\displaystyle \sum _{s\in S}(r_{s})^{D}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2fcdb1a0bb36f7c3f22318a0af1a44f297348ebe)

which is often (but not always) equal to the set's [Hausdorff dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension "Hausdorff dimension") and [packing dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_dimension "Packing dimension"). If the overlaps between the _f s_(_K_) are "small", we have the following simple formula for the measure:

![Image 37: {\displaystyle \mu ^{D}(f_{s_{1}}\circ f_{s_{2}}\circ \cdots \circ f_{s_{n}}(K))=(r_{s_{1}}\cdot r_{s_{2}}\cdots r_{s_{n}})^{D}.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10e82990507681b95040aef264afba42142bae36)

In [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"), a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") can be constructed by defining a **similarity** instead of a [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance"). The similarity is a function such that its value is greater when two points are closer (contrary to the distance, which is a measure of **dissimilarity**: the closer the points, the lesser the distance).

The definition of the similarity can vary among authors, depending on which properties are desired. The basic common properties are

1.   Positive defined:

![Image 38: {\displaystyle \forall (a,b),S(a,b)\geq 0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a335679687a9375ad2c359dcc20fedb8daf9479d)

1.   Majored by the similarity of one element on itself (**auto-similarity**):

![Image 39: {\displaystyle S(a,b)\leq S(a,a)\quad {\text{and}}\quad \forall (a,b),S(a,b)=S(a,a)\Leftrightarrow a=b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2566af94f43cb3d3033570b73034f98cf4f1eaa)

More properties can be invoked, such as:

The upper value is often set at 1 (creating a possibility for a probabilistic interpretation of the similitude).

Note that, in the topological sense used here, a similarity is a kind of [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics) "Measure (mathematics)"). This usage is **not** the same as the _similarity transformation_ of the [§In Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#In_Euclidean_space) and [§In general metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#In_general_metric_spaces) sections of this article.

[Self-similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity "Self-similarity") means that a pattern is **non-trivially similar** to itself, e.g., the set {..., 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, ...}  of numbers of the form {2 _i_, 3·2 _i_}  where i ranges over all integers. When this set is plotted on a [logarithmic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale "Logarithmic scale") it has one-dimensional [translational symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_symmetry "Translational symmetry"): adding or subtracting the logarithm of two to the logarithm of one of these numbers produces the logarithm of another of these numbers. In the given set of numbers themselves, this corresponds to a similarity transformation in which the numbers are multiplied or divided by two.

The intuition for the notion of geometric similarity already appears in human children, as can be seen in their drawings.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-23) Certain perceptual categorization models in psychology are based on geometric similarity, assuming that learning involves the storage of specific instances (_i.e._ of general object specifications) in memory. The categorization of another object ist subsequently based on the similarity of the object to the instances in memory.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#cite_note-24)
