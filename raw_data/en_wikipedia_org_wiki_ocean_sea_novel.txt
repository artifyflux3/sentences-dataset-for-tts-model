Ocean Sea First edition (Italian) Author Alessandro Baricco Original title Oceano mare Translator Alastair McEwen Language Italian Publisher Rizzoli editore Publication date 1993 Publication place Italy Published in English 1999 Pages 226 ISBN 88-17-66043-4 Ocean Sea ( Italian : Oceano mare ) is a 1993 novel by the Italian writer Alessandro Baricco . Its narrative revolves around the lives of a group of people gathered at a remote seaside hotel. The book is divided into three chapters: Locanda Almayer (Almayer Inn), Il ventre del mare (The Belly of the Sea), and I canti del ritorno (The Songs of the Return).

[ 1 ] The novel won the Viareggio Prize .

[ 2 ] Reception [ edit ] Richard Bernstein reviewed the book for The New York Times , and wrote: " Ocean Sea unfolds in its poetically elliptical way. Mr. Baricco is a literary cubist, a stylist who looks simultaneously at the several sides of things. He switches from one rhetorical mode to another, from a kind of symbolist poetry to grand adventure narrative to picaresque comedy." Bernstein continued: "This style of writing can be precious, artificial, a kind of verbal craftsmanship for craftsmanship's sake, but generally I read Ocean Sea transfixed by Mr. Baricco's linguistic originality, the boisterousness of his characters, and the skill with which he weaves the threads of a seemingly disjointed plot into a single narrative strand." [ 3 ] Tom Boncza-Tomaszewski of The Independent called the book an "extraordinary novel", and wrote: "A book about being, metaphysics juggled like the best trick of a wise old clown, this is a novel that at least suggests there's more to life than what any rationalist would tell you."
