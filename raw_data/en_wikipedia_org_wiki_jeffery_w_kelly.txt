Alma mater University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill State University of New York at Fredonia Awards Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences (2022) Wolf Prize (2023) Scientific career Institutions Scripps Research Institute Jeffery W. Kelly (born August 23, 1960 in Medina, New York ) is an American businessman and chemist who is on the faculty of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California .

Biography [ edit ] Kelly attended State University of New York at Fredonia , graduating in 1982.

[ 1 ] He received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1986) and performed post-doctoral research at The Rockefeller University (1986–89).

[ 2 ] He is former Dean of Graduate Studies (2000–2008) and Vice President of Academic Affairs (2000–2006) and co-Chairman of Molecular Medicine and the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professor of Chemistry within the Skaggs Institute of Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California .  His research focuses on understanding protein folding, misfolding and aggregation and on developing both chemical and biological strategies to ameliorate diseases caused by protein misfolding and/or aggregation.

[ 2 ] Kelly has cofounded three biotechnology companies, FoldRx Pharmaceuticals with Susan Lindquist in 2003, [ 3 ] Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. with Andrew Dillin and Richard Morimoto in 2010, [ 4 ] and Misfolding Diagnostics [ 5 ] in 2012.

[ 6 ] His lab began looking for ways to inhibit transthyretin fibril formation in the 1990s.

[ 7 ] : 210 Tafamidis was eventually discovered by Kelly's team using a structure-based drug design strategy; the structure was first published in 2003.

[ 8 ] [ 3 ] In 2003 Kelly co-founded FoldRx with Susan Lindquist of MIT and the Whitehead Institute [ 3 ] [ 9 ] and FoldRx developed tafamidis up through submitting an application for marketing approval in Europe in early 2010.

[ 8 ] FoldRx was acquired by Pfizer later that year.
