**Henry Margenau** (April 30, 1901 – February 8, 1997) was a German-American [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist") and [philosopher of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher_of_science "Philosopher of science").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Margenau#cite_note-1)

Born in [Bielefeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bielefeld "Bielefeld"), Germany, Margenau obtained his [bachelor's degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree "Bachelor's degree") from [Midland Lutheran College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Lutheran_College "Midland Lutheran College"), [Nebraska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska "Nebraska") before his [M.Sc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.Sc. "M.Sc.") from the [University of Nebraska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nebraska%E2%80%93Lincoln "University of Nebraska–Lincoln") in 1926, and PhD from [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University") in 1929.

Margenau worked on the theory of [microwaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") and the development of [duplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications) "Duplex (telecommunications)") systems that enabled a single [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar")[antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio) "Antenna (radio)") both to transmit and receive signals. He also worked on [spectral line broadening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line_broadening "Spectral line broadening"), a technique used to analyse and review the dynamics of the [atomic bombing of Hiroshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombing_of_Hiroshima "Atomic bombing of Hiroshima").

### Philosophy and history of science

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Margenau&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Philosophy and history  of science")]

Margenau wrote extensively on science, his works including: _Ethics and Science_, _The Nature of Physical Reality_, _Quantum Mechanics_ and _Integrative Principles of Modern Thought_. He wrote in 1954 the important introduction for the classic book of [Hermann von Helmholtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz "Hermann von Helmholtz"), [On the Sensations of Tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensations_of_Tone "Sensations of Tone").

In 1968, Margenau was invited to give the Wimmer Lecture at [St. Vincent College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vincent_College "St. Vincent College") in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. His topic was Scientific Indeterminism and Human Freedom. Margenau embraced [indeterminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminism "Indeterminism") as the first step toward a solution of the problem of human freedom.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Margenau#cite_note-2)

Then in 1982, Margenau called his two-stage model of free will a "solution" to what had heretofore had been seen as mere "paradox and illusion."[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Margenau#cite_note-sky-3) He very neatly separates "free" and "will" in a temporal sequence, as [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James "William James") had done, naming the two stages simply "chance" followed by "choice."

> "Our thesis is that quantum mechanics leaves our body, our brain, at any moment in a state with numerous (because of its complexity we might say innumerable) possible futures, each with a predetermined probability. Freedom involves two components: chance (existence of a genuine set of alternatives) and choice. Quantum mechanics provides the chance, and we shall argue that only the mind can make the choice by selecting (not energetically enforcing) among the possible future courses."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Margenau#cite_note-4)

### Religious interests

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Margenau&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Religious interests")]

Margenau served on a commission of the [World Council of Churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Council_of_Churches "World Council of Churches") in developing an [ecumenical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenical "Ecumenical") position on [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon") and [atomic warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_war "Atomic war"). However, his book The _Miracle of Existence_ (Ox Bow Press, 1984) shows Margenau's broad interests not only in Christianity, but also in Eastern religions and his fascination with finding connections among different religious and philosophical traditions.

Margenau was appointed Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics and Natural Philosophy as Yale in 1950, a post he was to hold until his retirement from formal academic life in 1986. He also became a staff member at both the [Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study,_Princeton "Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton") and the [MIT Radiation Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Radiation_Laboratory "MIT Radiation Laboratory"). During his working career, he acted as consultant to the [U.S. Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Air_Force "U.S. Air Force"), the U.S. [National Bureau of Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Standards "National Bureau of Standards"), [Argonne National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonne_National_Laboratory "Argonne National Laboratory"), [Rand Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Corporation "Rand Corporation"), [General Electric Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric_Co. "General Electric Co.") and [Lockheed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation "Lockheed Corporation").

Margenau's work embraced investigation of [intermolecular forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermolecular_force "Intermolecular force"), [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy "Spectroscopy"), [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics") and [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"). He was also interested in [parapsychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapsychology "Parapsychology").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Margenau#cite_note-5) He co-authored parapsychological papers with his friend [Lawrence LeShan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_LeShan "Lawrence LeShan").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Margenau#cite_note-6)

He was married to Liesel Noe and the couple parented two sons and a daughter. Margenau died in [Hamden, Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamden,_Connecticut "Hamden, Connecticut").
