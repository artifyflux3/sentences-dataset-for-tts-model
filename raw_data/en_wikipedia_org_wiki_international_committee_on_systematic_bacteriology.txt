[ 1 ] Composition [ edit ] The ICSP consists of an executive board, the members of a decision-making committee (judicial commission) and members elected from member societies of the International Union of Microbiological Societies (IUMS). In addition, the ICSP has a number of subcommittees dealing with issues regarding the nomenclature and taxonomy of specific groups of prokaryotes.

Subcommittees [ edit ] The ICSP has a number of subcommittees dealing with issues regarding the nomenclature and taxonomy of specific groups of prokaryotes. These include the following: Aeromonadaceae , Vibrionaceae and related organisms Genera Agrobacterium and Rhizobium Bacillus and related organisms Bifidobacterium , Lactobacillus and related organisms Genus Brucella ; Burkholderia , Ralstonia and related organisms Campylobacter and related bacteria Clostridia and Clostridium -like organisms Comamonadaceae and related organisms Family Enterobacteriaceae Flavobacterium - and Cytophaga -like bacteria Gram-negative anaerobic rods Family Halobacteriaceae Family Halomonadaceae Genus Leptospira Genus Listeria Methanogens Suborder Micrococcineae Families Micromonosporaceae , Streptosporangiaceae and Thermomonosporaceae Class Mollicutes Genus Mycobacterium Nocardia and related organisms Family Pasteurellaceae Photosynthetic prokaryotes Pseudomonas , Xanthomonas and related organisms Suborder Pseudonocardineae Staphylococci and streptococci Family Streptomycetaceae [ 2 ] Publications [ edit ] The ICSP is also integral to the production of the publication of the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (the Bacteriological Code) and the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM) (formerly the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, IJSB). IUMS has now agreed to transfer copyright of future versions of the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (to be renamed the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes) to the ICSP.
