In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the **degree** of a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") is the highest of the degrees of the polynomial's [monomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial "Monomial") (individual terms) with non-zero coefficients. The [degree of a term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_monomial "Degree of a monomial") is the sum of the exponents of the [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)") that appear in it, and thus is a non-negative [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer"). For a [univariate polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_polynomial "Univariate polynomial"), the degree of the polynomial is simply the highest exponent occurring in the polynomial.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_note-1) The term **order** has been used as a synonym of _degree_ but, nowadays, may refer to several other concepts (see [Order of a polynomial (disambiguation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_a_polynomial_(disambiguation) "Order of a polynomial (disambiguation)")).

For example, the polynomial ![Image 1: {\displaystyle 7x^{2}y^{3}+4x-9,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8f42a2b9071df7756f985ce7dea5016ae31c7df) which can also be written as ![Image 2: {\displaystyle 7x^{2}y^{3}+4x^{1}y^{0}-9x^{0}y^{0},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30b734674d57b5b2bbe3d7e27e2ba7b3219b007c) has three terms. The first term has a degree of 5 (the sum of the [powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation") 2 and 3), the second term has a degree of 1, and the last term has a degree of 0. Therefore, the polynomial has a degree of 5, which is the highest degree of any term.

To determine the degree of a polynomial that is not in standard form, such as ![Image 3: {\displaystyle (x+1)^{2}-(x-1)^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2c3344e0fb2987b2db32a7ccd4e23ae76de205bf), one can put it in standard form by expanding the products (by [distributivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributivity "Distributivity")) and combining the like terms; for example, ![Image 4: {\displaystyle (x+1)^{2}-(x-1)^{2}=4x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e27d760dc41861041d3718c2a622c0afa87a7acd) is of degree 1, even though each summand has degree 2. However, this is not needed when the polynomial is written as a product of polynomials in standard form, because the degree of a product is the sum of the degrees of the factors.

Names of polynomials by degree
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Degree_of_a_polynomial&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Names of polynomials by degree")]

The following names are assigned to polynomials according to their degree:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_note-4)

*   Special case – [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_polynomial "Zero polynomial") (see [§Degree of the zero polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#Degree_of_the_zero_polynomial), below)
*   Degree 0 – non-zero [constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_function "Constant function")[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_note-5)
*   Degree 1 – [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function "Linear function")
*   Degree 2 – [quadratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_polynomial "Quadratic polynomial")
*   Degree 3 – [cubic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function "Cubic function")
*   Degree 4 – [quartic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_function "Quartic function") (or, if all terms have even degree, [biquadratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biquadratic_function "Biquadratic function"))
*   Degree 5 – [quintic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintic_equation "Quintic equation")
*   Degree 6 – [sextic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextic_equation "Sextic equation") (or, less commonly, hexic)
*   Degree 7 – [septic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_equation "Septic equation") (or, less commonly, heptic)
*   Degree 8 – octic
*   Degree 9 – nonic
*   Degree 10 – decic

Names for degree above three are based on Latin [ordinal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_numeral "Ordinal numeral"), and end in _-ic_. This should be distinguished from the names used for the number of variables, the [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity "Arity"), which are based on Latin [distributive numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_number "Distributive number"), and end in _-ary_. For example, a degree two polynomial in two variables, such as ![Image 5: {\displaystyle x^{2}+xy+y^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ca3167b2fc0a108f2b3eb317d9fd46328e50d61), is called a "binary quadratic": _binary_ due to two variables, _quadratic_ due to degree two.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_note-6) There are also names for the number of terms, which are also based on Latin distributive numbers, ending in _-nomial_; the common ones are _[monomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial "Monomial")_, _[binomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial\_(polynomial) "Binomial (polynomial)")_, and (less commonly) _[trinomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinomial "Trinomial")_; thus ![Image 6: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f455605b597282c27d7cf2238821bc331479a7e9) is a "binary quadratic binomial".

The polynomial ![Image 7: {\displaystyle (y-3)(2y+6)(-4y-21)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c4c23980ace1759044d95ad8f086c3917aa0da02) is a cubic polynomial: after multiplying out and collecting terms of the same degree, it becomes ![Image 8: {\displaystyle -8y^{3}-42y^{2}+72y+378}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/44aa7cb757b5ed5c6e38d5a77a757857142a2af8), with highest exponent 3.

The polynomial ![Image 9: {\displaystyle (3z^{8}+z^{5}-4z^{2}+6)+(-3z^{8}+8z^{4}+2z^{3}+14z)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d0dd06b399f9d6555483e0b09802539ff10d205a) is a quintic polynomial: upon combining like terms, the two terms of degree 8 cancel, leaving ![Image 10: {\displaystyle z^{5}+8z^{4}+2z^{3}-4z^{2}+14z+6}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b52a37c8883535d008c47d942e7064a14e0864cb), with highest exponent 5.

Behavior under polynomial operations
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Degree_of_a_polynomial&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Behavior under polynomial operations")]

The degree of the sum, the product or the composition of two polynomials is strongly related to the degree of the input polynomials.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_note-7)

The degree of the sum (or difference) of two polynomials is less than or equal to the greater of their degrees; that is,

![Image 11: {\displaystyle \deg(P+Q)\leq \max\{\deg(P),\deg(Q)\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/215a476dff6ff5e96da1813a4833005838bac494) and ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \deg(P-Q)\leq \max\{\deg(P),\deg(Q)\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d81a834d5546d307c294bf417ced4647c9e58e84).
For example, the degree of ![Image 13: {\displaystyle (x^{3}+x)-(x^{3}+x^{2})=-x^{2}+x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e9c39cb0195ca9b719056fc071937870a26ac36b) is 2, and 2≤max{3,3}.

The equality always holds when the degrees of the polynomials are different. For example, the degree of ![Image 14: {\displaystyle (x^{3}+x)+(x^{2}+1)=x^{3}+x^{2}+x+1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68d83420375111ed4585f441986b1fbc615f733d) is 3, and 3=max{3,2}.

The degree of the product of a polynomial by a non-zero [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)") is equal to the degree of the polynomial; that is,

![Image 15: {\displaystyle \deg(cP)=\deg(P)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/031f282c959e21e05e1ff9faf485ce6bd05294db).
For example, the degree of ![Image 16: {\displaystyle 2(x^{2}+3x-2)=2x^{2}+6x-4}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd6a7716ced0cb4a533b5df1bcb3ea524a9ea649) is 2, which is equal to the degree of ![Image 17: {\displaystyle x^{2}+3x-2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d825f8e407e735c6c2e3d4a6ea0e1594149fc030).

Thus, the [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of polynomials (with coefficients from a given field _F_) whose degrees are smaller than or equal to a given number _n_ forms a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"); for more, see [Examples of vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_vector_spaces#Polynomial_vector_spaces "Examples of vector spaces").

More generally, the degree of the product of two polynomials over a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") or an [integral domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain "Integral domain") is the sum of their degrees:

![Image 18: {\displaystyle \deg(PQ)=\deg(P)+\deg(Q)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/13b8aa4e58bb4754220d0760251bb628f20e284d).
For example, the degree of ![Image 19: {\displaystyle (x^{3}+x)(x^{2}+1)=x^{5}+2x^{3}+x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86b6945d62df33c372054a458082c07edf473bfa) is 5=3+2.

For polynomials over an arbitrary [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)"), the above rules may not be valid, because of cancellation that can occur when multiplying two nonzero constants. For example, in the ring ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /4\mathbf {Z} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c464e80db5ebcfac735417e8050cc026d303092e) of [integers modulo 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers_modulo_n "Integers modulo n"), one has that ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \deg(2x)=\deg(1+2x)=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb1b6201791ee0f66b5b5c707588c76be4f6e0e6), but ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \deg(2x(1+2x))=\deg(2x)=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77fac5f8f219401ca721682ae530dc1d7ff2191f), which is not equal to the sum of the degrees of the factors.

The degree of the composition of two non-constant polynomials ![Image 23: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) and ![Image 24: {\displaystyle Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed) over a field or integral domain is the product of their degrees: ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \deg(P\circ Q)=\deg(P)\deg(Q).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35f1a25bb67304af6c670cbfcd24b07cac9a6fa1)

For example, if ![Image 26: {\displaystyle P=x^{3}+x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/972b332b06e40a96ef5adf1c7a4e10a522f35e23) has degree 3 and ![Image 27: {\displaystyle Q=x^{2}-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cd44d8cabe624e1717126fafe4125d59a7ff6bba) has degree 2, then their composition is ![Image 28: {\displaystyle P\circ Q=P\circ (x^{2}-1)=(x^{2}-1)^{3}+(x^{2}-1)=x^{6}-3x^{4}+4x^{2}-2,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6ffbddae321751b85608f320d0d3820c254a3b2c) which has degree 6.

Note that for polynomials over an arbitrary ring, the degree of the composition may be less than the product of the degrees. For example, in ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /4\mathbf {Z} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e1169d493a29b00df431cff7ef14f73880859bd) the composition of the polynomials ![Image 30: {\displaystyle 2x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e50b849d3a7cd902f0ae3fa6ad6d1cad49987c39) and ![Image 31: {\displaystyle 1+2x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1edf0f39397eca16051f055ef0a70881b65e5302) (both of degree 1) is the constant polynomial ![Image 32: {\displaystyle 2x\circ (1+2x)=2+4x=2,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/00be2febe4199d336977a01dd24fd18266000457) of degree 0.

Degree of the zero polynomial
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Degree_of_a_polynomial&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Degree of the zero polynomial")]

The degree of the [zero polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_polynomial "Zero polynomial") is either left undefined, or is defined to be negative (usually −1 or ![Image 33: {\displaystyle -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1)).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_note-8)

Like any constant value, the value 0 can be considered as a (constant) polynomial, called the [zero polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_polynomial "Zero polynomial"). It has no nonzero terms, and so, strictly speaking, it has no degree either. As such, its degree is usually undefined. The propositions for the degree of sums and products of polynomials in the above section do not apply, if any of the polynomials involved is the zero polynomial.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_note-9)

It is convenient, however, to define the degree of the zero polynomial to be _negative infinity_, ![Image 34: {\displaystyle -\infty ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/79d5ae78431259d0588140f827d0a1fcdfa4ec7f) and to introduce the arithmetic rules[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_note-10)

![Image 35: {\displaystyle \max(a,-\infty )=a,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbc1b73f6c689eabcdbb78ae121696679f54b487)
and

![Image 36: {\displaystyle a+(-\infty )=-\infty .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4444baba97e05604beb4bebad3cda40d0e67afc)
These examples illustrate how this extension satisfies the [behavior rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#Behavior_under_polynomial_operations) above:

Computed from the function values
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Degree_of_a_polynomial&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Computed from the function values")]

A number of formulae exist which will evaluate the degree of a polynomial function _f_. One based on [asymptotic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis "Asymptotic analysis") is

![Image 37: {\displaystyle \deg f=\lim _{x\rightarrow \infty }{\frac {\log |f(x)|}{\log x}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70b0c697dafdf4979de5102d9c65c334f67249d8);
this is the exact counterpart of the method of estimating the slope in a [log–log plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log%E2%80%93log_plot "Log–log plot").

This formula generalizes the concept of degree to some functions that are not polynomials. For example:

The formula also gives sensible results for many combinations of such functions, e.g., the degree of ![Image 38: {\displaystyle {\frac {1+{\sqrt {x}}}{x}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b3f48cf9c4e0a9533e5b01801cfb2571ed0eafcb) is ![Image 39: {\displaystyle -1/2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6fb9deb994fbfacb465f9a9d34b0f85d3cfc3985).

Another formula to compute the degree of _f_ from its values is

![Image 40: {\displaystyle \deg f=\lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {xf'(x)}{f(x)}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ea3cd783266cd2ee186fa9c343f5458477931365);
this second formula follows from applying [L'Hôpital's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule "L'Hôpital's rule") to the first formula. Intuitively though, it is more about exhibiting the degree _d_ as the extra constant factor in the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative")![Image 41: {\displaystyle dx^{d-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/89f6b7fab682bf5132563b73726da56e0e51af9f) of ![Image 42: {\displaystyle x^{d}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e1def89db6c549faae1ec80a25c654c900cf3386).

A more fine grained (than a simple numeric degree) description of the asymptotics of a function can be had by using [big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation "Big O notation"). In the [analysis of algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms "Analysis of algorithms"), it is for example often relevant to distinguish between the growth rates of ![Image 43: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) and ![Image 44: {\displaystyle x\log x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/799c4a359d6aeb7a818ea204a2170b8bfb0c1017), which would both come out as having the _same_ degree according to the above formulae.

Extension to polynomials with two or more variables
---------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Degree_of_a_polynomial&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Extension to polynomials with two or more variables")]

For polynomials in two or more variables, the degree of a term is the _sum_ of the exponents of the variables in the term; the degree (sometimes called the **total degree**) of the polynomial is again the maximum of the degrees of all terms in the polynomial. For example, the polynomial _x_ 2 _y_ 2 + 3 _x_ 3 + 4 _y_ has degree 4, the same degree as the term _x_ 2 _y_ 2.

However, a polynomial in variables _x_ and _y_, is a polynomial in _x_ with coefficients which are polynomials in _y_, and also a polynomial in _y_ with coefficients which are polynomials in _x_. The polynomial

![Image 45: {\displaystyle x^{2}y^{2}+3x^{3}+4y=(3)x^{3}+(y^{2})x^{2}+(4y)=(x^{2})y^{2}+(4)y+(3x^{3})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a6b21354a7a74163c2fd609eb9f81cb6d4932009)
has degree 3 in _x_ and degree 2 in _y_.

Degree function in abstract algebra
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Degree_of_a_polynomial&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Degree function in abstract algebra")]

Given a [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)")_R_, the [polynomial ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring "Polynomial ring")_R_[_x_] is the set of all polynomials in _x_ that have coefficients in _R_. In the special case that _R_ is also a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), the polynomial ring _R_[_x_] is a [principal ideal domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_ideal_domain "Principal ideal domain") and, more importantly to our discussion here, a [Euclidean domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_domain "Euclidean domain").

It can be shown that the degree of a polynomial over a field satisfies all of the requirements of the _norm_ function in the euclidean domain. That is, given two polynomials _f_(_x_) and _g_(_x_), the degree of the product _f_(_x_)_g_(_x_) must be larger than both the degrees of _f_ and _g_ individually. In fact, something stronger holds:

![Image 46: {\displaystyle \deg(f(x)g(x))=\deg(f(x))+\deg(g(x))}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6edde749e6bb3dbc4a3ebb4a5f85defb1f3ba96)
For an example of why the degree function may fail over a ring that is not a field, take the following example. Let _R_ = ![Image 47: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /4\mathbb {Z} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eb3ded1f832ca4738a18c9e4779381bd9591c058), the ring of integers [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic "Modular arithmetic") 4. This ring is not a field (and is not even an [integral domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain "Integral domain")) because 2 × 2 = 4 ≡ 0 (mod 4). Therefore, let _f_(_x_) = _g_(_x_) = 2 _x_ + 1. Then, _f_(_x_)_g_(_x_) = 4 _x_ 2 + 4 _x_ + 1 = 1. Thus deg(_f_⋅_g_) = 0 which is not greater than the degrees of _f_ and _g_ (which each had degree 1).

Since the _norm_ function is not defined for the zero element of the ring, we consider the degree of the polynomial _f_(_x_) = 0 to also be undefined so that it follows the rules of a norm in a Euclidean domain.

3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_ref-3)**King (2009) defines "quadratic", "cubic", "quartic", "quintic", "sextic", "septic", and "octic".
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_ref-4)**[James Cockle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cockle "James Cockle") proposed the names "sexic", "septic", "octic", "nonic", and "decic" in 1851. ([_Mechanics Magazine_, Vol. LV, p. 171](https://books.google.com/books?id=cxIFAAAAQAAJ&q=sexic+septic+octic+nonic+decic&pg=PP1))
5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_ref-5)**Shafarevich (2003) says of a polynomial of degree zero, ![Image 48: {\displaystyle f(x)=a_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103c6d4433d08f206bbfaea9ce897e7790959eb8): "Such a polynomial is called a _constant_ because if we substitute different values of _x_ in it, we always obtain the same value ![Image 49: {\displaystyle a_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/693ad9f934775838bd72406b41ada4a59785d7ba)."

7.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_ref-8)** Shafarevich (2003) says of the zero polynomial: "In this case, we consider that the degree of the polynomial is undefined." (p. 27)

 Childs (1995) uses −1. (p. 233)

 Childs (2009) uses −∞ (p. 287), however he excludes zero polynomials in his Proposition 1 (p. 288) and then explains that the proposition holds for zero polynomials "with the reasonable assumption that ![Image 50: {\displaystyle -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1) + _m_ = ![Image 51: {\displaystyle -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1) for _m_ any integer or _m_ = ![Image 52: {\displaystyle -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1)".

 Axler (1997) uses −∞. (p. 64)

 Grillet (2007) says: "The degree of the zero polynomial 0 is sometimes left undefined or is variously defined as −1 ∈ ![Image 53: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/449494a083e0a1fda2b61c62b2f09b6bee4633dc) or as ![Image 54: {\displaystyle -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1), as long as deg 0 < deg _A_ for all _A_ ≠ 0." (_A_ is a polynomial.) However, he excludes zero polynomials in his Proposition 5.3. (p. 121)

That is why we do not assign a degree to the zero polynomial."
9.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#cite_ref-10)**Axler (1997) gives these rules and says: "The 0 polynomial is declared to have degree ![Image 55: {\displaystyle -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1) so that exceptions are not needed for various reasonable results."
