Lichens are some of the organisms included in several definitions of the Thallophyte group.

Thallophytes ( Thallophyta or Thallobionta ) are a polyphyletic group of non-motile organisms traditionally described as "thalloid plants", "relatively simple plants" or " lower plants ". They form a division of kingdom Plantae that include lichens and algae and occasionally bryophytes , bacteria and slime moulds . Thallophytes have a hidden reproductive system and hence they are also incorporated into the similar Cryptogamae category (together with ferns ), as opposed to Phanerogamae . Thallophytes are defined by having undifferentiated bodies ( thalloid , pseudotissue ), as opposed to cormophytes (Cormophyta) with roots and stems. Various groups of thallophytes are major contributors to marine ecosystems.

Definitions [ edit ] Several different definitions of the group have been used.

Thallophytes (Thallophyta or Thallobionta) are a polyphyletic group of non-mobile organisms traditionally described as "thalloid plants", "relatively simple plants" or " lower plants ".

Stephan Endlicher , a 19th-century Austrian botanist , separated the vegetable kingdom into the thallophytes (algae, lichens, fungi) and the cormophytes (including bryophytes and thus being equivalent to Embryophyta in this case) in 1836.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] This definition of Thallophyta is approximately equivalent to Protophyta, which has always been a loosely defined group.

[ 3 ] In the Lindley system (1830–1839), Endlicher's cormophytes were divided into the thallogens (including the bryophytes), and cormogens ("non-flowering" plants with roots), as well as the six other classes. Cormogens were a much smaller group than Endlicher's cormophytes, [ 4 ] including just the ferns (and Equisetopsida ) and the plants now known as lycopodiophytes .

Thallophyta is a division of the plant kingdom including primitive forms of plant life showing a simple plant body. Including unicellular to large algae , fungi , lichens .

[ 5 ] The first ten phyla are referred to as thallophytes. They are simple plants without roots stems or leaves.

[ 6 ] They are non-embryophyta. These plants grow mainly in water.

Subdivisions [ edit ] The Thallophyta have been divided into two subdivisions: [ 7 ] Myxothallophyta (myxomycetes) Euthallophyta (bacteria, fungi, lichens, algae) The term Euthallophyta was originally used by Adolf Engler .
