Spatial autocorrelation is more complex than autocorrelation because the correlation is multi-dimensional and bi-directional.

Global Geary's C [ edit ] Geary's C is defined as C = ( N − − 1 ) ∑ ∑ i ∑ ∑ j w i j ( x i − − x j ) 2 2 S 0 ∑ ∑ i ( x i − − x ¯ ¯ ) 2 {\displaystyle C={\frac {(N-1)\sum _{i}\sum _{j}w_{ij}(x_{i}-x_{j})^{2}}{2S_{0}\sum _{i}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})^{2}}}} where N {\displaystyle N} is the number of spatial units indexed by i {\displaystyle i} and j {\displaystyle j} ; x {\displaystyle x} is the variable of interest; x ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}} is the mean of x {\displaystyle x} ; w i j {\displaystyle w_{ij}} is the i t h {\displaystyle i^{th}} row of the spatial weights matrix W {\displaystyle W} with zeroes on the diagonal (i.e., w i i = 0 {\displaystyle w_{ii}=0} ); and S 0 {\displaystyle S_{0}} is the sum of all weights in W {\displaystyle W} .

Geary's C statistic computed for different spatial patterns. Using ' rook ' neighbors for each grid cell, setting w i j = 1 {\displaystyle w_{ij}=1} for neighbours j {\displaystyle j} of i {\displaystyle i} and then row normalizing the weight matrix. Top left shows gives C > 1 {\displaystyle C>1} indicating anti-correlation. Top right shows a spatial gradient giving C < 1 {\displaystyle C<1} indicating correlation. Bottom left shows random data giving a value of C ∼ ∼ 1 {\displaystyle C\sim 1} indicating no correlation. Bottom right shows a spreading pattern with positive autocorrelation.

The value of Geary's C lies between 0 and some unspecified value greater than 1. Values significantly lower than 1 demonstrate increasing positive spatial autocorrelation, whilst values significantly higher than 1 illustrate increasing negative spatial autocorrelation.

Geary's C is inversely related to Moran's I , but it is not identical. While Moran's I and Geary's C are both measures of global spatial autocorrelation, they are slightly different. Geary's C uses the sum of squared distances whereas Moran's I uses standardized spatial covariance. By using squared distances Geary's C is less sensitive to linear associations and may pickup autocorrelation where Moran's I may not.

[ 1 ] Geary's C is also known as Geary's contiguity ratio or simply Geary's ratio.

[ 2 ] This statistic was developed by Roy C. Geary .

[ 3 ] Local Geary's C [ edit ] Like Moran's I , Geary's C can be decomposed into a sum of Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics. LISA statistics can be used to find local clusters through significance testing , though because a large number of tests must be performed (one per sampling area) this approach suffers from the multiple comparisons problem . As noted by Anselin , [ 4 ] this means the analysis of the local Geary statistic is aimed at identifying interesting points which should then be subject to further investigation. This is therefore a type of exploratory data analysis .

A local version of C {\displaystyle C} is given by [ 5 ] c i = 1 m 2 ∑ ∑ j w i j ( x i − − x j ) 2 {\displaystyle c_{i}={\frac {1}{m_{2}}}\sum _{j}w_{ij}(x_{i}-x_{j})^{2}} where m 2 = ∑ ∑ i ( x i − − x ¯ ¯ ) 2 N − − 1 {\displaystyle m_{2}={\frac {\sum _{i}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})^{2}}{N-1}}} then, C = ∑ ∑ i c i 2 S 0 {\displaystyle C=\sum _{i}{\frac {c_{i}}{2S_{0}}}} Local Geary's C can be calculated in GeoDa and PySAL.
