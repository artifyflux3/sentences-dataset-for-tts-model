Fiction genres Fiction non-fiction Official website orionbooks .co .uk Weidenfeld & Nicolson Ltd (established 1949), often shortened to W&N or Weidenfeld , is a British publisher of fiction and reference books. It has been a division of the French-owned Orion Publishing Group since 1991.

History [ edit ] George Weidenfeld and Nigel Nicolson founded Weidenfeld & Nicolson in 1949 with a reception at Brown's Hotel , London.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Among many other significant books, it published Vladimir Nabokov 's Lolita (1959) and Nicolson's Portrait of a Marriage (1973), a frank biography of his mother Vita Sackville-West and father Harold Nicolson . In its early years Weidenfeld also published nonfiction works by Isaiah Berlin , Hugh Trevor-Roper , and Rose Macaulay , and novels by Mary McCarthy and Saul Bellow . Later it published titles by world leaders and historians, along with contemporary fiction and glossy illustrated books.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Weidenfeld & Nicolson acquired the publisher Arthur Baker Ltd in 1959, and ran it as an imprint into the 1990s.

[ 5 ] Weidenfeld was one of Orion's first acquisitions after the group's founding in 1991, and formed the core of its offerings. At that time Weidenfeld imprints included Phoenix , its own much earlier establishment; and J. M. Dent , acquired in 1988 along with its Everyman series. Orion was acquired in turn by Hachette Livre in 1998.

[ 6 ] The hardcover rights to Everyman Library were sold in 1991, and survive as a Random House property; paperbacks of Everyman Classics continued under Orion. In January 2002, Cassell imprints, including the Cassell Reference and Cassell Military were joined with the Weidenfeld imprints to form a new division under the name of Weidenfeld & Nicolson.

[ 7 ] Late in 2013, W&N published the British edition (and Hachette subsidiary Little, Brown the American edition) of I Am Malala , the memoir of Pakistani-born teenager Malala Yousafzai with Christina Lamb . Yousafzai is a female education activist, and the Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2014.
