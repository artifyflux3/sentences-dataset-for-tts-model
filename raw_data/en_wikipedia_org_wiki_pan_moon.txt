[ 4 ] It is approximately 35 kilometres across and 23 km wide and orbits within the Encke Gap in Saturn's A Ring . Pan is a ring shepherd and is responsible for keeping the Encke Gap free of ring particles. It is sometimes described as having the appearance of a walnut, or raviolo .

[ 5 ] Pan was discovered by Mark R. Showalter in 1990 from analysis of old Voyager 2 probe photos and received the provisional designation S/1981 S 13 because the discovery images dated back to 1981.

[ 6 ] Prediction and discovery [ edit ] The existence of a moon in the Encke Gap was first predicted by Jeffrey N. Cuzzi and Jeffrey D. Scargle in 1985, based on wavy edges of the gap which indicated a gravitational disturbance.

[ 7 ] In 1986, Showalter et al.

inferred its orbit and mass by modeling its gravitational wake. They arrived at a precise prediction of 133,603 ± 10 km for the semi-major axis and a mass of 5–10 × 10 −12 Saturn masses, and inferred that there was only a single moon within the Encke gap.

[ 8 ] The actual semi-major axis differs by 19 km, and the actual mass is 8.6 × 10 −12 of Saturn's.

The moon was later found within 1° of the predicted position. The search was undertaken by considering all Voyager 2 images and using a computer calculation to predict whether the moon would be visible under sufficiently favorable conditions in each one. Every qualifying Voyager 2 image with a resolution better than ~50 km/pixel shows Pan clearly. In all, it appears in eleven Voyager 2 images.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Name [ edit ] The moon was named on 16 September 1991 [ 11 ] after the mythological Greek god named Pan , who was (among other things) the god of shepherds.  This is a reference to Pan's role as a shepherd moon .  It is also designated Saturn XVIII .

[ 12 ] Orbit [ edit ] The eccentricity of Pan's orbit causes its distance from Saturn to vary by ~4 km.  Its inclination , which would cause it to move up and down, is not distinguishable from zero with present data.  The Encke Gap , within which Pan orbits, is about 322 km wide.

[ 13 ] Geography [ edit ] Pan, photographed by Cassini on March 7, 2017. The thin equatorial ridge is clearly visible.

Cassini scientists have described Pan as " walnut -shaped" [ 14 ] owing to the equatorial ridge , similar to that on Atlas , that is visible in images. The ridge is due to ring material that Pan has swept up from the Encke gap. It has been referred to by journalists as a space empanada , a form of stuffed bread or pastry, as well as a ravioli .

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] A new study suggests that the bizarre shape of Pan could also be due to collisions between tiny moonlets , thus causing them to merge and form Pan (known as the pyramidal regime formation scenario).

[ 17 ] Pandean ringlet [ edit ] The Encke Gap contains a ringlet that is coincident with Pan's orbit, indicating that Pan maintains the particles in horseshoe orbits .

[ 18 ] A second ringlet is periodically disrupted by Pan, similarly to how the F Ring is disturbed by Prometheus .

[ 19 ] Gallery [ edit ] Closeup of the Encke Gap, showing the central ringlet that is coincident with Pan's orbit.

See also [ edit ] List of natural satellites Notes [ edit ] ^ This color photo of Pan was created by combining separate photos taken in infrared, green, and ultraviolet spectral filters of the Cassini spacecraft's narrow-angle Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) camera on 7 March 2017. This view of the moon's northern hemisphere shows its walnut -like appearance, with a highly inclined equatorial ridge almost eclipsing the moon's southern hemisphere from view.
