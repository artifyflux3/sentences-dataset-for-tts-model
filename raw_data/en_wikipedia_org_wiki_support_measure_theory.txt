It is defined to be the largest ( closed ) subset of X {\displaystyle X} for which every open neighbourhood of every point of the set has positive measure.

Motivation [ edit ] A (non-negative) measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on a measurable space ( X , Σ Σ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} is really a function μ μ : Σ Σ → → [ 0 , + ∞ ∞ ] .

{\displaystyle \mu :\Sigma \to [0,+\infty ].} Therefore, in terms of the usual definition of support , the support of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a subset of the σ-algebra Σ Σ : {\displaystyle \Sigma :} supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) := { A ∈ ∈ Σ Σ | μ μ ( A ) ≠ ≠ 0 } ¯ ¯ , {\displaystyle \operatorname {supp} (\mu ):={\overline {\{A\in \Sigma \,\vert \,\mu (A)\neq 0\}}},} where the overbar denotes set closure . However, this definition is somewhat unsatisfactory: we use the notion of closure, but we do not even have a topology on Σ Σ .

{\displaystyle \Sigma .} What we really want to know is where in the space X {\displaystyle X} the measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is non-zero. Consider two examples: Lebesgue measure λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } on the real line R .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} .} It seems clear that λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } "lives on" the whole of the real line.

A Dirac measure δ δ p {\displaystyle \delta _{p}} at some point p ∈ ∈ R .

{\displaystyle p\in \mathbb {R} .} Again, intuition suggests that the measure δ δ p {\displaystyle \delta _{p}} "lives at" the point p , {\displaystyle p,} and nowhere else.

In light of these two examples, we can reject the following candidate definitions in favour of the one in the next section: We could remove the points where μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is zero, and take the support to be the remainder X ∖ ∖ { x ∈ ∈ X ∣ ∣ μ μ ( { x } ) = 0 } .

{\displaystyle X\setminus \{x\in X\mid \mu (\{x\})=0\}.} This might work for the Dirac measure δ δ p , {\displaystyle \delta _{p},} but it would definitely not work for λ λ : {\displaystyle \lambda :} since the Lebesgue measure of any singleton is zero, this definition would give λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } empty support.

By comparison with the notion of strict positivity of measures, we could take the support to be the set of all points with a neighbourhood of positive measure: { x ∈ ∈ X ∣ ∣ ∃ ∃ N x open such that ( x ∈ ∈ N x and μ μ ( N x ) > 0 ) } {\displaystyle \{x\in X\mid \exists N_{x}{\text{ open}}{\text{ such that }}(x\in N_{x}{\text{ and }}\mu (N_{x})>0)\}} (or the closure of this). It is also too simplistic: by taking N x = X {\displaystyle N_{x}=X} for all points x ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x\in X,} this would make the support of every measure except the zero measure the whole of X .

{\displaystyle X.} However, the idea of "local strict positivity" is not too far from a workable definition.

Definition [ edit ] Let ( X , T ) {\displaystyle (X,T)} be a topological space ; let B ( T ) {\displaystyle B(T)} denote the Borel σ-algebra on X , {\displaystyle X,} i.e. the smallest sigma algebra on X {\displaystyle X} that contains all open sets U ∈ ∈ T .

{\displaystyle U\in T.} Let μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } be a measure on ( X , B ( T ) ) {\displaystyle (X,B(T))} Then the support (or spectrum ) of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is defined as the set of all points x {\displaystyle x} in X {\displaystyle X} for which every open neighbourhood N x {\displaystyle N_{x}} of x {\displaystyle x} has positive measure: supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) := { x ∈ ∈ X ∣ ∣ ∀ ∀ N x ∈ ∈ T : : ( x ∈ ∈ N x ⇒ ⇒ μ μ ( N x ) > 0 ) } .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {supp} (\mu ):=\{x\in X\mid \forall N_{x}\in T\colon (x\in N_{x}\Rightarrow \mu (N_{x})>0)\}.} Some authors prefer to take the closure of the above set. However, this is not necessary: see "Properties" below.

An equivalent definition of support is as the largest C ∈ ∈ B ( T ) {\displaystyle C\in B(T)} (with respect to inclusion) such that every open set which has non-empty intersection with C {\displaystyle C} has positive measure, i.e. the largest C {\displaystyle C} such that: ( ∀ ∀ U ∈ ∈ T ) ( U ∩ ∩ C ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ ⟹ ⟹ μ μ ( U ∩ ∩ C ) > 0 ) .

{\displaystyle (\forall U\in T)(U\cap C\neq \varnothing \implies \mu (U\cap C)>0).} Signed and complex measures [ edit ] This definition can be extended to signed and complex measures. 
Suppose that μ μ : Σ Σ → → [ − − ∞ ∞ , + ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle \mu :\Sigma \to [-\infty ,+\infty ]} is a signed measure . Use the Hahn decomposition theorem to write μ μ = μ μ + − − μ μ − − , {\displaystyle \mu =\mu ^{+}-\mu ^{-},} where μ μ ± ± {\displaystyle \mu ^{\pm }} are both non-negative measures. Then the support of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is defined to be supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) := supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ + ) ∪ ∪ supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ − − ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {supp} (\mu ):=\operatorname {supp} (\mu ^{+})\cup \operatorname {supp} (\mu ^{-}).} Similarly, if μ μ : Σ Σ → → C {\displaystyle \mu :\Sigma \to \mathbb {C} } is a complex measure , the support of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is defined to be the union of the supports of its real and imaginary parts.

Properties [ edit ] supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ 1 + μ μ 2 ) = supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ 1 ) ∪ ∪ supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ 2 ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {supp} (\mu _{1}+\mu _{2})=\operatorname {supp} (\mu _{1})\cup \operatorname {supp} (\mu _{2})} holds.

A measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on X {\displaystyle X} is strictly positive if and only if it has support supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) = X .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {supp} (\mu )=X.} If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is strictly positive and x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} is arbitrary, then any open neighbourhood of x , {\displaystyle x,} since it is an open set , has positive measure; hence, x ∈ ∈ supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) , {\displaystyle x\in \operatorname {supp} (\mu ),} so supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) = X .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {supp} (\mu )=X.} Conversely, if supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) = X , {\displaystyle \operatorname {supp} (\mu )=X,} then every non-empty open set (being an open neighbourhood of some point in its interior, which is also a point of the support) has positive measure; hence, μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is strictly positive.
The support of a measure is closed in X , {\displaystyle X,} as its complement is the union of the open sets of measure 0.

{\displaystyle 0.} In general the support of a nonzero measure may be empty: see the examples below. However, if X {\displaystyle X} is a Hausdorff topological space and μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a Radon measure , a Borel set A {\displaystyle A} outside the support has measure zero : A ⊆ ⊆ X ∖ ∖ supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) ⟹ ⟹ μ μ ( A ) = 0.

{\displaystyle A\subseteq X\setminus \operatorname {supp} (\mu )\implies \mu (A)=0.} The converse is true if A {\displaystyle A} is open, but it is not true in general: it fails if there exists a point x ∈ ∈ supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) {\displaystyle x\in \operatorname {supp} (\mu )} such that μ μ ( { x } ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu (\{x\})=0} (e.g. Lebesgue measure). Thus, one does not need to "integrate outside the support": for any measurable function f : X → → R {\displaystyle f:X\to \mathbb {R} } or C , {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ,} ∫ ∫ X f ( x ) d μ μ ( x ) = ∫ ∫ supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) f ( x ) d μ μ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \int _{X}f(x)\,\mathrm {d} \mu (x)=\int _{\operatorname {supp} (\mu )}f(x)\,\mathrm {d} \mu (x).} The concept of support of a measure and that of spectrum of a self-adjoint linear operator on a Hilbert space are closely related. Indeed, if μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a regular Borel measure on the line R , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ,} then the multiplication operator ( A f ) ( x ) = x f ( x ) {\displaystyle (Af)(x)=xf(x)} is self-adjoint on its natural domain D ( A ) = { f ∈ ∈ L 2 ( R , d μ μ ) ∣ ∣ x f ( x ) ∈ ∈ L 2 ( R , d μ μ ) } {\displaystyle D(A)=\{f\in L^{2}(\mathbb {R} ,d\mu )\mid xf(x)\in L^{2}(\mathbb {R} ,d\mu )\}} and its spectrum coincides with the essential range of the identity function x ↦ ↦ x , {\displaystyle x\mapsto x,} which is precisely the support of μ μ .

{\displaystyle \mu .} [ 1 ] Examples [ edit ] Lebesgue measure [ edit ] In the case of Lebesgue measure λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } on the real line R , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ,} consider an arbitrary point x ∈ ∈ R .

{\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} .} Then any open neighbourhood N x {\displaystyle N_{x}} of x {\displaystyle x} must contain some open interval ( x − − ϵ ϵ , x + ϵ ϵ ) {\displaystyle (x-\epsilon ,x+\epsilon )} for some ϵ ϵ > 0.

{\displaystyle \epsilon >0.} This interval has Lebesgue measure 2 ϵ ϵ > 0 , {\displaystyle 2\epsilon >0,} so λ λ ( N x ) ≥ ≥ 2 ϵ ϵ > 0.

{\displaystyle \lambda (N_{x})\geq 2\epsilon >0.} Since x ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} } was arbitrary, supp ⁡ ⁡ ( λ λ ) = R .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {supp} (\lambda )=\mathbb {R} .} Dirac measure [ edit ] In the case of Dirac measure δ δ p , {\displaystyle \delta _{p},} let x ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} } and consider two cases: if x = p , {\displaystyle x=p,} then every open neighbourhood N x {\displaystyle N_{x}} of x {\displaystyle x} contains p , {\displaystyle p,} so δ δ p ( N x ) = 1 > 0.

{\displaystyle \delta _{p}(N_{x})=1>0.} on the other hand, if x ≠ ≠ p , {\displaystyle x\neq p,} then there exists a sufficiently small open ball B {\displaystyle B} around x {\displaystyle x} that does not contain p , {\displaystyle p,} so δ δ p ( B ) = 0.

{\displaystyle \delta _{p}(B)=0.} We conclude that supp ⁡ ⁡ ( δ δ p ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {supp} (\delta _{p})} is the closure of the singleton set { p } , {\displaystyle \{p\},} which is { p } {\displaystyle \{p\}} itself.

In fact, a measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on the real line is a Dirac measure δ δ p {\displaystyle \delta _{p}} for some point p {\displaystyle p} if and only if the support of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the singleton set { p } .

{\displaystyle \{p\}.} Consequently, Dirac measure on the real line is the unique measure with zero variance (provided that the measure has variance at all).

A uniform distribution [ edit ] Consider the measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on the real line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } defined by μ μ ( A ) := λ λ ( A ∩ ∩ ( 0 , 1 ) ) {\displaystyle \mu (A):=\lambda (A\cap (0,1))} i.e. a uniform measure on the open interval ( 0 , 1 ) .

{\displaystyle (0,1).} A similar argument to the Dirac measure example shows that supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) = [ 0 , 1 ] .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {supp} (\mu )=[0,1].} Note that the boundary points 0 and 1 lie in the support: any open set containing 0 (or 1) contains an open interval about 0 (or 1), which must intersect ( 0 , 1 ) , {\displaystyle (0,1),} and so must have positive μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } -measure.

A nontrivial measure whose support is empty [ edit ] The space of all countable ordinals with the topology generated by "open intervals" is a locally compact Hausdorff space . The measure ("Dieudonné measure") that assigns measure 1 to Borel sets containing an unbounded closed subset  and assigns 0 to other Borel sets is a Borel probability measure whose support is empty.

[ 2 ] A nontrivial measure whose support has measure zero [ edit ] On a compact Hausdorff space the support of a non-zero measure is always non-empty, but may have measure 0.

{\displaystyle 0.} An example of this is given by adding the first uncountable ordinal Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } to the previous example: the support of the measure is the single point Ω Ω , {\displaystyle \Omega ,} which has measure 0.
