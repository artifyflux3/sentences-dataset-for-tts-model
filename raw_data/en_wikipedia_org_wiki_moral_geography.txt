The kind of questions that are examined including asking whether distance from a phenomenon lessons one's duty, whether there is a substantial difference between private spaces and public spaces and analysing which moral positions are personal, which are societal, which are absolute and which are relative. One key question is how to respect difference whilst recognizing universal rights.
