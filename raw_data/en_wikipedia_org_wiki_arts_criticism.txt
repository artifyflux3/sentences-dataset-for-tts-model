Arts criticism is the process of describing, analyzing, interpreting, and judging works of art.

[ 1 ] The disciplines of arts criticism can be defined by the object being considered rather than the methodology (through analysis of its philosophy): buildings ( architecture criticism ), paintings ( visual art criticism ), performances ( dance criticism , theatre criticism ), music ( music journalism ), visual media ( film criticism , television criticism ), or literary texts ( literary criticism ).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Criticism of the arts can be broadly divided into two types. There is academic criticism such as that found in scholarly works and specialist journals, then there is criticism of a more journalistic nature (often called 'a review ') which is seen by a wider public through newspapers, television and radio. The academic criticism will be of a more vigorous and analytical nature than the journalistic, the journalistic may even focus on entertaining the reader at the expense of detail about the art under discussion.
