( December 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Experimental data in science and engineering is data produced by a measurement , test method , experimental design or quasi-experimental design . In clinical research any data produced are the result of a clinical trial. Experimental data may be qualitative or quantitative , each being appropriate for different investigations .

Generally speaking, qualitative data are considered more descriptive and can be subjective in comparison to having a continuous measurement scale that produces numbers.  Whereas quantitative data are gathered in a manner that is normally experimentally repeatable , qualitative information is usually more closely related to phenomenal meaning and is, therefore, subject to interpretation by individual observers .

Experimental data can be reproduced by a variety of different investigators and mathematical analysis may be performed on these data.
