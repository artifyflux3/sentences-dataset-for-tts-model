[ 1 ] Author [ edit ] Beckmann was a Czech who fled the Czechoslovak Communist regime to go to the United States. His dislike of authority gives A History of Pi a style that belies its dry title. For example, his chapter on the era following the classical age of ancient Greece is titled "The Roman Pest"; [ 2 ] he calls the Catholic Inquisition the act of "insane religious fanatic"; and he says that people who question public spending on scientific research are "intellectual cripples who drivel about 'too much technology' because technology has wounded them with the ultimate insult: 'They can't understand it any more.'" Beckmann was a prolific scientific author who wrote several electrical engineering textbooks and non-technical works, founded Golem Press, which published most of his books, and published his own monthly newsletter, Access to Energy . In his self-published book Einstein Plus Two and in Internet flame wars , he claimed that the theory of relativity is incorrect.

[ 3 ] Bibliography [ edit ] A History of Pi was originally published as A History of π in 1970 by Golem Press. This edition did not cover any approximations of π calculated after 1946. A second edition, printed in 1971, added material on the calculation of π by electronic computers, but still contained historical and mathematical errors, such as an incorrect proof that there exist infinitely many prime numbers .

[ 4 ] A third edition was published as A History of Pi in 1976 by St. Martin's Press . It was published as A History of Pi by Hippocrene Books in 1990.

[ 5 ] The title is given as A History of Pi by both Amazon [ 6 ] and by WorldCat.
