John Machin John Machin Born c. 1686 [ 1 ] England Died 9 June 1751 (aged 70–71) London , England Nationality English Known for Machin-like formula Scientific career Fields Mathematician and astronomer Institutions Gresham College Notable students Brook Taylor John Machin (bapt. c. 1686 – June 9, 1751) [ 1 ] was a professor of astronomy at Gresham College , London. He is best known for developing a quickly converging series for pi in 1706 and using it to compute pi to 100 decimal places.

History [ edit ] John Machin served as secretary of the Royal Society from 1718 to 1747. 
He was also a member of the commission which decided the Calculus priority dispute between Leibniz and Newton in 1712.

[ 2 ] On 16 May 1713 he succeeded Alexander Torriano as professor of astronomy in Gresham College , and held the post until his death, which occurred in London on 9 June 1751. 
Machin enjoyed a high mathematical reputation.  In 1706, Machin computed the value of π with the formula given below to one hundred decimal places. His ingenious quadrature of the circle was later investigated by Charles Hutton. A mass of his manuscripts is preserved by the Royal Astronomical Society ; and writing to William Jones in 1727, he asserted his claim to the parliamentary reward of £10,000 for amending the lunar tables.

[ 2 ] In 1728, he was listed as one of the subscribers to the Cyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers .

[ 3 ] Formula [ edit ] Machin's formula [ 4 ] (for which the derivation is straightforward) is: π π 4 = 4 arctan ⁡ ⁡ 1 5 − − arctan ⁡ ⁡ 1 239 {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{4}}=4\arctan {\frac {1}{5}}-\arctan {\frac {1}{239}}} The benefit of the new formula, a variation on the Gregory–Leibniz series ( ⁠ π / 4 ⁠ = arctan 1), was that it had a significantly increased rate of convergence, which made it a much more practical method of calculation.

To compute π to 100 decimal places, he combined his formula with the Taylor series expansion for the inverse tangent. ( Brook Taylor was Machin's contemporary in Cambridge University .) Machin's formula remained the primary tool of pi-hunters for centuries (well into the computer era).

Several other Machin-like formulae are known.
