It has regional correspondent offices in Washington, D.C.

, and Potsdam . It is the only major newspaper in the capital to have increased its circulation, now 148,000, since reunification .

[ citation needed ] Der Tagesspiegel is a liberal newspaper [ 1 ] that is classified as centrist media in the context of German politics.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] History and profile [ edit ] Founded on 27 September 1945 by Erik Reger, Walther Karsch and Edwin Redslob, Der Tagesspiegel 's main office is based in Berlin [ 5 ] at Askanischer Platz in the locality of Kreuzberg , about 600 metres (2,000 ft) from Potsdamer Platz and the former location of the Berlin Wall .

For more than 45 years, Der Tagesspiegel was owned by an independent trust . In 1993, in response to an increasingly competitive publishing environment, and to attract investments required for technical modernisation, such as commission of a new printing plant, and improved distribution, it was bought by the Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group . Its current publisher is Dieter von Holtzbrinck with editors in chief Stephan-Andreas Casdorff and Lorenz Maroldt [ de ] . Pierre Gerckens, Giovanni di Lorenzo and Hermann Rudolph are editors of the newspaper. Some of the notable writers include Bas Kast and Harald Martenstein .

The paper's main readership is in the western half of the city, due to the 1948 blockade having stopped its circulation in East Berlin and Brandenburg . The paper has recently [ when?

] been redesigned, introducing more colour and a clearer typeface . In 2005 it was awarded the World's Best-Designed Newspapers Award by the Society for News Design in New York. It is owned by Verlag Der Tagesspiegel GmbH , a member of the Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group , and associated with the Wall Street Journal . In 2009, Dieter von Holtzbrinck bought Der Tagesspiegel and Handelsblatt from Holtzbrinck.

[ 6 ] From 2005 to 2008, American journalist Michael Scaturro edited the English-language version of Der Tagesspiegel , which was known as The Berlin Paper .

[ 7 ] In 2007 and 2008 Der Tagesspiegel 's Washington, D.C.

, correspondent, Christoph von Marschall , was noted in both Germany and the United States for his coverage of Barack Obama 's presidential campaign. He wrote a book entitled Barack Obama – Der schwarze Kennedy . The literal translation of its German title is "Barack Obama – the Black Kennedy ".

[ 8 ] His book was a bestseller in Germany, where other commentators had also compared the two Americans.
