Pseudo-Aristotle ).

[ 1 ] Thomas Winter has suggested that the author was Archytas , [ 2 ] while Michael Coxhead says that it is only possible to conclude that the author was one of the Peripatetics .

[ 3 ] During the Renaissance , an edition of this work was published by Francesco Maurolico . A Latin translation was made by Vettor Fausto , dedicated to Giovanni Badoer in 1517.
