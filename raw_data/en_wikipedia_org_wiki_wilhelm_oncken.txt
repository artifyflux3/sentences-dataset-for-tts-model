Wilhelm Oncken Born ( 1838-12-19 ) 19 December 1838 Heidelberg , German Confederation Died 11 August 1905 (1905-08-11) (aged 66) Gießen , German Empire Occupation Historian Christian Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Oncken (19 December 1838 – 11 August 1905) was a German historian .

Biography [ edit ] Oncken was born in Heidelberg to Anton Wilhelm Oncken, a lawyer and intellectual, and his wife Marie Eleonare Thaden. He was the brother of economist August Oncken [ de ] .

After his early education, Oncken studied classical philology , history and philosophy in Heidelberg, Göttingen and Berlin. In 1856, during his studies, he became a member of the Frankonia Heidelberg student society . He studied under historian Ludwig Häusser and graduated with a doctorate in 1862; in 1866, after a period as a private tutor, he became an Außerordentlicher Professor (professor without chair) of history at Heidelberg, specializing in Greek antiquity.
Oncken was a typical nineteenth-century national liberal , using history as a means of national political education.

In 1870 he was appointed a professor of history at the University of Gießen . Although he originally continued his work on the history of ancient Greece, he later turned to the history of Prussia and the topic of German unification . He aligned himself with the National Liberal Party (Germany) , serving as a delegate to the Hessian and national governments, and came to see his work teaching history as a means of national political education. He remained at Gießen for his entire career, declining an appointment to the University of Königsberg in 1873, and served as its chancellor in 1877-78. He was also a member and sometime leader of the Gießen Masonic lodge "Ludwig zur Treue".

Oncken published his most famous work, Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen [ de ] ( Common History in Monographs ) in 44 volumes, issued from 1876 to 1891. He delivered countless public lectures on the history of Germany, held throughout the country.

Wilhem I commissioned Oncken to write his biography; however, the work, Das Zeitalter des Kaisers Wilhelm ( The Era of Kaiser Wilhelm ) was published two years after Wilhelm's death in 1888.

In 1900 the university recognized him with emeritus status. He died on 11 August 1905 in Gießen , at the age of 67 years.
