He has been Queen Elizabeth II Birmingham Centenary Professor of Environmental Health at the University of Birmingham since 1991, and is a distinguished adjunct professor at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Roy Michael Harrison was born on 14 October 1948 to Wilfred and Rosa Harrison ( née Cotton ).

[ 3 ] He was educated at Henley Grammar School and the University of Birmingham , where he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1969, followed by a PhD in organic chemistry in 1972 and a Doctor of Science degree in environmental chemistry in 1989.

[ 3 ] [ 2 ] His PhD research investigated sigmatropic reactions of tropolone ethers.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Research and career [ edit ] Harrison is an expert on air pollution , specialising in the area of airborne particulates , including nanoparticles .

[ 7 ] His interests extend from source emissions, through atmospheric chemical and physical transformations, [ 8 ] to human exposures and effects upon health.

[ 9 ] His most significant work has been in the field of vehicle emitted particles, including their chemical composition and atmospheric processing.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] This forms the basis of the current understanding of the relationship of emissions to roadside concentrations and size distributions.

[ 9 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] In addition to leading a large project on diesel exhaust particles, he is also engaged in major collaborative studies of processes determining air quality in Beijing and Delhi .

[ 9 ] Awards and honours [ edit ] Harrison's work has been recognised by award of the John Jeyes Medal and Environment Prize of the Royal Society of Chemistry and the Fitzroy Prize of the Royal Meteorological Society .  He has served for many years as a chair and/or member of advisory committees of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department of Health .  He was appointed Order of the British Empire OBE in the 2004 New Year Honours for services to environmental science [ 13 ] and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2017 .

[ 9 ] Personal life [ edit ] Harrison married Angela Copeman in 1981. After their divorce, he married Susan Stuart in 1989. Harrison has a son and a daughter from his first marriage, and a son from his second. He enjoys "mowing and other outdoor pursuits".
