To do calculus on the tensor bundle a connection is needed, except for the special case of the exterior derivative of antisymmetric tensors.

Definition [ edit ] See also: Tensor field § Tensor bundles A tensor bundle is a fiber bundle where the fiber is a tensor product of any number of copies of the tangent space and/or cotangent space of the base space, which is a manifold. As such, the fiber is a vector space and the tensor bundle is a special kind of vector bundle .
