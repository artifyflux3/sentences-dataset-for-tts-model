[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He is known as the 'father of American geology'.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] As a social experimenter on new types of community life, he collaborated with British social reformer Robert Owen , (1771–1854), in the utopian settlement of New Harmony in Indiana , United States.

Maclure had a highly successful mercantile career, making a fortune that allowed him to retire in 1797 at the early age of 34 to pursue his scientific, geological and other interests. In 1809 he made the earliest attempt at a geological map of the United States of America.

[ 5 ] Biography [ edit ] Early life, business, and education [ edit ] Maclure was born in 1763 in Ayr , Scotland.

After a brief visit to New York City in 1782, he began work with the merchants Miller, Hart & Co, who traded and shipped goods to and from America. Maclure was based in the London office but regularly travelled to France and Ireland on business.

[ 6 ] In 1796 business affairs took him to Virginia , which he thereafter made his home. 
In 1803 he visited France as one of the commissioners appointed to settle the claims of American citizens on the French government; and during the few years then spent in Europe he applied himself with enthusiasm to the study of geology .

[ 7 ] While residing in Switzerland, he became impressed with what is now called the Pestalozzi School System, from Swiss pedagogist Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746–1827).

[ citation needed ] Geological map [ edit ] Maclure visit to Spain in 1808; this visit ended abruptly by the outbreak of the Peninsular War. After his return home in 1808 he commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him, the Allegheny Mountains being crossed and recrossed some 50 times.

[ 8 ] The results of his unaided labours were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map , and published in the Society's Transactions, together with the first geological map of that country, [ 7 ] Maclure's 1809 Geological Map .

[ 9 ] This antedates William Smith 's geological map of England and Wales (with part of Scotland) by six years, although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks.

Maclure's Geological Map of the United States, published in 1817 In 1812, while in France, Maclure became a member of the newly founded Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP). In 1817 Maclure became president of the ANSP, a post he held for the next 22 years.

[ 10 ] In 1817, while residing in Europe, Maclure brought before the same society a revised edition of his map, and his great geological memoir, which he had issued separately, with some additional matter, under the title Observations on the Geology of the United States of America .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Subsequent surveys have corroborated the general accuracy of Maclure's observations.

[ 7 ] Later years [ edit ] In 1820 he visited Spain, because since the restoration of the Constitution in July 1820, Spain was the only liberal country in Europe. He attempted to establish an agricultural college near the city of Alicante , but in 1823 the invasion of the French army, the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis , imposed absolutism again and in 2 May 1824, he abandoned Alicante.

[ 10 ] Returning to America in 1824, he settled for some years at New Harmony, Indiana , seeking to develop his vision of the agricultural college. Failing health ultimately required him to relinquish the attempt and to seek (in 1827) a more congenial climate in Mexico.

[ 7 ] There, in 1840, at San Ángel , he died aged 77. His will provided for a trust fund consisting of most of his property. Under the terms of the Trust, 160 workingmen's libraries were established. The treatment of Maclure's burial site in Mexico was bereft of the honors due the respected humanitarian and geologist: The burial site of William Maclure At the distance of a few feet from them, repose the remains of William McClure, a countryman, dear to American science. The Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia, of which he was so long the President and benefactor, erected a small marble monument over his grave, and surrounded it with an iron rail. A short time before I left Mexico, the rail was torn down, the monument upset, and, on the same night, the newly-buried body of a Scotchman was disinterred, stripped of its clothes, and thrown over the wall of the cemetery!

New Harmony [ edit ] Main article: New Harmony, Indiana The New Harmony commune in Indiana was a short-lived utopian community. Even after its collapse, it became home to geologists, naturalists, and botanists who were influenced by Maclure. This included the siblings Robert Dale Owen (1801–1877), social reformer; David Dale Owen (1807–1860), geologist, artist; Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy (1806–1861), educator; and Richard Dale Owen (1810–1890) geologist, first president of Purdue University , Lafayette, Indiana . A formidable group of  geologists, social reformers, botanists , paleobotanists , ethnologists and civil engineers interacted at New Harmony.
