Town or city Allston , Boston , Massachusetts Country United States Coordinates 42°22′11″N 71°07′33″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.3697°N 71.1258°W ﻿ / 42.3697; -71.1258 Named for Marshall Newell Year(s) built 1900 Owner Harvard University Technical details Material Concrete, slate Design and construction Architect(s) Peabody and Stearns Newell Boathouse is a boathouse on the Charles River in Boston , Massachusetts, United States. Named for a popular Harvard athlete killed just a few years after graduation, is the primary boathouse used by Harvard University 's varsity men's rowing teams.

[ 1 ] It stands on land subject to an unusual peppercorn lease agreement between Harvard and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] History [ edit ] Called "the elder statesman among Charles River boathouses," [ 4 ] Newell Boathouse is named for 1894 Harvard College graduate Marshall Newell , a varsity rower and All-American football player in all four of his undergraduate years, "beloved by all those who knew him" and nicknamed "Ma" for the guidance he gave younger athletes.

[ 5 ] After Newell was killed in 1897, [ 6 ] $2,000 was raised for a boathouse in his memory.

[ 5 ] Built in 1900 on the south side of the Charles to a design by Peabody and Stearns (architect Robert Peabody having been rowing captain as a Harvard undergraduate), [ 1 ] Newell Boathouse is constructed of concrete, with a slate façade and roof. It was Harvard's first permanent boathouse, [ 7 ] replacing a series of wooden boathouses in the area.

[ 8 ] In addition to storage for racing shells , the building provides locker rooms, meeting and training rooms, and rowing tanks and other practice equipment.

[ 4 ] Architectural historian Bainbridge Bunting wrote that its "complex profile ... closely resembling that of Carey Cage reflected in the Charles in the early morning, has made it a landmark on the river." [ 7 ] Site lease [ edit ] The "prime riverfront space" upon which Newell Boathouse stands belongs to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In addition to having given the Commonwealth forty-six acres of land downriver, Harvard pays $1 per year for the right to maintain a boathouse on the site, under a lease running one thousand years, at the end of which time Harvard has the option to renew the lease for a further thousand years [ 3 ] ‍—‌an example of a peppercorn lease amounting to "virtual freehold."
