TDRS spacecraft are all in geostationary orbit and are operated by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration , and are used for communication between NASA facilities and spacecraft, [ 1 ] including the Space Shuttle , Hubble Space Telescope , and International Space Station .

As of August 2025 [update] , 7 out of 12 TDRS satellites launched were operational, two ( TDRS-3 , TDRS-5 ) had been placed in storage, three ( TDRS-1 , TDRS-4 and TDRS-9 ) had been retired, and one ( TDRS-B ) had been lost in a launch failure .
