The season officially began on May 15, 2025, in the eastern Pacific basin (east of 140°W ), and on June 1, 2025, in the central Pacific (between 140°W and the International Date Line ); both will end on November 30, 2025. These dates, adopted by convention, describe the period in each year when most subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis occurs in these regions of the Pacific Ocean.

In contrast to last season , which was the latest starting Pacific hurricane season in the satellite era, there were multiple early season storms this year.

[ 1 ] Tropical Storm Alvin was the first system of the season. It formed off the coast of southern Mexico on May 28, and impacted El Salvador and western Mexico. Five systems formed in June, two of which became major hurricanes. Tropical Storm Dalila caused flooding while offshore Mexico.

Hurricane Erick became the earliest major hurricane to make landfall on either coast of Mexico (Pacific or Atlantic). Erick caused at least US$ 250 million in damage and 24 fatalities in southwestern Mexico . It was followed by Hurricane Flossie, which passed near the coast of southwestern Mexico, resulting in flooding and property damage. In August, Tropical Storm Ivo brought strong winds and heavy rain to parts of Mexico.

Seasonal forecasts [ edit ] Record Named storms Hurricanes Major hurricanes Ref Average (1991–2020): 15 8 4 [ 2 ] Record high activity: 1992: 27 2015: 16 2015: 11 [ 3 ] Record low activity: 2010: 8 2010: 3 2003: 0 [ 3 ] Date Source Named storms Hurricanes Major hurricanes Ref May 7, 2025 SMN 16–20 8–11 4–6 [ 4 ] May 22, 2025 NOAA 12–18 5–10 2–5 [ 5 ] Actual activity : EPAC 9 5 2 Actual activity : CPAC 2 1 1 Actual combined activity : 11 6 3 In advance of each Pacific hurricane season, forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Climate Prediction Center , and Mexico 's Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the amount of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular season.

[ 2 ] According to NOAA, the average Pacific hurricane season between 1991 and 2020 contained about 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes and 4 major hurricanes (Category 3 and higher), as well as an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 80–115 units. Broadly speaking, ACE is the measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical cyclone multiplied by the length of time it existed. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical or subtropical cyclones reaching wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h) or higher. NOAA typically describes a season as above-average, average, or below-average depending on the cumulative ACE index, but the number of tropical storms, hurricanes or major hurricanes can also be considered.

[ 2 ] On May 7, 2025, SMN issued its first outlook for the Pacific hurricane season, forecasting an above average season with 16–20 named storms, 8–11 hurricanes, and 4–6 major hurricanes.

[ 4 ] On May 22, NOAA released its outlook for the eastern Pacific, which calls for a near-average season with 12 to 18 named storms, 5 to 10 hurricanes, and 2 to 5 major hurricanes, citing a continued neutral phase, the unlikelihood of an El Niño , and the possibility of La Niña in the summer.

[ 5 ] This increases vertical wind shear in the basin and slightly reduces sea surface temperatures, thus favoring mild to moderate tropical cyclone activity. Furthermore, many global computer models predicted a negative Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), a phase of a multi-decadal cycle that favored the continuation of much warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures, which had been occurring since 2021 , unlike the 1991-2020 period, which generally featured below-normal activity.

[ 2 ] Seasonal summary [ edit ] For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the 2025 Pacific hurricane season .

Background [ edit ] Officially, the 2025 Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 in the Eastern Pacific, on June 1 in the Central Pacific, and both will end on November 30.

[ 6 ] Altogether, eleven tropical cyclones have formed, nine in the Eastern Pacific and two in the Central Pacific, and all became named storms . Six of the storms strengthened into hurricanes, with three of them intensifying into major hurricanes.

This season's ACE index, as of August 14, is approximately 49.2 units, as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the NHC.

[ 7 ] This number represents sum of the squares of the maximum sustained wind speed (knots) for all named storms while they are at least tropical storm intensity, divided by 10,000.

Early activity [ edit ] Three simultaneous tropical systems on July 29, Hurricane Iona (left), Tropical Storm Keli (center), and Invest 98E (right) Activity within the Eastern Pacific began with the formation and development of Tropical Storm Alvin on May 28, two weeks after the official start of the season, but nearly two weeks earlier than the average formation date of the basin's first named storm.

[ 8 ] Alvin persisted off the coast of Mexico for a few days before degenerating into a remnant low on May 31.

[ 9 ] The pace of activity quickened in early June. Two storms, Hurricane Barbara and Tropical Storm Cosme, formed on June 8, off the coast of southwestern Mexico.

[ 1 ] Next came Tropical Storm Dalila, which formed near the coast of southern Mexico on June 13.

[ 10 ] Hurricane Erick followed early on June 17, off the coast of southern Mexico.

[ 11 ] Erick was the earliest major hurricane on record to make landfall on either coast of Mexico ( Pacific or Atlantic); the previous Pacific coast record was set by Hurricane Kiko on August 26, 1989.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Next came Hurricane Flossie on June 29, [ 14 ] which became a Category 3 hurricane off the southwestern coast of Mexico [ 15 ] Dalila, Erick, and Flossie became the earliest fourth, fifth, and sixth named storms respectively in the Eastern Pacific since official naming of storms began there in 1960 .

[ 16 ] Tropical activity in the Central Pacific commenced in late July, with the formation of Hurricane Iona on July 27 and Tropical Storm Keli the following day.

[ 17 ] Both tracked to the south of Island of Hawaiʻi , with Iona crossing the International Date Line. Soon thereafter, Hurricane Gil formed in the open Eastern Pacific on July 31, far south-southwest of the Baja California peninsula.

[ 18 ] Peak season activity [ edit ] Next came Hurricane Henriette, which formed far to the southwest of the Baja California peninsula on August 4, [ 19 ] and ultimately tracked northeast of Hawaii.

[ 20 ] It was soon joined by Tropical Storm Ivo on August 6.

[ 21 ] Systems [ edit ] Tropical Storm Alvin [ edit ] Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration May 28 – May 31 Peak intensity 60 mph (95 km/h) (1-min) ; 999 mbar ( hPa ) On May 25, an area of low pressure developed south of the coast of southern Mexico, [ 22 ] along the eastern North Pacific monsoon trough .

[ 23 ] On the afternoon of May 28, the low developed into Tropical Depression One‑E.

[ 24 ] The depression became more organized around the center and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alvin the next morning.

[ 25 ] The storm continued to become better organized throughout the day, due to moving toward the northwest within an environment of warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and low wind shear , causing its sustained winds to increase to 60 mph (95 km/h).

[ 26 ] Early on May 30, the storm moved into an increasingly hostile environment with increasing wind shear and decreasing SSTs, causing it to weaken.

[ 27 ] Later, on the morning of May 31, Alvin degenerated into a remnant low while approaching the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula .

[ 9 ] The trough of low pressure that spawned Alvin caused strong winds and heavy rain in El Salvador and Chiapas . In El Salvador, multiple buildings were damaged and over 50 people were injured. One person was killed.

[ 28 ] However, the NHC did not attribute this fatality to Alvin in their post storm report. Agricultural losses in Emiliano Zapata were estimated at Mex$230,000 (US$12,000).

[ 29 ] In Greater Mexico City , remnant moisture from Alvin caused heavy rainfall and flash flooding in Coacalco de Berriozábal and Los Reyes La Paz . Numerous vehicles and roads were damaged by floodwaters. In Los Reyes La Paz, a group of people in a car were swept away by floodwaters.

[ 30 ] Alvin also generated heavy rainfall over Mexico City . An average of 53.5 to 84.5 mm (2.11 to 3.33 in) of rain fell in 24 hours. These rains disrupted the Mexico City Metro and other public transportation lines.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] At least 400 homes and 64 vehicles were damaged.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] The government allocated Mex$11.6 million (US$617,000) to support families in Iztapalapa affected by the flooding.

[ 35 ] In Sonora , Alvin generated heavy rain across 10 municipalities.

[ 36 ] Tomato farmers were badly affected by the rains.

[ 37 ] Additionally, remnant moisture from Alvin also reached the Southwestern United States .

[ 38 ] Hurricane Barbara [ edit ] Category 1 hurricane (SSHWS) Duration June 8 – June 10 Peak intensity 75 mph (120 km/h) (1-min) ; 991 mbar ( hPa ) On June 4, a trough of low pressure formed off the coast of southern Mexico.

[ 39 ] Two days later, showers and thunderstorms associated with the low gradually increased near the Gulf of Tehuantepec .

[ 40 ] By the morning of June 8, a closed and well-defined low-level circulation had developed within the disturbance, marking the formation of Tropical Storm Barbara.

[ 41 ] Barbara steadily strengthened into the next day, and by 14:00 UTC on June 9, had become a minimal Category 1 hurricane, while located about 155 mi (250 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima .

[ 42 ] Later that same day, however, the system weakened, and fell below hurricane strength.

[ 43 ] Then, on June 10, as Barbara moved through cooler waters and into a less favorable atmospheric environment, its deep convection diminished considerably, [ 44 ] and by late that same day, it had degenerated to a remnant low.

[ 45 ] Tropical Storm Cosme [ edit ] Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration June 8 – June 11 Peak intensity 70 mph (110 km/h) (1-min) ; 992 mbar ( hPa ) On June 6, a broad area of low pressure formed along the western side of an elongated trough south of Mexico.

[ 46 ] Showers and thunderstorms associated with the low became considerably better organized early on June 8, resulting in the formation of Tropical Depression Three-E.

[ 47 ] Moving slowly northwestward, the system soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Cosme.

[ 48 ] Cosme continued to intensify, and by the afternoon of June 9, was nearing hurricane strength, with sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h).

[ 49 ] Additional strengthening was stifled, however, and Cosme began weakening the following morning, due to the effects of moderate northeasterly wind shear and the presence of Barbara to the northeast.

[ 50 ] Ultimately, all deep convection ceased, and the storm degenerated to a remnant low early on June 11.

[ 51 ] Tropical Storm Dalila [ edit ] Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration June 13 – June 15 Peak intensity 65 mph (100 km/h) (1-min) ; 992 mbar ( hPa ) On June 10, a broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.

[ 52 ] Showers and thunderstorms associated with the low increased the following day and later began showing signs of organization, though its low-level circulation remained broad and elongated. Due to the increasing likelihood of the system developing into a tropical storm, and its proximity to coastal Mexico, the NHC designated it Potential Tropical Cyclone Four‑E at 21:00 UTC on June 12.

[ 53 ] The system gradually became better organized, developing into Tropical Depression Four‑E, [ 54 ] then soon strengthening into Tropical Storm Dalila at 18:00 UTC on June 13, about 195 mi (315 km) south of Zihuatanejo , Guerrero .

[ 55 ] The storm continued to gain strength the following day near the coast of southwestern Mexico, its sustained winds reaching 65 mph (100 km/h) that afternoon.

[ 56 ] However, on the morning of June 15, Dalila began weakening, [ 57 ] and it became a remnant low late that day.

[ 58 ] Dalila brought high winds and flooding to coastal southern and southwestern Mexico. In the Soconusco region of Chiapas , there were blackouts, fallen trees, and flooding. In Tapachula , a man was sucked into a sewer near a wastewater treatment plant while helping unclog it.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] Additionally, mudslides, road washouts, fallen trees, and roof collapses were reported in several municipalities of Guerrero , primarily in and around Acapulco .

[ 61 ] Power outages were reported in Guerrero.

[ 62 ] Dangerous rip currents and surf conditions also affected much of Mexico's Pacific coast.

[ 63 ] Businesses in Acapulco suffered losses of Mex$750 million (US$39.4 million).

[ 64 ] Hurricane Erick [ edit ] Category 4 hurricane (SSHWS) Duration June 17 – June 20 Peak intensity 145 mph (230 km/h) (1-min) ; 939 mbar ( hPa ) Main article: Hurricane Erick On June 14, a broad area of low pressure, associated with a tropical wave , formed off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica .

[ 65 ] Showers and thunderstorms associated with the low became better organized over the next couple of days, and the NHC designated it Potential Tropical Cyclone Five‑E at 21:00 UTC on June 16.

[ 66 ] The system soon acquired a well-defined circulation, developing into Tropical Depression Five‑E.

[ 67 ] The depression then strengthened into Tropical Storm Erick the next morning.

[ 68 ] The storm tracked northwestward through the day, while becoming increasingly better-organized. Deep convection expanded, and cloud tops cooled to about −120 °F (−85 °C) near the improving inner-core structure.

[ 69 ] Erick rapidly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane [ 12 ] around 12:00 UTC on June 18, about 160 mi (255 km) south-southeast of Puerto Ángel , Oaxaca .

[ 70 ] Rapid intensification continued, and with data collected from a Hurricane Hunter flight, the NHC upgraded Erick to category 2 strength a few hours later.

[ 12 ] Then, after another Hurricane Hunter flight, the storm was upgraded once more, becoming a Category 3 major hurricane at 00:00 UTC on June 19.

[ 71 ] Later, as Erick approached the coast of Mexico, the storm reached its peak intensity, with Category 4 sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 939 mb (27.73 inHg).

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] Then, shortly before 12:00 UTC, Erick made landfall in extreme western Oaxaca, about 20 mi (30 km) east of Punta Maldonado , Guerrero , with sustained winds of 125 mph (200 km/h).

[ 74 ] Inland, the hurricane rapidly weakened as its inner core began to collapse.

[ 13 ] Moving northwestward over rugged terrain, the inner core continued to deteriorate, and the system's overall convective pattern became quite ragged. Consequently, Erick weakened to tropical storm strength by 21:00 UTC.

[ 75 ] Later that same day, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, and then dissipated.

[ 76 ] Losses in Oaxaca reached Mex$2 billion (US$105 million), [ 77 ] while losses in Acapulco reached Mex$1.878 billion (US$99 million).

[ 78 ] Hurricane Flossie [ edit ] Category 3 hurricane (SSHWS) Duration June 29 – July 3 Peak intensity 120 mph (195 km/h) (1-min) ; 958 mbar ( hPa ) On June 23, a broad area of low pressure formed off the Pacific coast of Central America.

[ 79 ] After several days within favorable environment, the shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the disturbance become much better organized on June 28, and Tropical Depression Six-E formed early the next morning, when the low developed a well-defined, closed low-level circulation with maximum winds around 30 mph (45 km/h).

[ 80 ] Convection continued to become better organized, with curved banding to the north of the center a few hours later, marking the formation of Tropical Storm Flossie that same day.

[ 81 ] Flossie steadily gained strength on June 30, amid a favorable environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of about 84 to 86 °F (29 to 30 °C), [ 82 ] the storm attained hurricane strength late that day, about 175 mi (280 km) south of Manzanillo, Colima .

[ 83 ] The system continued to rapidly intensify on July 1, becoming a Category 3 major hurricane by day's end.

[ 84 ] The next morning, Flossie's eye became more ragged and the northern eyewall started to deteriorate, weakening the system to Category 2 strength.

[ 85 ] Flossie's structure continued to degrade, and, early on July 3, it weakened to a tropical storm.

[ 86 ] Then, having moved over colder sea surface temperatures southwest of Baja California Sur , the storm lost all convection, [ 87 ] and transitioned into a post-tropical low that afternoon.

[ 88 ] Flooding, fallen trees, land slides, and minor property damage was reported in Michoacán .

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] Similar damage was reported in the neighboring states of Guerrero, and Colima. In Manzanillo, Colima, a man drowned after being swept away by rough surf.

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] Hurricane Iona [ edit ] Category 3 hurricane (SSHWS) Duration July 27 – August 2 ( Exited basin ) Peak intensity 125 mph (205 km/h) (1-min) ; 957 mbar ( hPa ) On July 24, a broad area of low pressure developed in the Eastern Pacific, far to the southeast of the Hawaiian Islands .

[ 93 ] The disturbance moved into the Central Pacific the following day.

[ 94 ] The low became better organized as it moved westward, and developed persistent deep convection on July 26. Consequently, the disturbance was designated Tropical Depression One-C early on July 27.

[ 95 ] Later that day, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Iona.

[ 96 ] The storm quickly intensified amid favorable environmental conditions overnight, attaining hurricane strength early on July 28.

[ 97 ] By late that day, Iona had developed a well-defined eye, surrounded by −94 to −112 °F (−70 to −80 °C) cloud tops, as it rapidly intensified to a Category 3 major hurricane by 09:00 UTC on July 29.

[ 98 ] Having already strengthened by about 60 mph (95 km/h) in 24 hours, the system continued to rapidly intensify, with its sustained winds reaching 125 mph (205 km/h) several hours later. Though a powerful system, Iona's windfield remained compact, with hurricane- and tropical-storm-force winds only extending to around 25 mi (35 km) and 80 mi (130 km) from the center, respectively.

[ 99 ] Later that day, Iona began to weaken, due to increasing westerly wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures, [ 100 ] as it passed about 715 mi (1,150 km) south of Honolulu .

[ 101 ] This trend continued, and by midday on July 30, the system had rapidly weakened to a tropical storm.

[ 102 ] For the next couple of days, the storm moved generally west-northwestward while slowly weakening. Iona was downgraded to a tropical depression shortly before crossing the International Date Line on August 2.

[ 103 ] Tropical Storm Keli [ edit ] Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration July 28 – July 30 Peak intensity 40 mph (65 km/h) (1-min) ; 1006 mbar ( hPa ) On July 27, an area of low pressure developed well east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

[ 104 ] Quickly organizing into a cyclone, the low became Tropical Depression Two-C early on July 28, about 460 mi (740 km) east-northeast of Hurricane Iona. A compact system, the depression's cloud pattern extended only about 105 mi (165 km) across.

[ 105 ] Later that day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Keli.

[ 106 ] Keli struggled to become better organized due to vertical wind shear and upper-level outflow from nearby Hurricane Iona as it tracked westward, steered by a mid-level ridge to its north.

[ 107 ] Keli remained a minimal tropical storm through the morning of July 30, when its convection mostly collapsed and its low-level circulation opened into a trough on the northern side of Iona, [ 108 ] about 520 mi (835 km) south of Honolulu.

[ 109 ] Hurricane Gil [ edit ] Category 1 hurricane (SSHWS) Duration July 31 – August 3 Peak intensity 75 mph (120 km/h) (1-min) ; 991 mbar ( hPa ) On July 28, a broad area of low pressure formed well off the coast of southwestern Mexico.

[ 110 ] The disturbance become better organized the following day, and developed into Tropical Storm Gil early on July 31.

[ 111 ] Afterward, Gil gained strength steadily, while moving quickly toward the west-northwest. Then, late on August 1, after overcoming an intrusion of dry air, the storm strengthened into a 75 mph (120 km/h) hurricane, [ 112 ] about 1,080 mi (1,740 km) west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.

[ 113 ] However, the system soon moved into cooler waters, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm by the following morning.

[ 114 ] Later, after becoming devoid of deep convection due to the cool waters and a drier, more stable environment, Gil transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone early on August 3.

[ 115 ] Hurricane Henriette [ edit ] Category 1 hurricane (SSHWS) Duration August 4 – August 13 Peak intensity 85 mph (140 km/h) (1-min) ; 986 mbar ( hPa ) On August 2, a broad area of low pressure formed well off the coast of southwestern Mexico.

[ 116 ] The disturbance became better organized late the next day, and developed into Tropical Depression Eight‑E.

[ 117 ] Then, on August 4, it strengthened more, and the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Henriette.

[ 118 ] The system become slightly better organized later in the day as it tracked to the west-northwest, its sustained winds increased to 50 mph (85 km/h).

[ 119 ] Henriette's strength changed little over the next couple of days, and it remained weak and ragged.

[ 120 ] Moving westward over gradually cooling waters on August 6, the storm became nearly devoid of all deep convection and the low-level center became fully exposed.

[ 121 ] At 09:00 UTC on August 8, Henriette crossed into the Central Pacific basin, about 975 mi (1,570 km) east of Hilo, Hawaii .

[ 122 ] Later that day, Henriette briefly degenerated into a remnant low, [ 123 ] before regenerating into a tropical depression the following morning.

[ 124 ] Henriette then restrengthened into a tropical storm the same day.

[ 125 ] The storm strengthened on August 10, despite the marginal water temperatures, [ 126 ] rapidly intensifying into a hurricane at 18:00 UTC that afternoon.

[ 127 ] Henriette then went through an eyewall replacement early on August 11.

GMI imagery that morning showed a ring of deep convection surrounding what remained of the previous eyewall.

[ 128 ] Later that day, as the system passed about 585 mi (945 km) north of Honolulu , Hawaii, its winds increased to 85 mph (140 km/h).

[ 129 ] On August 12, Henriette weakened to tropical storm strength as a result of cooler waters and moderate wind shear.

[ 130 ] Later, as the storm moved northwestward amid increasingly hostile conditions, Henriette's low-level circulation became decoupled from the increasingly fragmented and shallow convection, [ 131 ] and it transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone early on August 13.

[ 132 ] Tropical Storm Ivo [ edit ] Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration August 6 – August 11 Peak intensity 65 mph (100 km/h) (1-min) ; 999 mbar ( hPa ) On August 4, an area of low pressure producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms formed just offshore of Central America.

[ 133 ] The disturbance become better organized during the following day, [ 134 ] and developed into Tropical Storm Ivo on the afternoon of August 6, [ 135 ] about 195 mi (310 km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Guerrero.

[ 136 ] Over the next couple of days, Ivo steadily strengthened while moving parallel to the coast of southwestern Mexico.

[ 137 ] The storm's tropical-storm-force winds, which extended only about 45 mi (75 km) out from the center, remained offshore.

[ 138 ] Ivo turned westward on August 8, due to strong mid-level ridging entrenched to its north, and its maximum sustained winds increased to 65 mph (100 km/h).

[ 139 ] The following day, moderate northeasterly shear and gradually cooling sea surface temperatures caused Ivo to weaken.

[ 140 ] This trend continued, and on August 10, the storm weakened to a tropical depression.

[ 141 ] By the end of the day, all convection associated with Ivo had dissipated, and the system degenerated into a remnant low early on August 11.

[ 142 ] In Oaxaca , flooding and landslides forced road closures.

[ 143 ] In Acapulco, street flooding was reported and the port was closed to small boat traffic.

[ 144 ] In Colima, Baja California Sur, Jalisco , and Nayarit , strong wind gusts, periods of heavy rain, and rough surf was reported.

[ 145 ] [ 146 ] In Tepic , Nayarit, up to 100 mm (3.94 in) of rainfall per hour was recorded on August 7.

[ 147 ] Interaction of multiple weather systems, including inflow derived from Ivo, brought heavy rains to Sinaloa , where a record 118.7 mm (4.67 in) of rain fell in Mazatlán in 24 hours.

[ 148 ] A total of 127 people were rescued from floodwaters. Ten sewage canals overflowed, 24 neighborhoods were flooded, and seven roads were closed.

[ 149 ] [ 150 ] A pedestrian bridge also collapsed.

[ 151 ] The government allocated a total of Mex$1.074 million (US$58,000) to support 179 families with recovery efforts from the storm.

[ 152 ] In Veracruz , an Atlantic basin tropical wave absorbed moisture aloft from Ivo, which compounded the rainfall there.

[ 153 ] Storm names [ edit ] Main articles: Tropical cyclone naming , History of tropical cyclone naming , and List of historical tropical cyclone names The following list of names is being used for named storms that form in the North Pacific Ocean east of 140°W during 2025.

[ 154 ] This is the same list used in the 2019 season .
