The institute was founded in 1995 and is located in the Potsdam Science Park in Golm, Potsdam and in Hannover where it closely collaborates with the Leibniz University Hannover . Both the Potsdam and the Hannover parts of the institute are organized in three research departments and host a number of independent research groups.

The institute conducts fundamental research in mathematics, data analysis , astrophysics and theoretical physics as well as research in laser physics , vacuum technology, vibration isolation and classical and quantum optics .

When the LIGO Scientific Collaboration announced the first detection of gravitational waves , researchers of the institute were involved in modeling, detecting, analysing and characterising the signals. The institute is part of a number of collaborations and projects: it is a main partner in the gravitational-wave detector GEO600 ; institute scientists are developing waveform-models that are applied in the gravitational-wave detectors for detecting and characterising gravitational waves . They are developing detector technology and are also analyzing data from the detectors of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration and the KAGRA Collaboration. They also play a leading role in planning and preparing the space-based detector LISA (planned launch date: 2034) and are involved in developing the third generation of earth-bound gravitational-wave detectors ( Einstein Telescope , Cosmic Explorer ). The institute is also a major player in the Einstein@Home and PyCBC projects.

The Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hannover.

From 1998 to 2015, the institute has published the open access review journal Living Reviews in Relativity .

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The newly founded institute started its work in April 1995 and has been located in Potsdam-Golm since 1999.

[ 2 ] In 2002 the institute opened a branch at the Universität Hannover with a focus on data analysis and the development and operation of gravitational-wave detectors on Earth and in space. The Hannover institute originated from the Institute for Atom and Molecule Physics (AMP) of the Universität Hannover, which was established in 1979 by the Department of Physics.

Research [ edit ] The research focus of the institute is in the field of general relativity . It covers theoretical and experimental gravitational physics , quantum gravity , multi-messenger astronomy and cosmology . The institute has a strong research focus on gravitational-wave astronomy : five out of six departments are working on different aspects of this research field. Central research topics are: source modeling (binary neutron stars , binary black holes , mixed binaries, stellar core collapse ) experimental work on gravitational-wave detectors – both on Earth and in space solving the two-body problem in general relativity analytical and numerical solutions of Einstein's equations development and implementation of data analysis algorithms for gravitational-wave searches follow-up analyses to infer properties of the gravitational-wave sources searches for particles and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model All these efforts enable a new kind of astronomy , which began with the first direct detection of gravitational waves on Earth.

Scientists of the institute also work towards the unification of the fundamental theories of physics – general relativity and quantum mechanics – into a theory of quantum gravity .

Departments [ edit ] Alessandra Buonanno ’s Astrophysical and Cosmological Relativity department [ 3 ] at AEI Potsdam solves the two-body problem in general relativity analytically and numerically , and predicts gravitational-wave signals emitted by binary systems composed of black holes and neutron stars . Members of the department use those waveform models to infer astrophysical and cosmological information, and carry out tests of general relativity , using data from gravitational-wave detectors .

Masaru Shibata's Computational Relativistic Astrophysics department [ 4 ] at AEI Potsdam studies mergers of black holes or neutron stars and the collapse of stellar cores . The department also works on more fundamental aspects of general relativity with numerical tools .

The Quantum Gravity and Unified Theories department [ 5 ] (acting director since August 2020: Alessandra Buonanno ) at AEI Potsdam works on the development of a quantum theory of gravity , based on conformal field theory , string theory , and supergravity and symmetries .

The research focus of Karsten Danzmann ’s department Laser Interferometry and Gravitational Wave Astronomy [ 6 ] at AEI Hannover is on the development and operation of gravitational-wave detectors on Earth and in space. This includes laboratory experiments in quantum optics and laser physics .

Bruce Allen ’s department Observational Relativity and Cosmology [ 7 ] at AEI Hannover studies observational consequences of general relativity , including the search for and analysis of gravitational-wave signals in data from ground-based detectors , and the operation of the Einstein@Home project. The department also works on searches for gamma-ray and radio pulsars , and on theoretical aspects of black holes.

The department Precision Interferometry and Fundamental Interactions [ 8 ] at AEI Hannover, led by Guido Müller, focuses its activity on LISA and other space-based and ground-based gravitational-wave astronomy and on searches for fundamental interactions beyond the standard model using laser-optical methods.
