[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It was originally defined in a "big number duel" at MIT on 26 January 2007.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Definition [ edit ] The definition of Rayo's number is a variation on the definition: [ 5 ] The smallest number bigger than any finite number named by an expression in any language of first-order set theory in which the language uses only a googol symbols or less.

Specifically, an initial version of the definition, which was later clarified, read "The smallest number bigger than any number that can be named by an expression in the language of first-order set-theory with less than a googol ( 10 100 {\displaystyle 10^{100}} ) symbols." [ 4 ] The formal definition of the number defines a predicate Sat {\displaystyle {\mbox{Sat}}} according to the following second-order formula, where [ ϕ ϕ ] {\displaystyle [\phi ]} is a Gödel-coded formula and s {\displaystyle s} is a variable assignment: [ 5 ] Sat ( [ ϕ ϕ ] , s ) := For all R { { for any (coded) formula [ ψ ψ ] and any variable assignment t ( R ( [ ψ ψ ] , t ) ↔ ↔ ( ( [ ψ ψ ] = '' x i ∈ ∈ x j '' ∧ ∧ t ( x i ) ∈ ∈ t ( x j ) ) ∨ ∨ ( [ ψ ψ ] = '' x i = x j '' ∧ ∧ t ( x i ) = t ( x j ) ) ∨ ∨ ( [ ψ ψ ] = '' ( ¬ ¬ θ θ ) '' ∧ ∧ ¬ ¬ R ( [ θ θ ] , t ) ) ∨ ∨ ( [ ψ ψ ] = '' ( θ θ ∧ ∧ ξ ξ ) '' ∧ ∧ R ( [ θ θ ] , t ) ∧ ∧ R ( [ ξ ξ ] , t ) ) ∨ ∨ ( [ ψ ψ ] = '' ∃ ∃ x i ( θ θ ) '' and, for some an x i -variant t ′ of t , R ( [ θ θ ] , t ′ ) ) ) } → → R ( [ ϕ ϕ ] , s ) } {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mbox{Sat}}([\phi ],s):=&{\mbox{For all }}R\ \{\\&\{{\mbox{for any (coded) formula }}[\psi ]{\mbox{ and any variable assignment }}t\\&(R([\psi ],t)\leftrightarrow \\&(([\psi ]={\mbox{''}}x_{i}\in x_{j}{\mbox{''}}\land t(x_{i})\in t(x_{j}))\ \lor \\&([\psi ]={\mbox{''}}x_{i}=x_{j}{\mbox{''}}\land t(x_{i})=t(x_{j}))\ \lor \\&([\psi ]={\mbox{''}}(\neg \theta ){\mbox{''}}\land \neg R([\theta ],t))\ \lor \\&([\psi ]={\mbox{''}}(\theta \land \xi ){\mbox{''}}\land R([\theta ],t)\land R([\xi ],t))\ \lor \\&([\psi ]={\mbox{''}}\exists x_{i}\ (\theta ){\mbox{'' and, for some an }}x_{i}{\mbox{-variant }}t'{\mbox{ of }}t,R([\theta ],t'))\\&)\}\rightarrow \\&R([\phi ],s)\}\end{aligned}}} Given this formula, Rayo's number is defined as: [ 5 ] The smallest number bigger than every finite number m {\displaystyle m} with the following property: there is a formula ϕ ϕ ( x 1 ) {\displaystyle \phi (x_{1})} in the language of first-order set-theory (as presented in the definition of Sat {\displaystyle {\mbox{Sat}}} ) with less than a googol symbols and x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} as its only free variable such that: (a) there is a variable assignment s {\displaystyle s} assigning m {\displaystyle m} to x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} such that Sat ( [ ϕ ϕ ( x 1 ) ] , s ) {\displaystyle {\mbox{Sat}}([\phi (x_{1})],s)} , and (b) for any variable assignment t {\displaystyle t} , if Sat ( [ ϕ ϕ ( x 1 ) ] , t ) {\displaystyle {\mbox{Sat}}([\phi (x_{1})],t)} , then t {\displaystyle t} assigns m {\displaystyle m} to x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} .

Explanation [ edit ] Intuitively, Rayo's number is defined in a formal language , such that: x i ∈ ∈ x j {\displaystyle x_{i}\in x_{j}} and x i = x j {\displaystyle x_{i}=x_{j}} are atomic formulas .

If θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } is a formula, then ( ¬ ¬ θ θ ) {\displaystyle (\neg \theta )} is a formula (the negation of θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } ).

If θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } and ξ ξ {\displaystyle \xi } are formulas, then ( θ θ ∧ ∧ ξ ξ ) {\displaystyle (\theta \land \xi )} is a formula (the conjunction of θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } and ξ ξ {\displaystyle \xi } ).

If θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } is a formula, then ∃ ∃ x i ( θ θ ) {\displaystyle \exists x_{i}(\theta )} is a formula ( existential quantification ).

Notice that it is not allowed to eliminate parentheses. For instance, one must write ∃ ∃ x i ( ( ¬ ¬ θ θ ) ) {\displaystyle \exists x_{i}((\neg \theta ))} instead of ∃ ∃ x i ( ¬ ¬ θ θ ) {\displaystyle \exists x_{i}(\neg \theta )} .

It is possible to express the missing logical connectives in this language. For instance: Disjunction : ( θ θ ∨ ∨ ξ ξ ) {\displaystyle (\theta \lor \xi )} as ( ¬ ¬ ( ( ¬ ¬ θ θ ) ∧ ∧ ( ¬ ¬ ξ ξ ) ) ) {\displaystyle (\neg ((\neg \theta )\land (\neg \xi )))} .

Implication : ( θ θ ⇒ ⇒ ξ ξ ) {\displaystyle (\theta \Rightarrow \xi )} as ( ¬ ¬ ( θ θ ∧ ∧ ( ¬ ¬ ξ ξ ) ) ) {\displaystyle (\neg (\theta \land (\neg \xi )))} .

Biconditional : ( θ θ ⇔ ⇔ ξ ξ ) {\displaystyle (\theta \Leftrightarrow \xi )} as ( ¬ ¬ ( ( ¬ ¬ ( θ θ ∧ ∧ ξ ξ ) ) ∧ ∧ ( ¬ ¬ ( ( ¬ ¬ θ θ ) ∧ ∧ ( ¬ ¬ ξ ξ ) ) ) ) ) {\displaystyle (\neg ((\neg (\theta \land \xi ))\land (\neg ((\neg \theta )\land (\neg \xi )))))} .

Universal quantification : ∀ ∀ x i ( θ θ ) {\displaystyle \forall x_{i}(\theta )} as ( ¬ ¬ ∃ ∃ x i ( ( ¬ ¬ θ θ ) ) ) {\displaystyle (\neg \exists x_{i}((\neg \theta )))} .

The definition concerns formulas in this language that have only one free variable , specifically x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} . If a formula with length n {\displaystyle n} is satisfied iff x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} is equal to the finite von Neumann ordinal k {\displaystyle k} , we say such a formula is a "Rayo string" for k {\displaystyle k} , and that k {\displaystyle k} is "Rayo-nameable" in n {\displaystyle n} symbols. Then, Rayo ( 10 100 ) {\displaystyle {\mbox{Rayo}}(10^{100})} is defined as the smallest k {\displaystyle k} greater than all numbers Rayo-nameable in at most ( 10 100 ) {\displaystyle (10^{100})} symbols.
