 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Term in an algebraic expression which does not contain any variables

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **constant term** (sometimes referred to as a **free term**) is a [term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_(logic) "Term (logic)") in an [algebraic expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_expression "Algebraic expression") that does not contain any [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)") and therefore is [constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_function "Constant function"). For example, in the [quadratic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_polynomial "Quadratic polynomial"),

x 2+2 x+3,{\displaystyle x^{2}+2x+3,\ }![Image 33: {\displaystyle x^{2}+2x+3,\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f8d508c036e17741aa9a8edace9abd22924e890a)
The number 3 is a constant term.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_term#cite_note-1)

After [like terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_terms "Like terms") are combined, an algebraic expression will have at most one constant term. Thus, it is common to speak of the quadratic polynomial

a x 2+b x+c,{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c,\ }![Image 34: {\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c,\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec4ee1a56f2416227120feeb9f6b1be30ab7ed80)
where x{\displaystyle x}![Image 35: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) is the variable, as having a constant term of c.{\displaystyle c.}![Image 36: {\displaystyle c.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/13b8d90daa52ffa8e5988459b6f10ef4d64ee5da) If the constant term is 0, then it will conventionally be omitted when the quadratic is written out.

Any [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") written in standard form has a unique constant term, which can be considered a [coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient "Coefficient") of x 0.{\displaystyle x^{0}.}![Image 37: {\displaystyle x^{0}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b01e8cbcc6629bd60ff334ef554a465338e6f51) In particular, the constant term will always be the lowest [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial "Degree of a polynomial") term of the polynomial. This also applies to multivariate polynomials. For example, the polynomial

x 2+2 x y+y 2−2 x+2 y−4{\displaystyle x^{2}+2xy+y^{2}-2x+2y-4\ }![Image 38: {\displaystyle x^{2}+2xy+y^{2}-2x+2y-4\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70a5ac75a6edab4a40825a382d005230b67f4838)
has a constant term of −4, which can be considered to be the coefficient of x 0 y 0,{\displaystyle x^{0}y^{0},}![Image 39: {\displaystyle x^{0}y^{0},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f8f753260d24984c1bde2f177ab8571083c7a63) where the variables are eliminated by being exponentiated to 0 (any non-zero number exponentiated to 0 becomes 1). For any polynomial, the constant term can be obtained by substituting in 0 instead of each variable; thus, eliminating each variable. The concept of exponentiation to 0 can be applied to [power series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series "Power series") and other types of series, for example in this power series:

a 0+a 1 x+a 2 x 2+a 3 x 3+⋯,{\displaystyle a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{3}x^{3}+\cdots ,}![Image 40: {\displaystyle a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{3}x^{3}+\cdots ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/be4d5161e21acb47227d3fe4f387f3a9e4d31dd9)
a 0{\displaystyle a_{0}}![Image 41: {\displaystyle a_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/693ad9f934775838bd72406b41ada4a59785d7ba) is the constant term.

Constant of integration
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constant_term&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Constant of integration")]

Main article: [Constant of integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_of_integration "Constant of integration")

The [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of a constant term is 0, so when a term containing a constant term is differentiated, the constant term vanishes, regardless of its value. Therefore the [antiderivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiderivative "Antiderivative") is only determined up to an unknown constant term, which is called "the constant of integration" and added in symbolic form (usually denoted as C{\displaystyle C}![Image 42: {\displaystyle C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029)).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_term#cite_note-2)

For example, the antiderivative of cos⁡x{\displaystyle \cos x}![Image 43: {\displaystyle \cos x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/184ba70c3a71df25a25c09f34cd7f8175a9b5280) is sin⁡x{\displaystyle \sin x}![Image 44: {\displaystyle \sin x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/09b4b55580d6a821a07ad9fe35be88976917b10b), since the derivative of sin⁡x{\displaystyle \sin x}![Image 45: {\displaystyle \sin x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/09b4b55580d6a821a07ad9fe35be88976917b10b) is equal to cos⁡x{\displaystyle \cos x}![Image 46: {\displaystyle \cos x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/184ba70c3a71df25a25c09f34cd7f8175a9b5280) based on the [properties of trigonometric derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_rules#Derivatives_of_trigonometric_functions "Differentiation rules").

However, the _[integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral")_ of cos⁡x{\displaystyle \cos x}![Image 47: {\displaystyle \cos x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/184ba70c3a71df25a25c09f34cd7f8175a9b5280) is equal to sin⁡x{\displaystyle \sin x}![Image 48: {\displaystyle \sin x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/09b4b55580d6a821a07ad9fe35be88976917b10b) (the antiderivative), plus an arbitrary constant:

∫cos⁡x d x=sin⁡x+C,{\displaystyle \int \cos x\,\mathrm {d} x=\sin x+C,}![Image 49: {\displaystyle \int \cos x\,\mathrm {d} x=\sin x+C,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d1915860ea6a4a297f34d47e7f03d75f3a19effb)

because for any constant C{\displaystyle C}![Image 50: {\displaystyle C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029), the derivative of the right-hand side of the equation is equal to the left-hand side of the equation.
