The **plus–minus sign** or **plus-or-minus sign** (±) and the complementary **minus-or-plus sign** (∓) are symbols with broadly similar multiple meanings.

*   In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the ± sign generally indicates a choice of exactly two possible values, one of which is obtained through [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition") and the other through [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction").
*   In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") and [experimental sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_science "Experimental science"), the ± sign commonly indicates the [confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval "Confidence interval") or [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_uncertainty "Measurement uncertainty") bounding a range of possible [errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics "Errors and residuals in statistics") in a measurement, often the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation "Standard deviation") or [standard error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error "Standard error"). The sign may also represent an inclusive range of values that a reading might have.
*   In [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess "Chess"), the ± sign indicates a clear advantage for the white player; the complementary minus-plus sign (∓) indicates a clear advantage for the black player.

Other meanings occur in other fields, including [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"), [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy").

A version of the sign, including also the French word _ou_ ("or"), was used in its mathematical meaning by [Albert Girard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Girard "Albert Girard") in 1626, and the sign in its modern form was used as early as 1631, in [William Oughtred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Oughtred "William Oughtred")'s _Clavis Mathematicae_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus%E2%80%93minus_sign#cite_note-1)

In [mathematical formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formula "Mathematical formula"), the ± symbol may be used to indicate a symbol that may be replaced by either of the [plus and minus signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs "Plus and minus signs"), + or −, allowing the formula to represent two values or two equations.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus%E2%80%93minus_sign#cite_note-2)

If _x_ 2 = 9, one may give the solution as _x_ = ±3. This indicates that the equation has two solutions: _x_ = +3 and _x_ = −3. A common use of this notation is found in the [quadratic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula "Quadratic formula")

![Image 1: {\displaystyle x={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6dca3ce631f83b33ad881aed5f6e12e2f6c3afbd)
which describes the two solutions to the [quadratic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation "Quadratic equation")_ax_ 2 + _bx_ + _c_ = 0.

Similarly, the [trigonometric identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_identity "Trigonometric identity")

![Image 2: {\displaystyle \sin(A\pm B)=\sin(A)\cos(B)\pm \cos(A)\sin(B)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/00d9081ccef9d9b5d6d4ea54f4bf8a34949db38b)
can be interpreted as a shorthand for two equations: one with + on both sides of the equation, and one with − on both sides.

The **minus–plus sign**, ∓, is generally used in conjunction with the ± sign, in such expressions as _x_ ± _y_ ∓ _z_, which can be interpreted as meaning _x_ + _y_ − _z_ or _x_ − _y_ + _z_ (but _not_ _x_ + _y_ + _z_ or _x_ − _y_ − _z_). The ∓ always has the opposite sign to ±.

The above expression can be rewritten as _x_ ± (_y_ − _z_) to avoid use of ∓, but cases such as the trigonometric identity are most neatly written using the "∓" sign:

![Image 3: {\displaystyle \cos(A\pm B)=\cos(A)\cos(B)\mp \sin(A)\sin(B)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b7cb8a2106ac9a46d4b4fc62799e6db8166b27be)
which represents the two equations:

![Image 4: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\cos(A+B)&=\cos(A)\cos(B)-\sin(A)\sin(B)\\\cos(A-B)&=\cos(A)\cos(B)+\sin(A)\sin(B)\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5eb4221e9f940996938d37d6f6203b4b833b5c1b)
Another example is the [conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_(square_roots) "Conjugate (square roots)") of the [perfect squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number "Square number")

![Image 5: {\displaystyle x^{3}\pm y^{3}=(x\pm y)\left((x\mp y)^{2}\pm xy\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3da8955bccb7cb63560a0aeec4eb9f94f6f44679)
which represents the two equations:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x^{3}+y^{3}&=(x+y)\left((x-y)^{2}+xy\right)\\x^{3}-y^{3}&=(x-y)\left((x+y)^{2}-xy\right)\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/840c10b4315211a34546ba15e4098453d78902c5)
A related usage is found in this presentation of the formula for the [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series "Taylor series") of the sine function:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle \sin \left(x\right)=x-{\frac {x^{3}}{3!}}+{\frac {x^{5}}{5!}}-{\frac {x^{7}}{7!}}+\cdots \pm {\frac {1}{(2n+1)!}}x^{2n+1}+\cdots }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d45d636447a5dcbceeedb0ad9ffdc82bff0230b3)
Here, the plus-or-minus sign indicates that the term may be added or subtracted depending on whether n is odd or even; a rule which can be deduced from the first few terms. A more rigorous presentation would multiply each term by a factor of (−1)_n_, which gives +1 when n is even, and −1 when n is odd. In older texts one occasionally finds (−)_n_, which means the same.

When the standard presumption that the plus-or-minus signs all take on the same value of +1 or all −1 is not true, then the line of text that immediately follows the equation must contain a brief description of the actual connection, if any, most often of the form _"where the ‘±’ signs are independent"_ or similar. If a brief, simple description is not possible, the equation must be re-written to provide clarity; e.g. by introducing variables such as _s_ 1, _s_ 2, ... and specifying a value of +1 or −1 separately for each, or some appropriate relation, like _s_ 3 = _s_ 1 · (_s_ 2)_n_ or similar.

The use of ± for an approximation is most commonly encountered in presenting the numerical value of a quantity, together with its [tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance "Engineering tolerance") or its statistical [margin of error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error "Margin of error").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus%E2%80%93minus_sign#cite_note-stderror-3) For example, 5.7 ± 0.2 may be anywhere in the range from 5.5 to 5.9 inclusive. In scientific usage, it sometimes refers to a probability of being within the stated interval, usually corresponding to either 1 or 2[standard deviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation "Standard deviation") (a probability of 68.3% or 95.4% in a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution "Normal distribution")).

Operations involving uncertain values should always try to preserve the uncertainty, in order to avoid [propagation of error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty "Propagation of uncertainty"). If _n_ = _a_ ± _b_, any operation of the form _m_ = _f_(_n_) must return a value of the form _m_ = _c_ ± _d_, where c is _f_(_a_) and d is the range b updated using [interval arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic "Interval arithmetic").

The symbols ± and ∓ are used in [chess annotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_annotation_symbols "Chess annotation symbols") to denote a moderate but significant advantage for White and Black, respectively.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus%E2%80%93minus_sign#cite_note-chess-4) Weaker and stronger advantages are denoted by ⩲ and ⩱ for only a slight advantage, and +– and –+ for a strong, potentially winning advantage, again for White and Black respectively.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus%E2%80%93minus_sign#cite_note-5)

*   In [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine"), it may mean "with or without" in some cases.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus%E2%80%93minus_sign#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus%E2%80%93minus_sign#cite_note-7)
*   In [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), the sign indicates the [tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance "Engineering tolerance"), which is the range of values that are considered to be acceptable or safe, or which comply with some standard or with a contract.
*   In [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), the sign is used to indicate a [racemic mixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racemic_mixture "Racemic mixture").
*   In [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"), this sign may indicate a dual voltage power supply, such as ±5 volts means +5 volts and −5 volts, when used with audio circuits and [operational amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier "Operational amplifier").
*   In [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), it may indicate a [distinctive feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinctive_feature "Distinctive feature"), such as [±voiced].[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus%E2%80%93minus_sign#cite_note-8)

*   In [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode"): U+00B1±PLUS-MINUS SIGN
*   In [ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1 "ISO 8859-1"), [-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-7 "ISO 8859-7"), [-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-8 "ISO 8859-8"), [-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-9 "ISO 8859-9"), [-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-13 "ISO 8859-13"), [-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-15 "ISO 8859-15"), and [-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-16 "ISO 8859-16"), the plus–minus symbol is code 0xB1[hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal"). This location was copied to Unicode.
*   In [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML"), the symbol also has [character entity reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_entity_reference "Character entity reference") representations of `&pm;`, `&plusmn;`
*   The rarer minus–plus sign is not generally found in legacy encodings, but is available in Unicode as U+2213∓MINUS-OR-PLUS SIGN so can be used in HTML using `&#x2213;` or `&#8723;`.
*   In [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX "TeX") 'plus-or-minus' and 'minus-or-plus' symbols are denoted `\pm` and `\mp`, respectively.
*   Although these characters may be approximated by underlining or overlining a + symbol (+ or +), this is discouraged because the formatting may be stripped at a later date, changing the meaning. It also makes the meaning less accessible to blind users with [screen readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader "Screen reader").
