In some contexts the antecedent is called the protasis .

[ 1 ] Examples: If P {\displaystyle P} , then Q {\displaystyle Q} .

This is a nonlogical formulation of a hypothetical proposition. In this case, the antecedent is P , and the consequent is Q . In the implication " ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } implies ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } ", ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is called the antecedent and ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } is called the consequent.

[ 2 ] Antecedent and consequent are connected via logical connective to form a proposition .

If X {\displaystyle X} is a man, then X {\displaystyle X} is mortal.

" X {\displaystyle X} is a man" is the antecedent for this proposition while " X {\displaystyle X} is mortal" is the consequent of the proposition.

If men have walked on the Moon, then I am the king of France.

Here, "men have walked on the Moon" is the antecedent and "I am the king of France" is the consequent.

Let y = x + 1 {\displaystyle y=x+1} .

If x = 1 {\displaystyle x=1} then y = 2 {\displaystyle y=2} ,.

" x = 1 {\displaystyle x=1} " is the antecedent and " y = 2 {\displaystyle y=2} " is the consequent of this hypothetical proposition.
