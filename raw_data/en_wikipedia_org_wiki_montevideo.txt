According to the 2023 census, the city proper has a population of 1,302,954 (about 37.2% of the country's total population) [ 13 ] in an area of 201 square kilometers (78 sq mi). Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the Río de la Plata .

A Portuguese garrison was established in the place where today is the city of Montevideo in November 1723. The Portuguese garrison was expelled in February 1724 by a Spanish soldier, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala , as a strategic move amidst the Spanish - Portuguese dispute over the platine region . There is no official document establishing the foundation of the city, but the "Diario" of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala officially mentions the date of 24 December 1726 as the foundation, corroborated by presential witnesses. The complete independence from Buenos Aires as a real city was not reached until 1 January 1730. It was also under brief British rule in 1807 , but eventually the city was retaken by Spanish criollos who defeated the British invasions of the River Plate . Montevideo is the seat of the administrative headquarters of Mercosur and ALADI , Latin America 's leading trade blocs, a position that entailed comparisons to the role of Brussels in Europe.

[ 14 ] The 2019 Mercer's report on quality of life rated Montevideo first in Latin America, [ 15 ] a rank the city has consistently held since 2005.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] As of 2010 [update] , Montevideo was the 19th largest city economy in the continent and 9th highest income earner among major cities .

[ 21 ] In 2022, it has a projected GDP of $53.9 billion, with a per capita of $30,148.

[ 22 ] In 2018, it was classified as a beta global city ranking eighth in Latin America and 84th in the world.

[ 23 ] Montevideo hosted every match during the first FIFA World Cup in 1930. Described as a "vibrant, eclectic place with a rich cultural life", [ 24 ] and "a thriving tech center and entrepreneurial culture", [ 19 ] Montevideo ranked eighth in Latin America on the 2013 MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.

[ 25 ] The city features historic European architecture, [ 26 ] and is in fact considered one of the cities with the most art deco influence.

[ 27 ] It is the hub of commerce and higher education in Uruguay as well as its chief port and financial hub , anchoring the metropolitan area with a population of around 2 million.

Etymology [ edit ] There are several explanations for the word Montevideo . All agree that "Monte" refers to the Cerro de Montevideo , the hill situated across the Bay of Montevideo , but there is disagreement about the etymological origin of the "video" part.

[ 28 ] Cerro de Montevideo as seen from the city, in 1865.

Monte vide eu ("I saw a mount") is the most widespread belief [ 29 ] [ 30 ] but is rejected by the majority of experts, who consider it unlikely because it involves a mix of dialects. The name would come from a Portuguese expression which means "I saw a mount", wrongly pronounced by an anonymous sailor belonging to the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes on catching sight of the Cerro de Montevideo.

Montem vídeo ("I see a hill"): This version, a variant of the previous one, suggests that the name comes directly from Latin, stemming from the spontaneous expression of a learned member of Magellan's expedition, who, upon spotting the Cerro de Montevideo, exclaimed: Montem vídeo ("I see a hill"). The rest of the crew, who did not speak Latin, mistakenly registered this as the name of the hill they had just sighted, Monte Vídeo . This theory is supported by numerous maps and documents from the colonial period that refer to the Cerro de Montevideo with the name Monte Vídeo.

[ 31 ] Monte Vidi: This hypothesis comes from the "Diario de Navegación" (Navigational Calendar) of boatswain Francisco de Albo, member of the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes , [ 29 ] who wrote, "Tuesday of the said [month of January 1520] we were on the straits of Cape Santa María [now Punta del Este ], from where the coast runs east to west, and the terrain is sandy, and at the right of the cape there is a mountain like a hat to which we gave the name "Montevidi"." [ 32 ] This is the oldest Spanish document that mentions the promontory with a name similar to the one that designates the city, but it does not contain any mention of the alleged cry "Monte vide eu." Monte-VI-D-E-O ( Monte VI D e E ste a O este , "Sixth mount from east to west"): According to Rolando Laguarda Trías, professor of history, the Spaniards annotated the geographic location on a map or Portolan chart , so that the mount/hill is the VI (6th) mount observable on the coast, navigating Río de la Plata from east to west.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] With the passing of time, these words were unified to "Montevideo". No conclusive evidence has been found to confirm this academic hypothesis, nor can it be asserted with certainty which the other five mounts observable before the Cerro were.

Monte Ovídio ( Monte Santo Ovídio ), a less widespread hypothesis of a religious origin, [ 29 ] stems from an interpolation in the aforementioned Diario de Navegación of Fernando de Albo, where it is asserted "corruptly now called Santo Vidio" when they refer to the hat-like mount which they named Monte Vidi (that is, the Cerro de Montevideo).

Auditus of Braga (Spanish: Ovídio ) was the third bishop of the Roman city of Braga (now in Portugal) in 95 CE, where he was always revered; a monument to him was erected there in 1505. Given the relationship that the Portuguese had with the discovery and foundation of Montevideo, and despite the fact that this hypothesis, like the previous ones, lacks conclusive documentation, there have been those who linked the name of Santo Ovídio or Vídio (appearing on some maps of the time) with the subsequent derivation of the name "Montevideo" given to the region since the early years of the 16th century.

When the Portuguese invaded the Banda Oriental and annexed it as the province of Cisplatina until 1831, they called the city Montevidéu , and pronounced as European Portuguese: [mõtɨviˈðew] .

This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca [ pt ] of Portugal built the Montevieu fort.

Arrival of the first families from the Canary Islands in 1726.

A Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were known as Guanches or Canarians . There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name of Jorge Burgues.

[ 36 ] A census of the city's inhabitants was performed in 1724 and then a plan was drawn delineating the city and designating it as San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo , later shortened to Montevideo. The census counted more than 100 families of Galician and Canary Islands origin, more than 1000 indigenous people, mostly Guaraní , as well as some trafficked slaves of Bantu origin .

[ 35 ] A few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the Río de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River , competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata brought it in confrontations with the city of Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was taken over to be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.

[ citation needed ] In 1776, Spain made Montevideo its main naval base ( Real Apostadero de Marina ) for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, Fernando Po , and the Falklands .

[ 37 ] Until the end of the 18th century, Montevideo remained a fortified area, today known as Ciudad Vieja .

19th century [ edit ] "Monte Video from the Anchorage outside the Harbour" by Emeric Essex Vidal (1820). The earliest securely dated picture of the city.

[ 38 ] On 3 February 1807, British troops under the command of General Samuel Auchmuty and Admiral Charles Stirling occupied the city during the Battle of Montevideo (1807) , but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the same year on 2 September when John Whitelocke was forced to surrender to troops formed by forces of the Banda Oriental —roughly the same area as modern Uruguay—and of Buenos Aires.

[ 39 ] After this conflict, the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de Elío opposed the new viceroy Santiago de Liniers , and created a government Junta when the Peninsular War started in Spain, in defiance of Liniers. Elío disestablished the Junta when Liniers was replaced by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros .

During the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo. During that year and the next, Uruguayan revolutionary José Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain.

[ 40 ] In 1811, the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo , which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution. The siege was lifted at the end of that year, when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region.

The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814. In 1816, Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821, it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil. It was named Imperial City [ pt ] by Emperor Pedro I when the city was part of the Empire of Brazil as the capital of the Cisplatina province .

[ 40 ] Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the Treinta y Tres Orientales (" Thirty-Three Orientals ") re-established the independence of the region in 1825. Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828, with Montevideo as the nation's capital.

[ 30 ] In 1829, the demolition of the city's fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja, referred to as the "Ciudad Nueva" ("new city"). Urban expansion, however, moved very slowly because of the events that followed.

[ 41 ] Map of Montevideo during the Guerra Grande (1843–1851).

Uruguay's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between Manuel Oribe and Fructuoso Rivera , the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the Empire of Brazil under the command of Lavalleja, each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction.

[ 42 ] Politics were divided between Oribe's Blancos ("whites"), represented by the National Party , and Rivera's Colorados ("reds"), represented by the Colorado Party , with each party's name taken from the color of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign from the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the Guerra Grande , which lasted until 1851.

The city of Montevideo suffered a siege of eight years between 1843 and 1851 , during which it was supplied by sea with British and French support.

[ 33 ] By 1843 Montevideo's population of thirty thousand inhabitants was highly cosmopolitan with Uruguayans making up only a third of it.

[ 43 ] The remaining were chiefly Italian (4205), Spanish (3406), Argentine (2553), Portuguese (659), English (606) and Brazilians (492).

[ 43 ] Oribe, with the support of the then conservative Governor of Buenos Aires Province Juan Manuel de Rosas , besieged the Colorados in Montevideo, where the latter were supported by the French Legion, the Italian Legion, the Basque Legion and battalions from Brazil. Finally in 1851, with the additional support of Argentine rebels who opposed Rosas, the Colorados defeated Oribe.

[ 40 ] The fighting however resumed in 1855, when the Blancos came to power, which they maintained until 1865. Thereafter, the Colorado Party regained power, which they retained until the middle of the 20th century.

After the end of hostilities, a period of growth and expansion started for the city. In 1853 a stagecoach bus line was established joining Montevideo with the newly formed settlement of Unión and the first natural gas street lights were inaugurated.

[ citation needed ] From 1854 to 1861 the first public sanitation facilities were constructed. In 1856 the Teatro Solís was inaugurated, 15 years after the beginning of its construction. By Decree, in December 1861 the areas of Aguada and Cordón were incorporated to the growing Ciudad Nueva (New City).

[ 44 ] In 1866, an underwater telegraph line connected the city with Buenos Aires. The statue of Peace, La Paz , was erected on a column in Plaza Cagancha and the building of the Postal Service as well as the bridge of Paso Molino were inaugurated in 1867.

[ 45 ] In 1868, the horse-drawn tram company Compañía de Tranvías al Paso del Molino y Cerro created the first lines connecting Montevideo with Unión, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro , at the time called Cosmopolis . In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras . During the same year and the next, the neighborhoods Colón , Nuevo París and La Comercial were founded. The Sunday market of Tristán Narvaja Street was established in Cordón in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, Bulevar Circunvalación was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas , going up to the north end of the city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed Artigas Boulevard in 1885.

[ 45 ] By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area Los Pocitos was incorporated into the Novísima Ciudad (Most New City).

[ 44 ] The first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas-operated ones in 1886. The Hipódromo de Maroñas started operating in 1888, and the neighborhoods of Reus del Sur, Reus del Norte and Conciliación were inaugurated in 1889. The new building of the School of Arts and Trades, as well as Zabala Square in Ciudad Vieja were inaugurated in 1890, followed by the Italian Hospital in 1891. In the same year, the village of Peñarol was founded. Other neighborhoods that were founded were Belgrano and Belvedere in 1892, Jacinto Vera in 1895 and Trouville in 1897. In 1894 the new port was constructed, and in 1897, the Central Railway Station of Montevideo was inaugurated.

[ 33 ] [ 45 ] Plaza Independencia around 1900.

20th century [ edit ] In the early 20th century, many Europeans (particularly Spaniards and Italians but also thousands from Central Europe) immigrated to the city. In 1908, 30% of the city's population of 300,000 was foreign-born. In that decade the city expanded quickly: new neighborhoods were created and many separate settlements were annexed to the city, among which were the Villa del Cerro , Pocitos , the Prado and Villa Colón . The Rodó Park and the Estadio Gran Parque Central were also established, which served as poles of urban development.

[ 46 ] During the early 20th century, Uruguay saw huge social changes with repercussions primarily in urban areas. Among these changes were the right to divorce (1907) and women's right to vote .

[ 47 ] The 1910s saw the construction of Montevideo's Rambla ; strikes by tram workers, bakers and port workers; the inauguration of electric trams; the creation of the Municipal Intendencias ; and the inauguration of the new port.

[ 48 ] In 1913, the city limits were extended around the entire gulf. The previously independent localities of the Villa del Cerro and La Teja were annexed to Montevideo, becoming two of its neighborhoods.

[ 49 ] During the 1920s, the equestrian statue of Artigas was installed in Plaza Independencia ; the Palacio Legislativo was built; the Spanish Plus Ultra flying boat arrived (the first airplane to fly from Spain to Latin America, 1926); prominent politician and former president José Batlle y Ordóñez died (1929); and the ground was broken (1929) for the Estadio Centenario (completed 1930).

[ 50 ] World War II [ edit ] During World War II, a famous incident involving the German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee took place in Punta del Este , 200 kilometers (120 mi) from Montevideo. After the Battle of the River Plate with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy on 13 December 1939, the Graf Spee retreated to Montevideo's port, which was considered neutral at the time. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on 17 December. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. The eagle figurehead of the Graf Spee was salvaged on 10 February 2006.

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] Post-war era [ edit ] A street in Montevideo's Ciudad Vieja.

Uruguay began to stagnate economically in the mid-1950s; Montevideo began a decline, later exacerbated by widespread social and political violence beginning in 1968 (including the emergence of the guerrilla Movimiento de Liberación Nacional-Tupamaros [ 50 ] ) and by the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985) . There were major problems with supply; the immigration cycle was reversed.

From the 1960s to the end of the dictatorship in 1985, around one hundred people died or disappeared because of political violence. In 1974 another hundred Uruguayans also disappeared in Argentina.

[ 53 ] In 1980, the dictatorship proposed a new constitution. The project was submitted to a referendum and rejected in the first polls since 1971, with 58% of the votes against and 42% in favor. The result weakened the military and triggered its fall, allowing the return of democracy.

[ 54 ] In the 1980s, Pope John Paul II visited the city twice. In April 1987, as head of state of Vatican , he signed a mediation agreement for the conflict of the Beagle Channel .

[ 55 ] He also held a large mass in Tres Cruces , declaring the cross located behind the altar as a monument. In 1988, he returned to the country, visiting Montevideo, Florida , Salto and Melo .

[ 55 ] 21st century [ edit ] The 2002 Uruguay banking crisis affected several industries of Montevideo. In 2017, the city has maintained 15 years of economic growth, with a GDP of $44 billion, and a GDP per capita of $25,900.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Montevideo has consistently been rated as having the highest quality of life of any city in Latin America: [ 56 ] by 2015 [ 57 ] [ 58 ] it held this rank every year during the decade through 2014.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Geography [ edit ] Map of Uruguay showing Montevideo on the Atlantic Ocean, between Argentina and Brazil Montevideo is situated on the north shore of the Río de la Plata, the arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the south coast of Uruguay from the north coast of Argentina; Buenos Aires lies 230 kilometers (140 mi) west on the Argentine side. The Santa Lucía River forms a natural border between Montevideo and San José Department to its west. To the city's north and east is Canelones Department , with the stream of Carrasco forming the eastern natural border. The coastline forming the city's southern border is interspersed with rocky protrusions and sandy beaches.

[ 59 ] The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbor, the nation's largest and one of the largest in the Southern Cone , and the finest natural port in the region, functioning as a crucial component of the Uruguayan economy and foreign trade. Various streams crisscross the town and empty into the Bay of Montevideo. Its coastline near the emptying rivers are heavily polluted.

[ 60 ] The city has an average elevation of 43 meters (141 ft). Its highest elevations are two hills: the Cerro de Montevideo and the Cerro de la Victoria, with the highest point, the peak of Cerro de Montevideo, crowned by a fortress, the Fortaleza del Cerro at a height of 134 m (440 ft).

[ 61 ] Closest cities by road are Las Piedras to the north and the so-called Ciudad de la Costa (a conglomeration of coastal towns) to the east, both in the range of 20 to 25 km (16 mi) from the city center. The approximate distances to the neighboring department capitals by road are, 90 km (56 mi) to San Jose de Mayo (San Jose Department) and 46 km (29 mi) to Canelones (Canelones Department).

Climate [ edit ] Montevideo has a Humid subtropical climate ( Köppen Cfa ) in a middle latitude, the city experiences the four seasons. It has cool winters (June to August), warm to hot summers (December to February), mild autumns (March to May) and volatile springs (September to November); [ 62 ] The climate is characterized by having mild temperatures, without harsh cold or extreme heat. There are numerous thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout the year, reaching around 950 millimeters (37 in).

[ 63 ] Winters are generally cool, wet, windy and overcast. The average temperature during this season is just above 10 °C (50 °F). Daytime temperatures are generally between 10 °C (50 °F) and 18 °C (64 °F), and night lows between 3 °C (37 °F) and 10 °C (50 °F). During this season, there are bursts of icy and relatively dry winds of continental polar air masses, giving an unpleasant chilly feeling to the everyday life of the city, with daytime temperatures around or below 8 °C (46 °F) and possible night frosts. These occur few times during winter, with temperatures generally not falling below −2 °C (28 °F) because of the oceanic influence that moderates the temperature; a few kilometres inland, frosts are more common and colder. On the other hand, even in the middle of winter it's not uncommon to have temperatures above 20 °C (68 °F) for a few days. Rainfall and sleet are a frequent winter occurrence, but snowfall is extremely rare: flurries have been recorded only four times but with no accumulation, the last one on 13 July 1930 during the inaugural match of the World Cup , [ 64 ] (the other three snowfalls were in 1850, 1853 and 1917); the alleged 1980 Carrasco snowfall was actually a hailstorm .

[ 65 ] Summers are warm-hot and humid, with less wind than other seasons. The average temperature in this season is 
23 °C (73 °F). Daytime temperatures are usually between 24 °C (75 °F) and 32 °C (90 °F), while night lows between 14 °C (57 °F) and 22 °C (72 °F). During this season, a moderate wind often blows from the sea in the evenings which has a pleasant cooling effect on the city, in contrast to the more severe summer heat of nearby cities like Buenos Aires .

[ 62 ] Heat waves come with the north winds, which bring humid and hot air masses from the tropical interior of the continent; temperatures can rise above 35 °C (95 °F). These warm periods are usually followed by thunderstorms, generated by cold fronts from the southwest that lowers temperatures considerably. This phenomenon is regional, and can occur several times all year long.

The autumn in Montevideo is quite pleasant and not so unstable. Daytime temperatures are in general around 20 °C (68 °F) and nights around 10 °C (50 °F).
Spring average temperatures are very similar to the autumn, but the weather in that season tends to be more windy and volatile, with more dramatic changes in a short period of time.

Montevideo has an annual average temperature of 16.7 °C (62.1 °F). The lowest recorded temperature is −5.6 °C (21.9 °F) while the highest is 42.8 °C (109.0 °F).

This division, according to the Municipality of Montevideo, "aims to advance political and administrative decentralization in the department of Montevideo, with the aim of deepening the democratic participation of citizens in governance." [ 71 ] The head of each Municipio is called an alcalde or (if female) alcaldesa .

[ 72 ] Of much greater importance is the division of the city into 62 barrios : neighborhoods or wards.

[ 73 ] Many of the city's barrios —such as Sayago , Ituzaingó and Pocitos —were previously geographically separate settlements, later absorbed by the growth of the city. Others grew up around certain industrial sites, including the salt-curing works of Villa del Cerro and the tanneries in Nuevo París . Each barrio has its own identity, geographic location and socio-cultural activities. A neighborhood of great significance is Ciudad Vieja, that was surrounded by a protective wall until 1829. This area contains most important buildings of the colonial era and early decades of independence.

Pocitos is the most populous Montevideo neighborhood.

The architecture of Montevideo ranges from Neoclassical buildings such as the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral to the late-modern style of the World Trade Center Montevideo or the 158-meter (518 ft) ANTEL Telecommunication Tower , the tallest skyscraper in the country. Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the Palacio Salvo dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building facades in the Old Town reflect the city's extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the Legislative Palace , the City Hall , Estévez Palace and the Executive Tower . The most notable sports stadium is the Estadio Centenario within Parque Batlle . Parque Batlle, Parque Rodó and Parque Prado are Montevideo's three great parks.

[ 74 ] The Pocitos district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the " Edificio Panamericano " designed by Raul Sichero, [ 75 ] and the "Positano" and "El Pilar" designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis García Pardo [ es ] in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighborhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle-class residents.

[ citation needed ] Palacio Legislativo [ edit ] The Legislative Palace .

The Palacio Legislativo in Aguada, north of the city center, is the seat of the Uruguayan Parliament . Construction started in 1904 and was sponsored by the government of President José Batlle y Ordóñez .

[ 76 ] It was designed by Italian architects Vittorio Meano and Gaetano Moretti [ it ] , who planned the building's interior. Among the notable contributors to the project was sculptor José Belloni , who contributed numerous reliefs and allegorical sculptures .

[ 76 ] World Trade Center Montevideo [ edit ] World Trade Center Montevideo .

Main article: World Trade Center Montevideo World Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998, but work was completed in 2009. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998.

[ citation needed ] It has 22 floors and 17,100 square meters of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and 27,000 square meters (290,000 sq ft) of space. The 6,300-square-meter (68,000 sq ft) [ citation needed ] World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a center of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St.

The Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social places. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor Pablo Atchugarry . World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and 53,500 square meters (576,000 sq ft) of space is under construction as of 2010 [update] .

[ citation needed ] Telecommunications Tower [ edit ] Telecommunications Tower .

Main article: Telecommunications Tower (Montevideo) Torre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the 158 meters (518 ft), 37-floor headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company, ANTEL , and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect Carlos Ott . It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by American Bridge Company and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.

When its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40 million, plus US$25 million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65 million price into US$102 million.

Ciudad Vieja (Old City) [ edit ] Main article: Ciudad Vieja, Montevideo Headquarters of Alcohólicos Anónimos in Montevideo Ciudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent barrio of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and nightclubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.

Plaza de la Constitución in winter.

Montevideo's most important plaza is Plaza Independencia , located between Ciudad Vieja and downtown Montevideo. It starts with the Gateway of The Citadel at one end and ends at the beginning of 18 de Julio Avenue . It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city.

[ 77 ] Several notable buildings are located here.

Solís Theatre.

The Solís Theatre is Uruguay's oldest theater. It was built in 1856 and is owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theater, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by Philippe Starck . The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theater reopened in August of that year.

[ 78 ] The plaza is also the site of the offices of the President of Uruguay (both the Estévez Palace and the Executive Tower ). The Artigas Mausoleum is located at the center of the plaza. Statues include that of José Gervasio Artigas , a hero of Uruguay's independence movement; an honor guard keeps vigil at the Mausoleum.

[ 79 ] Palacio Salvo , at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands 100 meters (330 ft) high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confitería La Giralda, renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodríguez wrote his tango " La Cumparsita " (1917.) [ 80 ] Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.

[ 81 ] Also of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the Plaza de la Constitución (or Plaza Matriz ). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the Cabildo —the seat of colonial government—and the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral . The cathedral is the burial place of Fructuoso Rivera , Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Venancio Flores . Another notable square is Plaza Zabala with the equestrian statue of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala . On its south side, Palacio Taranco , once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto , another major tourist destination.

Parque Batlle [ edit ] Main article: Parque Batlle Monumento La Carreta.

Parque Batlle [ 82 ] (formerly: Parque de los Aliados , [ 83 ] translation: "Park of the Allies") is a major public central park, located south of Avenida Italia and north of Avenue Rivera. Along with Parque Prado and Parque Rodó it is one of three large parks that dominate Montevideo.

[ 84 ] The park and surrounding area constitute one of the 62 neighborhoods ( barrios ) of the city. The barrio of Parque Batlle is one of seven coastal barrios, the others being Buceo , Carrasco, Malvin, Pocitos , Punta Carretas, and Punta Gorda.

[ 85 ] The barrio of Parque Battle includes four former districts: Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and Batlle Park itself and borders the neighborhoods of La Blanqueada , Tres Cruces , Pocitos and Buceo. It has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income.

[ 86 ] Villa Dolores, a sub-district of Parque Batlle, took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Doña Dolores Pereira de Rossel. On their grounds, they started a private collection of animals that became a zoological garden and was passed to the city in 1919; [ 87 ] in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises.

[ 88 ] Obelisk of Montevideo in the Parque Batlle.

Parque Batlle is named in honor of José Batlle y Ordóñez , President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915.

[ 89 ] The park was originally proposed by an Act of March 1907, which also projected wide boulevards and avenues.

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] French landscape architect, Carlos Thays , began the plantings in 1911. In 1918, the park was named Parque de los Aliados , following the victory of the Allies of World War I . On 5 May 1930, after significant expansion, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ordóñez, in memory of the prominent politician and president, who had died in 1929.

[ 90 ] The park was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975.

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] As of 2010 [update] , the park covers an area of 60 hectares (150 acres) and is considered the "lung" of the Montevideo city due to the large variety of trees planted here.

[ 90 ] [ better source needed ] The Estadio Centenario , the national football stadium, opened in 1930 for the first World Cup , and later hosted several other sporting grounds of note (see Sports ).

In 1934, sculptor José Belloni 's "La Carreta", a bronze monument on granite base, [ 92 ] was installed on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario. One of several statues in the park, it depicts yoked oxen pulling a loaded wagon.

[ 93 ] It was designated a national monument in 1976.

[ 92 ] Another statue on the same side of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron.

On the west side of Parque Batlle, on Artigas Boulevard , the 1938 Obelisk of Montevideo is a monument dedicated to those who created the first Constitution. The work of sculptor José Luis Zorrilla de San Martín (1891–1975), it is a three-sided granite obelisk, 40 meters (130 ft) tall, with bronze statues on its three sides, representing "Law", "Liberty", and "Force", respectively. It has been a National Heritage Site since 1976.

[ 94 ] Parque Prado [ edit ] Main article: Parque Prado Bridge over the Miguelete stream in the Prado Park.

Established in 1873, the largest of Montevideo's six main public parks is the 1.06-square-kilometre (260-acre) Parque Prado .

[ 95 ] Located in the northern part of the city, the Miguelete Creek flows through the park and the neighborhood and of the same name. It is surrounded by the avenues Agraciada, Obes Lucas, Joaquín Suárez, Luis Alberto de Herrera and by the streets Castro and José María Reyes.

The most frequented areas of the park are the Rosedal , a public rose garden with pergolas , the Botanical Garden, the area around the Hotel del Prado, as well as the Rural del Prado , a seasonal cattle and farm animal fairground. The Rosedal contains four pergolas, eight domes, and a fountain; its 12,000 roses were imported from France in 1910.

[ 96 ] There are several jogging paths along the Miguelete river.

The Presidential Residence is located behind the Botanical Gardens. Established in 1930, Juan Manuel Blanes Museum is situated in the Palladian villa, a National Heritage Site since 1975, and includes a Japanese garden.

[ 97 ] The Professor Atilio Lombardo Museum and Botanical Gardens were established in 1902. The National Institute of Physical Climatology and its observatory are also in the Prado.

[ 98 ] Parque Rodó [ edit ] Main article: Parque Rodó Parque Rodó park.

Parque Rodó amusement park.

Parque Rodó is both a barrio (neighborhood) of Montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighborhood itself and belongs to Punta Carretas . The name "Rodó" commemorates José Enrique Rodó, an important Uruguayan writer whose monument is in the southern side of the main park. The park was conceived as a French-style city park.

[ 99 ] Apart from the main park area which is delimited by Sarmiento Avenue to the south, Parque Rodó includes an amusement park; the Estadio Luis Franzini , belonging to Defensor Sporting; the front lawn of the Faculty of Engineering and a strip west of the Club de Golf de Punta Carretas that includes the Canteras ("quarry") del Parque Rodó , the Teatro de Verano ("summer theatre") and the Lago ("lake") del Parque Rodó .

[ 100 ] Faculty of Engineering located in Parque Rodó.

On the east side of the main park area is the National Museum of Visual Arts. On this side, a street market takes place every Sunday. On the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children. An area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography. West of the park, across the coastal avenue Rambla Presidente Wilson, stretches Ramirez Beach. Directly west of the main park area, and belonging to Parque Rodó barrio , there is the former Parque Hotel , now called Edifício Mercosur , the seat of the parliament of the member countries of the Mercosur .

[ 101 ] During the guerilla war the Tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area, including the old hotel.

[ 102 ] Forts [ edit ] The first set of subsidiary forts was planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front-line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at Colonia del Sacramento . However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship Nossa Senhora de Oliveara . They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.

[ 103 ] Fortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro) [ edit ] Fortaleza del Cerro.

Main article: Fortaleza del Cerro Fortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839.

[ 61 ] It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931 [ 104 ] and has housed a military museum since 1916.

[ 61 ] Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.

Punta Brava Lighthouse [ edit ] Punta Brava lighthouse.

Punta Brava Lighthouse ( Faro Punta Brava ), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876. The lighthouse is 21 meters (69 ft) high and its light reaches 24 km (15 mi) away, with a flash every ten seconds.

[ 105 ] In 1962, the lighthouse became electric. The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Inglés Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Lucía River.

Rambla of Montevideo [ edit ] Main article: Rambla of Montevideo The Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word rambla is "avenue" or "watercourse", but in the Americas it is mostly used as "coastal avenue", and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the Río de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, [ 106 ] though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas ("United Nations"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.

The Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even—in a special area—skateboard. Its 27-kilometer (17 mi) length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.

[ 107 ] Montevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city.

[ 107 ] Its best-known beaches are Ramírez, Pocitos , Carrasco , Buceo and Malvín . Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.

Cemeteries [ edit ] Central Cemetery.

There are five large cemeteries in Montevideo, all administered by the "Fúnebre y Necrópolis" annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.

[ 108 ] The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte , located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central ), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 at a time when burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo , Delmira Agustini , Luis Batlle Berres , José Batlle y Ordóñez , Juan Manuel Blanes , François Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautréamont (Isidore Ducasse), [ 109 ] Luis Alberto de Herrera , Benito Nardone , José Enrique Rodó , and Juan Zorrilla de San Martín .

The other large cemeteries are the Cementerio del Buceo , Cementerio del Cerro , and Cementerio Paso Molino .

The British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Británico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighborhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors , contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine , Henry de Costa, is buried here.

[ 114 ] [ 115 ] The city's population in 2023 was 87.1% White , 10.7% Black , 4,6% Mixed and 0.8% Asian; 5.6% identified themselves as being of other ethnic-racial descent, noting that respondents were allowed to select more than one category.

[ 116 ] The port of Montevideo served as the primary gateway for immigrants arriving during the significant migratory waves of the 19th and 20th centuries By 1880, the city's population had quadrupled, mainly because of the great European immigration .

[ 117 ] In 1908, its population had grown massively to 309,331 inhabitants.

[ 118 ] Since the mid-20th century, this area has been the main destination for most immigrants arriving in the country, largely due to its port . The majority of these immigrants were Italian and Spanish , who together made up more than 70% of the foreign-born population in the country.

[ 119 ] Other significant European origins include French , German , Portuguese , Polish , Irish , Croatian , and Lithuanian .

[ 120 ] Communities of Armenians , Lebanese , and Japanese also took root, along with both Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish groups.

[ 121 ] [ 122 ] There is also an Afro-Uruguayan community in the city, composed of descendants of enslaved people brought over during the colonial era, as well as Afro-Brazilian immigrants who fled to Uruguay following the country's abolition of slavery in 1842—decades before Brazil did the same.

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] As in the rest of the country, Christianity is the largest religion in Montevideo, with Catholicism as the denomination with the most adherents, followed by Protestantism—particularly Evangelical, Methodist, and Lutheran branches.

[ 125 ] [ 126 ] There is also a significant proportion of irreligious and agnostic individuals.

[ 127 ] Approximately 20,000 Jews live in Montevideo, accounting for over 50% of Uruguay’s Jewish population —one of the most prominent in Latin America.

[ 128 ] Government and politics [ edit ] Intendancy of Montevideo [ edit ] Main article: Intendancy of Montevideo The Palacio Municipal is the City Hall of Montevideo.

The Intendancy of Montevideo was first created by a legal act of 18 December 1908.

[ 129 ] The municipality's first mayor (1909–1911) was Daniel Muñoz. Municipalities were abolished by the Uruguayan Constitution of 1918 , effectively restored during the 1933 military coup of Gabriel Terra , and formally restored by the 1934 Constitution . The 1952 Constitution again decided to abolish the municipalities; it came into effect in February 1955. Municipalities were replaced by departmental councils, which consisted of a collegiate executive board with 7 members from Montevideo and 5 from the interior region. However, municipalities were revived under the 1967 Constitution and have operated continuously since that time.

Since 1990, Montevideo has been partially decentralized into 18 areas; administration and services for each area is provided by its Zonal Community Center ( Centro Comunal Zonal , CCZ), which is subordinate to the Intendancy of Montevideo.

[ 130 ] [ 131 ] The boundaries of the municipal districts of Montevideo were created on 12 July 1993, and successively amended on 19 October 1993, 6 June 1994 and 10 November 1994. In 2010, the city CCZ were abolished and eight municipalities were created instead.

The city government of Montevideo performs several functions, including maintaining communications with the public, promoting culture, organizing society, caring for the environment and regulating traffic. The city hall is the Palacio Municipal on 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro area of Montevideo.

[ 132 ] The legislative branch of government, the Junta Departamental, or the Congress of Montevideo, governs the Department of Montevideo . The Junta, composed of 31 unsalaried elected members, is responsible for such things as the freedom of the citizens, the regulation of cultural activities, the naming of streets and public places, and the placement of monuments; it also responds to proposals of the Intendant in various circumstances.

The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo , one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a "hotbed of resistance". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.

[ 226 ] [ 227 ] Carrasco International Airport Companies operating at Tres Cruces bus station: Agencia central, Bruno, Copsa, Cromin, Cynsa, Copay, Cot, Cut, Corporacion, Cita, Cauvi, Colonia Express, El Condor, El Norteño, Ega, Expreso Chago, Expreso Minuano, Intertur, Nossar, Nuñez, Rutas del sol, TTL, Turil, Turismar, etc.

Aviation [ edit ] Montevideo is served by the Carrasco International Airport ( IATA : MVD , ICAO : SUMU ), which is located in the north of Ciudad de la Costa , in Canelones Department , 19 km (12 mi) from the city center. It handles over 1,5 million passengers per year, [ 228 ] [ 229 ] and has been cited as one of the most efficient and traveler-friendly airports in Latin America.

[ 230 ] Ángel S. Adami Airport is a private airport operated by minor charter companies and in which there is also a flight school.

[ 231 ] Port [ edit ] Main article: Port of Montevideo Buquebus high-speed ferries connect Montevideo to Argentina Montevideo is also served by a ferry system operated by the company Buquebus that connects the port with Buenos Aires . More than 2.2 million people per year travel between Argentina and Uruguay with Buquebus. One of these ships is a catamaran , which can reach a top speed of about 80 km/h (50 mph).

[ 232 ] Port of Montevideo The port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbor entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of Río de la Plata, Buenos Aires.

[ 233 ] The main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja Refinery . A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works.

[ 49 ] Since the second half of the 20th century, until the 21st century, physical changes had ceased, and since that time the area had degraded due to national economic stagnation.

[ 49 ] The port's proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.

[ 49 ] Every year more than one hundred cruises arrive, bringing tourists to Montevideo by public or private tours.

[ 234 ] Cycling [ edit ] The city has bicycle circuits in Ciudad Vieja , Artigas Boulevard and Centro as well as with good facilities for cyclists such as bike paths and bike racks throughout the city.

[ 235 ] In 2013 the "South Bicicircuito" was also inaugurated, which connects several of the dependent faculties of the University of the Republic.

[ 236 ] There are more than 100 bike stations in the city.

[ 237 ] In 2014, a bicycle sharing system called Movete was launched.

[ 238 ] Education [ edit ] Public education [ edit ] University of the Republic law school.

The University of the Republic is the country's largest and most important university, with a student body of 81,774, according to the census of 2007.

[ 239 ] It was founded on 18 July 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its Rector is Dr.

Rodrigo Arocena . The university houses 14 faculties (departments) and various institutes and schools. Many eminent Uruguayans have graduated from this university, including Carlos Vaz Ferreira , José Luis Massera , Gabriel Paternain , Mario Wschebor , Roman Fresnedo Siri , Carlos Ott and Eladio Dieste The process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator Dámaso Antonio Larrañaga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic.

[ 240 ] That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay at that time.

Kindergarten kids at a public school in Montevideo Private education [ edit ] The largest private university in Uruguay, [ 241 ] is also located in Montevideo.

ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942, and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996, becoming the first private educational institution in the country to achieve that status.

[ 242 ] It is a member of World ORT , an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg , Russia.

[ 243 ] The university has about 8,000 students, distributed among 5 faculties and institutes, mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering. Its rector as of 2010 [update] is Dr. Jorge A. Grünberg.

Another private university in Uruguay is the University of Montevideo (Spanish: Universidad de Montevideo, short: UM). It opened in 1986 and obtained the right to be legally named a university in 1997. With its seven schools the UM has facilities all over Montevideo. The Universidad de Montevideo also holds more than 250 partnerships with other universities in 47 countries. Since 2019 is the university ranked in the Top 500 in the world by the QS World University Rankings (QSWUR).

[ 244 ] The Montevideo Crandon Institute is an American School of missionary origin and the main Methodist educational institution in Uruguay. Founded in 1879 and supported by the Women's Society of the Methodist Church of the United States, it is one of the most traditional and emblematic institutions in the city inculcating John Wesley 's values. Its alumni include presidents, senators, ambassadors and Nobel Prize winners [ citation needed ] , along with musicians, scientists, and others. The Montevideo Crandon Institute boasts of being the first academic institution in South America where a home economics course was taught.

[ 245 ] [ 246 ] A laundress girl in a school play in Montevideo The Christian Brothers of Ireland Stella Maris College is a private, co-educational , not-for-profit Catholic school located in the wealthy residential southeastern neighborhood of Carrasco . Established in 1955, it is regarded as one of the best high schools in the country, blending a rigorous curriculum with strong extracurricular activities.

[ 247 ] The school's headmaster, history professor Juan Pedro Toni, is a member of the Stella Maris Board of Governors and the school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Its long list of distinguished former pupils includes economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay , with the creation of Old Christians Club , the school's alumni club.

Also in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo , one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, founded in 1908 with "the object of giving children a complete education, both intellectual and moral, based upon the ideas and principles of the best schools in The British Isles".

[ 248 ] The School is governed by the Board of Governors, elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay, whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay. Prominent alumni include president Luis Lacalle Pou and former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry and Gabriel Gurméndez Armand-Ugon .

Located in Cordon, St.Brendan's school, previously named St.Catherine's is a non-profit civil association, which has a solid institutional culture with a clear vision of the future. It is known for being one of the best schools in the country, joining students from the wealthiest parts of Montevideo, such as, Punta Carretas, Pocitos, Malvin and Carrasco.
St. Brendan's School is a bilingual, non-denominational school that promotes a pedagogical constructivist approach focused on the child as a whole. In this approach, understanding is built from the connections children make between their own prior knowledge and the learning experiences, thus developing critical thinking skills. It is also the only school in the country implementing the three International Baccalaureate Programmes . These are: Diploma Program – Pre-University course for students aged 16 to 19. The Diploma Program is a two-year curriculum.

MYP -Middle Years Program. For students aged 12 to 16.

PYP – Primary Years Program. For students aged 3 to 12.

[ 249 ] Healthcare [ edit ] Left: Italian Hospital of Montevideo . Right: Hospital Clinic In Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by polyclinics and hospitals or sanatorios. The term hospital is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while sanatorio is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.

Public hospitals [ edit ] Hospital de Clínicas "Dr. Manuel Quintela" is a University Hospital attached to the University of the Republic , and is located on Avenida Italia . It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928–1929 and has a surface area of 110,000 square meters (1,200,000 sq ft) on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr.

Hugo Villar , who was a considerable influence on the institution.

Hospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaraní and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel , who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of José Toribio (son of Tomás Toribio [ es ] ) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaraní street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaraní and 25 de Mayo) and Julián Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Estévez in 1798.

Hospital Pereira Rossell was founded in 1908 and was built on land donated in late 1900 by Alexis Rossell y Rius and Dolores Pereira de Rossell.

[ 250 ] It was the city's first pediatric hospital, and shortly afterwards the addition of an obstetric and gynecological clinic in 1915 made it the first maternity hospital as well. Later, the hospital received a donation from Dr. Enrique Pouey for a radiotherapy unit.

Hospital Vilardebó is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist Teodoro Vilardebó [ es ] , it opened 21 May 1880.

[ 251 ] The hospital was originally one of the best of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel.

[ 252 ] It has an emergency service, outpatient, clinic and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others.

[ 253 ] The average patient age is 30 years; more than half of the patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, [ 254 ] and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.

Other public polyclinics and hospitals of note include the Hospital Saint Bois , founded 18 November 1928, which consists of a General Hospital and Eye Hospital; the Pasteur Hospital in La Unión neighborhood; the Hospital Español , which was founded in 1886, passed to the private sector in the 20th century, closed in 2004 and was restored and re-inaugurated in 2007 as the municipal Juan Jose Crottogini Polyclinic; [ 255 ] [ 256 ] the National Cancer Institute; and the National Institute of Trauma and Orthopedics.

Private healthcare [ edit ] Private healthcare is offered by many private health insurance companies, each of which has one or more polyclinics and owns or is associated with one or more hospitals. Private medical facilities of note include the Hospital Británico , the Italian Hospital of Montevideo , Mutualista CASMU's Sanatoria I, II, III and IV, the Evangelical Hospital, Médica Uruguaya [ es ] , Sanatorio de la Asociación Española, Sanatorios del Círculo Católico, Sanatorio Casa de Galicia and Sanatorio GREMCA.
