According to Angelos Chaniotis and Rudolph F. Peters , divine laws are typically perceived as superior to man-made laws, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] sometimes due to an assumption that their source has resources beyond human knowledge and human reason.

[ 3 ] Believers in divine laws might accord them greater authority than other laws, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 2 ] for example by assuming that divine law cannot be changed by human authorities.

[ 2 ] According to Chaniotis, divine laws are noted for their apparent inflexibility.

[ 6 ] The introduction of interpretation into divine law is a controversial issue, since believers place high significance on adhering to the law precisely.

[ 7 ] Opponents to the application of divine law typically deny that it is purely divine and point out human influences in the law. These opponents characterize such laws as belonging to a particular cultural tradition . Conversely, adherents of divine law are sometimes reluctant to adapt inflexible divine laws to cultural contexts .

[ 8 ] Medieval Christianity assumed the existence of three kinds of laws: divine law, natural law , and man-made law.

[ 4 ] Theologians have substantially debated the scope of natural law, with the Enlightenment encouraging greater use of reason and expanding the scope of natural law and marginalizing divine law in a process of secularization .

[ 9 ] Since the authority of divine law is rooted in its source, the origins and transmission-history of divine law are important.

[ 10 ] [ a ] Conflicts frequently arise between secular understandings of justice or morality and divine law.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Religious law , such as canon law , includes both divine law and additional interpretations, logical extensions, and traditions.
