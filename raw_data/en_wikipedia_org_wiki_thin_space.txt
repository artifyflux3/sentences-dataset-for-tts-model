The top row is unspaced, the middle row has a thin space between the words, and the bottom has a regular space.

In typography , a thin space is a space character whose width is usually 1 ⁄ 5 or 1 ⁄ 6 of an em . It is used to add a narrow space, such as between nested quotation marks or to separate glyphs that interfere with one another. It is not as narrow as the hair space . It is also used in the International System of Units and in many countries as a thousands separator when writing numbers in groups of three digits, in order to facilitate reading.

[ 1 ] It also avoids the ambiguity of the comma, used as a thousands separator in many countries but as a decimal point in Europe.

In Unicode , thin space is encoded at U+ 2009 THIN SPACE ( &thinsp;, &ThinSpace; ). Some text editors, such as IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio, will display the character as its suggested abbreviation of " THSP ".

[ 2 ] Unicode's U+ 202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE is a non-breaking space with a width similar to that of the thin space.

In LaTeX and Plain TeX , \thinspace produces a narrow, non-breaking space .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Inside and outside of math formulae in LaTeX, \, also produces a narrow, non-breaking space.

In all versions of LibreOffice and in some of Microsoft Word , the special characters and symbols dialog (often available via Insert > Symbol or Insert > Special Characters ), has both the thin space and the narrow no-break space available for point-and-click insertion. In LibreOffice's Symbol dialog, there is an easy-to-find box field to narrow the searching; in Word's Symbol dialog, under font = "(normal text)", the characters are found in subset = "General Punctuation", Unicode character 2009 and nearby. Other word processing programs and in many Linux configurations, have ways of producing a thin space using keyboard shortcuts.
