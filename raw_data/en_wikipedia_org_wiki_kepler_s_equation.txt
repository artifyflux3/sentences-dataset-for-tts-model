It was derived by Johannes Kepler in 1609 in Chapter 60 of his Astronomia nova , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and in book V of his Epitome of Copernican Astronomy (1621) Kepler proposed an iterative solution to the equation.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] This equation and its solution, however, first appeared in a 9th-century work by Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi , which dealt with problems of parallax.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The equation has played an important role in the history of both physics and mathematics, particularly classical celestial mechanics .

Equation [ edit ] Kepler's equation solutions for five different eccentricities between 0 and 1 Kepler's equation is M = E − − e sin ⁡ ⁡ E {\displaystyle M=E-e\sin E} where M {\displaystyle M} is the mean anomaly , E {\displaystyle E} is the eccentric anomaly , and e {\displaystyle e} is the eccentricity .

The 'eccentric anomaly' E {\displaystyle E} is useful to compute the position of a point moving in a Keplerian orbit. As for instance, if the body passes the periastron at coordinates x = a ( 1 − − e ) {\displaystyle x=a(1-e)} , y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} , at time t = t 0 {\displaystyle t=t_{0}} , then to find out the position of the body at any time, you first calculate the mean anomaly M {\displaystyle M} from the time and the mean motion n {\displaystyle n} by the formula M = n ( t − − t 0 ) {\displaystyle M=n(t-t_{0})} , then solve the Kepler equation above to get E {\displaystyle E} , then get the coordinates relative to the central gravitational body from: x = a ( cos ⁡ ⁡ E − − e ) y = b sin ⁡ ⁡ E {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{lcl}x&=&a(\cos E-e)\\y&=&b\sin E\end{array}}} where a {\displaystyle a} is the semi-major axis , b {\displaystyle b} the semi-minor axis .

Kepler's equation is a transcendental equation because sine is a transcendental function , and it cannot be solved for E {\displaystyle E} algebraically .

Numerical analysis and series expansions are generally required to evaluate E {\displaystyle E} .

Alternate forms [ edit ] There are several forms of Kepler's equation. Each form is associated with a specific type of orbit. The standard Kepler equation is used for elliptic orbits ( 0 ≤ ≤ e < 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq e<1} ). The hyperbolic Kepler equation is used for hyperbolic trajectories ( e > 1 {\displaystyle e>1} ). The radial Kepler equation is used for linear (radial) trajectories ( e = 1 {\displaystyle e=1} ).

Barker's equation is used for parabolic trajectories (for which e = 1 {\displaystyle e=1} ). With the parabolic orbit, unlike the elliptical or hyperbolic orbits, it is possible to solve Barker's equation and find a closed-form expression for the position as a function of time.

When e = 0 {\displaystyle e=0} , the orbit is circular. Increasing e {\displaystyle e} causes the circle to become elliptical. When e = 1 {\displaystyle e=1} , there are four possibilities: a parabolic trajectory, a trajectory that goes back and forth along a line segment from the centre of attraction to a point at some distance away, a trajectory going in or out along an infinite ray emanating from the centre of attraction, with its speed going to zero with distance or a trajectory along a ray, but with speed not going to zero with distance.

A value of e {\displaystyle e} slightly above 1 results in a hyperbolic orbit with a turning angle of just under 180 degrees. Further increases reduce the turning angle, and as e {\displaystyle e} goes to infinity, the orbit becomes a straight line of infinite length.

Hyperbolic Kepler equation [ edit ] The Hyperbolic Kepler equation is: M = e sinh ⁡ ⁡ H − − H {\displaystyle M=e\sinh H-H} where H {\displaystyle H} is the hyperbolic eccentric anomaly.
This equation is derived by redefining M to be the square root of −1 times the right-hand side of the elliptical equation: M = i ( E − − e sin ⁡ ⁡ E ) {\displaystyle M=i\left(E-e\sin E\right)} (in which E {\displaystyle E} is now imaginary) and then replacing E {\displaystyle E} by i H {\displaystyle iH} .

Radial Kepler equations [ edit ] The Radial Kepler equation for the case where the object does not have enough energy to escape is: t ( x ) = ± ± [ sin − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) − − x ( 1 − − x ) ] {\displaystyle t(x)=\pm {\biggr [}\sin ^{-1}({\sqrt {x}})-{\sqrt {x(1-x)}}{\biggr ]}} where t {\displaystyle t} is proportional to time and x {\displaystyle x} is proportional to the distance from the centre of attraction along the ray and attains the value 1 at the maximum distance. This equation is derived by multiplying Kepler's equation by 1/2 and setting e {\displaystyle e} to 1: t ( x ) = 1 2 [ E − − sin ⁡ ⁡ E ] .

{\displaystyle t(x)={\frac {1}{2}}\left[E-\sin E\right].} and then making the substitution E = 2 sin − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle E=2\sin ^{-1}({\sqrt {x}}).} The radial equation for when the object has enough energy to escape is: t ( x ) = ± ± [ sinh − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) − − x ( 1 + x ) ] {\displaystyle t(x)=\pm {\biggr [}\sinh ^{-1}({\sqrt {x}})-{\sqrt {x(1+x)}}{\biggr ]}} When the energy is exactly the minimum amount needed to escape, then the time is simply proportional to the distance to the power 3/2.

Inverse problem [ edit ] Calculating M {\displaystyle M} for a given value of E {\displaystyle E} is straightforward. However, solving for E {\displaystyle E} when M {\displaystyle M} is given can be considerably more challenging. There is no closed-form solution . Solving for E {\displaystyle E} is more or less equivalent to solving for the true anomaly , or the difference between the true anomaly and the mean anomaly, which is called the " Equation of the center ".

One can write an infinite series expression for the solution to Kepler's equation using Lagrange inversion , but the series does not converge for all combinations of e {\displaystyle e} and M {\displaystyle M} (see below).

Confusion over the solvability of Kepler's equation has persisted in the literature for four centuries.

[ 9 ] Kepler himself expressed doubt at the possibility of finding a general solution: I am sufficiently satisfied that it [Kepler's equation] cannot be solved a priori, on account of the different nature of the arc and the sine.  But if I am mistaken, and any one shall point out the way to me, he will be in my eyes the great Apollonius .

— Johannes Kepler [ 10 ] Fourier series expansion (with respect to M {\displaystyle M} ) using Bessel functions is [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] E = M + ∑ ∑ m = 1 ∞ ∞ 2 m J m ( m e ) sin ⁡ ⁡ ( m M ) , e ≤ ≤ 1 , M ∈ ∈ [ − − π π , π π ] .

{\displaystyle E=M+\sum _{m=1}^{\infty }{\frac {2}{m}}J_{m}(me)\sin(mM),\quad e\leq 1,\quad M\in [-\pi ,\pi ].} With respect to e {\displaystyle e} , it is a Kapteyn series .

Inverse Kepler equation [ edit ] The inverse Kepler equation is the solution of Kepler's equation for all real values of e {\displaystyle e} : E = { ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ M n 3 n !

lim θ θ → → 0 + ( d n − − 1 d θ θ n − − 1 ( ( θ θ θ θ − − sin ⁡ ⁡ ( θ θ ) 3 ) n ) ) , e = 1 ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ M n n !

lim θ θ → → 0 + ( d n − − 1 d θ θ n − − 1 ( ( θ θ θ θ − − e sin ⁡ ⁡ ( θ θ ) ) n ) ) , e ≠ ≠ 1 {\displaystyle E={\begin{cases}\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {M^{\frac {n}{3}}}{n!}}\lim _{\theta \to 0^{+}}\!{\Bigg (}{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{\,n-1}}{\mathrm {d} \theta ^{\,n-1}}}{\bigg (}{\bigg (}{\frac {\theta }{\sqrt[{3}]{\theta -\sin(\theta )}}}{\bigg )}^{\!\!\!n}{\bigg )}{\Bigg )},&e=1\\\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {M^{n}}{n!}}\lim _{\theta \to 0^{+}}\!{\Bigg (}{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{\,n-1}}{\mathrm {d} \theta ^{\,n-1}}}{\bigg (}{\Big (}{\frac {\theta }{\theta -e\sin(\theta )}}{\Big )}^{\!n}{\bigg )}{\Bigg )},&e\neq 1\end{cases}}} Evaluating this yields: E = { s + 1 60 s 3 + 1 1400 s 5 + 1 25200 s 7 + 43 17248000 s 9 + 1213 7207200000 s 11 + 151439 12713500800000 s 13 + ⋯ ⋯ with s = ( 6 M ) 1 / 3 , e = 1 1 1 − − e M − − e ( 1 − − e ) 4 M 3 3 !

InverseSeries [ Series [ M - Sin [ M ], { M , 0 , 10 }]] InverseSeries [ Series [ M - e Sin [ M ], { M , 0 , 10 }]] These functions are simple Maclaurin series . Such Taylor series representations of transcendental functions are considered to be definitions of those functions. Therefore, this solution is a formal definition of the inverse Kepler equation. However, E {\displaystyle E} is not an entire function of M {\displaystyle M} at a given non-zero e {\displaystyle e} . Indeed, the derivative d M / d E = 1 − − e cos ⁡ ⁡ E {\displaystyle \mathrm {dM} /\mathrm {d} E=1-e\cos E} goes to zero at an infinite set of complex numbers when e < 1 , {\displaystyle e<1,} the nearest to zero being at E = ± ± i cosh − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 / e ) , {\displaystyle E=\pm i\cosh ^{-1}(1/e),} and at these two points M = E − − e sin ⁡ ⁡ E = ± ± i ( cosh − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 / e ) − − 1 − − e 2 ) {\displaystyle M=E-e\sin E=\pm i\left(\cosh ^{-1}(1/e)-{\sqrt {1-e^{2}}}\right)} (where inverse cosh is taken to be positive), and d E / d M {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} E/\mathrm {d} M} goes to infinity at these values of M {\displaystyle M} . This means that the radius of convergence of the Maclaurin series is cosh − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 / e ) − − 1 − − e 2 {\displaystyle \cosh ^{-1}(1/e)-{\sqrt {1-e^{2}}}} and the series will not converge for values of M {\displaystyle M} larger than this. The series can also be used for the hyperbolic case, in which case the radius of convergence is cos − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 / e ) − − e 2 − − 1 .

{\displaystyle \cos ^{-1}(1/e)-{\sqrt {e^{2}-1}}.} The series for when e = 1 {\displaystyle e=1} converges when M < 2 π π {\displaystyle M<2\pi } .

While this solution is the simplest in a certain mathematical sense, [ which?

] , other solutions are preferable for most applications. Alternatively, Kepler's equation can be solved numerically.

The solution for e ≠ ≠ 1 {\displaystyle e\neq 1} was found by Karl Stumpff in 1968, [ 14 ] but its significance wasn't recognized.

[ 15 ] [ clarification needed ] One can also write a Maclaurin series in e {\displaystyle e} . This series does not converge when e {\displaystyle e} is larger than the Laplace limit (about 0.66), regardless of the value of M {\displaystyle M} (unless M {\displaystyle M} is a multiple of 2π ), but it converges for all M {\displaystyle M} if e {\displaystyle e} is less than the Laplace limit. The coefficients in the series, other than the first (which is simply M {\displaystyle M} ), depend on M {\displaystyle M} in a periodic way with period 2π .

Inverse radial Kepler equation [ edit ] The inverse radial Kepler equation ( e = 1 {\displaystyle e=1} ) for the case in which the object does not have enough energy to escape can similarly be written as: x ( t ) = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ [ lim r → → 0 + ( t 2 3 n n !

d n − − 1 d r n − − 1 ( r n ( 3 2 ( sin − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( r ) − − r − − r 2 ) ) − − 2 3 n ) ) ] {\displaystyle x(t)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\left[\lim _{r\to 0^{+}}\left({\frac {t^{{\frac {2}{3}}n}}{n!}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{\,n-1}}{\mathrm {d} r^{\,n-1}}}\!\left(r^{n}\left({\frac {3}{2}}{\Big (}\sin ^{-1}({\sqrt {r}})-{\sqrt {r-r^{2}}}{\Big )}\right)^{\!-{\frac {2}{3}}n}\right)\right)\right]} Evaluating this yields: x ( t ) = p − − 1 5 p 2 − − 3 175 p 3 − − 23 7875 p 4 − − 1894 3031875 p 5 − − 3293 21896875 p 6 − − 2418092 62077640625 p 7 − − ⋯ ⋯ | p = ( 3 2 t ) 2 / 3 {\displaystyle x(t)=p-{\frac {1}{5}}p^{2}-{\frac {3}{175}}p^{3}-{\frac {23}{7875}}p^{4}-{\frac {1894}{3031875}}p^{5}-{\frac {3293}{21896875}}p^{6}-{\frac {2418092}{62077640625}}p^{7}-\ \cdots \ {\bigg |}{p=\left({\tfrac {3}{2}}t\right)^{2/3}}} To obtain this result using Mathematica : InverseSeries [ Series [ ArcSin [ Sqrt [ t ]] - Sqrt [( 1 - t ) t ], { t , 0 , 15 }]] Numerical approximation of inverse problem [ edit ] Newton's method [ edit ] For most applications, the inverse problem can be computed numerically by finding the root of the function: f ( E ) = E − − e sin ⁡ ⁡ ( E ) − − M ( t ) {\displaystyle f(E)=E-e\sin(E)-M(t)} This can be done iteratively via Newton's method : E n + 1 = E n − − f ( E n ) f ′ ( E n ) = E n − − E n − − e sin ⁡ ⁡ ( E n ) − − M ( t ) 1 − − e cos ⁡ ⁡ ( E n ) {\displaystyle E_{n+1}=E_{n}-{\frac {f(E_{n})}{f'(E_{n})}}=E_{n}-{\frac {E_{n}-e\sin(E_{n})-M(t)}{1-e\cos(E_{n})}}} Note that E {\displaystyle E} and M {\displaystyle M} are in units of radians in this computation.  This iteration is repeated until desired accuracy is obtained (e.g. when f ( E ) {\displaystyle f(E)} < desired accuracy). For most elliptical orbits an initial value of E 0 = M ( t ) {\displaystyle E_{0}=M(t)} is sufficient. For orbits with e > 0.8 {\displaystyle e>0.8} , a initial value of E 0 = π π {\displaystyle E_{0}=\pi } can be used. Numerous works developed accurate (but also more complex) start guesses.

[ 16 ] If e {\displaystyle e} is identically 1, then the derivative of f {\displaystyle f} , which is in the denominator of Newton's method, can get close to zero, making derivative-based methods such as Newton-Raphson, secant, or regula falsi numerically unstable. In that case, the bisection method will provide guaranteed convergence, particularly since the solution can be bounded in a small initial interval. On modern computers, it is possible to achieve 4 or 5 digits of accuracy in 17 to 18 iterations.

[ 17 ] A similar approach can be used for the hyperbolic form of Kepler's equation.

[ 18 ] : 66–67 In the case of a parabolic trajectory, Barker's equation is used.

Fixed-point iteration [ edit ] A related method starts by noting that E = M + e sin ⁡ ⁡ E {\displaystyle E=M+e\sin {E}} . Repeatedly substituting the expression on the right for the E {\displaystyle E} on the right yields a simple fixed-point iteration algorithm for evaluating E ( e , M ) {\displaystyle E(e,M)} . This method is identical to Kepler's 1621 solution.

[ 4 ] In pseudocode : function E ( e , M , n ) E = M for k = 1 to n E = M + e * sin E next k return E The number of iterations, n {\displaystyle n} , depends on the value of e {\displaystyle e} . The hyperbolic form similarly has H = sinh − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( H + M e ) {\displaystyle H=\sinh ^{-1}\left({\frac {H+M}{e}}\right)} .

This method is related to the Newton's method solution above in that E n + 1 = E n − − E n − − e sin ⁡ ⁡ ( E n ) − − M ( t ) 1 − − e cos ⁡ ⁡ ( E n ) = E n + ( M + e sin ⁡ ⁡ E n − − E n ) ( 1 + e cos ⁡ ⁡ E n ) 1 − − e 2 ( cos ⁡ ⁡ E n ) 2 {\displaystyle E_{n+1}=E_{n}-{\frac {E_{n}-e\sin(E_{n})-M(t)}{1-e\cos(E_{n})}}=E_{n}+{\frac {(M+e\sin {E_{n}}-E_{n})(1+e\cos {E_{n}})}{1-e^{2}(\cos {E_{n}})^{2}}}} To first order in the small quantities M − − E n {\displaystyle M-E_{n}} and e {\displaystyle e} , E n + 1 ≈ ≈ M + e sin ⁡ ⁡ E n {\displaystyle E_{n+1}\approx M+e\sin {E_{n}}} .
