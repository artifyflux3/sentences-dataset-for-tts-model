Such constraints are called scleronomic constraints. The opposite of scleronomous is rheonomous .

Application [ edit ] Main article: Generalized velocity In 3-D space, a particle with mass m {\displaystyle m\,\!} , velocity v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } has kinetic energy T {\displaystyle T} T = 1 2 m v 2 .

{\displaystyle T={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}.} Velocity is the derivative of position r {\displaystyle r} with respect to time t {\displaystyle t\,\!} .  Use chain rule for several variables : v = d r d t = ∑ ∑ i ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ q i q ˙ ˙ i + ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ t .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\frac {d\mathbf {r} }{dt}}=\sum _{i}\ {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial q_{i}}}{\dot {q}}_{i}+{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial t}}.} where q i {\displaystyle q_{i}} are generalized coordinates .

Therefore, T = 1 2 m ( ∑ ∑ i ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ q i q ˙ ˙ i + ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ t ) 2 .

{\displaystyle T={\frac {1}{2}}m\left(\sum _{i}\ {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial q_{i}}}{\dot {q}}_{i}+{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial t}}\right)^{2}.} Rearranging the terms carefully, [ 1 ] T = T 0 + T 1 + T 2 : T 0 = 1 2 m ( ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ t ) 2 , T 1 = ∑ ∑ i m ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ t ⋅ ⋅ ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ q i q ˙ ˙ i , T 2 = ∑ ∑ i , j 1 2 m ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ q i ⋅ ⋅ ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ q j q ˙ ˙ i q ˙ ˙ j , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}T&=T_{0}+T_{1}+T_{2}:\\[1ex]T_{0}&={\frac {1}{2}}m\left({\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial t}}\right)^{2},\\T_{1}&=\sum _{i}\ m{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial t}}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial q_{i}}}{\dot {q}}_{i}\,\!,\\T_{2}&=\sum _{i,j}\ {\frac {1}{2}}m{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial q_{i}}}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial q_{j}}}{\dot {q}}_{i}{\dot {q}}_{j},\end{aligned}}} where T 0 {\displaystyle T_{0}\,\!} , T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}\,\!} , T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} are respectively homogeneous functions of degree 0, 1, and 2 in generalized velocities.  If this system is scleronomous, then the position does not depend explicitly with time: ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ t = 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial t}}=0.} Therefore, only term T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} does not vanish: T = T 2 .

{\displaystyle T=T_{2}.} Kinetic energy is a homogeneous function of degree 2 in generalized velocities.

Example: pendulum [ edit ] A simple pendulum As shown at right, a simple pendulum is a system composed of a weight and a string.  The string is attached at the top end to a pivot and at the bottom end to a weight.  Being inextensible, the string’s length is a constant.  Therefore, this system is scleronomous; it obeys scleronomic constraint x 2 + y 2 − − L = 0 , {\displaystyle {\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}-L=0,} where ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} is the position of the weight and L {\displaystyle L} is length of the string.

A simple pendulum with oscillating pivot point Take a more complicated example. Refer to the next figure at right, Assume the top end of the string is attached to a pivot point undergoing a simple harmonic motion x t = x 0 cos ⁡ ⁡ ω ω t , {\displaystyle x_{t}=x_{0}\cos \omega t,} where x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} is amplitude, ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is angular frequency, and t {\displaystyle t} is time.

Although the top end of the string is not fixed, the length of this inextensible string is still a constant.  The distance between the top end and the weight must stay the same.  Therefore, this system is rheonomous as it obeys constraint explicitly dependent on time ( x − − x 0 cos ⁡ ⁡ ω ω t ) 2 + y 2 − − L = 0.

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {(x-x_{0}\cos \omega t)^{2}+y^{2}}}-L=0.} See also [ edit ] Lagrangian mechanics Holonomic system Nonholonomic system Rheonomous Mass matrix References [ edit ] ^ Goldstein, Herbert (1980).
