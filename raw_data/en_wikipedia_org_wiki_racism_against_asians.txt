[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Which causes inferiority complex and internalized racism.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Reinforced by dangerous racial science of supposed " mongoloid race " (outdated), such as lacking of sexual dimorphism between Asian men and Asian women, [ 11 ] as well as dealing with the aftershocks of the history of European colonisation of Southeast Asia and " white worship ".

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] The model minority myth fails to account for the bamboo ceiling , the difficult circumstances of poorer Asians, and their marginalization and stereotyping in the media.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Contradictorily being used to justify white supremacy through modes of " honorary Aryan " or " honorary whiteness " racial concepts.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] Generalizing East Asians as monolithic [ 27 ] and being ignorant of the multicultural populations of Southeast Asia, such as the existence of Melanesians in Southeast Asia , etc.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Myopic depictions of Asian cultures continues to be a problem.

[ 35 ] Additionally, racism in Asia (racist attitudes which Asians have towards each other as well as racist attitudes which Asians have towards non-Asians) is also impacted by differences in nationality as well as regional differences.
