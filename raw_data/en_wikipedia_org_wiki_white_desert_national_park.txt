It is located in the Farafra depression , 45 km (28 mi) north of the town of Qasr Al Farafra . Part of the park is in the Farafra Oasis ( New Valley Governorate ).

[ 1 ] The park is the site of large white chalk rock formations, created through erosion by wind and sand. It is also the site of cliffs (at the northern end of the Farafra Depression), sand dunes (part of the Great Sand Sea ), as well as Wadi Hennis and oases at Ain El Maqfi and Ain El Wadi .

White Desert National Park covers an area of 300 km 2 (120 sq mi). The highest point in the park is at El Qess Abu Said at 353 m (1,158 ft) above sea level, and the lowest is at Wadi Hennis at 32 m (105 ft).

[ 2 ] The park serves as the refuge for various animals, including the endangered rhim gazelle and the vulnerable dorcas gazelle , as well as Barbary sheep ; jackals ; Rüppell's , red and fennec foxes; and the sand cat .

In popular culture [ edit ] In the Gathering Storm expansion pack released in 2019 for the turn-based strategy game Civilization VI , the Sahara el Beyda is featured as one of the Natural Wonders.
