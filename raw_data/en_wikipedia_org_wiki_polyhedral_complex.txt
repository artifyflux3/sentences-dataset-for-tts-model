[ 1 ] Polyhedral complexes generalize simplicial complexes and arise in various areas of polyhedral geometry, such as tropical geometry , splines and hyperplane arrangements .

Definition [ edit ] A polyhedral complex K {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}} is a set of polyhedra that satisfies the following conditions: 1. Every face of a polyhedron from K {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}} is also in K {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}} .

2. The intersection of any two polyhedra σ σ 1 , σ σ 2 ∈ ∈ K {\displaystyle \sigma _{1},\sigma _{2}\in {\mathcal {K}}} is a face of both σ σ 1 {\displaystyle \sigma _{1}} and σ σ 2 {\displaystyle \sigma _{2}} .

Note that the empty set is a face of every polyhedron, and so the intersection of two polyhedra in K {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}} may be empty.

Examples [ edit ] Tropical varieties are polyhedral complexes satisfying a certain balancing condition .

[ 2 ] Simplicial complexes are polyhedral complexes in which every polyhedron is a simplex .

Voronoi diagrams .

Splines .

Fans [ edit ] A fan is a polyhedral complex in which every polyhedron is a cone from the origin.  Examples of fans include: The normal fan of a polytope .

The Gröbner fan of an ideal of a polynomial ring .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] A tropical variety obtained by tropicalizing an algebraic variety over a valued field with trivial valuation.

The recession fan of a tropical variety.
