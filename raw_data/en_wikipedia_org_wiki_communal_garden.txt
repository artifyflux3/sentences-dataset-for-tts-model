Communal gardens in the centre of Berkeley Square , Mayfair , London .

A communal garden (often used in the plural as communal gardens ) is a (normally formal) garden for shared use by a number of local residents, typically in an urban setting. The term is especially used in the United Kingdom .

[ 1 ] The centre of many city squares and crescents (especially in London , for example), are maintained as communal gardens.

[ 2 ] Overview [ edit ] Despite the name, and the fact that they typically look like small public parks , such gardens are normally privately or jointly owned, with sharing of maintenance costs. Access may be restricted by locked gates, with keys available for residents, or only unlocked during daytime .

[ 3 ] They are often surrounded by tall railings designed to keep people and deer out.

In media [ edit ] One of the scenes in the 1999 film Notting Hill involves the two main characters, Anna ( Julia Roberts ) and William ( Hugh Grant ), breaking into private and locked communal gardens by climbing over the wall at night after a dinner party. The communal gardens used were Rosmead Gardens in Rosmead Road, Notting Hill , London.
