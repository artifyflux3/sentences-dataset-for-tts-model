( November 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Kula-Farallon Ridge was an ancient mid-ocean ridge that existed between the Kula and Farallon plates in the Pacific Ocean during the Jurassic period. There was a small piece of this ridge off the Pacific Northwest 43 million years ago. The rest of the ridge has since been subducted beneath Alaska .

In its early stages of development, the Kula-Farallon Ridge sheared pieces of oceanic rock off the coast of California . When the Kula–Farallon Ridge was in the area where Washington and Oregon are now, basaltic lava erupted there. Some of the basaltic lava is now part of the Olympic Peninsula .
