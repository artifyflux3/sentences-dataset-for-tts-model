An alethonym ('true name') or an orthonym ('real name') is the proper name of the object in question, the object of onomastic study. Scholars studying onomastics are called onomasticians .

Onomastics has applications in data mining , with applications such as named-entity recognition , or recognition of the origin of names.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is a popular approach in historical research, where it can be used to identify ethnic minorities within populations [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and for the purpose of prosopography .

Etymology [ edit ] Onomastics originates from the Greek onomastikós ( ὀνομαστικός , 'of or belonging to naming'), [ 5 ] [ 6 ] itself derived from ónoma ( ὄνομα , 'name').

[ 7 ] Branches [ edit ] Toponymy (or more precisely toponomastics), one of the principal branches of onomastics, is the study of place names.

[ 8 ] Anthroponymy is the study of personal names.

[ 9 ] Literary onomastics is the branch that researches the names in works of literature and other fiction.

[ 10 ] Socio-onomastics or re-onomastics is the study of names within a society or culture.
