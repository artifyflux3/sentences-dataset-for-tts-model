A [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") is the surface of a solid [ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics) "Ball (mathematics)"), here having [radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius "Radius")_r_

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **surface** is a [mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") of the common concept of a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface "Surface"). It is a generalization of a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)"), but, unlike a plane, it may be [curved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature"); this is analogous to a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") generalizing a [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line"). An example of a non-flat surface is the [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere").

There are several more precise definitions, depending on the context and the mathematical tools that are used for the study. The simplest mathematical surfaces are planes and [spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") in the [Euclidean 3-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_3-space "Euclidean 3-space"). The exact definition of a surface may depend on the context. Typically, in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), a surface may cross itself (and may have other [singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety "Singular point of an algebraic variety")), while, in [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), it may not.

A surface is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") two; this means that a moving point on a surface may move in two directions (it has two [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom "Degrees of freedom")). In other words, around almost every point, there is a _[coordinate patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate\_patch "Coordinate patch")_ on which a [two-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_space "Two-dimensional space")[coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") is defined. For example, the surface of the Earth resembles (ideally) a sphere, and [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude") provide two-dimensional coordinates on it (except at the poles and along the [180th meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180th_meridian "180th meridian")).

Often, a surface is defined by [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") that are satisfied by the [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate "Coordinate") of its points. This is the case of the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") of two variables. The set of the [zeros of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function") of three variables is a surface, which is called an [implicit surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_surface "Implicit surface").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-1) If the defining three-variate function is a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial"), the surface is an [algebraic surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface "Algebraic surface"). For example, the [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere") is an algebraic surface, as it may be defined by the [implicit equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_equation "Implicit equation")

![Image 2: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-1=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/334e6c81f012b997be35eee5f5d91d89ef7c9d50)
A surface may also be defined as the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)"), in some space of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") at least 3, of a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") of two variables (some further conditions are required to ensure that the image is not a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve")). In this case, one says that one has a [parametric surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_surface "Parametric surface"), which is _parametrized_ by these two variables, called _parameters_. For example, the unit sphere may be parametrized by the [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles"), also called [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude")u and [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude")v by

![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=\cos(u)\cos(v)\\y&=\sin(u)\cos(v)\\z&=\sin(v)\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7f1515471c9353718fdefb096e071dc08a0d073)
Parametric equations of surfaces are often irregular at some points. For example, all but two points of the unit sphere, are the image, by the above parametrization, of exactly one pair of Euler angles ([modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation "Modulo operation")2 π). For the remaining two points (the [north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole "North Pole") and [south poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole "South Pole")), one has cos _v_ = 0, and the longitude _u_ may take any values. Also, there are surfaces for which there cannot exist a single parametrization that covers the whole surface. Therefore, one often considers surfaces which are parametrized by several parametric equations, whose images cover the surface. This is formalized by the concept of [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"): in the context of manifolds, typically in [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), a surface is a manifold of dimension two; this means that a surface is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") such that every point has a [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood "Neighborhood") which is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") to an [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_subset "Open subset") of the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") (see [Surface (topology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)") and [Surface (differential geometry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(differential_geometry) "Surface (differential geometry)")). This allows defining surfaces in spaces of dimension higher than three, and even _abstract surfaces_, which are not contained in any other space. On the other hand, this excludes surfaces that have [singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_theory "Singularity theory"), such as the vertex of a [conical surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conical_surface "Conical surface") or points where a surface crosses itself.

In [classical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_geometry "Classical geometry"), a surface is generally defined as a [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") of a point or a line. For example, a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") is the locus of a point which is at a given distance of a fixed point, called the center; a [conical surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conical_surface "Conical surface") is the locus of a line passing through a fixed point and crossing a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve"); a [surface of revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_of_revolution "Surface of revolution") is the locus of a curve rotating around a line. A [ruled surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruled_surface "Ruled surface") is the locus of a moving line satisfying some constraints; in modern terminology, a ruled surface is a surface, which is a [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory) "Union (set theory)") of lines.

There are several kinds of surfaces that are considered in mathematics. An unambiguous terminology is thus necessary to distinguish them when needed. A _[topological surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological\_surface "Topological surface")_ is a surface that is a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") of dimension two (see [§Topological surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#Topological_surface)). A _[differentiable surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable\_surface "Differentiable surface")_ is a surfaces that is a [differentiable manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold") (see [§Differentiable surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#Differentiable_surface)). Every differentiable surface is a topological surface, but the converse is false.

A "surface" is often implicitly supposed to be contained in a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") of dimension 3, typically **R**3. A surface that is contained in a [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space") is called a [projective surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_surface "Projective surface") (see [§Projective surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#Projective_surface)). A surface that is not supposed to be included in another space is called an _abstract surface_.

*   The [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") of two variables, defined over a [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space")[open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_subset "Open subset") of **R**2 is a _topological surface_. If the function is [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function"), the graph is a _differentiable surface_.
*   A [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") is both an [algebraic surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface "Algebraic surface") and a differentiable surface. It is also a [ruled surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruled_surface "Ruled surface") and a [surface of revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_of_revolution "Surface of revolution").
*   A [circular cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_cylinder "Circular cylinder") (that is, the [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") of a line crossing a circle and parallel to a given direction) is an algebraic surface and a differentiable surface.
*   A [circular cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conical_surface "Conical surface") (locus of a line crossing a circle, and passing through a fixed point, the _apex_, which is outside the plane of the circle) is an algebraic surface which is not a differentiable surface. If one removes the apex, the remainder of the cone is the union of two differentiable surfaces.
*   The surface of a [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") is a topological surface, which is neither a differentiable surface nor an algebraic surface.
*   A [hyperbolic paraboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_paraboloid "Hyperbolic paraboloid") (the graph of the function _z_ = _xy_) is a differentiable surface and an algebraic surface. It is also a ruled surface, and, for this reason, is often used in [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture "Architecture").
*   A [two-sheet hyperboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sheet_hyperboloid "Two-sheet hyperboloid") is an algebraic surface and the union of two non-intersecting differentiable surfaces.

A **parametric surface** is the image of an open subset of the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") (typically ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd)) by a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"), in a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), generally a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") of dimension at least three. Usually the function is supposed to be [continuously differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_differentiable "Continuously differentiable"), and this will be always the case in this article.

Specifically, a parametric surface in ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) is given by three functions of two variables u and v, called _parameters_

![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=f_{1}(u,v),\\[4pt]y&=f_{2}(u,v),\\[4pt]z&=f_{3}(u,v)\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f8946cd2573c372525b0dec0e79413ba390f32f8)
As the image of such a function may be a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") (for example, if the three functions are constant with respect to v), a further condition is required, generally that, for [almost all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_all "Almost all") values of the parameters, the [Jacobian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix "Jacobian matrix")

![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}{\dfrac {\partial f_{1}}{\partial u}}&{\dfrac {\partial f_{1}}{\partial v}}\\[6pt]{\dfrac {\partial f_{2}}{\partial u}}&{\dfrac {\partial f_{2}}{\partial v}}\\[6pt]{\dfrac {\partial f_{3}}{\partial u}}&{\dfrac {\partial f_{3}}{\partial v}}\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef0d2b93d2507124b250c42e721a277064a9f845)
has [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_matrix "Rank of a matrix") two. Here "almost all" means that the values of the parameters where the rank is two contain a [dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_subset "Dense subset")[open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_subset "Open subset") of the range of the parametrization. For surfaces in a space of higher dimension, the condition is the same, except for the number of columns of the Jacobian matrix.

### Tangent plane and normal vector

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Tangent plane and normal vector")]

A point p where the above Jacobian matrix has rank two is called _regular_, or, more properly, the parametrization is called _regular_ at p.

The _[tangent plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent\_plane "Tangent plane")_ at a regular point p is the unique plane passing through p and having a direction parallel to the two [row vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_vector "Row vector") of the Jacobian matrix. The tangent plane is an [affine concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_property "Affine property"), because its definition is independent of the choice of a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)"). In other words, any [affine transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation") maps the tangent plane to the surface at a point to the tangent plane to the image of the surface at the image of the point.

The _[normal line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal\_line "Normal line")_ at a point of a surface is the unique line passing through the point and perpendicular to the tangent plane; a _normal vector_ is a vector which is parallel to the normal line.

For other [differential invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_invariant "Differential invariant") of surfaces, in the neighborhood of a point, see [Differential geometry of surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces "Differential geometry of surfaces").

### Irregular point and singular point

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Irregular point and singular point")]

A point of a parametric surface which is not regular is **irregular**. There are several kinds of irregular points.

It may occur that an irregular point becomes regular, if one changes the parametrization. This is the case of the poles in the parametrization of the [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere") by [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles"): it suffices to permute the role of the different [coordinate axes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_axes "Coordinate axes") for changing the poles.

On the other hand, consider the [circular cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_cone "Circular cone") of parametric equation

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=t\cos(u)\\y&=t\sin(u)\\z&=t\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c98c1d8df3664bc5fe446df0885762d041ce3e52)
The apex of the cone is the origin (0, 0, 0), and is obtained for _t_ = 0. It is an irregular point that remains irregular, whichever parametrization is chosen (otherwise, there would exist a unique tangent plane). Such an irregular point, where the tangent plane is undefined, is said **singular**.

There is another kind of singular points. There are the **self-crossing points**, that is the points where the surface crosses itself. In other words, these are the points which are obtained for (at least) two different values of the parameters.

### Graph of a bivariate function

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Graph of a bivariate function")]

Let _z_ = _f_(_x_, _y_) be a function of two real variables, a _[bivariate function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivariate\_function "Bivariate function")_. This is a parametric surface, parametrized as

![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=t\\y&=u\\z&=f(t,u)\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d1f93d014e3ff1a6b8284ed13babc697ad0e9aa4)
Every point of this surface is [regular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_point "Regular point"), as the two first columns of the Jacobian matrix form the [identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix") of rank two.

A **rational surface** is a surface that may be parametrized by [rational functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_functions "Rational functions") of two variables. That is, if _f i_(_t_, _u_) are, for _i_ = 0, 1, 2, 3, [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") in two indeterminates, then the parametric surface, defined by

![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&={\frac {f_{1}(t,u)}{f_{0}(t,u)}},\\[6pt]y&={\frac {f_{2}(t,u)}{f_{0}(t,u)}},\\[6pt]z&={\frac {f_{3}(t,u)}{f_{0}(t,u)}}\,,\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5c01e381d880542b94aba3160c5d11c339b46e15)
is a rational surface.

A rational surface is an [algebraic surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface "Algebraic surface"), but most algebraic surfaces are not rational.

An implicit surface in a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") (or, more generally, in an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space")) of dimension 3 is the set of the common zeros of a [differentiable function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function") of three variables

![Image 11: {\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73bb361249d50b3d1b54bb7b834c72b2313bf263)
Implicit means that the equation defines implicitly one of the variables as a function of the other variables. This is made more exact by the [implicit function theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem "Implicit function theorem"): if _f_(_x_ 0, _y_ 0, _z_ 0) = 0, and the partial derivative in z of f is not zero at (_x_ 0, _y_ 0, _z_ 0), then there exists a differentiable function _φ_(_x_, _y_) such that

![Image 12: {\displaystyle f(x,y,\varphi (x,y))=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cfb88fad3d86ec00dfa65a6288322526c94ad35f)
in a [neighbourhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)") of (_x_ 0, _y_ 0, _z_ 0). In other words, the implicit surface is the [graph of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") near a point of the surface where the partial derivative in z is nonzero. An implicit surface has thus, locally, a parametric representation, except at the points of the surface where the three partial derivatives are zero.

### Regular points and tangent plane

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Regular points and tangent plane")]

A point of the surface where at least one partial derivative of f is nonzero is called **regular**. At such a point ![Image 13: {\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39177ddeeb9f9a393b664e522bc8e3bf0face153), the tangent plane and the direction of the normal are well defined, and may be deduced, with the implicit function theorem from the definition given above, in [§Tangent plane and normal vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#Tangent_plane_and_normal_vector). The direction of the normal is the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient"), that is the vector

![Image 14: {\displaystyle \left[{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}),{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}),{\frac {\partial f}{\partial z}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})\right].}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9b93753ba36c47db43d602f08750ff6c02d8d208)
The tangent plane is defined by its implicit equation

![Image 15: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})(x-x_{0})+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})(y-y_{0})+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial z}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})(z-z_{0})=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/485400d3ef3385aab9d7f6262b588134312152f7)
A **singular point** of an implicit surface (in ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5)) is a point of the surface where the implicit equation holds and the three partial derivatives of its defining function are all zero. Therefore, the singular points are the solutions of a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_equations "Simultaneous equations") of four equations in three indeterminates. As most such systems have no solution, many surfaces do not have any singular point. A surface with no singular point is called _regular_ or _non-singular_.

The study of surfaces near their singular points and the classification of the singular points is [singularity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_theory "Singularity theory"). A singular point is [isolated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_singularity "Isolated singularity") if there is no other singular point in a neighborhood of it. Otherwise, the singular points may form a curve. This is in particular the case for self-crossing surfaces.

Originally, an algebraic surface was a surface which could be defined by an implicit equation

![Image 17: {\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2ae769b413860f6ae5461aae7ade41b990332f1b)
where _f_ is a polynomial in three [indeterminates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminate_(variable) "Indeterminate (variable)"), with real coefficients.

The concept has been extended in several directions, by defining surfaces over arbitrary [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), and by considering surfaces in spaces of arbitrary dimension or in [projective spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space"). Abstract algebraic surfaces, which are not explicitly embedded in another space, are also considered.

### Surfaces over arbitrary fields

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Surfaces over arbitrary fields")]

Polynomials with coefficients in any [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") are accepted for defining an algebraic surface. However, the field of coefficients of a polynomial is not well defined, as, for example, a polynomial with [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") coefficients may also be considered as a polynomial with [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") or [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") coefficients. Therefore, the concept of _point_ of the surface has been generalized in the following way.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-2)[_[page needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_]

Given a polynomial _f_(_x_, _y_, _z_), let _k_ be the smallest field containing the coefficients, and _K_ be an [algebraically closed extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_extension "Algebraically closed extension") of _k_, of infinite [transcendence degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_degree "Transcendence degree").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-3) Then a _point_ of the surface is an element of _K_ 3 which is a solution of the equation

![Image 18: {\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73bb361249d50b3d1b54bb7b834c72b2313bf263)
If the polynomial has real coefficients, the field _K_ is the [complex field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_field "Complex field"), and a point of the surface that belongs to ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) (a usual point) is called a _real point_. A point that belongs to _k_ 3 is called _rational over k_, or simply a _rational point_, if _k_ is the field of [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number").

A **projective surface** in a [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space") of dimension three is the set of points whose [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates "Homogeneous coordinates") are zeros of a single [homogeneous polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial "Homogeneous polynomial") in four variables. More generally, a projective surface is a subset of a projective space, which is a [projective variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_variety "Projective variety") of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety "Dimension of an algebraic variety") two.

Projective surfaces are strongly related to affine surfaces (that is, ordinary algebraic surfaces). One passes from a projective surface to the corresponding affine surface by setting to one some coordinate or indeterminate of the defining polynomials (usually the last one). Conversely, one passes from an affine surface to its associated projective surface (called _projective completion_) by [homogenizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial#Homogenization "Homogeneous polynomial") the defining polynomial (in case of surfaces in a space of dimension three), or by homogenizing all polynomials of the defining ideal (for surfaces in a space of higher dimension).

### In higher dimensional spaces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: In higher dimensional spaces")]

One cannot define the concept of an algebraic surface in a space of dimension higher than three without a general definition of an [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") and of the [dimension of an algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety "Dimension of an algebraic variety"). In fact, an algebraic surface is an _algebraic variety of dimension two_.

More precisely, an algebraic surface in a space of dimension n is the set of the common zeros of at least _n_ – 2 polynomials, but these polynomials must satisfy further conditions that may be not immediate to verify. Firstly, the polynomials must not define a variety or an [algebraic set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_set "Algebraic set") of higher dimension, which is typically the case if one of the polynomials is in the [ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)") generated by the others. Generally, _n_ – 2 polynomials define an algebraic set of dimension two or higher. If the dimension is two, the algebraic set may have several [irreducible components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_component "Irreducible component"). If there is only one component the _n_ – 2 polynomials define a surface, which is a [complete intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_intersection "Complete intersection"). If there are several components, then one needs further polynomials for selecting a specific component.

Most authors consider as an algebraic surface only algebraic varieties of dimension two, but some also consider as surfaces all algebraic sets whose irreducible components have the dimension two.

In the case of surfaces in a space of dimension three, every surface is a complete intersection, and a surface is defined by a single polynomial, which is [irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_polynomial "Irreducible polynomial") or not, depending on whether non-irreducible algebraic sets of dimension two are considered as surfaces or not.

Topological surface
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Topological surface")]

In [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"), a surface is generally defined as a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") of dimension two. This means that a topological surface is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") such that every point has a [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_(mathematics) "Neighborhood (mathematics)") that is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") to an [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_subset "Open subset") of a [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane").

Every topological surface is homeomorphic to a [polyhedral surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedral_surface "Polyhedral surface") such that all [facets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facet_(geometry) "Facet (geometry)") are [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle"). The [combinatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics") study of such arrangements of triangles (or, more generally, of higher-dimensional [simplexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex "Simplex")) is the starting object of [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology"). This allows the characterization of the properties of surfaces in terms of purely algebraic [invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)"), such as the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_(mathematics) "Genus (mathematics)") and [homology groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_group "Homology group").

The homeomorphism classes of surfaces have been completely described (see [Surface (topology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)")).

Differentiable surface

[Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") in 1828

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the [differential geometry of surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces "Differential geometry of surfaces") deals with the [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") of [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold")[surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)")[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-4) with various additional structures, most often, a [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric").[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-5)

Surfaces have been extensively studied from various perspectives: _extrinsically_, relating to their [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") in [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") and _intrinsically_, reflecting their properties determined solely by the distance within the surface as measured along curves on the surface. One of the fundamental concepts investigated is the [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature"), first studied in depth by [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGauss1902-6) who showed that curvature was an intrinsic property of a surface, independent of its [isometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry") embedding in Euclidean space.

Surfaces naturally arise as [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") of a pair of [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)"), and sometimes appear in parametric form or as [loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") associated to [space curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve#Definitions "Curve"). An important role in their study has been played by [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") (in the spirit of the [Erlangen program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program "Erlangen program")), namely the [symmetry groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_group "Symmetry group") of the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane"), the [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") and the [hyperbolic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_plane "Hyperbolic plane"). These Lie groups can be used to describe surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature; they also provide an essential ingredient in the modern approach to intrinsic differential geometry through [connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics) "Connection (mathematics)"). On the other hand, extrinsic properties relying on an embedding of a surface in Euclidean space have also been extensively studied. This is well illustrated by the non-linear [Euler–Lagrange equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equations "Euler–Lagrange equations") in the [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations "Calculus of variations"): although Euler developed the one variable equations to understand [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics "Geodesics"), defined independently of an embedding, one of Lagrange's main applications of the two variable equations was to [minimal surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surfaces "Minimal surfaces"), a concept that can only be defined in terms of an embedding.

[![Image 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Animated_fractal_mountain.gif/330px-Animated_fractal_mountain.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Animated_fractal_mountain.gif)

Use of [triangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle")[fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal") to create a mountainous terrain.

A [fractal landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_landscape "Fractal landscape") or fractal surface is generated using a [stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic "Stochastic") algorithm designed to produce [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal") behavior that mimics the appearance of natural [terrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain "Terrain"). In other words, the [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface "Surface") resulting from the procedure is not a deterministic, but rather a random surface that exhibits fractal behavior.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-7)

Many natural phenomena exhibit some form of statistical [self-similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity "Self-similarity") that can be modeled by [fractal surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension#Fractal_surface_structures "Fractal dimension").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-Fractal_landscape_Cham-8) Moreover, variations in [surface texture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_texture "Surface texture") provide important visual cues to the orientation and slopes of surfaces, and the use of almost self-similar fractal patterns can help create natural looking visual effects.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-9) The modeling of the Earth's rough surfaces via [fractional Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Brownian_motion "Fractional Brownian motion") was first proposed by [Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot "Benoit Mandelbrot").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-10)

Because the intended result of the process is to produce a landscape, rather than a mathematical function, processes are frequently applied to such landscapes that may affect the [stationarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process "Stationary process") and even the overall [fractal behavior of such a surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension#Fractal_surface_structures "Fractal dimension"), in the interests of producing a more convincing landscape.

According to [R. R. Shearer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhonda_Roland_Shearer "Rhonda Roland Shearer"), the generation of natural looking surfaces and landscapes was a major turning point in art history, where the distinction between geometric, [computer generated images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_generated_imagery "Computer generated imagery") and natural, man made art became blurred.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-11) The first use of a fractal-generated landscape in a film was in 1982 for the movie _[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Trek\_II:\_The\_Wrath\_of\_Khan "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan")_. [Loren Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Carpenter "Loren Carpenter") refined the techniques of Mandelbrot to create an alien landscape.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-Fractal_landscape_ftpoc-12)
