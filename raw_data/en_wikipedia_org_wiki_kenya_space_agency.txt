It was established in 2017 as the successor to the National Space Secretariat (NSS).

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] In 1964, Kenya and Italy collaborated to establish a satellite launching and tracking base in Malindi , the Broglio Space Center . From 1967 to 1989 over 20 sounding rockets and 9 rockets were launched from the Broglio Space Center. The facility is currently jointly managed and operated through a collaborative and enduring partnership with the Italian Space Agency , also known as Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI). The Malindi Space Centre currently provides Tracking, Telemetry and Command (TT&C) Services to a number of customers, including NASA, SpaceX, European Space Agency and CNES, among others.

Besides TT&C services, the Malindi Space Centre, through support from the Italian Space Agency, is also establishing a Centre for Earth Observation and Remote Sensing.

Until 2009 Kenya did not have a space programme of its own. That changed with the formal installation of the National Space Secretariat (NSS) under the wing of the Ministry for Defence .

[ 2 ] The NSS facilitated the development of the Kenya Space Policy 2016, Kenya Space Strategy 2016 and the Kenya Space Agency Order 2017.

The Kenya Space Agency (KSA) was established through Legal Notice No. 22 of 7 March 2017 with the mandate to promote, coordinate and regulate all Space-related activities in the country. The headquarters of the Agency is in Nairobi. The inaugural Board of Directors of the Agency was inaugurated by the Cabinet Secretary, Defence on 11 September 2018. The Executive Order No. 1 of 2023 placed the Agency under the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

Satellites launched [ edit ] While there have been many launches by the Italian Space Agency using the Broglio Space Center until 1989, KSA launched its own satellites much later.

1KUNS-PF [ edit ] The 1KUNS-PF is a CubeSat and was the first Kenyan-owned satellite to be launched into space in 2018.

[ 3 ] The 1KUNS-PF was an experimental cubesat, with the main mission being to create awareness to the locals on the benefits of space uses. On board the cubesat, there were camera payloads, which were used to take mapping images of Kenya and other East Africa countries within the vicinity of its orbit. The cubesat was designed to have a lifespan of one year and its operations were within the UN space use mitigation measures. 1KUNS-PF deorbited in June 2020.

TAIFA-1 [ edit ] The TAIFA-1 satellite is an earth observation 3U CubeSat , and was launched on 14 April 2023 [ 4 ] together with Exolaunch aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9 . It is the first satellite launched by KSA that was purely developed by Kenyan engineers with training provided by EnduroSat .

[ 5 ] [ 4 ] The word "taifa" is Swahili meaning "one nation".

[ 6 ] Research Grants [ edit ] The Kenya Space Agency offers research grants to promote advancements in Space Science and Technology within local universities. Recent initiatives include grants for projects such as Small-Scale Crop Mapping using AI/ML and Nanosatellite Development, with funding such as Ksh 2.5 million (approximately USD 22,292) designated for these projects.

The Research Grant programme aims to catalyse and promote research in Space Science and Technology at Kenya’s local universities, as well as build the technical capacity in these disciplines, which will contribute towards Kenya’s socio-economic development by building linkages between academia and the industry.

Kenya Space Expo and Conference (KSEC) [ edit ] The Kenya Space Expo and Conference is a biennial event organized by the Kenya Space Agency (KSA) to promote the understanding and utilization of space science, technology, and applications for socio-economic development and societal benefits. The event serves as a platform to enhance awareness of the opportunities in space exploration and exploitation, fostering discussions on how space technologies can address societal challenges and contribute to national development.

History and Purpose [ edit ] The inaugural Kenya Space Expo and Conference was held from 15 to 17 June 2022 in Nairobi, Kenya, under the theme "Leveraging Space Capabilities for National Development." The event has since established itself as a significant forum for engaging stakeholders in Africa's space sector, including government representatives, policymakers, academia, industry professionals, international organizations, and the general public.

[ 7 ] The second edition of the Kenya Space Expo and Conference was held from 18 to 20 June 2024 with the aim to further enhance awareness of the utility of space opportunities through the showcasing of successful use cases and innovations. Under the theme "Space Technologies for Societal Benefits," it underscored the potential of space technologies to address socio-economic challenges, support sustainable development, and drive national progress.

[ 8 ] Structure and Activities [ edit ] The Expo and Conference features: Keynote speeches by leading experts and policymakers.

Panel discussions and expert presentations on critical topics in the space sector.

Plenary sessions focused on global and regional space trends.

Exhibitions showcasing innovations, projects, and applications in space science and technology.

Thematic Areas [ edit ] The event covers a wide range of thematic areas, including: Earth Observation Applications Space Science Space Systems Engineering Space Policy, Legal, and Regulatory Framework Value Proposition [ edit ] The Kenya Space Expo and Conference provides a unique opportunity for diverse participants to engage in conversations centered around utilizing space applications for societal benefits. It fosters collaboration, encourages innovation, and highlights the transformative potential of space technologies in areas such as agriculture, urban planning, disaster management, and natural resource management.

Significance [ edit ] As a key event in the African space landscape, the Kenya Space Expo and Conference has become a platform for showcasing the continent's growing contributions to global space exploration and technology development. It aligns with the Kenya Space Agency’s mission to leverage space science and technology for national development while promoting regional and international partnerships.

Space Club & Outreach Activities [ edit ] The Kenya Space Agency (KSA) undertakes several initiatives to nurture and support the growth of the country's indigenous space sector. Of particular focus is the need to nurture and grow research and expand opportunities in the space science sector in Kenya. In this regard, the Agency is involved in a number programmes that promote Geography, Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics (Geo-STEAM) at all levels of education and training.

The Space Club was founded in September 2020 as an educative programme established by the KSA Education and Outreach Department. It involves interactive scientific activities, competitions and learning sessions with learners in various learning institutions around the country with the aim of educating the next generation on GEO-STEAM and the significance of these subjects in supporting the space industry.

The club prioritized the following four areas that support the country's growing space sector: Earth observation (EO).

Space Science and Astronomy (SSA).

Information technology (IT).

Space Systems Engineering (SSE).

The primary objective of Space Club is to educate, nurture and inspire learners with aspirations for the space ecosystem. By imparting knowledge on different elements pertaining to space, the club seeks to broaden and enhance the quality of education for learners and therefore allow them to understand and actively pursue the opportunities that the universe holds for them.
