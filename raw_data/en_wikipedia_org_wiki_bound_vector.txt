[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is typically formulated as the product of a unit of measurement and a vector numerical value ( unitless ), often a Euclidean vector with magnitude and direction .
For example, a position vector in physical space may be expressed as three Cartesian coordinates with SI unit of meters .

In physics and engineering , particularly in mechanics , a physical vector may be endowed with additional structure compared to a geometrical vector.

[ 3 ] A bound vector is defined as the combination of an ordinary vector quantity and a point of application or point of action .

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] Bound vector quantities are formulated as a directed line segment , with a definite initial point besides the magnitude and direction of the main vector.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] For example, a force on the Euclidean plane has two Cartesian components in SI unit of newtons and an accompanying two-dimensional position vector in meters, for a total of four numbers on the plane (and six in space).

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 4 ] A simpler example of a bound vector is the translation vector from an initial point to an end point; in this case, the bound vector is an ordered pair of points in the same position space, with all coordinates having the same quantity dimension and unit (length an meters).

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] A sliding vector is the combination of an ordinary vector quantity and a line of application or line of action , over which the vector quantity can be translated (without rotations).
A free vector is a vector quantity having an undefined support or region of application; it can be freely translated with no consequences; a displacement vector is a prototypical example of free vector.

Aside from the notion of units and support, physical vector quantities may also differ from Euclidean vectors in terms of metric .
For example, an event in spacetime may be represented as a position four-vector , with coherent derived unit of meters: it includes a position Euclidean vector and a timelike component, t ⋅ c 0 (involving the speed of light ).
In that case, the Minkowski metric is adopted instead of the Euclidean metric .

Vector quantities are a generalization of scalar quantities and can be further generalized as tensor quantities .

[ 8 ] Individual vectors may be ordered in a sequence over time (a time series ), such as position vectors discretizing a trajectory .
A vector may also result from the evaluation , at a particular instant, of a continuous vector-valued function (e.g., the pendulum equation ).
In the natural sciences, the term "vector quantity" also encompasses vector fields defined over a two- or three-dimensional region of space, such as wind velocity over Earth's surface.

Pseudo vectors and bivectors are also admitted as physical vector quantities.
