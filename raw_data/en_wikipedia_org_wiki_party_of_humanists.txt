[ 4 ] It is considered left-of-centre and supports socially liberal and secular policies, such as a federal European state , openness towards technologies such as stem cell research and strict separation between state and religion.

[ 5 ] The party contested the 2017 and 2021 federal elections, the 2019 European elections and numerous state elections from 2018 onwards. It also contested the 2024 European Parliament election in Germany .

[ 6 ] History [ edit ] In spring 2012, the Facebook group "Initiative Humanismus" created the "Manifesto of the Initiative Humanismus", which was to serve as the basis for a humanist party. The Party of Humanists was founded on the basis of this document on 4 October 2014 in Berlin .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The provisional executive committee consisted of eight spokespersons for various subject areas.

[ 9 ] At the first ordinary federal party conference in March 2015, David Helmus was elected as the party's first chairman.

[ 10 ] Beka Kobaidze served as secretary general, while Ioana Hauke took over as treasurer. According to the chairman, the party had around 75 members in September of the same year.

[ 11 ] The Berlin regional association was founded on 2 April 2016.

[ 12 ] A few months later, the regional associations of Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Württemberg were founded.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Shortly afterwards, in February of the following year, the Bavarian state association was also founded.

[ 15 ] On 21 March 2017, the Party held a joint press conference along with the Pirate Party Germany , the Liberal Democrats , the New Liberals , the Transhuman Party Germany , and the youth organization of The Left to announce a "social-liberal proclamation" and better cooperation among the participating organizations.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] In the 2017 German federal election , the Humanist Party took part in an election for the first time, although it was initially only electable in North Rhine-Westphalia . For this purpose, various teams were set up within the party, which now has around 600 members, for internal party organisation.

[ 21 ] In the election, the party received 5.991 second votes.

[ 22 ] After the federal election, the party received an influx of new members. As a result, state associations were founded in Hamburg and Lower Saxony in the same year, as well as state associations in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Rhineland-Palatinate, Bremen and Schleswig-Holstein in 2018.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] In January 2019, Steven Pinker was accepted onto the advisory board of the Humanist Party. One month later, in February 2019, Michael Shermer , founder of the American Skeptics Society , also became a member of the advisory board.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] The Humanist Party was registered for the European elections on 15 March 2019, in which it took part with its lead candidate Robin Thiedmann. It achieved 0.2% of 62,604 votes, but missed out on a place in the European Parliament.

[ 27 ] In 2021, the last four state associations, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Thuringia and Saarland were founded.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] Shortly after the founding of the Brandenburg state association, the party celebrated its new size of 1800 members.

[ 30 ] In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first digital federal party conference was held on 29 January and 20 February 2022.

In April 2023, 19-year-old Lasse Schäfer was elected as the new national chairman. This makes him the youngest party chairman in Germany.

[ 31 ] Party platform [ edit ] The underlying ideology is evolutionary humanism .

[ 32 ] The core themes of the Humanist Party are science and education, the right of self-determination of the individual, and secularization .

[ 33 ] For example, the party supports the liberal and self-responsible use of drugs, [ 34 ] supports legal voluntary euthanasia [ 35 ] [ 36 ] and is against circumcision of children.

[ 37 ] The party also supports the implementation of universal basic income .

[ 33 ] The party is considered left of the political centre .

[ 3 ] Currently, the Party of Humanists is the only party in Germany that specifically targets non-religious people, freethinkers , and atheists as voters.
