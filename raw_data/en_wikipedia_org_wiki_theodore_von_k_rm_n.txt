**Theodore von Kármán** ([Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language "Hungarian language"): _([szőllőskislaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%C5%91l%C5%91skislak "Szőlőskislak")) Kármán Tódor_[[(søːløːʃkiʃlɒki)ˈkaːrmaːn ˈtoːdor]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Hungarian "Help:IPA/Hungarian"), May 11, 1881– May 6, 1963) was a Hungarian-American [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician"), [aerospace engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineer "Aerospace engineer"), and [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist") who worked in [aeronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautics "Aeronautics") and [astronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics "Astronautics"). He was responsible for crucial advances in [aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics") characterizing [supersonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic "Supersonic") and [hypersonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic "Hypersonic") airflow. The human-defined threshold of outer space is named the "[Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line")" in recognition of his work.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-3) Kármán is regarded as an outstanding aerodynamic theoretician of the 20th century.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-6)

Theodore von Kármán was born into a [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish "Jewish") family in [Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest "Budapest"), then part of [Austria-Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary"), as Kármán Tódor, the son of Helene (Konn or Kohn, [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language "Hungarian language"): _Kohn Ilka_) and [Mór Kármán](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=M%C3%B3r_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mór Kármán (page does not exist)")[[eo](https://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B3r_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n "eo:Mór Kármán")].[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-frs-1) Among his ancestors were [Rabbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi "Rabbi")[Judah Loew ben Bezalel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel "Judah Loew ben Bezalel"), who was said to be the creator of the [Golem of Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem#The_classic_narrative:_The_Golem_of_Prague "Golem"), and Rabbi [Moses Kunitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Kunitz_(rabbi) "Moses Kunitz (rabbi)"), who wrote about [Zohar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zohar "Zohar").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-frs-1) His father, Mór, was a well-known educator, who reformed the Hungarian school system and founded [Minta Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minta_Gymnasium "Minta Gymnasium") in Budapest. He became an influential figure and became a commissioner of the Ministry of Education,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-7) and was responsible for "planning an education of a young archduke, the Emperor's cousin". In 1907 Mór Karman was ennobled, Theodore later described it:[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-rhodes-8)

> To receive a predicate of nobility, my father had to be landed. Fortunately he owned a small vineyard near Budapest, so the Emperor bestowed upon him the predicate "von Szőllőskislaki" (small grape). I have shortened it to von, for even to me, a Hungarian, the full title is almost unpronounceable.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-rhodes-8)

Theodore had three brothers (among them [Elemér Kármán](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elem%C3%A9r_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n&action=edit&redlink=1 "Elemér Kármán (page does not exist)")[[eo](https://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elem%C3%A9r_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n "eo:Elemér Kármán")]) and one sister, [Josephine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_de_Karman "Josephine de Karman"). At age six, he could "perform large mental calculations",[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-mathshistory-9) for example multiplication of six-digit numbers.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-rhodes-8) Father discouraged Theodore's mathematical education, he was afraid that his son would be a [child prodigy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy "Child prodigy") and a freak.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-mathshistory-9) He was tutored by his father and his father's former student; later he entered the Minta Gymnasium in Budapest. He won [Eötvös Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s_Prize&action=edit&redlink=1 "Eötvös Prize (page does not exist)") "for the best student in mathematics and science in the whole of Hungary" in his last year at Minta.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-mathshistory-9)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-11)

He studied engineering at the city's Royal Joseph Technical University ([Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_University_of_Technology_and_Economics "Budapest University of Technology and Economics")). He graduated in 1902 with a degree in mechanical engineering, his thesis was "The motion of a heavy rod supported on its rounded end by a horizontal plane". He then served a year as an artillery cadet in the Austro-Hungarian army.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-mathshistory-9) In 1903-1906 he worked as an assistant at the Royal Joseph Technical University. In 1906 he moved to the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire") and joined [Ludwig Prandtl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Prandtl "Ludwig Prandtl") at the [University of Göttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen "University of Göttingen"), where he received his doctorate in 1908, for his research on "mathematical models for the buckling of large structures".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-mathshistory-9) He taught at Göttingen for four years. In 1913 he accepted a position as director of the Aeronautical Institute at [RWTH Aachen University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWTH_Aachen_University "RWTH Aachen University"), a leading German university. His time at RWTH Aachen was interrupted by service in the [Austro-Hungarian Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Army "Austro-Hungarian Army") from 1915 to 1918, during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), when he designed the [Petróczy-Kármán-Žurovec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr%C3%B3czy-K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n-%C5%BDurovec "Petróczy-Kármán-Žurovec"), an early [helicopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter "Helicopter").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-mathshistory-9)

After the war, in 1919, he returned to Aachen with his mother and sister Josephine. Some of his students took an interest in [gliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliding "Gliding") and saw the competitions of the [Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh%C3%B6n-Rossitten_Gesellschaft "Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft") as an opportunity to advance in aeronautics. Kármán engaged [Wolfgang Klemperer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Klemperer "Wolfgang Klemperer") to design a competitive glider.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-TvK-12)

Josephine encouraged her brother Theodore to expand his science beyond national boundaries. They organized the first international conference in [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics") held in September 1922 in [Innsbruck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innsbruck "Innsbruck"). Subsequent conferences were organized as the [International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Theoretical_and_Applied_Mechanics "International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-13)

In 1926, Karman was first invited to the USA by the [California Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology "California Institute of Technology") to build a [wind tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_tunnel "Wind tunnel").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-Sears-14)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-mathshistory-9) In 1930 he was invited for a position of a full-time director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at California Institute of Technology ([GALCIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GALCIT "GALCIT")); his mother and sister, Josephine, also moved to California.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-mathshistory-9)

Von Kármán (center) during his work at the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory "Jet Propulsion Laboratory") in 1940

Apprehensive about developments in Europe regarding [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism"), in 1930 Kármán accepted the directorship of the [Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guggenheim_Aeronautical_Laboratory "Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory") at the [California Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology "California Institute of Technology") (GALCIT).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-Sears-14) The directorship included provision for a [research assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_assistant "Research assistant"), and he selected [Frank Wattendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wattendorf "Frank Wattendorf"), an American who had been studying for three years in Aachen.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-Thomas-15)

Another student [Ernest Edwin Sechler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Edwin_Sechler "Ernest Edwin Sechler") took up the problem of making reliable [airframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airframe "Airframe") for aircraft, and with Kármán's support, developed an understanding of [aeroelasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroelasticity "Aeroelasticity").

The US Army Air Force wanted Caltech to manufacture JATO rockets, but Caltech was not interested in operating an industry. In 1936, Kármán engaged the legal services of [Andrew G. Haley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_G._Haley "Andrew G. Haley") to form the [Aerojet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerojet "Aerojet") Corporation, with his graduate student [Frank Malina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Malina "Frank Malina") and their experimental rocketry collaborators [Jack Parsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Parsons "Jack Parsons") and [Edward Forman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Forman "Edward Forman") to manufacture [JATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JATO "JATO") rocket motors. Kármán later became a [naturalized citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalization "Naturalization") of the United States.

In 1940, Kármán was selected by [John M. Carmody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Carmody "John M. Carmody"), Administrator of the Federal Works Agency to be on the Board of Engineers tasked with investigating the November 7, 1940, collapse of the [Tacoma Narrows Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940) "Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)") outside [Tacoma, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington "Tacoma, Washington"). His expertise was instrumental in discovering the effect of aerodynamic forces on the bridge, causing its unusual "galloping" behavior and eventual collapse. Along with Civil Engineers [Othmar Amman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othmar_Ammann "Othmar Ammann") and [Glenn B. Woodruff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_B._Woodruff "Glenn B. Woodruff"), he published the report "The Failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge"[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-16) on March 28, 1941.

German activity during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") increased US military interest in rocket research. In early 1943, the Experimental Engineering Division of the [United States Army Air Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces "United States Army Air Forces") Material Command forwarded to Kármán reports from British intelligence sources describing German rockets capable of travelling more than 100 miles (160 km). In a letter dated August 2, 1943, Kármán provided the Army with his analysis of and comments on the German program.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-17)

In 1944 he and others affiliated with GALCIT founded the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory "Jet Propulsion Laboratory") (JPL), which is now a [federally funded research and development center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally_funded_research_and_development_center "Federally funded research and development center") managed and operated by Caltech under a contract from [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA"). In 1946 he became the first chairman of the [Scientific Advisory Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Advisory_Group "Scientific Advisory Group") which studied aeronautical technologies for the United States Army Air Forces. He also helped found [AGARD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGARD "AGARD"), the [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") aerodynamics research oversight group (1951), the [International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Council_of_the_Aeronautical_Sciences "International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences") (1956), the [International Academy of Astronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Academy_of_Astronautics "International Academy of Astronautics") (1960), and the [Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Karman_Institute_for_Fluid_Dynamics "Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics") in [Sint-Genesius-Rode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint-Genesius-Rode "Sint-Genesius-Rode"), south of [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels "Brussels") (1956).

He eventually became an important figure in supersonic motion, noting in a seminal paper that aeronautical engineers were "pounding hard on the closed door leading into the field of supersonic motion."[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-18)

In June 1944, von Kármán underwent surgery for [intestinal cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer "Colorectal cancer") in New York City. The surgery caused two [hernias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia "Hernia"), and Kármán's recovery was slow. Early in September, while still in New York, he met US Army Air Forces Commanding General [Henry H. Arnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_H._Arnold "Henry H. Arnold") on a runway at [LaGuardia Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaGuardia_Airport "LaGuardia Airport"), and Arnold then proposed that Kármán should move to Washington, D.C., to lead the Scientific Advisory Group and become a long-range planning consultant to the military. Kármán returned to [Pasadena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California "Pasadena, California") around mid-September, was appointed to the SAG position on October 23, 1944, and left Caltech in December 1944.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-19)

At the age of 81 Kármán was the recipient of the first [National Medal of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal_of_Science "National Medal of Science"), bestowed in a [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House") ceremony by President [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "John F. Kennedy"). He was recognized, "For his leadership in the science and engineering basic to aeronautics; for his effective teaching and related contributions in many fields of mechanics, for his distinguished counsel to the Armed Services, and for his promoting international cooperation in science and engineering."[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-20)

Kármán never married. He died on a trip to Aachen, [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany "West Germany"), in 1963, five days short of his 82nd birthday,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-21) and his body was returned to the United States to be entombed in the Beth Olam Mausoleum at what is now the [Hollywood Forever Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Forever_Cemetery "Hollywood Forever Cemetery").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-22) He has sometimes been described as one of [The Martians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martians_(scientists) "The Martians (scientists)").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-23)

Kármán's fame was in the use of mathematical tools to study [fluid flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"),[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-24) and the interpretation of those results to guide practical designs. He was instrumental in recognizing the importance of [swept-back wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swept_wing "Swept wing") ubiquitous in modern [jet aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft "Jet aircraft").

Four years after Kármán died his [autobiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobiography "Autobiography")_The Wind and Beyond_ was published by Lee Edson with [Little, Brown and Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little,_Brown_and_Company "Little, Brown and Company"). Seven major [academic journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal "Academic journal") then followed with [book reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_review "Book review") by noted authors: As the book was non-technical, written for the general reader, [Thomas P. Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_P._Hughes_(historian) "Thomas P. Hughes (historian)")[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-25) cited that as problematic given the technical context of Kármán's work. Hughes conceded that Kármán "exhibited a genius for finding the simplifying assumptions that made possible the mathematical analysis." While acknowledging Kármán's gifts as an applied mathematician and teacher, [Stanley Corrsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Corrsin "Stanley Corrsin") points out that the autobiography is "marriage between a man and his ego." In the later part of his life, Kármán was a "planner of global symposia and societies" and a "consultant to the upper echelons of the Pentagon corps."[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-26)

On [creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity "Creativity"), Kármán wrote "the finest creative thought comes not out of organized teams but out of the quiet of one's own world."[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-TvK-12): 307  In his review[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-27) I. B. Holley noted "penetrating insights into the creative process, its ingredients, nurture and exploitation." According to Holley, Kármán was given to "convivial drinking and the company of beautiful women."

An enthusiastic review by J. Kestin[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-28) advised readers to buy and study the book, and prize it as a reference. On the other hand, Charles Süsskind[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-29) faults Kármán for his contempt for the conventional (gaminarie). Süsskind expected the book to show some reaction to [Wernher von Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun "Wernher von Braun")'s coming to America, and some clarification of the [Hsue-shen Tsien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsue-shen_Tsien "Hsue-shen Tsien") affair, rather than "lapses into generalities". Süsskind also tags Kármán as a [militarist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarist "Militarist"): a "forthright engineer who is quite unabashed about his lifelong association with military authorities in whatever country he happened to reside at the time."

[Sydney Goldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Goldstein "Sydney Goldstein"), who also wrote the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society") memoir for Kármán, reviewed the autobiography[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-30) and remembered "an eminent engineer and scientist, warm-hearted and witty, much traveled, well-known by many, devoted to international collaboration, who, in his own words, as a scientist found the military 'the most comfortable group to deal with'".

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_ref-11)**von Karman's own recollections about the prize and competition: "Selected students were kept in a closed room and given difficult mathematics problems, which demanded creative and even daring thinking. The teacher of the pupil who won the prize would gain great distinction, so the competition was keen and teachers worked hard to prepare their best students. I tried out for this prize against students of great attainments, and to my delight I managed to win. Now, I note that more than half of all the famous expatriate Hungarian scientists, and almost all the well-known ones in the United States, have won this prize."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n#cite_note-Gymnasium-10)
