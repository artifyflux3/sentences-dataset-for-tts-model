It operates as a pan-European umbrella for subsidiary parties sharing the same name and branding.

Volt aligns its political positions across Europe, presenting a common, pan-European manifesto. In the 2019 European Parliament elections , Volt ran in eight member states with a shared platform, emphasising solutions to supranational challenges, such as climate change, defense, energy policy, migration, economic inequality, terrorism, welfare, and the technological evolution of the labor market. The party advocates for a stronger, more integrated European Union , with the long-term goal of creating a federal Europe.

[ 9 ] Additionally, Volt endorses the formation of a European army , joint European debt and taxes, nuclear energy including the construction of new nuclear power plants, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] and stronger economic solidarity between the EU member states.

Initially using the slogan "Neither left nor right", Volt is now generally perceived as centrist [ 5 ] [ 6 ] or centre-left , with a core focus on evidence-based policy and best-practice sharing among EU countries and municipalities.

[ 12 ] It campaigns on these principles in both local and national elections.

Founded in March 2017, Volt's first national subsidiary party was established in Hamburg , Germany, a year later. Since then, Volt has developed local teams in all EU member states, as well as in non-EU countries like Albania , Switzerland , Kosovo , Ukraine , and the United Kingdom . Volt subsidiaries are now registered political parties in many of these countries, most recently expanding to Cyprus and Romania .

Despite its organisation and being referred to as a "European party" or "transnational party", Volt does not yet meet the requirements to register as a European political party .

[ 13 ] History [ edit ] This section needs to be updated .

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

( June 2024 ) Foundation [ edit ] National sections of Volt Europa. The borders of the European Union are shown in red.

Volt Europa was founded on 29 March 2017 by Andrea Venzon , Colombe Cahen-Salvador, and Damian Boeselager , on the same day that the United Kingdom formally announced its intention to leave the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union .

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] According to their own statement, Volt's foundation was a reaction to growing populism in the world as well as to Brexit .

[ 17 ] [ 15 ] Venzon became founding President, Boeselager Vice President, and Cahen-Salvador policy lead.

[ 18 ] [ 15 ] 2019 European Parliament election [ edit ] European elections 2019 promo by Volt Netherlands, May 2019 Damian Boeselager , Volt's first Member of the European Parliament Between 27 and 28 October 2018, Volt Europa hosted its General Assembly meeting in Amsterdam , agreeing its Amsterdam Declaration, which also served as its manifesto programme for the European Parliament elections.

[ 19 ] The party previously gathered in Berlin, Bucharest, and Paris.

Between 22 and 24 March 2019, Volt Europa hosted its first European Congress in Rome, [ 20 ] presenting its candidates for the 2019 European Parliament election . The keynote speakers list included Paolo Gentiloni (former Prime Minister of Italy and President of the Italian Democratic Party ), Emma Bonino (Italian senator and former European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety ), Enrico Giovannini (former Italian Government minister), Marcella Panucci (Director General of the General Confederation of Italian Industry ), Sandro Gozi (President of the Union of European Federalists ) and Antonio Navarra (President of the Mediterranean Center for Climate Change).

During the European Parliament elections in May 2019 , the party won one seat by winning 0.7 percent of votes in Germany, with Damian Boeselager its first Member of the European Parliament .

[ 21 ] On 9 June 2019, following a pan-European vote of party members, Volt elected to join the Greens–European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament.

[ 22 ] In the future, Volt hopes to be able to form its own political group in the European Parliament, which would require a minimum of 25 MEPs from at least seven different member states.

Election of new board and first pan-European digital assembly [ edit ] Reinier van Lanschot , Volt Europa's co-president 2019–2023 From 12 to 13 October 2019, Volt Europa hosted its general assembly in Sofia to elect the new board of Volt Europa. While Volt up to that point had been an ASBL non-profit with only few registered members, based in Luxembourg, it was transformed into an international non-profit organization (AISBL) according to Belgian law.

[ 23 ] In the AISBL structure all members of the Volt movement, as well as the national subsidiaries could become voting members. The statutes of Volt Europa lay out a general assembly, open to all members, which decides on important issues, and elects a gender-balanced board of nine directors.

[ 24 ] Volt's Spring 2020 general assembly was scheduled to take place in Lisbon , but due to the COVID-19 pandemic , the party held a digital general assembly, which included a decision on its programme until 2024.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] From 16 to 17 October 2021, Volt Europa hosted its General Assembly in Lisbon, Portugal, the first physical General Assembly since 2019. During the 2021 General Assembly, Reinier van Lanschot who has been co-president since the General Assembly in Sofia 2019 was reelected. Francesca Romana D'Antuono from Italy was elected as co-president. Johannes Heinrich from Switzerland was elected as treasurer. The six non-executive board members elected were: Ines Consonni, Anouk Ooms, Lucia Nass, Thor Larholm, Charles Evain and Lucas Amorelli Ribeiro Kornexl.

[ citation needed ] 2024 European Parliament election [ edit ] On 27 November 2023, Volt adopted its joint European election programme during its General Assembly in Paris.

[ 27 ] At a subsequent meeting in Brussels on 7 April 2024, the party elected Sophie in 't Veld and Damian Boeselager as its lead candidates for the 2024 European Parliament elections , also choosing a symbolic transnational list.

[ 28 ] Following the election, Volt increased its number of seats from 2 to 5, with 3 seats from Germany and 2 from the Netherlands. Volt announced that it would engage in negotiations with both the Greens/EFA and Renew Europe groups in the European Parliament and would let its members vote on which group to join. Upon a unanimous recommendation by its newly elected MEPs, 87% of voting party members chose to remain affiliated with the Greens/EFA group.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Name [ edit ] Volt Europa was incorporated as a non-profit association (ASBL) in Luxembourg under the name "Volt Europa", [ 23 ] abandoning a previous name of Vox Europe to avoid any confusion with a similarly named far-right Spanish party .

[ 31 ] "Volt" was chosen as a name due to its similarity to the initial name and the added meaning of figuratively bringing voltage into politics. Added to that, both the term "Volt" and the Latin version of the name of the European continent are understood in all European languages , hence as a transcontinental movement, Volt Europa does not need to translate its own name, except for languages where non-Latin alphabets are used (like Bulgaria , Cyprus , Greece , and Ukraine ).

[ 32 ] Ideology [ edit ] In 2018, Volt identified "the 5+1 fundamental challenges", which it has identified as crucial for an improvement of the European Union: [ 33 ] Smart state – Digitalisation of public services Economic renaissance – a blend of circular , green and blue economic models Social equality – Human rights , equality of opportunity , gender equality , and tolerance of cultural differences Global balance – Sustainable and responsible policies in farming and trade, measures to address climate change and refugee crises, and support for labour migration and development cooperation Citizen empowerment – Greater subsidiarity , social responsibility , and participatory democracy European reform – Federation of EU states , with greater responsibilities for its regions and cities On economic issues, Volt Europa supports digitisation, investment in the green and blue economy , measures to address poverty and inequality (including a European minimum income of at least 40% of the median wage), a more integrated European tax system with exclusively European taxes, and the use of public-private partnerships; it also supports increased spending on welfare, in particular related to education and healthcare .

[ 33 ] Volt has supported a European Basic Income (EBI), based on a " negative tax system ". In this model, individuals earning below a set threshold receive payments instead of paying taxes, providing a safety net and incentivizing work. Volt argues that the legal basis for an EBI is already established under Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and that its implementation would harmonize member states' welfare systems.

On social policy, Volt opposes sexism and racism and supports LGBT+ rights.

[ 34 ] Volt also supports deep reforms to EU institutions, including common management of migration and border protection, a European army , and European debt and taxation .

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 33 ] It argues that a European army should be established and that the relationship between the EU and NATO should be reviewed and balanced.

[ 37 ] Volt supports the idea of a federal Europe with a strong European Parliament, [ 38 ] [ 31 ] in order to create a united European voice on the global stage.

[ 39 ] There should be a European government, elected and accountable to the parliament, instead of a European commission. The European election law should be uniform across all member states, the European parliament should gain the right to initiate laws, and the European Council should be transformed into a second chamber with regressive voting weights to balance the dominance of larger states. Volt supports a referendum across all member states, which legitimizes such a constitution for the set of agreeing member states to form a core union, even if not every member state agrees.

[ 40 ] In terms of environmental policy, Volt has committed to the 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) target of the Paris agreement . To implement the target, Volt proposes a broad certificate trading scheme, the proceeds of which should be redistributed to citizens. Volt supports investment into nuclear power for maintenance and new reactors if safety standards are met. A European energy grid is promoted to integrate production and distribution in the European single market.

[ 41 ] As opposed to other movements promoting European integration, such as Pulse of Europe or the European Federalists , Volt has participated in elections on all levels of government as a political party. Its first major objective was the European Parliament elections in May 2019 .

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] Volt has participated successfully in local, [ a ] national, and European elections.

In 2024, Volt published the "Electoral Moonshot Programme", its electoral programme for the 2024 European elections, with comprehensive policy proposals organised in five pillars: Europe's geopolitical leadership, quality of life, humane migration, making votes count, and a liveable planet.

[ 44 ] The program is available in 7 languages.

[ 45 ] Organisation and governance [ edit ] The structure of Volt Europa is similar to parties in federal political systems, such as Germany. Volt Europa is registered as an international non-profit (AISBL), according to Belgian law. The membership of Volt Europa consists of both the local political branches, which are often incorporated according to national law, elect a local leadership, and often have further sub-levels, as well as all individual members. Individual members thus often have double membership of both Volt Europa and a national branch.

[ 23 ] The highest authority of the party is the General Assembly, which consists of all AISBL members and can pass motions on all matters relating to the organization. The General Assembly is open without a delegate system although some local branches use delegate systems (e.g. Volt Germany). A five-member intra-party legal board (Conflict Resolution Body) is elected by the General Assembly.

[ 23 ] All membership associations of Volt Europa send representatives to the Country Council, which formal role is restricted to deciding on the admission of new membership associations and political alliances on the European level. However, informally the Country Council plays an important role in advising and overseeing the work of the European Board.

[ 23 ] Co-Presidents of Volt Europa [ edit ] Co-presidents Year Name Country Chapter Term 2017–2019 Andrea Venzon Volt Italy 1st Damian Boeselager Volt Germany 1st 2019–2021 Valerie Sternberg Volt Germany 1st Reinier van Lanschot Volt Nederland 1st 2021–2023 Reinier van Lanschot Volt Nederland 2nd Francesca Romana D'Antuono Volt Italy 1st 2023– Francesca Romana D'Antuono Volt Italy 2nd Mels Klabbers Volt Nederland 1st Funding [ edit ] According to the party's financial accounts, it generates most of its income through membership fees and donations. National chapters provide 25% of their membership fees to Volt Europa to finance its operation. Volt claims to publish every donation exceeding € 3,000 per donation or donor per year within 15 days from its receipt on the party's website and that its national and local chapters adhere to the same standard.

[ 46 ] On 9 May 2021, Volt announced that they had raised €40,000 in three weeks in a fundraising drive ahead of the 2024 European Parliament election .

[ 47 ] Volt has received several large donations from firms in the housing and start-up sectors. Its biggest donors are Elastic founder Steven Schuurman with €500,000 via his Dreamery foundation, Marc Dreesmann, heir to Anton Dreesmann of Dutch retail company Vroom & Dreesmann with around €160,000, and Christian Oldendorff, heir to German shipping firm Oldendorff Carriers with around €120,000.

[ 136 ] [ 137 ] The party participated in the 2022 Swedish general election and received 89 votes.

[ 138 ] It received 388 votes in the 2024 European Election, not enough to win a seat.

[ 142 ] In the municipal elections in Zurich in February 2022, Volt stood for the first time in an election in Switzerland and fielded candidates in 2 out of 9 constituencies.
