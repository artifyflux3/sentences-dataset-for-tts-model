For the plant form, see Tree . For other uses, see Tree (disambiguation) .

In mathematics , Kruskal's tree theorem states that the set of finite trees over a well-quasi-ordered set of labels is itself well-quasi-ordered under homeomorphic embedding.

A finitary application of the theorem gives the existence of the fast-growing TREE function .

TREE ( 3 ) {\displaystyle {\text{TREE}}(3)} is largely accepted to be one of the largest simply defined finite numbers, dwarfing other large numbers such as Graham's number and googolplex .

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The theorem was conjectured by Andrew Vázsonyi and proved by Joseph Kruskal ( 1960 ); a short proof was given by Crispin Nash-Williams ( 1963 ). It has since become a prominent example in reverse mathematics as a statement that cannot be proved in ATR 0 (a second-order arithmetic theory with a form of arithmetical transfinite recursion ).

In 2004, the result was generalized from trees to graphs as the Robertson–Seymour theorem , a result that has also proved important in reverse mathematics and leads to the even-faster-growing SSCG function , which dwarfs TREE ( 3 ) {\displaystyle {\text{TREE}}(3)} .

Statement [ edit ] The version given here is that proven by Nash-Williams; Kruskal's formulation is somewhat stronger. All trees we consider are finite.

Given a tree T {\displaystyle T} with a root , and given vertices v {\displaystyle v} , w {\displaystyle w} , call w {\displaystyle w} a successor of v {\displaystyle v} if the unique path from the root to w {\displaystyle w} contains v {\displaystyle v} , and call w {\displaystyle w} an immediate successor of v {\displaystyle v} if additionally the path from v {\displaystyle v} to w {\displaystyle w} contains no other vertex.

Take X {\displaystyle X} to be a partially ordered set . If T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} , T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} are rooted trees with vertices labeled in X {\displaystyle X} , we say that T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} is inf-embeddable in T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} and write T 1 ≤ ≤ T 2 {\displaystyle T_{1}\leq T_{2}} if there is an injective map F {\displaystyle F} from the vertices of T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} to the vertices of T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} such that: For all vertices v {\displaystyle v} of T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} , the label of v {\displaystyle v} precedes the label of F ( v ) {\displaystyle F(v)} ; If w {\displaystyle w} is any successor of v {\displaystyle v} in T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} , then F ( w ) {\displaystyle F(w)} is a successor of F ( v ) {\displaystyle F(v)} ; and If w 1 {\displaystyle w_{1}} , w 2 {\displaystyle w_{2}} are any two distinct immediate successors of v {\displaystyle v} , then the path from F ( w 1 ) {\displaystyle F(w_{1})} to F ( w 2 ) {\displaystyle F(w_{2})} in T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} contains F ( v ) {\displaystyle F(v)} .

Kruskal's tree theorem then states: If X {\displaystyle X} is well-quasi-ordered , then the set of rooted trees with labels in X {\displaystyle X} is well-quasi-ordered under the inf-embeddable order defined above. (That is to say, given any infinite sequence T 1 , T 2 , … … {\displaystyle T_{1},T_{2},\ldots } of rooted trees labeled in X {\displaystyle X} , there is some i < j {\displaystyle i<j} so that T i ≤ ≤ T j {\displaystyle T_{i}\leq T_{j}} .) Friedman's work [ edit ] For a countable label set X {\displaystyle X} , Kruskal's tree theorem can be expressed and proven using second-order arithmetic . However, like Goodstein's theorem or the Paris–Harrington theorem , some special cases and variants of the theorem can be expressed in subsystems of second-order arithmetic much weaker than the subsystems where they can be proved. This was first observed by Harvey Friedman in the early 1980s, an early success of the then-nascent field of reverse mathematics. In the case where the trees above are taken to be unlabeled (that is, in the case where X {\displaystyle X} has size one), Friedman found that the result was unprovable in ATR 0 , [ 2 ] thus giving the first example of a predicative result with a provably impredicative proof.

[ 3 ] This case of the theorem is still provable by Π 1 1 -CA 0 , but by adding a "gap condition" [ 4 ] to the definition of the order on trees above, he found a natural variation of the theorem unprovable in this system.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Much later, the Robertson–Seymour theorem would give another theorem unprovable by Π 1 1 -CA 0 .

Ordinal analysis confirms the strength of Kruskal's theorem, with the proof-theoretic ordinal of the theorem equaling the small Veblen ordinal (sometimes confused with the smaller Ackermann ordinal ).

[ 7 ] Weak tree function [ edit ] Suppose that P ( n ) {\displaystyle P(n)} is the statement: There is some m {\displaystyle m} such that if T 1 , … … , T m {\displaystyle T_{1},\ldots ,T_{m}} is a finite sequence of unlabeled rooted trees where T i {\displaystyle T_{i}} has i + n {\displaystyle i+n} vertices, then T i ≤ ≤ T j {\displaystyle T_{i}\leq T_{j}} for some i < j {\displaystyle i<j} .

All the statements P ( n ) {\displaystyle P(n)} are true as a consequence of Kruskal's theorem and Kőnig's lemma . For each n {\displaystyle n} , Peano arithmetic can prove that P ( n ) {\displaystyle P(n)} is true, but Peano arithmetic cannot prove the statement " P ( n ) {\displaystyle P(n)} is true for all n {\displaystyle n} ".

[ 8 ] Moreover, the length of the shortest proof of P ( n ) {\displaystyle P(n)} in Peano arithmetic grows phenomenally fast as a function of n {\displaystyle n} , far faster than any primitive recursive function or the Ackermann function , for example.

[ citation needed ] The least m {\displaystyle m} for which P ( n ) {\displaystyle P(n)} holds similarly grows extremely quickly with n {\displaystyle n} .

Friedman defined the following function, which is a weaker version of the TREE function below. For a positive integer n {\displaystyle n} , take FFF ( n ) {\displaystyle {\text{FFF}}(n)} to be the largest m {\displaystyle m} so that we have the following: There is a sequence T 1 , … … , T m {\displaystyle T_{1},\ldots ,T_{m}} of rooted trees, where each T i {\displaystyle T_{i}} has i + n − − 1 {\displaystyle i+n-1} vertices, such that T i ≤ ≤ T j {\displaystyle T_{i}\leq T_{j}} does not hold for any i < j ≤ ≤ m {\displaystyle i<j\leq m} .

Friedman computes the first few terms of this sequence as FFF ( 1 ) = 1 {\displaystyle {\text{FFF}}(1)=1} , FFF ( 2 ) = 2 {\displaystyle {\text{FFF}}(2)=2} , and FFF ( 3 ) = 5 {\displaystyle {\text{FFF}}(3)=5} . He also estimates FFF ( 4 ) {\displaystyle {\text{FFF}}(4)} to be less than 100, while FFF ( 5 ) {\displaystyle {\text{FFF}}(5)} suddenly explodes to a very large value. Any proof that FFF ( 5 ) {\displaystyle {\text{FFF}}(5)} exists in Peano arithmetic requires at least A ( 10 ) {\displaystyle A(10)} [c] symbols, but it can be proved to exist in ACA 0 with at most 10,000 symbols.

[ 9 ] TREE function [ edit ] A sequence of rooted trees labelled from a set of 3 labels (blue < red < green). The n {\displaystyle n} th tree in the sequence contains at most n {\displaystyle n} vertices, and no tree is inf-embeddable within any later tree in the sequence.

TREE ( 3 ) {\displaystyle {\text{TREE}}(3)} is defined to be the longest possible length of such a sequence.

By incorporating labels, Friedman defined a far faster-growing function.

[ 10 ] For a positive integer v {\displaystyle v} , take TREE ( n ) {\displaystyle {\text{TREE}}(n)} [a] to be the largest m {\displaystyle m} so that we have the following: There is a sequence T 1 , … … , T m {\displaystyle T_{1},\ldots ,T_{m}} of rooted trees labelled from a set of n {\displaystyle n} labels, where each T i {\displaystyle T_{i}} has at most i {\displaystyle i} vertices, such that T i ≤ ≤ T j {\displaystyle T_{i}\leq T_{j}} does not hold for any i < j ≤ ≤ m {\displaystyle i<j\leq m} .

Kruskal's theorem asserts that TREE ( n ) {\displaystyle {\text{TREE}}(n)} is finite for all n {\displaystyle n} . The TREE function eventually dominates every provably recursive function of the system ACA 0 + Π 1 2 -BI.

[ 10 ] The sequence begins TREE ( 1 ) = 1 {\displaystyle {\text{TREE}}(1)=1} , TREE ( 2 ) = 3 {\displaystyle {\text{TREE}}(2)=3} , before TREE ( 3 ) {\displaystyle {\text{TREE}}(3)} suddenly explodes to a value so large that many other "large" combinatorial constants, such as Friedman's n ( 4 ) {\displaystyle n(4)} and Graham's number , [b] are extremely small by comparison. A lower bound for n ( 4 ) {\displaystyle n(4)} , and, hence, an extremely weak lower bound for TREE ( 3 ) {\displaystyle {\text{TREE}}(3)} , is A A ( 187196 ) ( 1 ) {\displaystyle A^{A(187196)}(1)} [c] , where A ( x ) {\displaystyle A(x)} is the single-argument version of Ackermann's function , defined as A ( x ) = A ( x , x ) {\displaystyle A(x)=A(x,x)} .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Friedman showed that TREE ( 3 ) {\displaystyle {\text{TREE}}(3)} is greater than the halting time of any Turing machine that can be proved to halt in ACA 0 + Π 1 2 -BI with at most 2 ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ 1000 {\displaystyle 2\uparrow \uparrow 1000} symbols, where ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ {\displaystyle \uparrow \uparrow } denotes tetration .

[ 10 ] See also [ edit ] Paris–Harrington theorem Kanamori–McAloon theorem Robertson–Seymour theorem Notes [ edit ] ^ a Friedman originally denoted this function by TR [ n ] {\displaystyle {\text{TR}}[n]} .

^ b n ( k ) {\displaystyle n(k)} is defined as the length of the longest possible sequence that can be constructed with a k {\displaystyle k} -letter alphabet such that no block of letters x i , … … , x 2 i {\displaystyle x_{i},\ldots ,x_{2i}} is a subsequence of any later block x j , … … , x 2 j {\displaystyle x_{j},\ldots ,x_{2j}} .

[ 12 ] For example n ( 1 ) = 3 {\displaystyle n(1)=3} , n ( 2 ) = 11 {\displaystyle n(2)=11} ,  and n ( 3 ) > 2 ↑ ↑ 7197 158386 {\displaystyle n(3)>2\uparrow ^{7197}158386} .

^ c The superscript indicates repeated iteration. For example, A 3 ( 1 ) {\displaystyle A^{3}(1)} would mean computing A ( A ( A ( 1 ) ) ) {\displaystyle A(A(A(1)))} .
