The Maryland Wildlands Preservation System is the state's counterpart to the federal government's National Wilderness Preservation System . Protected properties are designated as state wildlands by the Maryland General Assembly . These wildlands are owned and managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources . Each tract overlaps with all or part of a state park , forest, wildlife management area , or other land unit of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.

History [ edit ] In 1971, the Maryland State Legislature passed the Wildlands Protection Act, which began the program of protecting publicly owned areas. As of December 2018, 38 areas had been designated as Maryland Wildlands.
