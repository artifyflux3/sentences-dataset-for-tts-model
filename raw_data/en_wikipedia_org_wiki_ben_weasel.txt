In the early 1990s, Foster founded The Gore Gore Girls (unrelated to the later band of the same name) with SW guitarist Jughead, Glynis Johnson (also of Red Red Meat ) and Russ Forester (founder of Underdog Records).

SXSW incident [ edit ] On Friday, March 18, 2011, at Austin, Texas's SXSW Festival , Foster was involved in an altercation with two women during a Screeching Weasel performance.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The first woman threw ice cubes at Foster. Upon being hit with more ice Foster found an unruly woman was the source of the ice. Foster originally stated he "can't kick a girl's ass" and offered money for another woman to handle the attacker.  As the ice and spitting continued Foster threatened to beat the woman up himself. The woman then threw beer at Foster, who responded by attacking her. A club owner, also female, then came on stage and grabbed Foster from behind.  He pushed her and punched her before being pulled to the other side of the stage by a bouncer .

[ 9 ] On March 20, Foster posted an apology [ 10 ] on his website BenWeasel.com [ 11 ] stating "I want to apologize to both the club owner and audience member involved for my actions during our show at SXSW on Friday night. While their actions were outside of my control, my regretful reaction is wholly my responsibility. Whatever my feelings are about fans crossing the line like that, I wish I could have that moment back and deal with it in the same spirit as I did the preceding 60 minutes. Since I can't, an apology is all I've got and I sincerely hope those people will accept it. Up front, I wish to say that I am sorry to the fan and any others who were involved. As a husband, father, and a musician on the public stage, I understand that it is my duty to always take responsibility for my actions in a socially acceptable way, and most especially in the face of confrontation." —  Ben Foster.

Following the incident, several bands who were slated to appear at Weasel Fest in Chicago dropped out, including Chinese Telephones, Chixdiggit , The Soviettes , Teenage Bottlerocket and Kepi Ghoulie .

[ 12 ] On March 23, 2011, the other four members of Screeching Weasel all resigned from the band citing the SXSW incident as the reason.

[ 13 ] On March 31 it was announced that the entire Weasel Fest had been cancelled.

[ 14 ] In August, Weasel issued a full article on Screeching Weasel's website describing his whole point of view on the situation.

[ 15 ] Personal life [ edit ] On November 30, 2010, Foster appeared on Last Call with Carson Daly and revealed that he suffers from anxiety , panic attacks , and bouts of agoraphobia .

[ 16 ] Foster lives with his wife and 3 children in Madison, Wisconsin . He used to be a Buddhist but then became Catholic .
