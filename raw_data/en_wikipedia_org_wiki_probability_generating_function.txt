Probability generating functions are often employed for their succinct description of the sequence of probabilities Pr( X = i ) in the probability mass function for a random variable X , and to make available the well-developed theory of power series with non-negative coefficients.

Definition [ edit ] Univariate case [ edit ] If X is a discrete random variable taking values x in the non-negative integers {0,1, ...}, then the probability generating function of X is defined as [ 1 ] G ( z ) = E ⁡ ⁡ ( z X ) = ∑ ∑ x = 0 ∞ ∞ p ( x ) z x , {\displaystyle G(z)=\operatorname {E} (z^{X})=\sum _{x=0}^{\infty }p(x)z^{x},} where p {\displaystyle p} is the probability mass function of X {\displaystyle X} .  Note that the subscripted notations G X {\displaystyle G_{X}} and p X {\displaystyle p_{X}} are often used to emphasize that these pertain to a particular random variable X {\displaystyle X} , and to its distribution . The power series converges absolutely at least for all complex numbers z {\displaystyle z} with | z | < 1 {\displaystyle |z|<1} ; the radius of convergence being often larger.

Multivariate case [ edit ] If X = ( X 1 ,..., X d ) is a discrete random variable taking values ( x 1 , ..., x d ) in the d -dimensional non-negative integer lattice {0,1, ...} d , then the probability generating function of X is defined as G ( z ) = G ( z 1 , … … , z d ) = E ⁡ ⁡ ( z 1 X 1 ⋯ ⋯ z d X d ) = ∑ ∑ x 1 , … … , x d = 0 ∞ ∞ p ( x 1 , … … , x d ) z 1 x 1 ⋯ ⋯ z d x d , {\displaystyle G(z)=G(z_{1},\ldots ,z_{d})=\operatorname {E} {\bigl (}z_{1}^{X_{1}}\cdots z_{d}^{X_{d}}{\bigr )}=\sum _{x_{1},\ldots ,x_{d}=0}^{\infty }p(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{d})z_{1}^{x_{1}}\cdots z_{d}^{x_{d}},} where p is the probability mass function of X . The power series converges absolutely at least for all complex vectors z = ( z 1 , .

z d ) ∈ ∈ C d {\displaystyle z=(z_{1},...z_{d})\in \mathbb {C} ^{d}} with max { | z 1 | , .

, | z d | } ≤ ≤ 1.

{\displaystyle {\text{max}}\{|z_{1}|,...,|z_{d}|\}\leq 1.} Properties [ edit ] Power series [ edit ] Probability generating functions obey all the rules of power series with non-negative coefficients.  In particular, G ( 1 − − ) = 1 {\displaystyle G(1^{-})=1} , where G ( 1 − − ) = lim x → → 1 , x < 1 G ( x ) {\displaystyle G(1^{-})=\lim _{x\to 1,x<1}G(x)} , x approaching 1 from below , since the probabilities must sum to one. So the radius of convergence of any probability generating function must be at least 1, by Abel's theorem for power series with non-negative coefficients.

Probabilities and expectations [ edit ] The following properties allow the derivation of various basic quantities related to X {\displaystyle X} : The probability mass function of X {\displaystyle X} is recovered by taking derivatives of G {\displaystyle G} , p ( k ) = Pr ⁡ ⁡ ( X = k ) = G ( k ) ( 0 ) k !

.

{\displaystyle p(k)=\operatorname {Pr} (X=k)={\frac {G^{(k)}(0)}{k!}}.} It follows from Property 1 that if random variables X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} have probability-generating functions that are equal, G X = G Y {\displaystyle G_{X}=G_{Y}} , then p X = p Y {\displaystyle p_{X}=p_{Y}} .  That is, if X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} have identical probability-generating functions, then they have identical distributions.

The normalization of the probability mass function can be expressed in terms of the generating function by E ⁡ ⁡ [ 1 ] = G ( 1 − − ) = ∑ ∑ i = 0 ∞ ∞ p ( i ) = 1.

{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [1]=G(1^{-})=\sum _{i=0}^{\infty }p(i)=1.} The expectation of X {\displaystyle X} is given by E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] = G ′ ( 1 − − ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [X]=G'(1^{-}).} More generally, the k t h {\displaystyle k^{th}} factorial moment , E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ( X − − 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( X − − k + 1 ) ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [X(X-1)\cdots (X-k+1)]} of X {\displaystyle X} is given by E ⁡ ⁡ [ X !

( X − − k ) !

] = G ( k ) ( 1 − − ) , k ≥ ≥ 0.

{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \left[{\frac {X!}{(X-k)!}}\right]=G^{(k)}(1^{-}),\quad k\geq 0.} So the variance of X {\displaystyle X} is given by Var ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) = G ″ ( 1 − − ) + G ′ ( 1 − − ) − − [ G ′ ( 1 − − ) ] 2 .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Var} (X)=G''(1^{-})+G'(1^{-})-\left[G'(1^{-})\right]^{2}.} Finally, the k -th raw moment of X is given by E ⁡ ⁡ [ X k ] = ( z ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ z ) k G ( z ) | z = 1 − − {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [X^{k}]=\left(z{\frac {\partial }{\partial z}}\right)^{k}G(z){\Big |}_{z=1^{-}}} G X ( e t ) = M X ( t ) {\displaystyle G_{X}(e^{t})=M_{X}(t)} where X is a random variable, G X ( t ) {\displaystyle G_{X}(t)} is the probability generating function (of X {\displaystyle X} ) and M X ( t ) {\displaystyle M_{X}(t)} is the moment-generating function (of X {\displaystyle X} ).

Functions of independent random variables [ edit ] Probability generating functions are particularly useful for dealing with functions of independent random variables. For example: If X i , i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ ⋯ , N {\displaystyle X_{i},i=1,2,\cdots ,N} is a sequence of independent (and not necessarily identically distributed) random variables that take on natural-number values, and S N = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N a i X i , {\displaystyle S_{N}=\sum _{i=1}^{N}a_{i}X_{i},} where the a i {\displaystyle a_{i}} are constant natural numbers, then the probability generating function is given by G S N ( z ) = E ⁡ ⁡ ( z S N ) = E ⁡ ⁡ ( z ∑ ∑ i = 1 N a i X i , ) = G X 1 ( z a 1 ) G X 2 ( z a 2 ) ⋯ ⋯ G X N ( z a N ) .

{\displaystyle G_{S_{N}}(z)=\operatorname {E} (z^{S_{N}})=\operatorname {E} \left(z^{\sum _{i=1}^{N}a_{i}X_{i},}\right)=G_{X_{1}}(z^{a_{1}})G_{X_{2}}(z^{a_{2}})\cdots G_{X_{N}}(z^{a_{N}}).} In particular, if X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are independent random variables: G X + Y ( z ) = G X ( z ) ⋅ ⋅ G Y ( z ) {\displaystyle G_{X+Y}(z)=G_{X}(z)\cdot G_{Y}(z)} and G X − − Y ( z ) = G X ( z ) ⋅ ⋅ G Y ( 1 / z ) .

{\displaystyle G_{X-Y}(z)=G_{X}(z)\cdot G_{Y}(1/z).} In the above, the number N {\displaystyle N} of independent random variables in the sequence is fixed. Assume N {\displaystyle N} is discrete random variable taking values on the non-negative integers, which is independent of the X i {\displaystyle X_{i}} , and consider the probability generating function G N {\displaystyle G_{N}} .  If the X i {\displaystyle X_{i}} are not only independent but also identically distributed with common probability generating function G X = G X i {\displaystyle G_{X}=G_{X_{i}}} , then G S N ( z ) = G N ( G X ( z ) ) .

{\displaystyle G_{S_{N}}(z)=G_{N}(G_{X}(z)).} This can be seen, using the law of total expectation , as follows: G S N ( z ) = E ⁡ ⁡ ( z S N ) = E ⁡ ⁡ ( z ∑ ∑ i = 1 N X i ) = E ⁡ ⁡ ( E ⁡ ⁡ ( z ∑ ∑ i = 1 N X i ∣ ∣ N ) ) = E ⁡ ⁡ ( ( G X ( z ) ) N ) = G N ( G X ( z ) ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}G_{S_{N}}(z)&=\operatorname {E} (z^{S_{N}})=\operatorname {E} (z^{\sum _{i=1}^{N}X_{i}})\\[4pt]&=\operatorname {E} {\big (}\operatorname {E} (z^{\sum _{i=1}^{N}X_{i}}\mid N){\big )}=\operatorname {E} {\big (}(G_{X}(z))^{N}{\big )}=G_{N}(G_{X}(z)).\end{aligned}}} This last fact is useful in the study of Galton–Watson processes and compound Poisson processes .

When the X i {\displaystyle X_{i}} are not supposed identically distributed (but still independent and independent of N {\displaystyle N} ), we have G S N ( z ) = ∑ ∑ n ≥ ≥ 1 f n ∏ ∏ i = 1 n G X i ( z ) , {\displaystyle G_{S_{N}}(z)=\sum _{n\geq 1}f_{n}\prod _{i=1}^{n}G_{X_{i}}(z),} where f n = Pr ( N = n ) .

{\displaystyle f_{n}=\Pr(N=n).} For identically distributed X i {\displaystyle X_{i}} s, this simplifies to the identity stated before, but the general case is sometimes useful to obtain a decomposition of S N {\displaystyle S_{N}} by means of generating functions.

Examples [ edit ] The probability generating function of an almost surely constant random variable , i.e. one with Pr ( X = c ) = 1 {\displaystyle \Pr(X=c)=1} and Pr ( X ≠ ≠ c ) = 0 {\displaystyle \Pr(X\neq c)=0} is G ( z ) = z c .

{\displaystyle G(z)=z^{c}.} The probability generating function of a binomial random variable , the number of successes in n {\displaystyle n} trials, with probability p {\displaystyle p} of success in each trial, is G ( z ) = [ ( 1 − − p ) + p z ] n .

{\displaystyle G(z)=\left[(1-p)+pz\right]^{n}.} Note : it is the n {\displaystyle n} -fold product of the probability generating function of a Bernoulli random variable with parameter p {\displaystyle p} .

So the probability generating function of a fair coin , is G ( z ) = 1 2 + z 2 .

{\displaystyle G(z)={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {z}{2}}.} The probability generating function of a negative binomial random variable on { 0 , 1 , 2 ⋯ ⋯ } {\displaystyle \{0,1,2\cdots \}} , the number of failures until the r t h {\displaystyle r^{th}} success with probability of success in each trial p {\displaystyle p} , is G ( z ) = ( p 1 − − ( 1 − − p ) z ) r , {\displaystyle G(z)=\left({\frac {p}{1-(1-p)z}}\right)^{r},} which converges for | z | < 1 1 − − p {\displaystyle |z|<{\frac {1}{1-p}}} .

Note that this is the r {\displaystyle r} -fold product of the probability generating function of a geometric random variable with parameter 1 − − p {\displaystyle 1-p} on { 0 , 1 , 2 , ⋯ ⋯ } {\displaystyle \{0,1,2,\cdots \}} .

The probability generating function of a Poisson random variable with rate parameter λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is G ( z ) = e λ λ ( z − − 1 ) .

{\displaystyle G(z)=e^{\lambda (z-1)}.} Related concepts [ edit ] The probability generating function is an example of a generating function of a sequence: see also formal power series . It is equivalent to, and sometimes called, the z-transform of the probability mass function.

Other generating functions of random variables include the moment-generating function , the characteristic function and the cumulant generating function . The probability generating function is also equivalent to the factorial moment generating function , which as E ⁡ ⁡ [ z X ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \left[z^{X}\right]} can also be considered for continuous and other random variables.
