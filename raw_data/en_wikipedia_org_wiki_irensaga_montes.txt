The range is located near Titan's equator , between 5–6° south and 210–214° east.

[ 1 ] It is located within the Adiri region, just west of the landing site of the Huygens probe .

[ 2 ] The Irensaga Montes is named after Irensaga , one of the White Mountains in J. R. R. Tolkien 's fictional world of Middle-earth .

[ 3 ] The name follows a convention that Titanean mountains are after mountains in Tolkien's work.

[ 4 ] It was formally announced on November 13, 2012.
