The name of the seesaw mechanism was given by Tsutomu Yanagida in a Tokyo conference in 1981.

There are several types of models, each extending the Standard Model .  The simplest version, "Type 1", extends the Standard Model by assuming two or more additional right-handed neutrino fields
inert under the electroweak interaction, [ a ] and the existence of a very large mass scale. This allows the mass scale to be identifiable with the postulated scale of grand unification.

Type 1 seesaw [ edit ] This model produces a light neutrino, for each of the three known neutrino flavors, and a corresponding very heavy neutrino for each flavor, which has yet to be observed.

The simple mathematical principle behind the seesaw mechanism is the following property of any 2×2 matrix of the form A = ( 0 M M B ) .

{\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}0&M\\M&B\end{pmatrix}}.} It has two eigenvalues : λ λ ( + ) = B + B 2 + 4 M 2 2 , {\displaystyle \lambda _{(+)}={\frac {B+{\sqrt {B^{2}+4M^{2}}}}{2}},} and λ λ ( − − ) = B − − B 2 + 4 M 2 2 .

{\displaystyle \lambda _{(-)}={\frac {B-{\sqrt {B^{2}+4M^{2}}}}{2}}.} The geometric mean of λ λ ( + ) {\displaystyle \lambda _{(+)}} and λ λ ( − − ) {\displaystyle \lambda _{(-)}} equals | M | {\displaystyle \left|M\right|} , since the determinant λ λ ( + ) λ λ ( − − ) = − − M 2 {\displaystyle \lambda _{(+)}\;\lambda _{(-)}=-M^{2}} .

Thus, if one of the eigenvalues goes up, the other goes down, and vice versa. This is the point of the name " seesaw " of the mechanism.

In applying this model to neutrinos, B {\displaystyle B} is taken to be much larger than M .

{\displaystyle M.} Then the larger eigenvalue, λ λ ( + ) , {\displaystyle \lambda _{(+)},} is approximately equal to B , {\displaystyle B,} while the smaller eigenvalue is approximately equal to λ λ − − ≈ ≈ − − M 2 B .

{\displaystyle \lambda _{-}\approx -{\frac {M^{2}}{B}}.} This mechanism serves to explain why the neutrino masses are so small.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The matrix A is essentially the mass matrix for the neutrinos. The Majorana mass component B {\displaystyle B} is comparable to the GUT scale and violates lepton number conservation; while the Dirac mass components M {\displaystyle M} are of order of the much smaller electroweak scale , called the VEV or vacuum expectation value below. The smaller eigenvalue λ λ ( − − ) {\displaystyle \lambda _{(-)}} then leads to a very small neutrino mass, comparable to 1 eV , which is in qualitative accord with experiments—sometimes regarded as supportive evidence for the framework of Grand Unified Theories.

Background [ edit ] The 2×2 matrix A arises in a natural manner within the standard model by considering the most general mass matrix allowed by gauge invariance of the standard model action , and the corresponding charges of the lepton- and neutrino fields.

Call the neutrino part of a Weyl spinor χ χ , {\displaystyle \chi ,} a part of a left-handed lepton weak isospin doublet ; the other part is the left-handed charged lepton ℓ ℓ , {\displaystyle \ell ,} L = ( χ χ ℓ ℓ ) , {\displaystyle L={\begin{pmatrix}\chi \\\ell \end{pmatrix}},} as it is present in the minimal standard model with neutrino masses omitted, and let η η {\displaystyle \eta } be a postulated right-handed neutrino Weyl spinor which is a singlet under weak isospin – i.e. a neutrino that fails to interact weakly, such as a sterile neutrino .

There are now three ways to form Lorentz covariant mass terms, giving either 1 2 B ′ χ χ α α χ χ α α , 1 2 B η η α α η η α α , o r M η η α α χ χ α α , {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}\,B'\,\chi ^{\alpha }\chi _{\alpha }\,,\quad {\frac {1}{2}}\,B\,\eta ^{\alpha }\eta _{\alpha }\,,\quad \mathrm {or} \quad M\,\eta ^{\alpha }\chi _{\alpha }\,,} and their complex conjugates , which can be written as a quadratic form , 1 2 ( χ χ η η ) ( B ′ M M B ) ( χ χ η η ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}\,{\begin{pmatrix}\chi &\eta \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}B'&M\\M&B\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\chi \\\eta \end{pmatrix}}.} Since the right-handed neutrino spinor is uncharged under all standard model gauge symmetries, B is a free parameter which can in principle take any arbitrary value.

The parameter M is forbidden by electroweak gauge symmetry , and can only appear after the symmetry has been spontaneously broken by a Higgs mechanism , like the Dirac masses of the charged leptons. In particular, since χ ∈ L has weak isospin ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ like the Higgs field H , and η η {\displaystyle \eta } has weak isospin 0, the mass parameter M can be generated from Yukawa interactions with the Higgs field , in the conventional standard model fashion, L y u k = y η η L ϵ ϵ H ∗ ∗ + .

.

.

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{yuk}=y\,\eta L\epsilon H^{*}+...} This means that M is naturally of the order of the vacuum expectation value of the standard model Higgs field , the vacuum expectation value (VEV) v ≈ ≈ 246 G e V , | ⟨ ⟨ H ⟩ ⟩ | = v / 2 {\displaystyle \quad v\;\approx \;\mathrm {246\;GeV} ,\qquad \qquad |\langle H\rangle |\;=\;v/{\sqrt {2}}} M t = O ( v / 2 ) ≈ ≈ 174 G e V , {\displaystyle M_{t}={\mathcal {O}}\left(v/{\sqrt {2}}\right)\;\approx \;\mathrm {174\;GeV} ,} if the dimensionless Yukawa coupling is of order y ≈ ≈ 1 {\displaystyle y\approx 1} . It can be chosen smaller consistently, but extreme values y ≫ ≫ 1 {\displaystyle y\gg 1} can make the model nonperturbative .

The parameter B ′ {\displaystyle B'} on the other hand, is forbidden, since no renormalizable singlet under weak hypercharge and isospin can be formed using these doublet components – only a nonrenormalizable, dimension 5 term is allowed. This is the origin of the pattern and hierarchy of scales of the mass matrix A {\displaystyle A} within the "Type 1" seesaw mechanism.

The large size of B can be motivated in the context of grand unification . In such models, enlarged gauge symmetries may be present, which initially force B = 0 {\displaystyle B=0} in the unbroken phase, but generate a large, non-vanishing value B ≈ ≈ M G U T ≈ ≈ 10 15 G e V , {\displaystyle B\approx M_{\mathsf {GUT}}\approx \mathrm {10^{15}~GeV} ,} around the scale of their spontaneous symmetry breaking . So given a mass M ≈ ≈ 100 G e V {\displaystyle M\approx \mathrm {100\;GeV} } one has λ λ ( − − ) ≈ ≈ 0.01 e V .

{\displaystyle \lambda _{(-)}\;\approx \;\mathrm {0.01\;eV} .} A huge scale has thus induced a dramatically small neutrino mass for the eigenvector ν ν ≈ ≈ χ χ − − M B η η .

{\displaystyle \nu \approx \chi -{\frac {\;M\;}{B}}\eta .} See also [ edit ] Majoron Spinor Footnotes [ edit ] ^ It is possible to generate two low-mass neutrinos with only one right-handed neutrino, but the resulting mass spectra are generally not viable.
