Day of Prayer for Prisoners [ edit ] Main article: Prayers for Prisoners Day Crucifixion of Jesus with the Penitent Thief and the impenitent thief (central image of the Bockstorfer Altar in the Cathedral of Konstanz , painted in 1524) Day of Prayers for Prisoners is a Polish Catholic holiday celebrated since 2009 every year on 26 March, established on the memorial day of Penitent Thief (known also as Good Thief, a patron of prisoners). The initiative came from the Association of Evangelical Help for Prisoners "Prison Brotherhood" in Warsaw .

[ 1 ] On this day for many years, the Prison Brotherhood organized a pilgrimage of prisoners' representatives to the Jasna Góra Monastery in Częstochowa , the major Polish Marian sanctuary . The idea behind establishing the Day of Prayers for Prisoners is a need to promote prayers especially among the prisoners who disassociate themselves entirely from God, who do not see any point in conversion or have lost their faith in Divine Mercy .

Pope John Paul II during his fourth pastoral visit to Poland in 1991, visited the prison in Płock and said: "You are convicted, that's a truth, but you are not condemned. Each of you can, with a help of God's grace, become a saint."

Memorial engraving of global religious leaders at the first "World Day of Prayer for Peace" in Assisi (1986) Pope John Paul II organized the first World Day of Prayer for Peace in Assisi , Italy, on October 27, 1986.
In all there were 160 religious leaders who spent the day together with fasting and praying to their God or Gods. They represented 32 Christian religious organizations and 11 other non-Christian world religions, including: Christian religions and organizations: Catholic Church Greek Orthodox Church Russian Orthodox Church World Council of Churches World YWCA World Alliance of YMCA 's Friends World Committee for Consultation (Quakers) Mennonite World Conference Reformed Ecumenical Synod Baptist World Alliance Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) World Alliance of Reformed Churches Lutheran World Federation Anglican Communion Old Catholic Church of Utrecht Assyrian Church of the East non-Christian religions: [ 11 ] Hinduism Sikhism Buddhism Jainism Judaism Islam African and North American animism Shintoism Zoroastrianism Baháʼí In 1993, John Paul II repeated the Day of Prayer to pray for an end to the war in Bosnia , and invited leaders of the Christian, Muslim and Jewish religions. And on January 24, 2002, he organized another World Day of Prayer for Peace, again in Assisi. Some 200 other religious leaders were present, including Roman Catholic cardinals, Muslim clerics, Jewish rabbis, Buddhists, Sikhs, Baháʼís, Hindus, Jains, Zoroastrians and members of African traditional religions. Following the Terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , the Assisi event intended to discourage making religion a motive for conflict in the 21st century.

Benedict felt that, while such gatherings are good, one cannot give the impression – even externally, interpreted by others – that theological differences have been reduced or are not consequential.

The Catholic Church has established January 22 as the  Day of Prayer for the Legal Protection of Unborn Children.

[ 14 ] World Peace and Prayer Day [ edit ] Chief Arvol Looking Horse , Spiritual Leader, Keeper of the White Buffalo Calf Pipe, was directed to begin a spiritual journey and he committed to organize World Peace and Prayer Day in the Four Directions that would be held annually on the summer solstice, June 21.  As leader of the Lakota/Dakota/Nakota (Sioux) Nation, he has invited the people of the world to return to their sacred sites on June 21 to pray to the Creator to heal the Earth and to heal relationships between people.  In 1996 Chief Looking Horse led a Unity Ride of Bigfoot Riders from the Wahpeton Dakota Reservation, Saskatchewan to Grey Horn Butte (He Hota Paha) Wyoming, called Devils Tower on current maps.  Over the past sixteen years the event has been hosted in Ireland (2001), Durban, South Africa (2002), Australia (2003) and Japan (2004).

The Wolakota Youth Council embarked on a large-scale project called Prayer Run for World Peace 2005.  This project included both First Nation tribes and many non-native youth from all cultures across the nation.  Starting in May 2005 groups from the four directions started their run.  Los Angeles, CA in the west, Manitoba, Canada in the north, Long Island, New York in the east and the southern group from Mexico and El Paso, TX.

There was also a Prayer Ride for World Peace that started from Cypress Hills Saskatchewan.  A Horse Bundle was carried by the riders on a route that brought them across Montana and through many Tribal communities.  As many as 15 youth stayed on their horses all the way to the event.  It was a beautiful sight to see the horses and runners come in to the beginning of World Peace and Prayer Day.  They brought all their prayers in one hoop of unity.

2006: A Prayer Run for World Peace started in Vancouver, British Columbia that spanned 2,262 miles to the site of World Peace and Prayer Day in Eklutna, Alaska, hosted by the Inuit.

In Africa, North Korea, China, India, the Philippines, and other nations, Christians face worship restrictions, public humiliation, and social isolation. Many encounter violence; some face death. Church buildings are burned and vandalized. The International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church is charged with raising awareness of such circumstances and lifting the most pressing instances of global persecution up in prayer. Held annually in mid-November, traditionally a month devoted to remembering the saints and martyrs of the church, the event is supported by prominent evangelical and humanitarian organizations including the World Evangelical Alliance, Open Doors, and International Christian Concern.
