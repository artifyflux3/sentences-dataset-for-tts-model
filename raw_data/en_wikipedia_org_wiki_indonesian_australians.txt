[ 2 ] Migration history [ edit ] The number of permanent settlers arriving in Australia from Indonesia since 1991 (monthly) People born in Indonesia as a percentage of the population in Sydney by postal area.

Pre-colonial era [ edit ] As early as the 1750s, that is prior to European colonisation , seamen from eastern Indonesian ports such as Kupang and Makassar regularly visited Australia's northern coast, spending about four months per year there collecting trepang or sea cucumbers to trade with China.

[ 3 ] Colonial period migration [ edit ] Beginning in the 1870s, Indonesian workers were recruited to work in colonial Australia, with almost 1,000 (primarily in Western Australia and Queensland ) residing in Australia by federation .

[ 4 ] The pearl hunting industry predominantly recruited workers from Kupang, and sugar plantations recruited migrant labourers from Java to work in Queensland .

Following federation and the enactment of the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 , the first in a series of laws that collectively formed the White Australia policy , most of these migrants returned to Indonesia.

[ 5 ] 1940s–1990s [ edit ] Beginning in 1942, thousands of Indonesians fled the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies and took refuge in Australia. Exact landing statistics were not kept due to the chaotic nature of their migration, but after the war, 3,768 repatriated to Indonesia on Australian government-provided ships.

[ 6 ] In the 1950s, roughly 10,000 people from the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), who held Dutch citizenship and previously settled in the Netherlands, migrated to Australia, bypassing the White Australia policy .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Large numbers of Chinese Indonesians began migrating to Australia in the late 1990s, fleeing the political and economic turmoil in the aftermath of the May 1998 riots and the subsequent fall of Suharto .

[ 9 ] Between 1986 and 1996, the Indonesian-Australian community increased to 12,128. According to the Immigration Museum (Melbourne) , many migrants were either students on temporary visas. However, other migrants came under either family reunion or skilled migration programs.
