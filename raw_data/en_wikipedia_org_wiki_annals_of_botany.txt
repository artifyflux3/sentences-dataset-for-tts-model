History [ edit ] Annals of Botany was established in 1887 by Isaac Bayley Balfour (Sir Isaac from 1920) and Sydney Howard Vines with support from eight other prominent botanists of the time including Sir Francis Darwin and William Turner Thiselton-Dyer (Sir William from 1899). An extensive collection of letters, minutes and accounts covering the first 125 years of the Journal's existence has been archived as the Annals of Botany Papers at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew . A two-part history has been published based on this archive.
