It is produced annually by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) and published by UNESCO on behalf of UN-Water .

The report examines how the world’s water resources are being managed and addresses the diverse water challenges faced by different regions around the globe. It highlights pressing global water issues such as access to clean water and sanitation , while also exploring cross-cutting topics like energy , climate change , agriculture , and urban growth . Additionally, the report offers recommendations for managing freshwater resources in a more sustainable manner.

The content of the report is the result of collaboration among various UN agencies that make up UN-Water , alongside contributions from governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations , and other stakeholders .

From 2003 through to 2012 , the UN WWDR was produced and released every three years , following a comprehensive approach . As of 2014 , the UN WWDR transformed into an annual, thematic report , focused on a different strategic water issue each year. Starting with the fourth edition in 2012 , the WWDR has incorporated a gender perspective to align with UNESCO’s priorities , dedicating chapters or sections specifically to discuss the significance of gender issues in water management .

The following table outlines the key themes explored in the UN WWDR from 2003 through 2025 : No.
