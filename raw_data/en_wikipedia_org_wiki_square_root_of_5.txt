Algebraic form 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} Continued fraction 2 + 1 4 + 1 4 + 1 4 + x ⋱ ⋱ {\displaystyle 2+{\cfrac {1}{4+{\cfrac {1}{4+{\cfrac {1}{4+{{\vphantom {x}} \atop \displaystyle \ddots }}}}}}}} The square root of 5 , denoted ⁠ 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ , is the positive real number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the natural number 5 . Along with its conjugate ⁠ − − 5 {\displaystyle -{\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ , it solves the quadratic equation ⁠ x 2 − − 5 = 0 {\displaystyle x^{2}-5=0} ⁠ , making it a quadratic integer , a type of algebraic number .

⁠ 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ is an irrational number , meaning it cannot be written as a fraction of integers .

[ 1 ] The first forty significant digits of its decimal expansion are: 2.23606 79774 99789 69640 91736 68731 27623 5440...

(sequence A002163 in the OEIS ).

A length of ⁠ 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ can be constructed as the diagonal of a ⁠ 2 × × 1 {\displaystyle 2\times 1} ⁠ unit rectangle .

⁠ 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ also appears throughout in the metrical geometry of shapes with fivefold symmetry; the ratio between diagonal and side of a regular pentagon is the golden ratio ⁠ φ φ = 1 2 ( 1 + 5 ) {\displaystyle \varphi ={\tfrac {1}{2}}{\bigl (}1+{\sqrt {5}}~\!{\bigr )}} ⁠ .

Rational approximations [ edit ] See also: Square root algorithms The square root of 5 is an irrational number , meaning it can not be exactly represented as a fraction ⁠ x / y {\displaystyle x/y} ⁠ where ⁠ x {\displaystyle x} ⁠ and ⁠ y {\displaystyle y} ⁠ are integers . However, it can be approximated arbitrarily closely by such rational numbers .

Particularly good approximations are the integral solutions of Pell's equations , x 2 − − 5 y 2 = 1 and x 2 − − 5 y 2 = − − 1 , {\displaystyle x^{2}-5y^{2}=1\quad {\text{and}}\quad x^{2}-5y^{2}=-1,} which can be algebraically rearranged into the form x y = 5 ± ± 1 y 2 .

{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{y}}={\sqrt {5\pm {\frac {1}{y^{2}}}}}.} For example, the approximation ⁠ 2 = 5 − − 1 {\displaystyle \textstyle 2={\sqrt {5-1}}} ⁠ , which is accurate to about 10%, satisfies the negative Pell's equation, ⁠ 2 2 − − 5 ⋅ ⋅ 1 2 = 4 − − 5 = − − 1 {\displaystyle \textstyle 2^{2}-5\cdot 1^{2}=4-5=-1} ⁠ ; likewise, the approximation ⁠ 9 4 = 5 + 1 16 = 2.25 {\displaystyle \textstyle {\tfrac {9}{4}}={\sqrt {5+{\tfrac {1}{16}}}}=2.25} ⁠ , which is accurate within 1%, satisfies the positive equation, ⁠ 9 2 − − 5 ⋅ ⋅ 4 2 = 81 − − 80 = 1 {\displaystyle \textstyle 9^{2}-5\cdot 4^{2}=81-80=1} ⁠ . These two approximations are the respective fundamental solutions of each Pell's equation, to which additional solutions are algebraically related .

Solutions to both Pell's equations can also be found systematically by following the Euclidean algorithm , resulting in the simple continued fraction for ⁠ 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ , [ 2 ] 5 = [ 2 ; 4 , 4 , 4 , … … ] = 2 + 1 4 + 1 4 + 1 4 + x ⋱ ⋱ .

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}=[2;4,4,4,\ldots {}]=2+{\cfrac {1}{4+{\cfrac {1}{4+{\cfrac {1}{4+{{\vphantom {x}} \atop \displaystyle \ddots }}}}}}}.} Each step ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ of the algorithm produces a better approximation ⁠ x n / y n {\displaystyle x_{n}/y_{n}} ⁠ , one of the convergents (partial evaluations) of this continued fraction. These are a sequence of best rational approximations to ⁠ 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ , each more accurate than any other rational approximation with the same or smaller denominator. They give all of the solutions to Pell's equations, satisfying ⁠ x n 2 − − 5 y n 2 = ( − − 1 ) n {\displaystyle \textstyle x_{n}^{2}-5y_{n}^{2}=(-1)^{n}} ⁠ .

[ 3 ] The first several convergents to the continued fraction are: [ 4 ] ⁠ n {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {n}}} ⁠ ⁠ 0 {\displaystyle 0} ⁠ ⁠ 1 {\displaystyle 1} ⁠ ⁠ 2 {\displaystyle 2} ⁠ ⁠ 3 {\displaystyle 3} ⁠ ⁠ 4 {\displaystyle 4} ⁠ ⁠ 5 {\displaystyle 5} ⁠ ⁠ 6 {\displaystyle 6} ⁠ ⁠ 7 {\displaystyle 7} ⁠ ⁠ 8 {\displaystyle 8} ⁠ ⁠ 9 {\displaystyle 9} ⁠ ⁠ … … {\displaystyle \ldots } ⁠ ⁠ x n t y n {\displaystyle {\frac {{\boldsymbol {x_{n}}}{\vphantom {t}}}{\boldsymbol {y_{n}}}}} ⁠ 1 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{0}}} 2 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {2}{1}}} 9 4 {\displaystyle {\frac {9}{4}}} 38 17 {\displaystyle {\frac {38}{17}}} 161 72 {\displaystyle {\frac {161}{72}}} 682 305 {\displaystyle {\frac {682}{305}}} 2889 1292 {\displaystyle {\frac {2889}{1292}}} 12238 5473 {\displaystyle {\frac {12238}{5473}}} 51841 23184 {\displaystyle {\frac {51841}{23184}}} 219602 98209 {\displaystyle {\frac {219602}{98209}}} … … {\displaystyle \ldots } In the limit , these approximations converge to ⁠ 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ . That is, ⁠ lim n → → ∞ ∞ x n / y n = 5 {\displaystyle \textstyle \lim _{n\to \infty }x_{n}/y_{n}={\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ .

One of the oldest methods of calculating a square root of a number ⁠ d {\displaystyle d} ⁠ , the Babylonian method , [ 5 ] starts with an initial guess ⁠ x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} ⁠ , and at each step finds a new approximation by averaging the previous approximation and ⁠ d {\displaystyle d} ⁠ times its reciprocal , ⁠ x n + 1 = 1 2 ( x n + d / x n ) {\displaystyle x_{n+1}={\tfrac {1}{2}}(x_{n}+d/x_{n})} ⁠ . This is the special case, for the function ⁠ f ( x ) = x 2 − − d {\displaystyle \textstyle f(x)=x^{2}-d} ⁠ , of Newton's method for finding the root of an arbitrary function. For a typical guess, the approximation converges quadratically (roughly doubles the number of correct digits at each step).

[ 6 ] The initial guess is somewhat arbitrary, but when approximating ⁠ 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ by this method, usually ⁠ x 0 = 2 {\displaystyle x_{0}=2} ⁠ is chosen.

[ 7 ] With this choice, the ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ th approximation is equal to the ⁠ 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} ⁠ th convergent of the continued fraction for ⁠ 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ .

Relation to the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers [ edit ] See also: Golden field The ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ √5 diagonal of a half square forms the basis for the geometrical construction of a golden rectangle .

The golden ratio ⁠ φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ⁠ is the arithmetic mean of 1 and 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} .

[ 9 ] 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} has a relationship to the golden ratio and its algebraic conjugate ⁠ φ φ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\varphi }}} ⁠ as is expressed in the following formulae: 5 = φ φ − − φ φ ¯ ¯ = 2 φ φ − − 1 = 1 − − 2 φ φ ¯ ¯ , φ φ = 1 + 5 2 = φ φ ¯ ¯ + 5 = − − 1 φ φ ¯ ¯ = 1 − − φ φ ¯ ¯ , φ φ ¯ ¯ = 1 − − 5 2 = φ φ − − 5 = − − 1 φ φ = 1 − − φ φ .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\sqrt {5}}&=\varphi -{\overline {\varphi }}=2\varphi -1=1-2{\overline {\varphi }},\\[5pt]\varphi &={\frac {1+{\sqrt {5}}}{2}}={\overline {\varphi }}+{\sqrt {5}}=-{\frac {1}{~\!{\overline {\varphi }}\!~}}=1-{\overline {\varphi }},\\[5pt]{\overline {\varphi }}&={\frac {1-{\sqrt {5}}}{2}}=\varphi -{\sqrt {5}}=-{\frac {1}{\varphi }}=1-\varphi .\end{aligned}}} 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} then figures in the closed form expression for the Fibonacci numbers : [ 10 ] F ( n ) = φ φ n − − φ φ ¯ ¯ n 5 .

{\displaystyle F(n)={\frac {\varphi ^{n}-{\overline {\varphi }}^{n}}{\sqrt {5}}}.} The quotient ⁠ 5 / φ φ {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}{\big /}\varphi } ⁠ provides an interesting pattern of continued fractions and are related to the ratios between the Fibonacci numbers and the Lucas numbers : [ 11 ] 5 φ φ = 5 − − 5 2 = 1.381966 ⋯ ⋯ = [ 1 ; 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 , … … ] {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\sqrt {5}}{\varphi }}={\frac {5-{\sqrt {5}}}{2}}&=1.381966\dots =[1;2,1,1,1,\ldots ]\end{aligned}}} The convergents feature the Lucas numbers as numerators and the Fibonacci numbers as denominators: 1 1 , 3 2 , 4 3 , 7 5 , 11 8 , 18 13 , 29 21 , … … , L n F n + 1 , … … {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1}},{\frac {3}{2}},{\frac {4}{3}},{\frac {7}{5}},{\frac {11}{8}},{\frac {18}{13}},{\frac {29}{21}},\ldots ,{\frac {L_{n}}{F_{n+1}}},\ldots } In the limit , lim n → → ∞ ∞ F n + 1 F n = L n + 1 L n = φ φ , lim n → → ∞ ∞ L n F n = 5 .

{\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {F_{n+1}}{F_{n}}}={\frac {L_{n+1}}{L_{n}}}=\varphi ,\qquad \lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {L_{n}}{F_{n}}}={\sqrt {5}}.} More precisely, the convergents to the continued fraction for ⁠ 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ (see § Rational approximations above) are: 2 1 , 9 4 , 38 17 , 161 72 , 682 305 , … … , 1 2 L 3 n 1 2 F 3 n , … … .

{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{1}},{\frac {9}{4}},{\frac {38}{17}},{\frac {161}{72}},{\frac {682}{305}},\ldots ,{\frac {{\tfrac {1}{2}}L_{3n}}{{\tfrac {1}{2}}F_{3n}}},\ldots .} Geometry [ edit ] Decomposition of a 1 × 2 right triangle into five similar triangles, the basis for the aperiodic pinwheel tiling Jay Hambidge's construction of "root rectangles" Distances between vertices of a double unit cube are square roots of the first six natural numbers . ( √7 is not possible due to Legendre's three-square theorem .) Geometrically , 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} corresponds to the diagonal of a rectangle whose sides are of length 1 and 2 , as is evident from the Pythagorean theorem . Such a rectangle can be obtained by halving a square, or by placing two equal squares side by side. This can be used to subdivide a square grid into a tilted square grid with five times as many squares, forming the basis for a subdivision surface .

[ 12 ] Together with the algebraic relationship between 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} and ⁠ φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ⁠ , this forms the basis for the geometrical construction of a golden rectangle from a square, and for the construction of a regular pentagon given its side (since the side-to-diagonal ratio in a regular pentagon is ⁠ φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ⁠ ).

Since two adjacent faces of a cube would unfold into a ⁠ 1 : 2 {\displaystyle 1\mathbin {:} 2} ⁠ rectangle, the ratio between the length of the cube's edge and the shortest distance from one of its vertices to the opposite one, when traversing the cube surface , is 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} . By contrast, the shortest distance when traversing through the inside of the cube corresponds to the length of the cube diagonal, which is the square root of three times the edge.

[ 13 ] A rectangle with side proportions 1 : 5 {\displaystyle 1\mathbin {:} {\sqrt {5}}} is part of the series of dynamic rectangles , which are based on proportions ⁠ 1 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {1}}} ⁠ , ⁠ 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} ⁠ , ⁠ 3 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}} ⁠ , ⁠ 4 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {4}}} ⁠ , ⁠ 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} ⁠ , ... and successively constructed using the diagonal of the previous root rectangle, starting from a square.

[ 14 ] A root-5 rectangle is particularly notable in that it can be split into a square and two equal golden rectangles or into two golden rectangles of different sizes.

[ 15 ] It can also be decomposed as the union of two equal golden rectangles whose intersection forms a square. These shapes pictorially represent the algebraic relationships between 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} , ⁠ φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ⁠ and ⁠ φ φ − − 1 {\displaystyle \varphi ^{-1}} ⁠ mentioned above.

Trigonometry [ edit ] The square root of 5 appears in trigonometric constants related to the angles in a regular pentagon and decagon, which when combined which can be combined with other angles involving 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} and 3 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}} to describe sines and cosines of every angle whose measure in degrees is divisible by 3 but not by 15.

[ 16 ] The simplest of these are sin ⁡ ⁡ π π 10 = sin ⁡ ⁡ 18 ∘ ∘ = 1 4 ( 5 − − 1 ) = 1 5 + 1 , sin ⁡ ⁡ π π 5 = sin ⁡ ⁡ 36 ∘ ∘ = 1 4 2 ( 5 − − 5 ) , sin ⁡ ⁡ 3 π π 10 = sin ⁡ ⁡ 54 ∘ ∘ = 1 4 ( 5 + 1 ) = 1 5 − − 1 , sin ⁡ ⁡ 2 π π 5 = sin ⁡ ⁡ 72 ∘ ∘ = 1 4 2 ( 5 + 5 ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\sin {\frac {\pi }{10}}=\sin 18^{\circ }&={\tfrac {1}{4}}({\sqrt {5}}-1)={\frac {1}{{\sqrt {5}}+1}},\\[5pt]\sin {\frac {\pi }{5}}=\sin 36^{\circ }&={\tfrac {1}{4}}{\sqrt {2(5-{\sqrt {5}})}},\\[5pt]\sin {\frac {3\pi }{10}}=\sin 54^{\circ }&={\tfrac {1}{4}}({\sqrt {5}}+1)={\frac {1}{{\sqrt {5}}-1}},\\[5pt]\sin {\frac {2\pi }{5}}=\sin 72^{\circ }&={\tfrac {1}{4}}{\sqrt {2(5+{\sqrt {5}})}}\,.\end{aligned}}} Computing its value was therefore historically important for generating trigonometric tables . Since 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} is geometrically linked to half-square rectangles and to pentagons, it also appears frequently in formulae for the geometric properties of figures derived from them, such as in the formula for the volume of a dodecahedron .

[ 13 ] Diophantine approximations [ edit ] Hurwitz's theorem in Diophantine approximations states that every irrational number x can be approximated by infinitely many rational numbers ⁠ m / n ⁠ in lowest terms in such a way that | x − − m n | < 1 5 n 2 {\displaystyle \left|x-{\frac {m}{n}}\right|<{\frac {1}{{\sqrt {5}}\,n^{2}}}} and that 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} is best possible, in the sense that for any larger constant than 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} , there are some irrational numbers x for which only finitely many such approximations exist.

[ 17 ] Closely related to this is the theorem [ 18 ] that of any three consecutive convergents ⁠ p i / q i ⁠ , ⁠ p i +1 / q i +1 ⁠ , ⁠ p i +2 / q i +2 ⁠ , of a number α , at least one of the three inequalities holds: | α α − − p i q i | < 1 5 q i 2 , | α α − − p i + 1 q i + 1 | < 1 5 q i + 1 2 , | α α − − p i + 2 q i + 2 | < 1 5 q i + 2 2 .

{\displaystyle \left|\alpha -{p_{i} \over q_{i}}\right|<{1 \over {\sqrt {5}}q_{i}^{2}},\quad \left|\alpha -{p_{i+1} \over q_{i+1}}\right|<{1 \over {\sqrt {5}}q_{i+1}^{2}},\quad \left|\alpha -{p_{i+2} \over q_{i+2}}\right|<{1 \over {\sqrt {5}}q_{i+2}^{2}}.} And the 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} in the denominator is the best bound possible since the convergents of the golden ratio make the difference on the left-hand side arbitrarily close to the value on the right-hand side.  In particular, one cannot obtain a tighter bound by considering sequences of four or more consecutive convergents.

[ 18 ] Algebra [ edit ] The two quadratic fields ⁠ Q ( 5 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} {\bigl (}{\sqrt {5}}~\!{\bigr )}} ⁠ and ⁠ Q ( − − 5 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} {\bigl (}{\sqrt {-5}}~\!{\bigr )}} ⁠ , field extensions of the rational numbers , and their associated rings of integers, ⁠ Z [ 1 2 + 1 2 5 ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} {\bigl [}{\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {5}}~\!]} ⁠ and ⁠ Z [ − − 5 ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} {\bigl [}{\sqrt {-5}}~\!]} ⁠ , respectively, are basic examples and have been studied extensively.

The ring Z [ − − 5 ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [{\sqrt {-5}}]} contains numbers of the form a + b − − 5 {\displaystyle a+b{\sqrt {-5}}} , where a and b are integers and − − 5 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {-5}}} is the imaginary number i 5 {\displaystyle i{\sqrt {5}}} . This ring is a frequently cited example of an integral domain that is not a unique factorization domain .

[ 19 ] For example, the number 6 has two inequivalent factorizations within this ring: 6 = 2 ⋅ ⋅ 3 = ( 1 − − − − 5 ) ( 1 + − − 5 ) .

{\displaystyle 6=2\cdot 3=(1-{\sqrt {-5}})(1+{\sqrt {-5}}).\,} On the other hand, the real quadratic integer ring of golden integers Z [ φ φ ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [\varphi ]} , adjoining the golden ratio φ φ = 1 2 ( 1 + 5 ) {\displaystyle \varphi ={\tfrac {1}{2}}{\bigl (}1+{\sqrt {5}}~\!{\bigr )}} , was shown to be Euclidean , and hence a unique factorization domain, by Dedekind. This is the ring of integers in the golden field ⁠ Q ( 5 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} {\bigl (}{\sqrt {5}}~\!{\bigr )}} ⁠ .

[ 20 ] The field Q [ − − 5 ] , {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} [{\sqrt {-5}}],} like any other quadratic field , is an abelian extension of the rational numbers. The Kronecker–Weber theorem therefore guarantees that the square root of five can be written as a rational linear combination of roots of unity : 5 = e 2 π π 5 i − − e 4 π π 5 i − − e 6 π π 5 i + e 8 π π 5 i .

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}=e^{{\frac {2\pi }{5}}i}-e^{{\frac {4\pi }{5}}i}-e^{{\frac {6\pi }{5}}i}+e^{{\frac {8\pi }{5}}i}.\,} [ citation needed ] Decimal calculation [ edit ] As of January 2022, the numerical value in decimal of the square root of 5 has been computed to at least 2.25 trillion digits.
