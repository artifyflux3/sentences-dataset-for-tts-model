This is a list of all spacecraft landings on other planets and bodies in the Solar System , including soft landings and both intended and unintended hard impacts . The list includes orbiters that were intentionally crashed, but not orbiters which later crashed in an unplanned manner due to orbital decay .

Colour key: – Unsuccessful soft landing, intentional hard landing, or mission still in progress.

– Successful soft landing with intelligible data return. The tannish hue indicates extraterrestrial soil.

– Successful soft landing, intelligible data return, and sample return to Earth. The greenish hue indicates terrestrial return.

– Successful soft landing, data/voice/video communication, sample return to Earth, and safe astronaut landing and return to Earth.

Moons of Saturn [ edit ] Titan Mission Country/Agency Date of landing/impact Coordinates Notes Huygens probe ESA 14 January 2005 10°17′37″S 163°10′39″E ﻿ / ﻿ 10.2936°S 163.1775°E ﻿ / -10.2936; 163.1775 Titan floating lander. Successful soft landing. Transmitted data for 90 minutes following landing.

Other bodies [ edit ] Asteroids [ edit ] Body Mission Country/Agency Date of landing/impact Notes Eros NEAR Shoemaker USA 12 February 2001 Designed as an orbiter, but an improvised landing was carried out on completion of the main mission. Transmission from the surface continued for about 16 days.

Itokawa Hayabusa Japan 19 November 2005 Accidentally stayed for 30 min.

25 November 2005 Stayed for 1 sec. Sample return (very small amount of dust successfully returned to Earth).

Ryugu Hayabusa2 Japan 21 September 2018 MINERVA-II Rover-1A and Rover-1B, deployed successfully and returned data from the surface.

France / Germany 3 October 2018 MASCOT rover, deployed successfully and returned data from the surface.

Japan 21 February 2019 Hayabusa2 first touchdown. Successfully collected sample from the surface. Sample returned to Earth on 5 December 2020.

5 April 2019 Small Carry-on Impactor (SCI), fired at surface to create a crater from which to sample sub-surface material April 2019 Deployable Camera 3, photographed the impact created by the Small carry-on Impactor. Presumed to have fallen on the asteroid.

11 July 2019 Hayabusa2 second touchdown. Successfully collected sub-surface material sample from the crater created by the SCI. Sample returned to Earth on 5 December 2020.

October 2019 MINERVA-II Rover-2, failed before deployment, so it was released in orbit around the asteroid to perform gravitational measurements before it impacted a few days later.

Bennu OSIRIS-REx USA 20 October 2020 OSIRIS-REx touchdown, collected sample from surface. Sample returned to Earth on 24 September 2023 Dimorphos Double Asteroid Redirection Test USA 26 September 2022 Intentional hard impact. First Solar System body intentionally deviated (slightly) of its orbit.

[ 20 ] Comets [ edit ] Body Mission Country/Agency Date of landing/impact Notes Comet 9P/Tempel 1 Deep Impact USA 4 July 2005 Impactor.

Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko Rosetta ESA 12 November 2014 Philae lander. Successful soft landing, but anchors misfired and Philae bounced multiple times before coming to rest. Philae transmitted briefly but could not maintain power due to its awkward landing.

29 September 2016 The Rosetta orbiter was intentionally crashed into the comet.
