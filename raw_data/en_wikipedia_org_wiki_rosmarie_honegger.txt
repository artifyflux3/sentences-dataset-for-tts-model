Rosmarie Honegger (born 1947) is a Swiss lichenologist and Emeritus Professor at the University of Zurich .

Academic career [ edit ] Honegger was born in 1947 and grew up in Emmental , Switzerland.

[ 1 ] She developed an early interest in plants, and was recommended to study lichens by a biology teacher. This led to a research project involving compiling a flora of her home town, which, in 1967, led to her earning a prize at an international science fair in San Francisco . The same year, she began studies at the University of Basel .

[ 2 ] Honegger earned her PhD in biology from the University of Basel in 1976. Her doctoral research examined the structure and function of the ascus (the spore -bearing structure) in the lichen genus Lecanora , using microscopic techniques.

[ 2 ] In 1977 she accepted a postdoctoral research position in the Institute of Plant Biology at the University of Zurich. After a time working at the University of California, Riverside she returned to Switzerland as professor in the Institute of Plant Biology of the University of Zurich.

[ 3 ] Honegger retired in 2009 [ 4 ] as Emeritus Professor.

[ 5 ] From 2011 she worked with Dianne Edwards , a palaeobotanist at the Cardiff University on lichen fossils found on the Welsh borderland.

[ 1 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Honegger was awarded the International Association for Lichenology's Acharius Medal for her lifetime work in lichenology in 2008 [ 8 ] and in 2015 she received the Linnean Medal recognising her contribution to the natural sciences.

[ 9 ] She was one of the "Fifty influential lichenologists" discussed in Ingvar Kärnefelt 's 2011 review of the scientific progress of lichenology and the scientists who study it.

[ 2 ] The standard author abbreviation Honegger is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .

[ 10 ] Among the lichens named in her honour is Xanthomendoza rosmarieae , described in 2011 by Sergey Kondratyuk and Kärnefelt.
