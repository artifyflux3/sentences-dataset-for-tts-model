[Buzz Aldrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin "Buzz Aldrin") took the first EVA "selfie" in 1966.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-NYT-20150223-1)

A **space selfie** is a [selfie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie "Selfie") (self-portrait [photograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph "Photograph") typically posted on [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media "Social media") sites[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-oxford-2)) that is taken in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"). This include selfies taken by [astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut "Astronaut")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-3) (also known as **astronaut selfies**[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-4)), machines[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-5) (also known as **space robot selfies**[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-discovery-6) and **rover selfies**[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-7)) and by indirect methods.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-8)

[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Aerospace_Exploration_Agency "Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency") astronaut [Akihiko Hoshide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihiko_Hoshide "Akihiko Hoshide") took a space selfie in September 2012.

The first known space selfie (during an EVA - an earlier shot inside the capsule was taken on [Gemini 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_10 "Gemini 10") by [Michael Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut) "Michael Collins (astronaut)")) was taken by [Buzz Aldrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin "Buzz Aldrin") during the [Gemini 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_12 "Gemini 12") mission.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-9)

The [extra-vehicular activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-vehicular_activity "Extra-vehicular activity") (EVA) equipment used by astronauts during spacewalks contains a specially designed camera for photography in outer space. The main purpose of the EVA camera is to take pictures of the subjects related to the missions.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-10)

There have been many space selfies, some of which use the [visor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visor "Visor") of another astronaut's helmet as the mirror. Early space selfies after the word "selfie" was first used in 2002[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-oxford-2) without assistance from another astronaut included [Donald Pettit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Pettit "Donald Pettit") and [Stephen Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Robinson "Stephen Robinson"). Pettit took one during the [Expedition 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_6 "Expedition 6") in January 2003.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-11) Robinson took his during the repair of the [Space Shuttle _Discovery_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Discovery "Space Shuttle Discovery")[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-12) on August 3, 2005, as part of the [STS-114](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-114 "STS-114") mission.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-13)

Another notable space selfie was taken by Japanese astronaut [Akihiko Hoshide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihiko_Hoshide "Akihiko Hoshide") during the six-hour, 28-minute spacewalk on September 5, 2012.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-15) Hoshide's photo became a [viral phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon "Viral phenomenon") after Commander [Chris Hadfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hadfield "Chris Hadfield") uploaded the photo to his [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") account on September 30, 2013.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-16) Coincidentally, [Oxford University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Press "Oxford University Press"), the publisher of the _[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_English\_Dictionary "Oxford English Dictionary")_, announced in November 2013 that "selfie" was the word of the year for 2013.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-17) The picture topped many selfie lists of the year.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-19) Another space selfie of Hoshide also showed up on [Instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram "Instagram") and appeared on a list of top selfies of 2013.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-20)

Space selfies can be dated back to 1976 when the lander of the _[Viking 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking\_2 "Viking 2")_ mission took the photo of its deck after landing on Mars; however they were not considered by [Discovery News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_News "Discovery News") as true selfies in its list of top 10 space robot selfies.

In 1989, the _[Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo\_spacecraft "Galileo spacecraft")_ spacecraft took a selfie using its near-infrared mapping spectrometer (NIMS).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-Ulivi218-21) The image was taken in order to judge how parts of the spacecraft would block the instrument's view. The resulting image was fuzzy and warped by _Galileo_'s spin.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-Ulivi218-21)

An unusual approach was taken in 2010 by [IKAROS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKAROS "IKAROS"), launched by [Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Aerospace_Exploration_Agency "Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency") (JAXA). It included two wireless cameras that were ejected out of the spacecraft for the sole purpose of taking "hand free" space selfies. A [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog "Blog") entry about the photos was posted in 2010 and the link was posted on Twitter in 2013.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-discovery-6)

[![Image 3: Autonomous robot space selfie of Orbital Express spacecraft](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Orbital_Express_3.jpg/250px-Orbital_Express_3.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orbital_Express_3.jpg)

Autonomous robot space selfie of [Orbital Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_Express "Orbital Express") spacecraft

On June 22, 2007, DARPA's [Orbital Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_Express "Orbital Express") spacecraft captured perhaps the first space selfie by an autonomous robot.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-:0-22) Taken near the end of mission on July 22, 2007, the selfie was intended to capture a family portrait of the two spacecraft in a mated configuration.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-:0-22) The selfie shows the ASTRO "servicing satellite" at left, and the NEXTSat "client satellite" at right.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-23) The robot arm used to capture the selfie can be seen in white at the bottom of the frame. The photo has a dark, high-contrast quality to it due to the use of the arm-mounted camera, not intended for general photography, but used to autonomously track and acquire the NEXTSat.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-:0-22)

Space selfie of [_Curiosity_ rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover) "Curiosity (rover)")

_[Curiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity\_(rover) "Curiosity (rover)")_, which landed on Mars in 2012, was equipped with the [Mars Hand Lens Imager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Hand_Lens_Imager "Mars Hand Lens Imager") (MAHLI) camera. It can maneuver its robotic arm and turn the attached camera around to take its head shots.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-24)[Discovery News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_News "Discovery News") described the maneuver as the way to take a truly authentic selfie and gave it the title _King of Selfies_ in 2013.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-discovery-6)

The first space selfie on another planet was taken by the _Curiosity_ rover[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-26) on September 7, 2012, based on the local time at [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory "Jet Propulsion Laboratory"), the base of the operations in [Pasadena, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California "Pasadena, California"). It was taken while the clear dust cover of the lens was closed giving a blurry image.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-27) The image was slightly modified and posted on its Facebook account on September 8, 2012, with the message:[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-28)

> Hello, Gorgeous! Snapped this self portrait while inspecting my MAHLI camera with its dust cover intentionally left on. This was a test to make sure the cover, its hinge the area it sweeps when it opens are clear of debris.

On November 19, 2013,[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-29) one day after Oxford announced that "selfie" was the word of the year,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-oxford-2) the _@MarsCuriosity_[Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") account posted a space selfie with the message:[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-30)

> Oh, @OxfordWords... Need an illustration for #WOTYselfie? For your consideration. pic.twitter.com/EKNafzYsyp

In February 2018, the [_Opportunity_ rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover) "Opportunity (rover)") used its MER Microscopic Imager to take a selfie to mark 5,000 [sols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_(Day_on_Mars) "Sol (Day on Mars)") on Mars.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-Ellison-31) The MER Microscopic Imager has a fixed focus and a fairly narrow field of view resulting in the selfie having to be made up of a series of stitched, out of focus shots.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-Ellison-31) In order to reduce the amount of data that needed to be transmitted the images were scaled down in size and compressed before being transmitted from the rover.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-Ellison-31) This was the first time images from the MER Microscopic Imager had been scaled down by the rover.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-Ellison-31)

During a brief period, an alternative method was presented as available by which a person could, without being in outer space, indirectly take space selfies. This was promoted as part of the [crowdfunding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding "Crowdfunding") efforts for the [Planetary Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_Resources "Planetary Resources")'s ARKYD mission. The ARKYD "space selfie" method would have allowed donors to upload their own photos to the [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") orbiting the Earth; the telescope would have had a robotic arm equipped with a camera and a small [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_visual_display "Electronic visual display") to display the picture of the donor on one surface of the telescope, and the on-screen image of the donor was to be visible to the lower part of the camera (with the Earth as the background) allowing a space selfie to be taken.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-34)

A similar service was launched in 2014 by Belgian startup SpaceBooth.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-35) The SpaceBooth [Low Earth Orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_Orbit "Low Earth Orbit") pico-satellite will project uploaded images in front of a transparent window and then take a picture of the projection with space in the background. The space selfie will then be sent back to the Earth.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-36)

In November 2019, Spelfie, the selfie from space, was launched to allow users to take a selfie at the exact time that a satellite camera captures their location from space.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-37)

Users of the app click on the event they are attending, then, once they are at the venue, the app provides coordinates so the user knows precisely where to position themselves and at what time. They then take a photo of themselves at the moment the satellite is taking its photo and later the same day the app sends back the satellite image juxtaposed with the selfie to be viewed in its gallery.

The tool, which uses [Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus "Airbus") satellites, was demonstrated as part of a BBC documentary showing a village of people spelling out the words Act Now on a beach in Bali, with the image captured on camera from space.

Spelfie is primarily aimed at people attending major sports and cultural events but for its second phase of development, the app will extend beyond specific events and allow users to give a specific location anywhere in the world, and be alerted if the satellite is going to pass overhead.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-38)

CrunchLabs, founded by YouTuber [Mark Rober](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rober "Mark Rober"), currently offers space selfies as a service via its satellite SatGus. Customers can upload their selfies, which are then displayed on the satellite's external screen and photographed using an onboard camera with Earth in the background.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_selfie#cite_note-39)
