For the lunar crater, see Abul Wáfa (crater) .

Abu al-Wafa' al-Buzjani Born ( 940-06-10 ) 10 June 940 Buzhgan , Iran Died 15 July 998 (998-07-15) (aged 58) Baghdad Academic background Influences Al-Battani Academic work Era Islamic Golden Age Main interests Mathematics and astronomy Notable works Almagest of Abū al-Wafā' Notable ideas Tangent function Law of sines Several trigonometric identities Influenced Al-Biruni , Abu Nasr Mansur Abū al-Wafāʾ Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ismāʿīl ibn al-ʿAbbās al-Būzjānī or Abū al-Wafā Būzhjānī ( Persian : ابو الوفا بوژگانی , Arabic : ابو الوفا بوزجانی ; [ 1 ] 10 June 940 – 15 July 998) [ 2 ] was a Persian [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] mathematician and astronomer who worked in Baghdad . He made important innovations in spherical trigonometry , and his work on arithmetic for businessmen contains the first instance of using negative numbers in a medieval Islamic text.

He is also credited with compiling the tables of sines and tangents at 15 ' intervals. He also introduced the secant and cosecant functions, as well studied the interrelations between the six trigonometric lines associated with an arc.

[ 2 ] His Almagest was widely read by medieval Arabic astronomers in the centuries after his death. He is known to have written several other books that have not survived.

Life [ edit ] He was born in Buzhgan , (now Torbat-e Jam ) in Khorasan (in today's Iran). At age 19, in 959, he moved to Baghdad and remained there until his death in 998.

[ 2 ] He was a contemporary of the distinguished scientists Abū Sahl al-Qūhī and al-Sijzi who were in Baghdad at the time and others such as Abu Nasr Mansur , Abu-Mahmud Khojandi , Kushyar Gilani and al-Biruni .

[ 6 ] In Baghdad, he received patronage from members of the Buyid court.

[ 7 ] Astronomy [ edit ] Abu al-Wafa' was the first to build a wall quadrant to observe the sky.

[ 6 ] It has been suggested that he was influenced by the works of al-Battani as the latter described a quadrant instrument in his Kitāb az-Zīj .

[ 6 ] His use of the concept of the tangent helped solve problems involving right-angled spherical triangles .  He developed a new technique to calculate sine tables, allowing him to construct more accurate tables than his predecessors.

[ 7 ] In 997, he participated in an experiment to determine the difference in local time between his location, Baghdad, and that of al-Biruni (who was living in Kath, now a part of Uzbekistan ).

[ 8 ] The result was very close to present-day calculations, showing a difference of approximately 1 hour between the two longitudes. Abu al-Wafa is also known to have worked with Abū Sahl al-Qūhī , who was a famous maker of astronomical instruments.

[ 7 ] While what is extant from his works lacks theoretical innovation, his observational data were used by many later astronomers, including al-Biruni.

[ 7 ] Almagest [ edit ] Among his works on astronomy, only the first seven treatises of his Almagest ( Kitāb al-Majisṭī ) are now extant.

[ 9 ] The work covers numerous topics in the fields of plane and spherical trigonometry , planetary theory, and solutions to determine the direction of Qibla .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Mathematics [ edit ] He defined the tangent function, and he established several trigonometric identities in their modern form, where the ancient Greek mathematicians had expressed the equivalent identities in terms of chords.

[ 10 ] The trigonometric identities he introduced were: sin ⁡ ⁡ ( a ± ± b ) = sin ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) cos ⁡ ⁡ ( b ) ± ± cos ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) sin ⁡ ⁡ ( b ) {\displaystyle \sin(a\pm b)=\sin(a)\cos(b)\pm \cos(a)\sin(b)} cos ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 a ) = 1 − − 2 sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) {\displaystyle \cos(2a)=1-2\sin ^{2}(a)} sin ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 a ) = 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) cos ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) {\displaystyle \sin(2a)=2\sin(a)\cos(a)} He has discovered the law of tangents [ 11 ] and may have discovered the law of sines for spherical triangles , however, other scholars like Abu-Mahmud Khojandi have been credited with the latter achievement: [ 12 ] sin ⁡ ⁡ A sin ⁡ ⁡ a = sin ⁡ ⁡ B sin ⁡ ⁡ b = sin ⁡ ⁡ C sin ⁡ ⁡ c {\displaystyle {\frac {\sin A}{\sin a}}={\frac {\sin B}{\sin b}}={\frac {\sin C}{\sin c}}} where A , B , C {\displaystyle A,B,C} are the sides of the triangle (measured in radians on the unit sphere) and a , b , c {\displaystyle a,b,c} are the opposing angles.

[ 10 ] Some sources suggest that he introduced the tangent function, although other sources give the credit for this innovation to al-Marwazi .

[ 10 ] Works [ edit ] Almagest ( كتاب المجسطي Kitāb al-Majisṭī ).

A book of zij called Zīj al-wāḍiḥ ( زيج الواضح ), no longer extant.

[ 7 ] "A Book on Those Geometric Constructions Which Are Necessary for a Craftsman", ( كتاب في ما یحتاج إليه الصانع من الأعمال الهندسية Kitāb fī mā yaḥtāj ilayh al-ṣāniʿ min al-aʿmāl al-handasiyya ).

[ 13 ] This text contains over one hundred geometric constructions, including for a regular heptagon , which have been reviewed and compared with other mathematical treatises. The legacy of this text in Latin Europe is still debated.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] "A Book on What Is Necessary from the Science of Arithmetic for Scribes and Businessmen", ( كتاب في ما يحتاج إليه الكتاب والعمال من علم الحساب Kitāb fī mā yaḥtāj ilayh al-kuttāb wa’l-ʿummāl min ʾilm al-ḥisāb ).

[ 13 ] This is the first book where negative numbers have been used in the medieval Islamic texts.

[ 7 ] He also wrote translations and commentaries on the algebraic works of Diophantus , al-Khwārizmī , and Euclid 's Elements .

[ 7 ] Legacy [ edit ] The crater Abul Wáfa on the Moon is named after him.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] On 10 June 2015, Google changed its logo in memory of Abu al-Wafa' Buzjani.

The science of trigonometry as known today was established by Islamic mathematicians. One of the most important of these was the Persian Abu' l-Wafa' Buzjani (d. 997 or 998), who wrote a work called the Almagest dealing mostly with trigonometry ^ Subtelny, Maria E. (2007).
