 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Mathematical Concept

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **Voigt notation** or **Voigt form** in [multilinear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_algebra "Multilinear algebra") is a way to represent a [symmetric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_tensor "Symmetric tensor") by reducing its order.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voigt_notation#cite_note-Voigt-1) There are a few variants and associated names for this idea: **Mandel notation**, **Mandel–Voigt notation** and **Nye notation** are others found. **Kelvin notation** is a revival by Helbig[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voigt_notation#cite_note-Helbig-2) of old ideas of [Lord Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kelvin "Lord Kelvin"). The differences here lie in certain weights attached to the selected entries of the tensor. Nomenclature may vary according to what is traditional in the field of application. The notation is named after physicists [Woldemar Voigt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woldemar_Voigt "Woldemar Voigt")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voigt_notation#cite_note-Voigt-1)&[John Nye (scientist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nye_(scientist) "John Nye (scientist)").

For example, a 2×2 symmetric tensor _X_ has only three distinct elements, the two on the diagonal and the other being off-diagonal. Thus its rank can be reduced by expressing it as a vector without loss of information:

X=[x 11 x 12 x 12 x 22]=[x 11 x 22 x 12].{\displaystyle X={\begin{bmatrix}x_{11}&x_{12}\\x_{12}&x_{22}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}x_{11}\\x_{22}\\x_{12}\end{bmatrix}}.}![Image 36: {\displaystyle X={\begin{bmatrix}x_{11}&x_{12}\\x_{12}&x_{22}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}x_{11}\\x_{22}\\x_{12}\end{bmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f3403171294463c730b178b2ccc0777b3df49e6)

Voigt notation is used in [materials science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science "Materials science") to simplify the representation of the rank-2 stress and strain tensors, and fourth-rank stiffness and compliance tensors.

The 3×3 [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_stress_tensor "Cauchy stress tensor") and [strain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(mechanics)#Strain_tensor "Strain (mechanics)") tensors in their full forms can be written as:

σ=[σ 11 σ 12 σ 13 σ 21 σ 22 σ 23 σ 31 σ 32 σ 33]{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}={\begin{bmatrix}\sigma _{11}&\sigma _{12}&\sigma _{13}\\\sigma _{21}&\sigma _{22}&\sigma _{23}\\\sigma _{31}&\sigma _{32}&\sigma _{33}\end{bmatrix}}\quad }![Image 37: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}={\begin{bmatrix}\sigma _{11}&\sigma _{12}&\sigma _{13}\\\sigma _{21}&\sigma _{22}&\sigma _{23}\\\sigma _{31}&\sigma _{32}&\sigma _{33}\end{bmatrix}}\quad }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/668d367a8593e355558d8732f8334b4f599cdc81) and ε=[ε 11 ε 12 ε 13 ε 21 ε 22 ε 23 ε 31 ε 32 ε 33]{\displaystyle \quad {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}={\begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon _{11}&\varepsilon _{12}&\varepsilon _{13}\\\varepsilon _{21}&\varepsilon _{22}&\varepsilon _{23}\\\varepsilon _{31}&\varepsilon _{32}&\varepsilon _{33}\end{bmatrix}}}![Image 38: {\displaystyle \quad {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}={\begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon _{11}&\varepsilon _{12}&\varepsilon _{13}\\\varepsilon _{21}&\varepsilon _{22}&\varepsilon _{23}\\\varepsilon _{31}&\varepsilon _{32}&\varepsilon _{33}\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/be2a3354b2216c845025c808fca242ee5ea418b7).
Voigt notation then utilises the symmetry of these matrices (σ 12=σ 21{\displaystyle \sigma _{12}=\sigma _{21}}![Image 39: {\displaystyle \sigma _{12}=\sigma _{21}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/67a18cec116597945dace5009f601b570edb9c84) and so on) to express them instead as a 6×1 vector:

σ _=[σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 σ 4 σ 5 σ 6]:=[σ 11 σ 22 σ 33 σ 23 σ 13 σ 12]{\displaystyle {\underline {\sigma }}={\begin{bmatrix}\sigma _{1}\\\sigma _{2}\\\sigma _{3}\\\sigma _{4}\\\sigma _{5}\\\sigma _{6}\end{bmatrix}}:={\begin{bmatrix}\sigma _{11}\\\sigma _{22}\\\sigma _{33}\\\sigma _{23}\\\sigma _{13}\\\sigma _{12}\end{bmatrix}}\quad }![Image 40: {\displaystyle {\underline {\sigma }}={\begin{bmatrix}\sigma _{1}\\\sigma _{2}\\\sigma _{3}\\\sigma _{4}\\\sigma _{5}\\\sigma _{6}\end{bmatrix}}:={\begin{bmatrix}\sigma _{11}\\\sigma _{22}\\\sigma _{33}\\\sigma _{23}\\\sigma _{13}\\\sigma _{12}\end{bmatrix}}\quad }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2d66ee4485db047af1b090a3b36d4cc5dcbc1886) and ε _=[ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 ε 4 ε 5 ε 6]:=[ε 11 ε 22 ε 33 γ 23 γ 13 γ 12]{\displaystyle \quad {\underline {\varepsilon }}={\begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon _{1}\\\varepsilon _{2}\\\varepsilon _{3}\\\varepsilon _{4}\\\varepsilon _{5}\\\varepsilon _{6}\end{bmatrix}}:={\begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon _{11}\\\varepsilon _{22}\\\varepsilon _{33}\\\gamma _{23}\\\gamma _{13}\\\gamma _{12}\end{bmatrix}}}![Image 41: {\displaystyle \quad {\underline {\varepsilon }}={\begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon _{1}\\\varepsilon _{2}\\\varepsilon _{3}\\\varepsilon _{4}\\\varepsilon _{5}\\\varepsilon _{6}\end{bmatrix}}:={\begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon _{11}\\\varepsilon _{22}\\\varepsilon _{33}\\\gamma _{23}\\\gamma _{13}\\\gamma _{12}\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/82c8f95fe651c845eed239314564a2527005a738)

Mnemonic rule

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voigt_notation&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Mnemonic rule")]

A simple [mnemonic rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic") for memorizing Voigt notation is as follows:

*   Write down the second order tensor in matrix form (in the example, the stress tensor)
*   Strike out the diagonal
*   Continue on the third column
*   Go back to the first element along the first row.

Voigt indexes are numbered consecutively from the starting point to the end (in the example, the numbers in blue).

Mandel notation

Thus it can be expressed, in Mandel notation,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voigt_notation#cite_note-3) as the vector σ~M=⟨σ 11,σ 22,σ 33,2 σ 23,2 σ 13,2 σ 12⟩.{\displaystyle {\tilde {\sigma }}^{M}=\langle \sigma _{11},\sigma _{22},\sigma _{33},{\sqrt {2}}\sigma _{23},{\sqrt {2}}\sigma _{13},{\sqrt {2}}\sigma _{12}\rangle .}![Image 52: {\displaystyle {\tilde {\sigma }}^{M}=\langle \sigma _{11},\sigma _{22},\sigma _{33},{\sqrt {2}}\sigma _{23},{\sqrt {2}}\sigma _{13},{\sqrt {2}}\sigma _{12}\rangle .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/420d6db92f7498c4e73b9a532ab9197669d372bd)

The main advantage of Mandel notation is to allow the use of the same conventional operations used with vectors, for example: σ~:σ~=σ~M⋅σ~M=σ 11 2+σ 22 2+σ 33 2+2 σ 23 2+2 σ 13 2+2 σ 12 2.{\displaystyle {\tilde {\sigma }}:{\tilde {\sigma }}={\tilde {\sigma }}^{M}\cdot {\tilde {\sigma }}^{M}=\sigma _{11}^{2}+\sigma _{22}^{2}+\sigma _{33}^{2}+2\sigma _{23}^{2}+2\sigma _{13}^{2}+2\sigma _{12}^{2}.}![Image 53: {\displaystyle {\tilde {\sigma }}:{\tilde {\sigma }}={\tilde {\sigma }}^{M}\cdot {\tilde {\sigma }}^{M}=\sigma _{11}^{2}+\sigma _{22}^{2}+\sigma _{33}^{2}+2\sigma _{23}^{2}+2\sigma _{13}^{2}+2\sigma _{12}^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f4042159ce496883153dbb773d5e30c86a5f5e9f)

Applications
------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voigt_notation&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Applications")]

It is useful, for example, in calculations involving constitutive models to simulate materials, such as the generalized [Hooke's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law "Hooke's law"), as well as [finite element analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_analysis "Finite element analysis"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voigt_notation#cite_note-4) and [Diffusion MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI "Diffusion MRI").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voigt_notation#cite_note-5)

Hooke's law has a symmetric fourth-order [stiffness tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness_tensor "Stiffness tensor") with 81 components (3×3×3×3), but because the application of such a rank-4 tensor to a symmetric rank-2 tensor must yield another symmetric rank-2 tensor, not all of the 81 elements are independent. Voigt notation enables such a rank-4 tensor to be _represented_ by a 6×6 matrix. However, Voigt's form does not preserve the sum of the squares, which in the case of Hooke's law has geometric significance. This explains why weights are introduced (to make the mapping an [isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry")).

A discussion of invariance of Voigt's notation and Mandel's notation can be found in Helnwein (2001).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voigt_notation#cite_note-Helnwein-6)
