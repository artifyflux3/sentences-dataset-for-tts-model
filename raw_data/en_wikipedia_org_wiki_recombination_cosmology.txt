From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), **recombination** refers to the [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy) "Epoch (astronomy)") during which charged [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") first became [bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state "Bound state") to form [electrically neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge")[hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen")[atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"). Recombination occurred about 378 000 years[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-Olive_Peacock2017-1) after the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") (at a [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_redshift "Cosmic redshift") of _z_=1100).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-FOOTNOTERyden2003159-2) The word "recombination" is misleading, since the Big Bang theory does not posit that protons and electrons had been combined before, but the name exists for historical reasons since it was named before the Big Bang hypothesis became the primary theory of the birth of the universe.

Immediately after the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"), the universe was a hot, dense [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") of [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), [leptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton "Lepton"), and [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark"): the [quark epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_epoch "Quark epoch"). At 10−6 seconds, the Universe had expanded and cooled sufficiently to allow for the formation of [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton"): the [hadron epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron_epoch "Hadron epoch"). This plasma was effectively opaque to electromagnetic radiation due to [Thomson scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_scattering "Thomson scattering") by free electrons, as the [mean free path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path "Mean free path") each photon could travel before encountering an electron was very short. This is the current state of the interior of the Sun. As the universe [expanded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space "Metric expansion of space"), it also cooled. Eventually, the universe cooled to the point that the radiation field could not immediately ionize neutral hydrogen, and atoms became energetically favored.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-3) The fraction of free electrons and protons as compared to neutral hydrogen decreased to a few parts in 10 000.

Recombination involves electrons binding to protons (hydrogen nuclei) to form neutral [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen")[atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"). Because direct recombinations to the [ground state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_state "Ground state") (lowest energy) of hydrogen are very inefficient,[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons in a high energy state, and the electrons quickly transition to their low energy state by emitting [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"). Two main pathways exist: from the 2p state by emitting a [Lyman-a photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_series "Lyman series") – these photons will almost always be reabsorbed by another hydrogen atom in its ground state – or from the 2s state by emitting two photons, which is very slow.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

This production of photons is known as [decoupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling_(cosmology) "Decoupling (cosmology)"), which leads to recombination sometimes being called **photon decoupling**, but recombination and photon decoupling are distinct events. Once photons decoupled from matter, they [traveled freely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_stream "Free stream") through the universe without interacting with matter and constitute what is observed today as [cosmic microwave background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation "Cosmic microwave background radiation") (in that sense, the cosmic background radiation is [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared "Infrared") and some red [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation "Black-body radiation") emitted when the universe was at a temperature of some 3000 K, [redshifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift") by a factor of 1100 from the visible spectrum to the [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") spectrum).

Recombination time frames
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recombination_(cosmology)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Recombination time frames")]

The time frame for recombination can be estimated from the time dependence of the temperature of the [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background") (CMB).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-4) The microwave background is a [blackbody spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody_spectrum "Blackbody spectrum") representing the photons present at recombination, shifted in energy by the expansion of the universe. A blackbody is completely characterized by its temperature; the shift is called the [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift") denoted by _z_: ![Image 1: {\displaystyle T_{\text{CMB}}=\mathrm {2.7~K} \times (1+z)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5e1544b5dae5dcd84a725b1ce45acc38f9fcdd46) where 2.7 K is today's temperature.

The thermal energy at the peak of the blackbody spectrum is the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant"), k B, times the temperature, ![Image 2: {\displaystyle k_{B}T_{\text{CMB}}(z)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9809f9d4ca4cd86b2a7cf4a7b608d4beb3265f19) but simply comparing this to the ionization energy of hydrogen atoms will not consider the spectrum of energies. A better estimate evaluates the thermal equilibrium between matter (atoms) and radiation. The density of photons, ![Image 3: {\displaystyle n_{\gamma }(E>Q_{H})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ae83f64eca570cacc33ddc371f1d7b229f4f92b) with energy _E_ sufficient to ionize hydrogen is the total density times a factor from the equilibrium [Boltzmann distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution "Boltzmann distribution"): ![Image 4: {\displaystyle n_{\gamma }(E>Q_{H})=n_{\gamma }\exp \left({\frac {-Q_{H}}{k_{B}T_{\text{CMB}}(z)}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b005b1b04bf721433ce286a9364ce33d7b8c4c42) At equilibrium this will approximately equal the matter (baryon) density. The ratio of baryons to photons, ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \eta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4d701857cf5fbec133eebaf94deadf722537f64), is known from several sources[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-Olive_Peacock2017-1) including measurements by the [Planck satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_satellite "Planck satellite") to be around 10-9. Solving for ![Image 6: {\displaystyle z_{\text{rec}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7097763929922a32e3b9fc2e24eb58a65a13323b) gives value around 1100, which converts to a [cosmic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_time "Cosmic time") value around 400,000 years.

Recombination history of hydrogen
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recombination_(cosmology)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Recombination history of hydrogen")]

The cosmic ionization history is generally described in terms of the free electron fraction _x_ e as a function of [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift"). It is the ratio of the abundance of free electrons to the total abundance of hydrogen (both neutral and ionized). Denoting by _n_ e the number density of free electrons, _n_ H that of atomic hydrogen and _n_ p that of ionized hydrogen (i.e. protons), _x_ e is defined as

![Image 7: {\displaystyle x_{\text{e}}={\frac {n_{\text{e}}}{n_{\text{p}}+n_{\text{H}}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2d370cc761e7eec8976df19cb50fa2ff14f1ab41)
Since hydrogen only recombines once helium is fully neutral, charge neutrality implies _n_ e = _n_ p, i.e. _x_ e is also the fraction of ionized hydrogen.

### Rough estimate from equilibrium theory

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recombination_(cosmology)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Rough estimate from equilibrium theory")]

It is possible to find a rough estimate of the redshift of the recombination epoch assuming the recombination reaction ![Image 8: {\displaystyle p+e^{-}\longleftrightarrow H+\gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6543967a3b807094c09e402e2c654e64e4be9762) is fast enough that it proceeds near thermal equilibrium. The relative abundance of free electrons, protons and neutral hydrogen is then given by the [Saha equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saha_equation "Saha equation"):

![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\frac {n_{\text{p}}n_{\text{e}}}{n_{\text{H}}}}=\left({\frac {m_{\text{e}}k_{\text{B}}T}{2\pi \hbar ^{2}}}\right)^{\frac {3}{2}}\exp \left(-{\frac {E_{\text{I}}}{k_{\text{B}}T}}\right),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31281d0b10f35cd7cd8cf04ae60e7b50aa2ac0bd)
where _m_ e is the [mass of the electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_rest_mass "Electron rest mass"), _k_ B is the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant"), _T_ is the temperature, _ħ_ is the [reduced Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_Planck_constant "Reduced Planck constant"), and _E_ I = 13.6 eV is the [ionization energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_energy "Ionization energy") of hydrogen.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-FOOTNOTERyden2003157-5) Charge neutrality requires _n_ e=_n_ p, and the Saha equation can be rewritten in terms of the free electron fraction _x_ e:

![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\frac {x_{\text{e}}^{2}}{1-x_{\text{e}}}}=(n_{\text{H}}+n_{\text{p}})^{-1}\left({\frac {m_{\text{e}}k_{\text{B}}T}{2\pi \hbar ^{2}}}\right)^{\frac {3}{2}}\exp \left(-{\frac {E_{\text{I}}}{k_{\text{B}}T}}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f8a2cf194db7ed84fd0b888d9148879c3a3c3530)
All quantities in the right-hand side are known functions of z, the [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_redshift "Cosmological redshift"): the temperature is given by _T_ = (1 + _z_) × 2.728 K,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-FOOTNOTELongair200832-6) and the total density of hydrogen (neutral and ionized) is given by _n_ p + _n_ H = (1 + _z_)3 × 1.6 m−3.

Solving this equation for a 50 percent ionization fraction yields a recombination temperature of roughly 4000[K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin"), corresponding to redshift _z_=1500.

### Effective three-level atom

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recombination_(cosmology)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Effective three-level atom")]

In 1968, physicists [Jim Peebles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Peebles "Jim Peebles")[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPeebles1968-7) in the US and [Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Borisovich_Zel%27dovich "Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich") and collaborators[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-8) in the USSR independently computed the non-equilibrium recombination history of hydrogen. The basic elements of the model are the following.

*   Direct recombinations to the ground state of hydrogen are very inefficient: each such event leads to a photon with energy greater than 13.6 eV, which almost immediately re-ionizes a neighboring hydrogen atom.
*   Electrons therefore only efficiently recombine to the excited states of hydrogen, from which they cascade very quickly down to the first excited state, with [principal quantum number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_quantum_number "Principal quantum number")_n_ = 2.
*   From the first excited state, electrons can reach the ground state _n_ = 1 through two pathways: 
    *   Decay from the 2p state by emitting a [Lyman-α photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_series "Lyman series"). This photon will almost always be reabsorbed by another hydrogen atom in its ground state. However, cosmological redshifting systematically decreases the photon frequency, and there is a small chance that it escapes reabsorption if it gets redshifted far enough from the Lyman-α line resonant frequency before encountering another hydrogen atom.
    *   Decay from the 2s state by emitting two photons. This [two-photon decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two-photon_decay&action=edit&redlink=1 "Two-photon decay (page does not exist)") process is very slow, with a rate[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-9) of 8.22 s−1. It is however competitive with the slow rate of Lyman-α escape in producing ground-state hydrogen.

*   Atoms in the first excited state may also be re-ionized by the ambient [CMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background") photons before they reach the ground state. When this is the case, it is as if the recombination to the excited state did not happen in the first place. To account for this possibility, Peebles defines the factor _C_ as the probability that an atom in the first excited state reaches the ground state through either of the two pathways described above before being photoionized.

This model is usually described as an "effective three-level atom" as it requires keeping track of hydrogen under three forms: in its ground state, in its first excited state (assuming all the higher excited states are in [Boltzmann equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution "Boltzmann distribution") with it), and in its ionized state.

Accounting for these processes, the recombination history is then described by the [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation")

![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\frac {dx_{\text{e}}}{dt}}=-C\left(\alpha _{\text{B}}(T)n_{\text{p}}x_{e}-4(1-x_{\text{e}})\beta _{\text{B}}(T)e^{-E_{21}/T}\right),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f6f34ce165922b75cfdc2ec42df75fbcf7e2711e)
where α B is the "case B" recombination coefficient to the excited states of hydrogen, β B is the corresponding photoionization rate and _E_ 21 = 10.2 eV is the energy of the first excited state. Note that the second term in the right-hand side of the above equation can be obtained by a [detailed balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detailed_balance "Detailed balance") argument. The equilibrium result given in the previous section would be recovered by setting the left-hand side to zero, i.e. assuming that the net rates of recombination and photoionization are large in comparison to the [Hubble expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_expansion "Hubble expansion") rate, which sets the overall evolution timescale for the temperature and density. However, _C_ α B _n_ p is comparable to the Hubble expansion rate, and even gets significantly lower at low redshifts, leading to an evolution of the free electron fraction much slower than what one would obtain from the Saha equilibrium calculation. With modern values of cosmological parameters, one finds that the universe is 90% neutral at _z_ ≈ 1070.

### Modern developments

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recombination_(cosmology)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Modern developments")]

The simple effective three-level atom model described above accounts for the most important physical processes. However it does rely on approximations that lead to errors on the predicted recombination history at the level of 10% or so. Due to the importance of recombination for the precise prediction of [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background") anisotropies,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-10) several research groups have revisited the details of this picture over the last two decades.

The refinements to the theory can be divided into two categories:

*   Accounting for the non-equilibrium populations of the highly excited states of hydrogen. This effectively amounts to modifying the recombination coefficient _α_ B.
*   Accurately computing the rate of Lyman-α escape and the effect of these photons on the 2s–1s transition. This requires solving a time-dependent [radiative transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_transfer "Radiative transfer") equation. In addition, one needs to account for higher-order [Lyman transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_series "Lyman series"). These refinements effectively amount to a modification of Peebles' _C_ factor.

Modern recombination theory is believed to be accurate at the level of 0.1%, and is implemented in publicly available fast recombination codes.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-12)

Primordial helium recombination
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recombination_(cosmology)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Primordial helium recombination")]

[Helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium") nuclei are produced during [Big Bang nucleosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis "Big Bang nucleosynthesis"), and make up about 24% of the total mass of [baryonic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon "Baryon"). The [ionization energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_energy "Ionization energy") of helium is larger than that of hydrogen and it therefore recombines earlier. Because neutral helium carries two electrons, its recombination proceeds in two steps. The first recombination, ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathrm {He} ^{2+}+\mathrm {e} ^{-}\longrightarrow \mathrm {He} ^{+}+\gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dfed3b7b185b9140623233a1c597cbd7399c19d6) proceeds near Saha equilibrium and takes place around redshift _z_ ≈ 6000.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-13) The second recombination, ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \mathrm {He} ^{+}+\mathrm {e} ^{-}\longrightarrow \mathrm {He} +\gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f1ed6e03f84145311b373f75a886e688396328d1), is slower than what would be predicted from Saha equilibrium and takes place around redshift _z_ ≈ 2000.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-14) The details of helium recombination are less critical than those of hydrogen recombination for the prediction of [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background") anisotropies, since the universe is still very optically thick after helium has recombined and before hydrogen has started its recombination.

Primordial light barrier
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recombination_(cosmology)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Primordial light barrier")]

Prior to recombination, photons were not able to freely travel through the universe, as they constantly [scattered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_scattering "Thomson scattering") off the free electrons and protons. This scattering causes a loss of information, and "there is therefore a photon barrier at a redshift" near that of recombination that prevents us from using photons directly to learn about the universe at larger redshifts.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-FOOTNOTELongair2008280-15) Once recombination had occurred, however, the mean free path of photons greatly increased due to the lower number of free electrons. Shortly after recombination, the photon mean free path became larger than the [Hubble length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_sphere "Hubble sphere"), and photons traveled freely without interacting with matter.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPadmanabhan1993115-16) For this reason, recombination is closely associated with the last scattering surface, which is the name for the last time at which the photons in the cosmic microwave background interacted with matter.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-FOOTNOTELongair2008281-17) However, these two events are distinct, and in a universe with different values for the baryon-to-photon ratio and matter density, recombination and photon decoupling need not have occurred at the same epoch.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPadmanabhan1993115-16)
