[ 3 ] [ 6 ] He worked at Schussenrieder Street, 29. Soon afterwards he started operating in a fabric factory under the name "Einstein & Erlanger". The business was partly owned by his family and closed in 1938; Einstein had to work as a factory worker at a butter factory in Riedlingen.

[ 7 ] [ 3 ] On 21 February 1945, he was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp , [ 8 ] [ 3 ] but he survived and returned to Bad Buchau in late June 1945, now in the French occupation zone .

In September 1946, Einstein wrote a letter on the transport of the Jews taken to Stuttgart in 1942, he reports that he accompanied the transport to Stuttgart, he cared for the victims and also counted them. In April 1947, Einstein wrote another letter regarding the transport to Theresienstadt in 1942, that the Nazi paramedics had sent some of their relatives and acquaintances to the concentration camp.

[ 3 ] [ 9 ] The 270 Jews who lived in the city of Buchau were deported in the Holocaust; only Einstein and three others returned to the city after the war.

[ n 6 ] In 1950, Einstein purchased the land from the Synagoge (Bad Buchau) [ de ] (destroyed by the Nazis in 1938). Einstein planted a weeping willow in 1951, and the space was opened to the public. Today the space belongs to Jost Einstein, Siegbert's grandson, who is the director of the Center for Nature Conservation of Bad Buchau.

[ 8 ] Personal life [ edit ] After the end of the war, Siegbert married Elsa Schlittler; because she was Aryan , Siegbert had additional privileges under the Nazis.
