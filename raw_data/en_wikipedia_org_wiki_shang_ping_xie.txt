Known best for his research on interaction between the world's oceans and atmosphere and on El Niño–Southern Oscillation , Xie is noted as a Highly Cited Researcher by Clarivate .

[ 2 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Xie was born in Quzhou in 1963.

[ 3 ] He entered university after the Cultural Revolution had ended, and studied oceanography, though he had never seen the ocean before.

[ 4 ] His education includes: [ 5 ] Bachelor of Science , Shandong College of Oceanography ( Ocean University of China ), 1984 [ 6 ] Study at Dalian College of Foreign Languages , 1984–85 Master of Science , Tohoku University , 1988 Doctor of Science , Tohoku University , 1991 He was a visiting scientist to Princeton University from 1991 to 1993, and a research associate for the University of Washington from 1993 to 1994.

[ 5 ] Career [ edit ] Xie had been employed at the University of Hawaiʻi as a professor of meteorology until he joined the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California, San Diego in 2012 as the inaugural Roger Revelle Chair, [ b ] [ 7 ] a title named for pioneering researcher Roger Revelle , [ 8 ] established with an endowment from the Revelle family.

[ 9 ] While at Hawaiʻi, he was faculty in the International Pacific Research Center of the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology .

[ 10 ] In April 2016, as a Scripps professor, Xie returned to the University of Washington as an endowed lecturer—he gave a lecture on El Niño in the Graduate Students' Distinguished Visiting Lecture series.

[ 11 ] Research [ edit ] In 2013, a study co-authored by Xie and published in Nature suggested that the slowdown in global warming was tied to cooling in parts of the Pacific Ocean .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Further research into the slowdown was published in 2015, in the journal Nature Climate Change .

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Xie has also published research on modeling the role of human activity to global warming; a 2015 co-authored paper in Nature Geoscience modeled the evolution of global temperature, creating a new method of tracking anthropogenic global warming .

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] The modelling was reported on again in 2016, when Xie and others modelled human activities' impact on warming.

[ 18 ] Other papers on climate change have included collaboration with authors affiliated with Duke University and University of Wisconsin–Madison .

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] In 2019, Xie published research with scientists from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , where they modelled Hadley cells to predict changes in the monsoon season of parts of Asia.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] In a 2022 article published by the World Economic Forum and The Conversation and co-authored by Xie, the authors claim that tropical cyclones have been increasing in intensity over time.

[ 23 ] In 2016, Xie was the organizer of a special issue of Advances in Atmospheric Sciences .

[ c ] [ 24 ] Xie has been included as a Highly Cited Researcher by Clarivate in the field of geosciences .
