Find sources: "Bid price" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( August 2024 ) A bid price is the highest price that a buyer (i.e., bidder) is willing to pay for some goods. It is usually referred to simply as the "bid".  In bid and ask , the bid price stands in contrast to the ask price or "offer", and the difference between the two is called the bid–ask spread . An unsolicited bid or purchase offer is when a person or company receives a bid even though they are not looking to sell.

Bidding war [ edit ] A bidding war is said to occur when a large number of competing bids are placed in rapid succession by two or more entities, especially when the price paid is much greater than the ask price , or greater than the first bid in the case of unsolicited bidding.

In other words, a bidding war is a situation where two or more buyers are interested in an item (such as a house or a business) that they make increasingly higher-priced offers in attempts to outbid others and win the ownership of the item.

[ 1 ] In real estate, a potential buyer can increase their bid in a number of different ways. Some common ways a bidder can increase their bid such as offering a higher purchase price, reduce the number of contingencies, pay with cash or even write a letter to appeal to the seller. These are all strategies that are proven to increase the odds of the buyer winning the bidding war.

[ 2 ] In the markets [ edit ] In the context of stock trading on a stock exchange , the bid price is the highest price a buyer of a stock is willing to pay for a share of that given stock. The bid price displayed in most quote services is the highest bid price in the market .
The ask or offer price on the other hand is the lowest price a seller of a particular stock is willing to sell a share of that given stock. The ask or offer price displayed is the lowest ask/offer price in the stock market.

The bid price is almost always lower than the ask price.
