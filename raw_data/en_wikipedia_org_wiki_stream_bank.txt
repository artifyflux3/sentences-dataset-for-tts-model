For other uses, see Riverbank (disambiguation) , Left Bank , and Right Bank .

This article is about terrain alongside a body of water and is not to be confused with shoal , a submerged ridge sometimes called a "bank".

A natural grass bank of the Perfume River in Huế , Vietnam An artificial lake with grass banks in Keukenhof , Netherlands In geography , a bank is the land alongside a body of water .

Different structures are referred to as banks in different fields of geography.

In limnology , a stream bank or river bank is the terrain alongside the bed of a river , creek, or stream .

[ 1 ] The bank consists of the sides of the channel , between which the flow is confined.

[ 1 ] Stream banks are of particular interest in fluvial geography, which studies the processes associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. Bankfull discharge is a discharge great enough to fill the channel and overtop the banks.

[ 2 ] Diagram of a river's left and right banks The descriptive terms left bank and right bank refer to the perspective of an observer looking downstream ; a well-known example of this being the southern left bank and the northern right bank of the river Seine defining parts of Paris . The shoreline of ponds , swamps , estuaries , reservoirs , or lakes are also of interest in limnology and are sometimes referred to as banks. The grade of all these banks or shorelines can vary from vertical to a shallow slope.

In freshwater ecology , banks are of interest as the location of riparian habitats .

Riparian zones occur along upland and lowland river and stream beds. The ecology around and depending on a marsh , swamp , slough , or estuary , sometimes called a bank, is likewise studied in freshwater ecology.

Banks are also of interest in navigation , where the term can refer either to a barrier island or a submerged plateau , [ 3 ] such as an ocean bank . A barrier island is a long narrow island composed of sand and forming a barrier between an island lagoon or sound and the ocean. A submerged plateau is a relatively flat topped elevation of the sea floor at shallow depth — generally less than 200 metres (660 ft) — typically on the continental shelf or near an island .
