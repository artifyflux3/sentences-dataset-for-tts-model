Similarly, a non-conservative extension , or proper extension , [ citation needed ] is a supertheory which is not conservative, and can prove more theorems than the original.

More formally stated, a theory T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} is a ( proof theoretic ) conservative extension of a theory T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} if every theorem of T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} is a theorem of T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} , and any theorem of T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} in the language of T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} is already a theorem of T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} .

More generally, if Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is a set of formulas in the common language of T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} and T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} , then T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} is Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } -conservative over T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} if every formula from Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } provable in T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} is also provable in T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} .

Note that a conservative extension of a consistent theory is consistent. If it were not, then by the principle of explosion , every formula in the language of T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} would be a theorem of T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} , so every formula in the language of T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} would be a theorem of T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} , so T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} would not be consistent. Hence, conservative extensions do not bear the risk of introducing new inconsistencies. This can also be seen as a methodology for writing and structuring large theories: start with a theory, T 0 {\displaystyle T_{0}} , that is known (or assumed) to be consistent, and successively build conservative extensions T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} , T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} , ... of it.

Recently, conservative extensions have been used for defining a notion of module for ontologies [ citation needed ] : if an ontology is formalized as a logical theory, a subtheory is a module if the whole ontology is a conservative extension of the subtheory.

Examples [ edit ] A C A 0 {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ACA}}_{0}} , a subsystem of second-order arithmetic studied in reverse mathematics , is a conservative extension of first-order Peano arithmetic .

The subsystems of second-order arithmetic R C A 0 ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle {\mathsf {RCA}}_{0}^{*}} and W K L 0 ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle {\mathsf {WKL}}_{0}^{*}} are Π Π 2 0 {\displaystyle \Pi _{2}^{0}} -conservative over E F A {\displaystyle {\mathsf {EFA}}} .

[ 1 ] The subsystem W K L 0 {\displaystyle {\mathsf {WKL}}_{0}} is a Π Π 1 1 {\displaystyle \Pi _{1}^{1}} -conservative extension of R C A 0 {\displaystyle {\mathsf {RCA}}_{0}} , and a Π Π 2 0 {\displaystyle \Pi _{2}^{0}} -conservative over P R A {\displaystyle {\mathsf {PRA}}} ( primitive recursive arithmetic ).

[ 1 ] Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory ( N B G {\displaystyle {\mathsf {NBG}}} ) is a conservative extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice ( Z F C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZFC}}} ).

Internal set theory is a conservative extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice ( Z F C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZFC}}} ).

Extensions by definitions are conservative.

Extensions by unconstrained predicate or function symbols are conservative.

I Σ Σ 1 {\displaystyle I\Sigma _{1}} (a subsystem of Peano arithmetic with induction only for Σ Σ 1 0 {\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}^{0}} -formulas ) is a Π Π 2 0 {\displaystyle \Pi _{2}^{0}} -conservative extension of P R A {\displaystyle {\mathsf {PRA}}} .

[ 2 ] Z F C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZFC}}} is a Π Π 4 1 {\displaystyle \Pi _{4}^{1}} -conservative extension of Z F {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZF}}} by Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem .

[ 3 ] Z F C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZFC}}} with the generalized continuum hypothesis is a Π Π 1 2 {\displaystyle \Pi _{1}^{2}} -conservative extension of Z F C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZFC}}} .

[ 4 ] Model-theoretic conservative extension [ edit ] See also: Extension (model theory) With model-theoretic means, a stronger notion is obtained: an extension T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} of a theory T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} is model-theoretically conservative if T 1 ⊆ ⊆ T 2 {\displaystyle T_{1}\subseteq T_{2}} and every model of T 1 {\displaystyle T_{1}} can be expanded to a model of T 2 {\displaystyle T_{2}} . Each model-theoretic conservative extension also is a (proof-theoretic) conservative extension in the above sense.

[ 5 ] The model theoretic notion has the advantage over the proof theoretic one that it does not depend so much on the language at hand; on the other hand, it is usually harder to establish model theoretic conservativity.
