[ 4 ] It was produced by the Majorcan cartographic school , possibly by Cresques Abraham , a Jewish book illuminator who was described by a contemporary as a master of mappae mundi as well as of compasses.

[ 5 ] It was in the royal library of France by 1380, during the reign of King Charles V , and is still preserved in the Bibliothèque nationale de France . The Catalan Atlas originally consisted of six vellum leaves (each circa 64.5 by 50 cm [25.4 by 19.7 in]) folded vertically, painted in various colours including gold and silver.

[ 6 ] They were later mounted on the front and back of five wooden panels, with the ends enclosed in a leather binding by Simon Vostre c.

1515 , restored most recently in 1991. Wear has split each leaf into two.

1330 This section possibly contains original research . Text may include some assumptions about identification of historical lands and states not supported by citations or by reliable sources.

Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations . Statements consisting only of original research should be removed.

( July 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The first two leaves contain texts in Catalan covering cosmography , astronomy , and astrology . These texts are accompanied by illustrations. The texts and illustration emphasise the Earth's spherical shape and the state of the then known world. They also provide information to sailors on tides and how to tell time at night.

[ 7 ] The four remaining leaves make up the actual map, with Jerusalem located close to the centre; two depict the Orient; the remaining two show Europe, along with North and West Africa. The map is around 1.3 m 2 (14 sq ft) in size. It shows illustrations of many cities—Christian cities with a cross, other cities with a dome—and with each city's political allegiance indicated by a flag. Wavy blue vertical lines are used to symbolise oceans. Place names of important ports are transcribed in red, while others are indicated in black. The illustrations and most of the text are oriented towards the edges of the map, suggesting it was intended to be used by laying it flat and walking around it.

[ 8 ] The oriental portion of the Catalan Atlas illustrates numerous religious references as well as a synthesis of medieval mappae mundi and the travel literature of the time, especially Marco Polo 's Book of Marvels and Mandeville 's Travels and Voyage of Sir John Mandeville . Many Indian and Chinese cities can be identified.

[ 9 ] The explanatory texts report customs described by Polo and catalogue local economic resources, real or supposed.

[ citation needed ] The Western portion is similar to contemporary portolan charts , but contains the first compass rose known to have been used on such a chart.

[ 4 ] Mali Empire [ edit ] Depiction of Mansa Musa , ruler of the Mali Empire , holding a gold object The Mali Empire and its riches are shown under the rule of Mansa Musa . The caption reads: This black Lord is called Musse Melly and is the sovereign of the land of the black people of Gineva ( Ghana ). This king is the richest and noblest of all these lands due to the abundance of gold that is extracted from his lands.

[ 10 ] Organa [ edit ] Depiction of The King Organa, "Rey de Organa".

There are different interpretations of the depiction of Organa in the Catalan Atlas, on which the caption reads: Here rules the King of Organa, a Saracen that constantly battles with the Saracens of the coast and with other Arabs.

[ 11 ] Ife Empire [ edit ] The first interpretation is by Suzanne Preston Blier , who identified Organa as the Ife Empire . Blier claimed that the name Organa alluded to an early dynasty of Ife rulers with the title 'Ogane (Oghene, Ogene)'.

[ 12 ] She also points out that this same title is referenced in a Portuguese account from the 1480s by the seafarer Joao Afonso de Aveiro, whose work describes an inland ruler that played a central role in Benin royal enthronements by providing a brass crown, staff, and cross to acknowledge a new king.

[ 12 ] Kanem-Bornu Empire [ edit ] The second interpretation comes from David Northrup who posits the Kanem-Bornu Empire as the polity Organa depicts. He suggests that the name Organa was given by Europeans.

[ 13 ] India [ edit ] Western and southern India.

The western part of the Indian subcontinent is clearly depicted, and several of the location names are accurate.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] To the north appears the Sultan of Delhi ( Rey de delli ), the ruler of the contemporary Delhi Sultanate , with his flag on numerous cities ( ). The caption reads: Here is a great sultan, powerful and very rich: the sultan has seven hundred elephants and a hundred thousand horsemen under his command. He also has countless foot soldiers. In this part of the land there is a lot of gold and precious stones.

[ 16 ] In the center of India appears the traditional Yadava capital of Diogil ("Deogiri", or Devagiri ). On top of the city of Diogil floats a peculiar flag ( ), while coastal cities are under the black flag of the Delhi Sultanate ( ).

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Devagiri was ultimately captured by Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate in 1307.

[ 19 ] The trading ship raises the flag of the Ilkhanate ( ). Its caption reads: Let it be known that these ships are named nichi, and measure sixty cubits in depth and thirty-four cubits in length; there are few with less than four masts and some even have ten. The sails are made of reed and palm leafs.

[ 20 ] To the south, at the tip of India, appears the " King of Colombo " with a Christian flag ( ). He was identified as Christian due to the early Saint Thomas Christianity there (since at least the 8th century), and the Catholic mission there under Jordan Catala since 1329.

[ 21 ] His caption reads: Here rules the king of Colombo , a Christian.

[ 16 ] Jordan, Christian missionary to Colombo from 1329, who wrote "Book of Marvels" ( Mirabilia descripta , 1340), was probably the source of the information about Colombo in the Catalan Atlas.

[ 22 ] He mentions the earlier presence of the Saint Thomas Christians in India.

[ 23 ] Il-Khanate [ edit ] Depiction of the ruler of the Ilkhanate and his realm.

[ 24 ] The Mongol Il-Khanate ruler and his dominions are depicted in the area of Persia under the title "Rey del tauris" , after his capital city of Tabriz . The Ilkhanate flag also appears: .

[ 25 ] [ 15 ] The caption is only related to the city of Babylon : Here there was the Great Babylonia, where Nabuconodosor resided, and that is called Baldaca today. Let it be known that many spices, as well as other noble products, come to this city from the Indies and they are distributed by Siria, in particular at the city of Damascus.

[ 20 ] A ship under the Ilkhanate flag ( ), sailing the Indian Ocean towards the coast of India under the control of the Delhi Sultanate ( ).

[ 26 ] Over him appears a city within a sphere, with the following caption, mentioning the Persian city of Shiraz and Ptolemy : This city is named Siras , and in antiquity, it was named the City of Grace because it was there where astronomy was invented by the great wise man Ptolemy .

[ 20 ] Two ships with flags of the Ilkhanate appears on the India Ocean , sailing to and from the Indian coast, where appear flags of the Delhi Sultanate . The label attached to one of the ships reads: Know that these ships are called junks ( inchi ) and have sixty-cubit hulls with thirty-four cubits of freeboard. They have on top of this between four and ten masts, and their sails are of canes and palm.

[ 27 ] Golden Horde [ edit ] Jani Beg of the Golden Horde .

[ 28 ] The Mongol polity of the Golden Horde is accurately depicted north of the Caspian Sea . The ruler named Jani Beg has been identified in this representation, being mentioned as "Jambech senyor de Sarra " , and the flag of the Golden Horde also appears ( ).

[ 28 ] The caption to the right reads: Flag of the Golden Horde according to the Catalan Atlas.

Coinage of Mengu-Timur with tamgha symbol , dated 1273–1275.

Here resides the emperor of this northern region whose empire starts in the province of Bulgaria and ends at the city of Organcio. The sovereign is named Jambech, Lord of the Sarra.

[ 20 ] The symbolism of the Golden Horde flag depicted by the Catalan Atlas ( ) is fairly similar to the type of tamgha symbols (such as ) actually found on the coinage of the Golden Horde.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Such symbols were used until the time of Jani Beg , but essentially disappear thereafter.

[ 31 ] The text to the left reads: Let it be known that those that wish to cross this desert stop and rest during a week in a city named Lop. Here, expeditions and their animals relax/enjoy themselves. After that, they procure what is needed for the next seven months of the journey, because in the desert one travels an entire day and night before reaching potable water; however, every day and a half, they can find plenty of it, enough for fifty or a hundred people or even more. And if it happens that a rider, tired by the journey, falls sleep or for any other reason he separates from his companions, he will often hear the voices of devils, similar to the voices of his companions, often calling him by his own name. In this way, the devils take him through the desert to a fro such that the traveler cannot find his companions. A thousand stories are known about this desert.

[ 20 ] Anatolia [ edit ] Anatolian Beyliks in the Catalan Atlas. The map is shown upside down.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] The Anatolian Beyliks , a group of Turkic principalities in Anatolia are also depicted, in the region labelled Turqhia ( Turkey ). The caption next to the seated ruler in Anatolia reads: Asia Minor also called Turkey, where there are many cities and castles.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Numerous Turkic principalities appear, with a variety of flags, but very little prominence is given to the Orthodox princes of the Byzantine Empire , although several Byzantine cities appear with the Byzantine imperial flag ( ), or Trebizond ( ).

[ 33 ] The Christian kingdom of Cilician Armenia appears heavily fortified within green walls, with its ports and flags ( , ) clearly visible.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] Gog and Magog [ edit ] Land of "Gog i Magog".

The land of "Gog i Magog" ( Gog and Magog ) appear in the top right corner. Its king is mounted on a horse, followed by a procession. Next to it appears the gate of Moses, against alexander , and mechanical trumpeters.

Chagatai Khanate [ edit ] Kingdom of Chagatai in the Catalan Atlas (1375).

The Khan Kebek , Mongol ruler of the Chagatai Khanate is depicted with the following caption: Here reigns the King Chabech ( Kebek ), lord of the Medeja [Media] Empire. He resides at Emalech ( Almaliq ).

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] His cities appear with the Chagatai flag ( ).

[ 38 ] Cathay (China) [ edit ] Flag over the city is camull ( Khamil ) in Xinjiang .

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] Flag of Cathay in the Catalan Atlas (Label: "The city of Carnan. Here ends Catay").

[ 39 ] [ 37 ] Empire of the Great Khan ( Catayo ) according to the Catalan Atlas (rotated 180°). The flag with three red crescent moons ( ) appears on all the territory.

The cities of Cathay, at that time the Empire of the Great Khan ( Yuan China ), are shown raising a flag with three red crescent moons ( ). The flag is seen all over eastern Asian cities in the Catalan Atlas.

[ 41 ] Kubilai Khan appears enthroned and wearing a green coat, with the following caption: The most powerful prince of the Tartars is named Holubeim [Kubilay Khan], that means Great Khan. This emperor is richer than any other emperor in the world. This emperor is protected by twelve thousand horsemen with their four captains that stay at the court three months of the year.

[ 37 ] Antichrist [ edit ] Antichrist in the Catalan Atlas (1375).

The Antichrist appears beyond the Great Wall of China, next to the territory of Gog and Magog . The label reads: Antichrist. He will be raised in Goraym of Galilea, and at the age of thirty he will start to preach in Jerusalem; contrary to the truth, he will proclaim that he is Christ, the living son of God. It is said that he will rebuild the Temple.

[ 42 ] Gallery [ edit ] Modern copy of western half A modern reproduction of the Catalan Atlas depicting the eastern Mediterranean region.

Reproduction of the first leaf Reproduction of the second leaf Depiction of a Sanhaja Berber , known as 'the veiled ones' due to their custom of wearing a face veil.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] The caption reads: "All this land is populated by people who cover themselves such that only their eyes can be seen; they live in tents and ride in camels. There are animals named lemp [orice] whose skin can be used to make good leather shields." See also [ edit ] Rhumbline network Early world maps References [ edit ] ^ Ferandez-Armesto, F.F.R. (1995).

The Catalan Atlas is conventionally attributed to 1375, because that year is used as the starting-point for the computation of the Golden Number, but 1376 and 1377 are also mentioned in its accompanying texts; it conforms closely to the description of such an atlas in the French royal library catalogue, dated 1380 [...] The Catalan Atlas can be assigned with some confidence to the late 1370s or the early 1380s.
