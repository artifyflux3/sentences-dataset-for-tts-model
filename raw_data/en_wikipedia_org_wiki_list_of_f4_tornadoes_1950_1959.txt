The F4 Scottsbluff, Nebraska tornado passing the Scottsbluff airport on June 27, 1955.

This is a list of tornadoes which have been officially or unofficially labeled as F4, EF4, IF4, or an equivalent rating in the 1950s. These scales – the Fujita scale , the Enhanced Fujita scale , the International Fujita scale , and the TORRO tornado intensity scale – attempt to estimate the intensity of a tornado by classifying the damage caused to natural features and man-made structures in the tornado's path.

Tornadoes are among the most violent known meteorological phenomena. Each year, more than 2,000 tornadoes are recorded worldwide, with the vast majority occurring in North America and Europe.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] To assess the intensity of these events, meteorologist Ted Fujita devised a method to estimate maximum wind speeds within tornadic storms based on the damage caused; this became known as the Fujita scale . The scale ranks tornadoes from F0 to F5, with F0 being the least intense and F5 being the most intense. F4 tornadoes were estimated to have had maximum winds between 207 mph (333 km/h) and 260 mph (420 km/h).

[ 3 ] [ nb 1 ] Following two particularly devastating tornadoes in 1997 and 1999, engineers questioned the reliability of the Fujita scale. Ultimately, a new scale was devised that took into account 28 different damage indicators; this became known as the Enhanced Fujita scale .

[ 4 ] With building design and structural integrity taken more into account, winds in an EF4 tornado were estimated to between 166 mph (267 km/h) and 200 mph (320 km/h).

[ 5 ] The Enhanced Fujita scale is used predominantly in North America. Most of Europe, on the other hand, uses the TORRO tornado intensity scale (or T-Scale), which ranks tornado intensity between T0 and T11; F4/EF4 tornadoes are approximately equivalent to T8 to T9 on the T-Scale. Tornadoes rated IF4 on the International Fujita scale are also included on this list.

[ 17 ] [ 14 ] [ 56 ] [ 58 ] NWS April 30 1953 United States Georgia Warner Robins , Robins Air Force Base 18 (300 Injuries) Tornado outbreak sequence of April 28 – May 2, 1953 – This tornado struck a large housing project on the south side of Warner Robins. It destroyed 275 apartment units, 65 homes, and 25 trailers while heavily damaging 84 other apartment units, and 135 other homes. Debris was hurled high into the air and scattered a 1 ⁄ 2 mi (0.80 km) or more away from the path of the tornado. The high death and injury toll was mainly caused by this as people were hit by flying bricks and other debris. Grazulis list this as a long-tracked tornado that started south of Fort Valley and struck Dry Branch and Jeffersonville , but official records list this as four separate tornado events.

[ 17 ] [ 14 ] [ 56 ] [ 59 ] NWS May 1 1953 United States Alabama Millerville , Ashland 7 (12 Injuries) Tornado outbreak sequence of April 28 – May 2, 1953 – This tornado obliterated a frame home near its touchdown point, killing the two women inside, with one of the bodies being thrown over 100 yd (91 m).

Part of the track may have also been from a separate supercell. Grazulis stated that the F4 damage occurred in Wisconsin towards the end of its path southeast of Catawaba; he rated the maximum damage in the other two states F3. A farmhouse was swept from its foundation, and fragments of the home were lofted for 7 miles (11 km). Near-F4 damage was also inflicted to two homes near Strum according to Grazulis.

[ 14 ] [ 56 ] [ 68 ] NWS May 11 1953 United States Texas San Angelo 13 (159 Injuries) 1953 Waco tornado outbreak – This tornado, which was likely spawned by an outflow boundary, moved east-southeast through the north side of San Angelo, producing near-F5 damage at times according to Grazulis. 519 homes, 19 businesses and 150 cars were damaged or destroyed along the northern third of the city. A two-story school lost its roof and many walls; students in the school sheltered safely in interior hallways, and only 12 were injured, none critically.

[ 14 ] [ 56 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] NWS May 21 1953 United States, Canada Michigan , Ontario Port Huron (MI) , Sarnia (ON) , Nairn (ON) 2 (68 Injuries) 1953 Sarnia tornado – This large tornado began near Smiths Creek, Michigan and struck Porth Huron, devastating a large section of the town as it produced widespread F3 to F4 damage. 300 homes were damaged and 90 more were destroyed. The tornado strengthened some more as it crossed the St. Clair River and moved into Canada just south of Sarnia Harbour, striking Sarnia directly damaging almost 100 commercial buildings. At least 150 homes on the more suburban outskirts of the city were damaged, including some that were destroyed and leveled. The tornado weakened after that, but one more area of F4 damage was inflicted upon farmsteads and homes near Nairn before it dissipated south of Stratford. The tornado's total path length based on official information is suggested to be exceeding 120 km (75 mi), though it is highly probable that this damage path was made up of more than one tornado, possibly as many as four, after the tornado left Sarnia.

[ 14 ] [ 56 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] NWS , EC June 7 1953 United States Nebraska Arcadia 11 Flint–Worcester tornado outbreak sequence – Homes were leveled, two cars were destroyed, and farm machinery was tossed. F4 damage occurred to one home in the Hays Creek area and three more near Arcadia. A farm near Arcadia was obliterated and swept completely away, killing 10 people at a family reunion.

A six-ton truck was thrown 80 ft (24 m) and three cars were observed in the air at one point as well. The tornado then transitioned into a waterspout that tracked for an additional 30 miles (48 km) in 44 minutes over Lake Erie , one of the longest such tracks ever recorded. A motorist who sought shelter in a ditch was killed while the other three fatalities occurred in a home that was destroyed.

[ 17 ] [ 14 ] [ 56 ] [ 77 ] NWS June 8 1953 United States Ohio Cygnet 17 (379 Injured) Flint–Worcester tornado outbreak sequence – This long-tracked tornado was more than likely a tornado family of at least three tornadoes according to Grazulis. The tornado moved out onto Lake Erie on the west side of Cleveland at the end of its life. Many buildings and crops were heavily damaged or destroyed and cattle was killed or injured. The peak damage occurred near Cygnet, where a woman and four children died in their home. The tornado is noted by Grazulis to have possibly reached F5 intensity in the town as well.

[ 17 ] [ 14 ] [ 56 ] [ 78 ] NWS June 8 1953 United States Michigan Yale 0 (23 Injuries) Flint–Worcester tornado outbreak sequence – This tornado came from the same storm that produced the Flint F5 tornado . Two homes and many barns were obliterated. Grazulis listed the casualty count as one death and 34 injuries.

[ 17 ] [ 14 ] [ 56 ] [ 79 ] NWS June 9 1953 United States Massachusetts Rutland , Holden , Worcester , Shrewsbury , Westborough , Soutborough 94 (1,228 Injuries) 1953 Worcester tornado – This large, long-tracked, deadly, and destructive tornado, which was 1 mi-wide (1.6 km) at times, damaged or destroyed 4,000 buildings. The most intense damage occurred in Rutland, Holden, Worcester, Shrewsbury and Westborough. Entire neighborhoods was obliterated and swept away with the debris granulated and scattered well away from the foundations of the homes. The main building of Assumption College (building is now home to Quinsigamond Community College ), which had 3-foot (0.91 m)-thick brick walls, was reduced by three floors. The landmark tower at the school also lost three stories. A nearby storage tank, weighing several tons, was lofted and tossed across a road. Hundreds of vehicles were thrown, including a 12-tonne (12,000 kg) bus that was picked up, rolled over several times, and thrown against a newly constructed apartment building, killing two passengers. Debris from the tornado was strewn eastward, reaching the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory 35 mi (56 km) away, and even out over Massachusetts Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. One item was documented to have been blown from Holden to Eastham on Cape Cod , a distance of 110 miles (180 km), one of the greatest such instances in a U.S. tornado. The tornado caused the 4th (then-3rd) most amount of injuries of any tornado in U.S. history and left 10,000 people homeless. Many experts, including Grazulis, suspect that this tornado probably reached F5 intensity at some point in it life. Although, it was on the ground for 85 minutes, the tornado never received a formal tornado warning until it was in the process of dissipating at the end of its life, although a separate F3 tornado did form after the tornado dissipated. 1953 was the first year that tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings were used, but the National Weather Service office in Boston feared that mentioning the possibility for tornado activity for the area that day would cause panic among local citizens and only issued a severe thunderstorm watch, the first one ever issued in Massachusetts. As a result, most residents received little to no warning about the tornado approaching their area. The tornado was also the principal catalyst for the Storm Prediction Center 's reorganization on June 17, 1953, and subsequent implementation of a nationwide radar/storm spotter system.

The authors sent a detailed letter to the SPC recommending the two tornadoes from 1974, and the 1952 tornado mentioned above, be downgraded to F4. The SPC agreed to all three of these changes. The SPC database now reflects the conclusions of Professor Fujita's map of 1974, and Grazulis 1952 tornado report (1993). ... The authors suggested that the three former F5 tornadoes in Tennessee should be reclassified as F4. These changes have been adopted, making the 16 April 1998 Lawrence County tornado the only documented F5 in the history of Tennessee.
