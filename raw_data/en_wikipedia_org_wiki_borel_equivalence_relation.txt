Given Borel equivalence relations E and F on Polish spaces X and Y respectively, one says that E is Borel reducible to F , in symbols E ‚â§ B F , if and only if there is a Borel function Œò¬†: X ‚Üí Y such that for all x , x ' ‚àà X , one has x E x ' ‚áî Œò( x ) F Œò( x ').

Conceptually, if E is Borel reducible to F , then E is "not more complicated" than F , and the quotient space X / E has a lesser or equal "Borel cardinality" than Y / F , where "Borel cardinality" is like cardinality except for a definability restriction on the witnessing mapping.

Kuratowski's theorem [ edit ] A measure space X is called a standard Borel space if it is Borel-isomorphic to a Borel subset of a Polish space. Kuratowski's theorem then states that two standard Borel spaces X and Y are Borel-isomorphic iff | X | = | Y |.
