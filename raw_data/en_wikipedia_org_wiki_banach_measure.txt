In the mathematical discipline of measure theory , a Banach measure is a certain way to assign a size (or area) to all subsets of the Euclidean plane , consistent with but extending the commonly used Lebesgue measure . While there are certain subsets of the plane which are not Lebesgue measurable , all subsets of the plane have a Banach measure. On the other hand, the Lebesgue measure is countably additive while a Banach measure is only finitely additive (and is therefore known as a " content ").

Stefan Banach proved the existence of Banach measures in 1923.

[ 1 ] This established in particular that paradoxical decompositions as provided by the Banach-Tarski paradox in Euclidean space R 3 cannot exist in the Euclidean plane R 2 .

Definition [ edit ] A Banach measure [ 2 ] on R n is a function μ μ : P ( R n ) → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle \mu :{\mathcal {P}}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})\to [0,\infty ]} (assigning a non-negative extended real number to each subset of R n ) such that μ is finitely additive, i.e.

μ μ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) = μ μ ( A ) + μ μ ( B ) {\displaystyle \mu (A\cup B)=\mu (A)+\mu (B)} for any two disjoint sets A , B ⊆ ⊆ R n {\displaystyle A,B\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} ; μ extends the Lebesgue measure λ , i.e.

μ μ ( A ) = λ λ ( A ) {\displaystyle \mu (A)=\lambda (A)} for every Lebesgue-measurable set A ⊆ ⊆ R n {\displaystyle A\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} ; μ is invariant under isometries of R n , i.e.

μ μ ( A ) = μ μ ( f ( A ) ) {\displaystyle \mu (A)=\mu (f(A))} for every A ⊆ ⊆ R n {\displaystyle A\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and every isometry f : R n → → R n {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} .

Properties [ edit ] The finite additivity of μ implies that μ μ ( ∅ ∅ ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu (\varnothing )=0} and μ μ ( A 1 ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ ∪ ∪ A k ) = ∑ ∑ i = 1 k μ μ ( A i ) {\displaystyle \mu (A_{1}\cup \cdots \cup A_{k})=\sum _{i=1}^{k}\mu (A_{i})} for any pairwise disjoint sets A 1 , … … , A k ⊆ ⊆ R n {\displaystyle A_{1},\ldots ,A_{k}\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . We also have μ μ ( A ) ≤ ≤ μ μ ( B ) {\displaystyle \mu (A)\leq \mu (B)} whenever A ⊆ ⊆ B ⊆ ⊆ R n {\displaystyle A\subseteq B\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} .

Since μ extends Lebesgue measure, we know that μ μ ( A ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu (A)=0} whenever A is a finite or a countable set and that μ μ ( [ a 1 , b 1 ] × × ⋯ ⋯ × × [ a n , b n ] ) = ( b 1 − − a 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( b n − − a n ) {\displaystyle \mu ([a_{1},b_{1}]\times \cdots \times [a_{n},b_{n}])=(b_{1}-a_{1})\cdots (b_{n}-a_{n})} for any product of intervals [ a 1 , b 1 ] × × ⋯ ⋯ × × [ a 1 , b 1 ] ⊆ ⊆ R n {\displaystyle [a_{1},b_{1}]\times \cdots \times [a_{1},b_{1}]\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} .

Since μ is invariant under isometries, it is in particular invariant under rotations and translations.

Results [ edit ] Stefan Banach showed that Banach measures exist on R 1 and on R 2 . These results can be derived from the fact that the groups of isometries of R 1 and of R 2 are solvable .

The existence of these measures proves the impossibility of a Banach–Tarski paradox in one or two dimensions: it is not possible to decompose a one- or two-dimensional set of finite Lebesgue measure into finitely many sets that can be reassembled into a set with a different Lebesgue measure, because this would violate the properties of the Banach measure that extends the Lebesgue measure.

[ 3 ] Conversely, the existence of the Banach-Tarski paradox in all dimensions n ≥ 3 shows that no Banach measure can exist in these dimensions.

As Vitali's paradox shows, Banach measures cannot be strengthened to countably additive ones: there exist subsets of R n that are not Lebesgue measurable, for all n ≥ 1 .

Most of these results depend on some form of the axiom of choice . Using only the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice, it is not possible to derive the Banach-Tarski paradox, nor it is possible to prove the existence of sets that are not Lebesgue-measurable (the latter claim depends on a fairly weak and widely believed assumption, namely that the existence of inaccessible cardinals is consistent). The existence of Banach measures on R 1 and on R 2 can also not be proven in the absence of the axiom of choice.

[ 4 ] In particular, no concrete formula for these Banach measures can be given.
