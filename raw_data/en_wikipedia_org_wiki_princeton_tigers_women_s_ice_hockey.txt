They play at the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. In the 2019–2020 season, they won their first ECAC championship, defeating #1 ranked Cornell by a score of 3–2 in overtime.

History [ edit ] On November 24, 1979, the Princeton Tigers played their first varsity game against the University of Pennsylvania.

[ 2 ] In winter of 1982, Princeton would snap the Cornell Big Red women's ice hockey program's string of six straight Ivy League titles and go on to win Ivy League championships in 1983 and 1984 under head coach Bill Quackenbush.

Former Princeton player and assistant coach Laura Halldorson would coach the Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey program to the 2004 NCAA title.

[ 3 ] On February 26, 2010, Princeton would be part of NCAA ice hockey history. With a 5–1 loss to the Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey program, Harvard coach Katey Stone became women's college hockey's all-time winningest coach, surpassing former Princeton player and Minnesota head coach Laura Halldorson.

[ 4 ] On December 31, 2010, Rachel Weber made 24 saves as the Tigers upset the fifth ranked Boston College Eagles by a 3–0 margin. It was Weber's third shutout in four games and her goals against average for the season was lowered to 1.93 [ 5 ] In three games played between January 3 and 8, 2011, Rachel Weber earned three victories and allowed only one goal. On January 3, she defeated Quinnipiac by a 3–0 tally and shutout Clarkson by a 2–0 score on January 7. The following day, she gave up her only goal of the week in a 3–1 win over St. Lawrence. Her shutout streak spanned six games and lasted 289:43. She is now the owner of the longest shutout streak in ECAC history [ 6 ] and the fourth longest in NCAA Division I since the 2000–01 season.

2019–2020 was a historic season for the Tigers. The team finished with a program-best 26 wins.  Ranked 6th and seeded second, they played in and won the ECAC championship tournament for the first time. Carly Bullock scored 30 goals, only the fifth player in program history to accomplish the feat. She was named the national Player of the Month in February 2020 for scoring 13 goals in 9 games.

[ 7 ] Her 30th goal came in the ECAC championship game against Cornell, when she evened the score at 2–2. The Tigers would go on to win in overtime, 3–2, with Mariah Keopple scoring the winning goal, from assists by Shannon Griffin and Sharon Frankel.

[ 8 ] Forward Sarah Fillier was selected as ECAC tournament Most Outstanding Player, after earning points in every game. The Tigers arrived in the championship game after beating Clarkson by a score of 5–1. The Tigers were scheduled to play Northeastern in the quarterfinals for the NCAA tournament when the event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic .

Additionally, the impact of the pandemic would wipe out the 2020–21 season for all Ivy League teams. Although the ECAC Conference, the member conference for Ivy League women's ice hockey teams, held a season in 2020–21, Princeton, and all other Ivy League teams did not participate.

In 2024, team captain Sarah Fillier was selected first overall by the New York Sirens in the 2024 PWHL Draft . As of 2025, a total of five alumnae and one former coach have played in the PWHL .
