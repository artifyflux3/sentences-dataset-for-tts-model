He is now known as a well-connected humanistic scholar, and supporter of both Copernicus and Rheticus .

Life [ edit ] Born in Lindau , he studied mathematics, history, and philosophy, as well as astronomy.

[ 3 ] He was a student in Sélestat under Johannes Sapidus [ it ] ; [ 4 ] he also attended universities in Wittenberg , Vienna , Montpellier , and Avignon .

[ 5 ] In 1528, German cartographer Sebastian Münster appealed to scientists across the Holy Roman Empire [ 6 ] to assist him with his description of Germany. Gassar accepted this and was later recognized by Münster as a close collaborator for his cartography of the country.

[ 7 ] Rheticus lost his physician father Georg Iserin in 1528 when he was executed on sorcery charges. Gasser later took over the practice in Feldkirch , in 1538; he taught Rheticus some astrology , and helped his education, in particular by writing to the University of Wittenberg on his behalf.

[ 5 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] When Rheticus printed his Narratio prima —the first published account of the Copernican heliocentric system —in 1540 ( Danzig ), he sent Gasser a copy. Gasser then undertook a second edition (1541, Basel ) with his own introduction [ 10 ] in the form of a letter from Gasser to Georg Vogelin of Konstanz .

[ 5 ] The second edition (1566, Basel) of De revolutionibus orbium coelestium contained the Narratio Prima with this introduction by Gasser.

[ 11 ] Works [ edit ] Title page of the De magnete in the 1558 edition by Gasser He prepared the first edition (Augsburg, 1558) of the Epistola de magnete of Pierre de Maricourt .

[ 3 ] [ 12 ] Other works include: Historiarum et Chronicorum totius mundi epitome (1532) Prognosticon (1544) dedicated to Thomas Venatorius [ de ] [ 13 ] Edition of the Evangelienbuch of Otfried of Weissenburg . His edition did not appear until 1571, under the name of Matthias Flacius who had taken over.

[ 14 ] Observations on comets [ 15 ] Gasser belonged with Flacius to the humanist circle around Kaspar von Niedbruck [ de ] , concerned with the recovery of monastic manuscripts. Others in the group were John Bale , Conrad Gesner , Joris Cassander , Johannes Matalius Metellus , and Cornelius Wauters .
