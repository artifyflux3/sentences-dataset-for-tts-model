At Harvard University , the title of University Professor is the institution's most distinguished professorial post, [ 1 ] and is conferred upon a select group of 25 tenured faculty members whose scholarship and other professional work have achieved exceptional distinction and influence.

[ 2 ] Established in 1935, this position enables scholars to work across disciplines and at any of Harvard's schools.

[ 2 ] The number of University Professors has increased over time, made possible by new endowed gifts to the university. In 2006, there were 21 University Professors.

[ 3 ] As of 2022 [update] , the total has risen to 25 University Professors.
