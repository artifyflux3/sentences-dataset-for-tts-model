The largest city square in the world , the Xinghai Square of Dalian , China, was created entirely through land reclamation.

Land reclamation , often known as reclamation , and also known as land fill (not to be confused with a waste landfill ), is the process of creating new land from oceans , seas , riverbeds or lake beds. The land reclaimed is known as reclamation ground , reclaimed land , or land fill .

History [ edit ] In ancient Egypt , the rulers of the Twelfth Dynasty (c. 2000–1800 BC) undertook a far-sighted land reclamation scheme to increase agricultural output. They constructed levees and canals to connect the Faiyum with the Bahr Yussef waterway, diverting water that would have flowed into Lake Moeris and causing gradual evaporation around the lake's edges, creating new farmland from the reclaimed land. A similar land reclamation system using dams and drainage canals was used in the Greek Copaic Basin during the Middle Helladic Period (c. 1900–1600 BC).

[ 1 ] Another early large-scale project was the Beemster Polder in the Netherlands, adding 70 square kilometres (27 sq mi) of land in 1612. In Hong Kong, the Praya Reclamation Scheme added 20 to 24 hectares (50 to 60 acres) of land in 1890 during the second phase of construction. It was one of the most ambitious projects undertaken during the era of colonial Hong Kong .

[ 2 ] Some 20% of land in the Tokyo Bay area has been reclaimed, [ 3 ] most notably Odaiba artificial island. The city of Rio de Janeiro was largely built on reclaimed land, as was Wellington , New Zealand.

Methods [ edit ] Land reclamation can be achieved by a number of different methods. The simplest method involves filling the area with large amounts of heavy rock and/or cement , then filling with clay and dirt until the desired height is reached. The process is called "infilling" [ 4 ] and the material used to fill the space is generally called "infill".

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Draining of submerged wetlands is often used to reclaim land for agricultural use.

Deep cement mixing is used typically in situations in which the material displaced by either dredging or draining may be contaminated and hence needs to be contained. Land dredging is also another method of land reclamation. It is the removal of sediments and debris from the bottom of a body of water. It is commonly used for maintaining reclaimed land masses as sedimentation, a natural process, fills channels and harbors.

Singapore The city-state of Singapore , where land is in short supply, is also famous for its efforts on land reclamation.

[ 13 ] The size of Singapore has increased by 25% from 581.5 square kilometres in 1960 to 725.7 in 2019. This is part of the nation's plans to create more homes and common spaces in the land-scarce city-state . Upcoming projects include the Long Island project, involving the reclamation of three tracts of land (expected to span around 800 ha), which is set at a higher level to protect against rising sea levels. It will also enclose a body of water, acting as a reservoir, strengthening the nation's water resilience. Detailed technical studies are currently under way, lasting five years. This project would take a few decades to plan and implement.

Agriculture [ edit ] Land reclamation in progress in Bingzhou (丙州) Peninsula (formerly, island) of the Dongzui Bay (东咀港).

Tong'an District , Xiamen , China Agriculture was a driver of land reclamation before industrialisation .

[ 28 ] In South China , farmers reclaimed paddy fields by enclosing an area with a stone wall on the sea shore near a river mouth or river delta .  The species of rice that are grown on these grounds are more salt tolerant. Another use of such enclosed land is the creation of fish ponds . It is commonly seen on the Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong . These reclaimed areas also attract species of migrating birds .

A related practice is the draining of swampy or seasonally submerged wetlands to convert them to farmland . While this does not create new land exactly, it allows commercially productive use of land that would otherwise be restricted to wildlife habitat.

It is also an important method of mosquito control .

Even in the post-industrial age, there have been land reclamation projects intended for increasing available agricultural land. For example, the village of Ogata in Akita, Japan , was established on land reclaimed from Lake Hachirōgata (Japan's second largest lake at the time) starting in 1957. By 1977, the amount of land reclaimed totalled 172.03 square kilometres (66.42 sq mi).

[ 29 ] Artificial islands [ edit ] Artificial islands are an example of land reclamation. Creating an artificial island is an expensive and risky undertaking. It is often considered in places with high population density and a scarcity of flat land.

Kansai International Airport (in Osaka ) and Hong Kong International Airport are examples where this process was deemed necessary. The Palm Islands , The World and hotel Burj al-Arab off Dubai in the United Arab Emirates are other examples of artificial islands (although there is yet no real "scarcity of land" in Dubai), as well as the Flevopolder in the Netherlands which is the largest artificial island in the world.

Beach restoration [ edit ] Main article: Beach nourishment Beach rebuilding is the process of repairing beaches using materials such as sand or mud from inland. This can be used to build up beaches suffering from beach starvation or erosion from longshore drift . It stops the movement of the original beach material through longshore drift and retains a natural look to the beach. Although it is not a long-lasting solution, it is cheap compared to other types of coastal defences . An example of this is the city of Mumbai.

[ 10 ] Landfill [ edit ] As human overcrowding of developed areas intensified during the 20th century, it has become important to develop land re-use strategies for completed landfills.  Some of the most common usages are for parks, golf courses and other sports fields. Increasingly, however, office buildings and industrial uses are made on a completed landfill. In these latter uses, methane capture is customarily carried out to minimize explosive hazard within the building.

An example of a Class A office building constructed over a landfill is the Dakin Building at Sierra Point , Brisbane, California . The underlying fill was deposited from 1965 to 1985, mostly consisting of construction debris from San Francisco and some municipal wastes .

Aerial photographs prior to 1965 show this area to be tidelands of the San Francisco Bay . A clay cap was constructed over the debris prior to building approval.

[ 30 ] A notable example is Sydney Olympic Park , the primary venue for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games , which was built atop an industrial wasteland that included landfills.

Another strategy for landfill is the incineration of landfill trash at high temperature via the plasma-arc gasification process , which is currently used at two facilities in Japan , and was proposed to be used at a facility in St. Lucie County , Florida .

[ 31 ] The planned facility in Florida was later canceled.

[ 32 ] Environmental impact [ edit ] Parts (highlighted in brown) of the San Francisco Bay were reclaimed from wetlands for urban use.

Draining wetlands for ploughing, for example, is a form of habitat destruction . In some parts of the world, new reclamation projects are restricted or no longer allowed, due to environmental protection laws. Reclamation projects have strong negative impacts on coastal populations, although some species can take advantage of the newly created area.

[ 33 ] A 2022 global analysis estimated that 39% of losses (approximately 5,300 km 2 or 2,000 sq mi) and 14% of gains (approximately 1,300 km 2 or 500 sq mi) of tidal wetlands ( mangroves , tidal flats , and tidal marshes ) between 1999 and 2019 were due to direct human activities, including conversion to aquaculture, agriculture, plantations, coastal developments and other physical structures.

[ 34 ] Environmental legislation [ edit ] A map of reclaimed land (grey area) in Hong Kong. Many of the urban areas of Hong Kong are on reclaimed land.

The State of California created a state commission, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission , in 1965 to protect San Francisco Bay and regulate development near its shores.  The commission was created in response to growing concern over the shrinking size of the bay.

Hong Kong legislators passed the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance , proposed by the Society for Protection of the Harbour , in 1997 in an effort to safeguard the increasingly threatened Victoria Harbour against encroaching land development.

[ 35 ] Several large reclamation schemes at Green Island, West Kowloon, and Kowloon Bay were subsequently shelved, and others reduced in size.

Dangers [ edit ] Reclaimed land is highly susceptible to soil liquefaction during earthquakes, [ 36 ] which can amplify the amount of damage that occurs to buildings and infrastructure.

Subsidence is another issue, both from soil compaction on filled land, and also when wetlands are enclosed by levees and drained to create polders . Drained marshes will eventually sink below the surrounding water level, increasing the danger from flooding .

Land amounts added [ edit ] Asia [ edit ] Country or territory Notes Bahrain 76.3% of original size of 410 km 2 (160 sq mi) (1931–2007).

[ citation needed ] [ 37 ] Bangladesh About 110 km 2 (42 sq mi) in total and has 12,000 square kilometres (4,600 sq mi) potential (8% of total area) up to 12 metres (39 ft) depth in the territorial sea area.

[ 38 ] Hong Kong Main article: Land reclamation in Hong Kong 67 km 2 (26 sq mi) of land was reclaimed up to 2013.

Praya Reclamation Scheme began in the late 1860s and consisted of two stages totaling 20 to 24 hectares (50 to 60 acres).

[ 2 ] Hong Kong Disneyland , Hong Kong International Airport , and its predecessor, Kai Tak Airport , were all built on reclaimed land. In addition, much reclamation has taken place in prime locations on the waterfront on both sides of Victoria Harbour . This has raised environmental issues of the protection of the harbour which was once the source of prosperity of Hong Kong, traffic congestion in the Central District , [ 39 ] as well as the collusion of the Hong Kong Government with the real estate developers in the territory.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] In addition, as the city expanded, new towns in different decades were mostly built on reclaimed land, such as Kwun Tong , Sha Tin - Ma On Shan , Tai Po , Tseung Kwan O , Tuen Mun , and West Kowloon .

Macao 170% of the original size or 17 km 2 (6.6 sq mi) [ 43 ] North Korea In the 1980s, North Korea commenced a "find new land" program to reclaim 300,000 hectares of land (3,000 km 2 or 1,160 mi 2 ) in order to expand the country's supply of arable land . The project was unsuccessful and only reclaimed 20,000 hectares (200 km 2 or 70 mi 2 ) by the time it was cancelled after the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994. It also contributed to the collapse of the North Korean economy and the subsequent famine in the 1990s. Land reclamation efforts resumed in the 2010s under Kim Jong-un with more success. North Korea constructed artificial islands in the Yellow Sea containing Korean People's Army bases, possibly inspired by Chinese artificial islands in the South China Sea and possibly as bases for long-range ballistic missiles .

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Philippines Manila Bay Main article: Land reclamation in Metro Manila Additional 626 hectares along the eastern coast of Manila Bay created in the 1990s [ 47 ] to the 88-hectare Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex . The shore road of Manila ( Roxas Boulevard ) is actually reclaimed land, as well as its extension road to Cavite ( Manila-Cavite Expressway / Aguinaldo Boulevard ).

Cebu South Road Properties , Cebu City , Philippines - Artificial island which is 300 hectares was built along the sea between Mainland Cebu and Kawit Island. This was done to address the increasing need of urban and residential development in Cebu City due to its very progressive economy.

New Manila International Airport , Bulakan , Philippines Singapore Main article: Land reclamation in Singapore 20 percent of the original size or 135 km 2 (52 sq mi). As of 2003 [update] , plans for 99 km 2 (38 sq mi) more are to go ahead, [ 48 ] even though disputes persist with Malaysia over Singapore's extensive land reclamation works.

[ 49 ] Parts of Changi Airport are also on reclaimed land.

South Korea As of 2006, 38 percent or 1,550 km 2 (600 sq mi) of coastal wetlands reclaimed, including 400 km 2 (150 sq mi) at Saemangeum .

United Arab Emirates Main article: Land reclamation in the United Arab Emirates Dubai has a total of four reclaimed islands (the Palm Jumeirah , Jebal Ali , The Burj al Arab Island, and The World Islands ), with a fifth under construction (the Palm Deira ). There are several human-made islands in Abu Dhabi , such as Yas Island and Al Lulu Island .

Europe [ edit ] Country Notes Monaco Main article: Land reclamation in Monaco 0.41 km 2 (0.16 sq mi) out of 2.05 km 2 (0.79 sq mi), or one fifth of Monaco comes from land taken from the sea, mainly in the neighborhoods of Fontvieille, La Condamine , and Larvotto/Bas Moulins .

Netherlands Main article: Land reclamation in the Netherlands About 1 ⁄ 6 (almost 17%) of the entire country, or about 7,000 km 2 (2,700 sq mi) in total, has been reclaimed from the sea, lakes, marshes and swamps. The province of Flevoland has almost completely been reclaimed from the Zuiderzee .

Other countries [ edit ] Country Notes New Zealand Significant areas of land totaling several hundred hectares have been reclaimed along the harbourfronts of Auckland , Dunedin , and Wellington . In Dunedin – which in its early days was nicknamed "Mudedin" – around 2.5 km 2 (0.97 sq mi), including much of the inner city and suburbs of Dunedin North , South Dunedin , and Andersons Bay is reclaimed from the Otago Harbour , and a similar area in the suburbs of St Clair and St Kilda is reclaimed swampland. The international airports serving Auckland and Wellington have had significant reclamation for runway use.
