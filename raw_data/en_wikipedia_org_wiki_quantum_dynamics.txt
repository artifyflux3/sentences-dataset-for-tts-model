Quantum dynamics deals with the motions, and energy and momentum exchanges of systems whose behavior is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Quantum dynamics is relevant for burgeoning fields, such as quantum computing and atomic optics .

In mathematics, quantum dynamics is the study of the mathematics behind quantum mechanics .

[ 3 ] Specifically, as a study of dynamics , this field investigates how quantum mechanical observables change over time. Most fundamentally, this involves the study of one-parameter automorphisms of the algebra of all bounded operators on the Hilbert space of observables (which are self-adjoint operators). These dynamics were understood as early as the 1930s, after Wigner , Stone , Hahn and Hellinger worked in the field. Recently, [ when?

] mathematicians in the field have studied irreversible quantum mechanical systems on von Neumann algebras .

[ 4 ] Relation to classical dynamics [ edit ] Equations to describe quantum systems can be seen as equivalent to that of classical dynamics on a macroscopic scale , except for the important detail that the variables don't follow the commutative laws of multiplication.

[ 5 ] Hence, as a fundamental principle, these variables are instead described as " q-numbers ", conventionally represented by operators or Hermitian matrices on a Hilbert space .

[ 6 ] Indeed, the state of the system in the atomic and subatomic scale is described not by dynamic variables with specific numerical values, but by state functions that are dependent on the c-number time. In this realm of quantum systems, the equation of motion governing dynamics heavily relies on the Hamiltonian , also known as the total energy. Therefore, to anticipate the time evolution of the system, one only needs to determine the initial condition of the state function |Ψ(t) and its first derivative with respect to time.

[ 7 ] For example, quasi-free states and automorphisms are the Fermionic counterparts of classical Gaussian measures [ 8 ] ( Fermions' descriptors are Grassmann operators).
