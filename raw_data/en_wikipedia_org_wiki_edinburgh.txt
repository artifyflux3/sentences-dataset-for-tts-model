It is located in southeast Scotland and is bounded to the north by the Firth of Forth and to the south by the Pentland Hills . Edinburgh had a population of 
506,520 in 2020, [ 6 ] making it the second-most-populous city in Scotland and the seventh-most-populous in the United Kingdom . The wider metropolitan area had a population of 912,490 in the same year.

[ 7 ] Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government , the Scottish Parliament , the highest courts in Scotland , and the Palace of Holyroodhouse , the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. It is also the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland . The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scottish law , literature , philosophy , the sciences and engineering. The University of Edinburgh was founded in 1582 and is now one of three universities in the city. The financial centre of Scotland, Edinburgh is the second-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom, the fourth-largest in Europe, and the thirteenth-largest in the world.

[ 8 ] The city is a cultural centre, and is the home of institutions including the National Museum of Scotland , the National Library of Scotland , and the Scottish National Gallery .

[ 9 ] The city is also known for the Edinburgh International Festival and the Fringe , the latter being the world's largest annual international arts festival. Historic sites in Edinburgh include Edinburgh Castle , the Palace of Holyroodhouse, St Giles' Cathedral , Greyfriars Kirk , Canongate Kirk and the extensive Georgian New Town built in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Old Town and the New Town are together listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO , [ 10 ] and the site has been managed by Edinburgh World Heritage since 1999. The city's historical and cultural attractions have made it Britain's second-most-visited tourist destination, attracting 5.3 million visits, including 2.4 million from overseas, in 2023.

[ 11 ] Edinburgh is governed by the City of Edinburgh Council , a unitary authority. The City of Edinburgh council area had an estimated population of 514,990 in 2022, [ 2 ] and includes outlying towns and villages which are not part of Edinburgh proper. The city is in the Lothian region and was historically part of the shire of Midlothian (also called Edinburghshire).

Etymology [ edit ] Main article: Etymology of Edinburgh "Edin", the root of the city's name, derives from Eidyn , the name for the region in Cumbric , the Brittonic Celtic language formerly spoken there. The name's meaning is unknown.

[ 12 ] The district of Eidyn was centred on the stronghold of Din Eidyn, the dun or hillfort of Eidyn.

[ 12 ] This stronghold is believed to have been located at Castle Rock , [ 13 ] now the site of Edinburgh Castle . A siege of Din Eidyn by Oswald , king of the Angles of Northumbria in 638 marked the beginning of three centuries of Germanic influence in south east Scotland that laid the foundations for the development of Scots , before the town was ultimately subsumed in 954 by the kingdom known to the English as Scotland.

[ 14 ] As the language shifted from Cumbric to Northumbrian Old English and then Scots , the Brittonic din in Din Eidyn was replaced by burh , producing Edinburgh . In Scottish Gaelic din becomes dùn , producing modern Dùn Èideann .

[ 12 ] [ 15 ] Nicknames [ edit ] The city is affectionately nicknamed Auld Reekie , [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Scots for Old Smoky , for the views from the country of the smoke-covered Old Town. A note in a collection of the works of the poet Allan Ramsay explains, "Auld Reeky...A name the country people give Edinburgh, from the cloud of smoke or reek that is always impending over it." [ 18 ] In Walter Scott 's 1820 novel The Abbot , a character observes that "yonder stands Auld Reekie—you may see the smoke hover over her at twenty miles' distance".

[ 19 ] Thomas Carlyle comments on the phenomenon: "Smoke cloud hangs over old Edinburgh, for, ever since Aeneas Silvius 's time and earlier, the people have the art, very strange to Aeneas, of burning a certain sort of black stones, and Edinburgh with its chimneys is called 'Auld Reekie' by the country people".

[ 20 ] The 19th-century historian Robert Chambers asserted that the sobriquet could not be traced before the reign of King Charles II in the late 17th century. He attributed the name to a Fife laird, Durham of Largo, who regulated the bedtime of his children by the smoke rising above Edinburgh from the fires of the tenements. "It's time now bairns, to tak' the beuks, and gang to our beds, for yonder's Auld Reekie, I see, putting on her nicht-cap!".

[ 21 ] Edinburgh has been popularly called the Athens of the North since the early 19th century.

[ 22 ] References to Athens , such as Athens of Britain and Modern Athens , had been made as early as the 1760s. The similarities were seen to be topographical but also intellectual. Edinburgh's Castle Rock reminded returning grand tourists of the Athenian Acropolis , as did aspects of the neoclassical architecture and layout of New Town .

[ 22 ] In 1818, naturalist Edward Daniel Clarke called Edinburgh "a very correct model of a Grecian city", pointing out perceived similarities between both cities and their ports (respectively, Leith and Piraeus ).

[ 22 ] Intellectually, the Scottish Enlightenment , with its humanist and rationalist outlook, was influenced by Ancient Greek philosophy .

[ 23 ] In 1822 the English landscape painter Hugh William Williams organised an exhibition that showed his paintings of Athens alongside views of Edinburgh, and the idea of a direct parallel between both cities quickly caught the popular imagination.

[ 24 ] When plans were drawn up in the early 19th century to architecturally develop Calton Hill , the design of the National Monument directly copied Athens' Parthenon .

[ 25 ] Tom Stoppard 's character Archie of Jumpers said, perhaps playing on Reykjavík meaning "smoky bay", that the "Reykjavík of the South" would be more appropriate.

[ 26 ] The city has also been known by several Latin names , such as Edinburgum , while the adjectival forms Edinburgensis and Edinensis are used in educational and scientific contexts.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Edina is a late 18th-century poetical form used by the Scottish poets Robert Fergusson and Robert Burns . "Embra" or "Embro" are colloquialisms from the same time, [ 29 ] as in Robert Garioch 's Embro to the Ploy .

[ 30 ] Ben Jonson described it as "Britaine's other eye", [ 31 ] and Sir Walter Scott referred to it as "yon Empress of the North".

[ 32 ] Robert Louis Stevenson , also a son of the city, wrote that Edinburgh "is what Paris ought to be".

[ 33 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Edinburgh Early history [ edit ] Surgeons' Hall , one of the Greek Revival buildings that earned Edinburgh the nickname "Athens of the North" The earliest known human habitation in the Edinburgh area was at Cramond , where evidence was found of a Mesolithic camp site dated to c. 8500 BC.

[ 34 ] Traces of later Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements have been found on Castle Rock, Arthur's Seat , Craiglockhart Hill , and the Pentland Hills .

[ 35 ] When the Romans arrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they found a Brittonic Celtic tribe whose name they recorded as the Votadini .

[ 36 ] The Votadini transitioned into the Gododdin kingdom in the Early Middle Ages , with Eidyn serving as one of the kingdom's districts. During this period, the Castle Rock site, thought to have been the stronghold of Din Eidyn, emerged as the kingdom's major centre.

[ 37 ] The medieval Welsh-language poem Y Gododdin describes a war band from across the Brittonic world who gathered in Eidyn before a fateful raid; this may describe a historical event around AD 600.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] In 638 the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal to King Oswald of Northumbria , and around this time, control of Lothian passed to the Angles . Their influence continued for the next three centuries until around 950, when, during the reign of Indulf , son of Constantine II , the "burh" (fortress), named in the 10th-century Pictish Chronicle as oppidum Eden , [ 41 ] was abandoned to the Scots. It thenceforth remained, for the most part, under their jurisdiction.

[ 42 ] The royal burgh was founded by King David I in the early 12th century on land belonging to the Crown, though the date of its charter is unknown.

[ 43 ] The first documentary evidence of the medieval burgh is a royal charter , c.

1124–1127 , by King David I granting a toft in burgo meo de Edenesburg to the Priory of Dunfermline .

[ 44 ] The shire of Edinburgh seems also to have been created during David's reign, possibly covering all of Lothian at first, but by 1305 the eastern and western parts of Lothian had become Haddingtonshire and Linlithgowshire , leaving Edinburgh as the county town of a shire covering the central part of Lothian, which was called Edinburghshire or Midlothian (the latter name being an informal, but commonly used, alternative until the county's name was legally changed in 1947).

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] Edinburgh, showing Arthur's Seat, one of the earliest known sites of human habitation in the area Edinburgh was largely under English control from 1291 to 1314 and from 1333 to 1341, during the Wars of Scottish Independence . When the English invaded Scotland in 1298 , Edward I of England chose not to enter Edinburgh but passed by it with his army.

[ 47 ] In the middle of the 14th century the French chronicler Jean Froissart described it as the capital of Scotland (c. 1365), and James III (1451–1488) referred to it in the 15th century as "the principal burgh of our kingdom".

[ 48 ] In 1482 James III "granted and perpetually confirmed to the said Provost, Bailies, Clerk, Council, and Community, and their successors, the office of Sheriff within the Burgh for ever, to be exercised by the Provost for the time as Sheriff, and by the Bailies for the time as Sheriffsdepute conjunctly and severally; with full power to hold Courts, to punish transgressors not only by banishment but by death, to appoint officers of Court, and to do everything else appertaining to the office of Sheriff; as also to apply to their own proper use the fines and escheats arising out of the exercise of the said office." [ 49 ] Despite being burnt by the English in 1544, Edinburgh continued to develop and grow, [ 50 ] and was at the centre of events in the 16th-century Scottish Reformation [ 51 ] and 17th-century Wars of the Covenant .

[ 52 ] In 1582 Edinburgh's town council was given a royal charter by King James VI and I permitting the establishment of a university; [ 53 ] founded as Tounis College (Town's College), the institution developed into the University of Edinburgh , which contributed to Edinburgh's central intellectual role in subsequent centuries.

[ 54 ] 17th century [ edit ] Edinburgh in the 17th century In 1603 King James VI of Scotland succeeded to the English throne, uniting the crowns of Scotland and England, an event known as the Union of the Crowns , though the two kingdoms remained separate realms governed in personal union .

[ 55 ] In 1638 King Charles I 's attempt to introduce Anglican church forms in Scotland encountered stiff Presbyterian opposition, culminating in the conflicts of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms .

[ 56 ] Subsequent Scottish support for Charles II 's restoration to the throne of England resulted in Edinburgh's occupation by Oliver Cromwell 's Commonwealth of England forces – the New Model Army – in 1650.

[ 57 ] In the 17th century Edinburgh's boundaries were still defined by the city's defensive town walls . As a result, the city's growing population was accommodated by increasing the height of the houses. Buildings of 11 storeys or more were common, [ 58 ] and have been described as forerunners of the modern-day skyscraper.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] Most of these old structures were replaced by the predominantly Victorian buildings seen in today's Old Town. In 1611 an act of parliament created the High Constables of Edinburgh to keep order in the city, thought to be the oldest statutory police force in the world.

[ 61 ] 18th century [ edit ] A painting showing Edinburgh characters (based on John Kay 's caricatures) behind St Giles' Cathedral in the late 18th century Following the Treaty of Union in 1706, the Parliaments of England and Scotland passed Acts of Union in 1706 and 1707 respectively, uniting the two kingdoms in the Kingdom of Great Britain effective from 1 May 1707.

[ 62 ] As a consequence, the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England to form the Parliament of Great Britain , which sat at Westminster in London. The Union was opposed by many Scots, resulting in riots in the city.

[ 63 ] By the first half of the 18th century, Edinburgh was described as one of Europe's most densely populated, overcrowded, and unsanitary towns.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] Visitors were struck by the fact that the social classes shared the same urban space, even inhabiting the same tenement buildings; although here a form of social segregation did prevail, whereby shopkeepers and tradesmen tended to occupy the cheaper-to-rent cellars and garrets, while the more well-to-do professional classes occupied the more expensive middle storeys.

[ 66 ] During the Jacobite rising of 1745 , Edinburgh was briefly occupied by the Jacobite "Highland Army" before its march into England.

[ 67 ] After its eventual defeat at Culloden , there followed a period of reprisals and pacification, largely directed at the rebellious clans .

[ 68 ] In Edinburgh, the Town Council, keen to emulate London by initiating city improvements and expansion to the north of the castle, [ 69 ] reaffirmed its belief in the Union and loyalty to the Hanoverian monarch George III by its choice of names for the streets of the New Town: for example, Rose Street and Thistle Street; and for the royal family, George Street , Queen Street , Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Princes Street (in honour of George's two sons).

[ 70 ] The consistently geometric layout of the plan for the extension of Edinburgh was the result of a major competition in urban planning staged by the Town Council in 1766.

[ 71 ] In the second half of the century, the city was at the heart of the Scottish Enlightenment , [ 72 ] when thinkers like David Hume , Adam Smith , James Hutton and Joseph Black were familiar figures in its streets. Edinburgh became a major intellectual centre, earning it the nickname "Athens of the North" because of its many neo-classical buildings and reputation for learning, recalling ancient Athens.

[ 73 ] In the 18th-century novel The Expedition of Humphry Clinker by Tobias Smollett one character describes Edinburgh as a "hotbed of genius".

[ 74 ] Edinburgh was also a major centre for the Scottish book trade. The highly successful London bookseller Andrew Millar was apprenticed there to James McEuen.

[ 75 ] From the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant "one-family" residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the city's social character. According to the foremost historian of this development, "Unity of social feeling was one of the most valuable heritages of old Edinburgh, and its disappearance was widely and properly lamented." [ 76 ] 19th and 20th centuries [ edit ] Edinburgh, c. 1920 Despite an enduring myth to the contrary, [ 77 ] Edinburgh became an industrial centre [ 78 ] with its traditional industries of printing, brewing and distilling continuing to grow in the 19th century and joined by new industries such as rubber works , engineering works and others. By 1821 Edinburgh had been overtaken by Glasgow as Scotland's largest city.

[ 79 ] The city centre between Princes Street and George Street became a major commercial and shopping district, a development partly stimulated by the arrival of railways in the 1840s. The Old Town became an increasingly dilapidated, overcrowded slum with high mortality rates.

[ 80 ] Improvements carried out under Lord Provost William Chambers in the 1860s began the transformation of the area into the predominantly Victorian Old Town seen today.

[ 81 ] More improvements followed in the early 20th century as a result of the work of Patrick Geddes , [ 82 ] but relative economic stagnation during the two world wars and beyond saw the Old Town deteriorate further before major slum clearance in the 1960s and 1970s began to reverse the process. University building developments, which transformed the George Square and Potterrow areas, proved highly controversial.

[ 83 ] Queen Elizabeth II and Donald Dewar at the opening of the Scottish Parliament , 1999 Since the 1990s a new "financial district", including the Edinburgh International Conference Centre , has grown mainly on demolished railway property to the west of the castle, stretching into Fountainbridge , a run-down 19th-century industrial suburb which has undergone radical change since the 1980s with the demise of industrial and brewery premises. This ongoing development has enabled Edinburgh to maintain its place as the United Kingdom's second largest financial and administrative centre after London.

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] Financial services now account for a third of all commercial office space in the city.

[ 86 ] The development of Edinburgh Park , a new business and technology park covering 38 acres (15 ha), 4 mi (6 km) west of the city centre, has also contributed to the District Council's strategy for the city's major economic regeneration.

[ 86 ] In 1998 the Scotland Act , which came into force the following year, established a devolved Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive (renamed the Scottish Government since September 2007 [ 87 ] ). Both based in Edinburgh, they are responsible for governing Scotland while reserved matters such as defence, foreign affairs, and some elements of income tax remain the responsibility of the Parliament of the United Kingdom in London.

[ 88 ] 21st century [ edit ] In 2022 Edinburgh was affected by the 2022 Scotland bin strikes .

[ 89 ] In 2023 Edinburgh became the first capital city in Europe to sign the global Plant Based Treaty , which was introduced at COP26 in 2021 in Glasgow.

[ 90 ] The Scottish Greens councillor Steve Burgess introduced the treaty. The Scottish Countryside Alliance and other farming groups called the treaty "anti-farming".

[ 91 ] Geography [ edit ] Location [ edit ] Victoria Street in October 2021 Situated in Scotland's Central Belt , Edinburgh lies on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. The city centre is 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 mi (4.0 km) southwest of the shoreline of Leith and 26 mi (42 km) inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the North Sea at Dunbar .

[ 92 ] While the early burgh grew up near the prominent Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built on seven hills , namely Calton Hill , Corstorphine Hill , Craiglockhart Hill, Braid Hill , Blackford Hill , Arthur's Seat and the Castle Rock, [ 93 ] giving rise to allusions to the seven hills of Rome .

[ 94 ] Cityscape [ edit ] Edinburgh. View from Calton Hill.

Occupying a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the Pentland Hills and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.

[ 95 ] : 64–65 Igneous activity between 350 and 400 million years ago, coupled with faulting , led to the creation of tough basalt volcanic plugs , which predominate over much of the area.

[ 95 ] : 64–65 One such example is the Castle Rock which forced the advancing ice sheet to divide, sheltering the softer rock and forming a 1 mi-long (1.6 km) tail of material to the east, thus creating a distinctive crag and tail formation.

[ 95 ] : 64–65 Glacial erosion on the north side of the crag gouged a deep valley later filled by the now drained Nor Loch . These features, along with another hollow on the rock's south side, formed an ideal natural strongpoint upon which Edinburgh Castle was built.

[ 95 ] : 64–65 Similarly, Arthur's Seat is the remains of a volcano dating from the Carboniferous period , which was eroded by a glacier moving west to east during the ice age.

[ 95 ] : 64–65 Erosive action such as plucking and abrasion exposed the rocky crags to the west before leaving a tail of deposited glacial material swept to the east.

[ 96 ] This process formed the distinctive Salisbury Crags , a series of teschenite cliffs between Arthur's Seat and the location of the early burgh.

[ 97 ] The residential areas of Marchmont and Bruntsfield are built along a series of drumlin ridges south of the city centre, which were deposited as the glacier receded.

[ 95 ] : 64–65 Other prominent landforms, such as Calton Hill and Corstorphine Hill , are also products of glacial erosion.

[ 95 ] : 64–65 The Braid Hills and Blackford Hill are a series of small summits to the south of the city centre that command expansive views looking northwards over the urban area to the Firth of Forth.

[ 95 ] : 64–65 Panorama of Edinburgh, 2025 Edinburgh is drained by the river named the Water of Leith , which rises at the Colzium Springs in the Pentland Hills and runs for 18 miles (29 km) through the south and west of the city, emptying into the Firth of Forth at Leith.

[ 98 ] The nearest the river gets to the city centre is at Dean Village on the north-western edge of the New Town, where a deep gorge is spanned by Thomas Telford 's Dean Bridge , built in 1832 for the road to Queensferry . The Water of Leith Walkway is a mixed-use trail that follows the course of the river for 19.6 km (12.2 mi) from Balerno to Leith.

[ 99 ] Excepting the shoreline of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a green belt , designated in 1957, which stretches from Dalmeny in the west to Prestongrange in the east.

[ 100 ] With an average width of 3.2 km (2 mi) the principal objectives of the green belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas.

[ 100 ] Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as Edinburgh Airport and the Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston lie within the zone.

[ 100 ] Similarly, suburbs such as Juniper Green and Balerno are situated on green belt land.

[ 100 ] One feature of the Edinburgh green belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, even though they do not connect with the peripheral ring. Examples of these independent wedges of green belt include Holyrood Park and Corstorphine Hill.

[ 100 ] Areas [ edit ] Map showing the areas of central Edinburgh Early settlements [ edit ] Edinburgh includes former towns and villages that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the expanding city of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

[ 101 ] Many areas, such as Dalry , contain residences that are multi-occupancy buildings known as tenements , although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been less built-up with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.

[ 102 ] The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided into two by the broad green swathe of Princes Street Gardens . To the south, the view is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built high on Castle Rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.

The West End includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.

Old and New Towns [ edit ] Skyline of the Edinburgh Old Town Edinburgh's Old and New Towns were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500 listed buildings within the city, [ 10 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ] a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.

The castle is perched on top of a rocky crag (the remnant of an extinct volcano), and the Royal Mile runs down the crest of a ridge from it, terminating at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets (called closes or wynds ) lie on either side of the main spine, forming a herringbone pattern.

[ 105 ] Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest "high rise" residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as lands were the norm from the 16th century onwards, with ten and eleven storeys being typical, and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys.

[ 106 ] Vaults below street level were inhabited to accommodate the influx of incomers, particularly Irish immigrants , during the Industrial Revolution . The street has several fine public buildings such as St Giles' Cathedral, the City Chambers and the Law Courts . Other places of historical interest nearby are Greyfriars Kirkyard and Mary King's Close . The Grassmarket , running deep below the castle, is connected by the steep double terraced Victoria Street. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many Northern European cities.

The New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city, which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a "New Town" was won by James Craig , a 27-year-old architect.

[ 107 ] The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with Enlightenment ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be George Street , running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the "Old Town". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become Edinburgh's main shopping street and now has few of its Georgian buildings in their original state. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by St Andrew Square and Charlotte Square respectively.

Skyline of the Edinburgh New Town The latter, designed by Robert Adam , influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century.

[ 108 ] Bute House , the official residence of the First Minister of Scotland , is on the north side of Charlotte Square.

[ 109 ] The hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the Nor Loch , which was created for the town's defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their sewage . It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city's northward expansion. Craig's original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch, [ 70 ] but this idea was abandoned.

[ 110 ] Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the loch to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as The Mound .

In the middle of the 19th century the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy Building were built on The Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between Haymarket and Waverley stations were driven through it.

Southside [ edit ] The Southside is a residential part of the city, which includes the districts of St Leonards , Marchmont , Morningside , Newington , Sciennes , the Grange and Blackford . The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the Burgh Muir , and was developed as a residential area after the opening of the South Bridge in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families (many state and private schools are here), young professionals and students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around George Square just north of Marchmont and the Meadows ), and Napier University (with major campuses around Merchiston and Morningside). The area is also well provided with hotels and "bed and breakfast" accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example, Church Hill in Morningside, was the home of Muriel Spark 's Miss Jean Brodie, [ 111 ] and Ian Rankin 's Inspector Rebus lives in Marchmont and works in St Leonards.

[ 112 ] Leith [ edit ] The Shore, Leith Leith was historically the port of Edinburgh, an arrangement of unknown date that was confirmed by the royal charter Robert the Bruce granted to the city in 1329.

[ 113 ] The port developed a separate identity from Edinburgh, which to some extent it still retains, and it was a matter of great resentment when the two burghs merged in 1920 into the City of Edinburgh.

[ 114 ] Even today, the parliamentary seat is known as "Edinburgh North and Leith". The loss of traditional industries and commerce (the last shipyard closed in 1983) resulted in economic decline.

[ 115 ] The Edinburgh Waterfront development has transformed old dockland areas from Leith to Granton into residential areas with shopping and leisure facilities and helped rejuvenate the area. With the redevelopment, Edinburgh has gained the business of cruise liner companies, which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The coastal suburb of Portobello is characterised by Georgian villas, Victorian tenements, a beach and promenade , and cafés, bars, restaurants and independent shops. There are rowing and sailing clubs, a restored Victorian swimming pool, and Victorian Turkish baths .

Urban area [ edit ] The urban area of Edinburgh is almost entirely within the City of Edinburgh Council boundary, merging with Musselburgh in East Lothian. Towns within easy reach of the city boundary include Inverkeithing , Haddington , Tranent , Prestonpans , Dalkeith , Bonnyrigg , Loanhead , Penicuik , Broxburn , Livingston and Dunfermline . Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh & South East Scotland City region, with a population in 2014 of 1,339,380.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] Climate [ edit ] Sunshine in Princes Street Gardens Like most of Scotland, Edinburgh has a cool temperate maritime climate ( Cfb ) which, despite its northerly latitude, is milder than places which lie at similar latitudes such as Moscow and Labrador .

[ 118 ] The city's proximity to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. Winter daytime temperatures rarely fall below freezing while summer temperatures are moderate, rarely exceeding 22 °C (72 °F).

[ 118 ] The highest temperature recorded in the city was 31.6 °C (88.9 °F) on 25 July 2019 [ 118 ] at Gogarbank, beating the previous record of 31 °C (88 °F) on 4 August 1975 at Edinburgh Airport.

[ 119 ] The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was −14.6 °C (5.7 °F) during December 2010 at Gogarbank.

[ 120 ] Given Edinburgh's position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as "the windy city", with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south-west, which is often associated with warm, unstable air from the North Atlantic Current that can give rise to rainfall – although considerably less than cities to the west, such as Glasgow.

[ 118 ] Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.

[ 118 ] Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by haar , a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as European windstorms , can affect the city between October and April.

[ 118 ] Located slightly north of the city centre, the weather station at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) has been an official weather station for the Met Office since 1956.
The Met Office operates its own weather station at Gogarbank on the city's western outskirts, near Edinburgh Airport .

[ 121 ] This slightly inland station has a slightly wider temperature span between seasons, is cloudier and somewhat wetter, but differences are minor.

Temperature and rainfall records have been kept at the Royal Observatory since 1764.

506,520 for the locality (includes Currie ), [ 6 ] and
530,990 for the Edinburgh settlement (includes Musselburgh ).

[ 6 ] Edinburgh has a high proportion of young adults, with 19.5% of the population in their 20s (exceeded only by Aberdeen) and 15.2% in their 30s which is the highest in Scotland. The proportion of Edinburgh's population born in the UK fell from 92% to 84% between 2001 and 2011, while the proportion of White Scottish-born fell from 78% to 70%. Of those Edinburgh residents born in the UK, 335,000 or 83% were born in Scotland, with 58,000 or 14% being born in England.

Of the Non-White population, the largest group by far is Asian , totalling about 44 thousand people. Within the Asian population, people of Chinese descent are now the largest sub-group, with 15,076 people, amounting to about 2.9% of the city's total population. The city's population of Indian descent amounts to 12,414 (2.4% of the total population), while there are some 7,454 of Pakistani descent (1.5% of the total population). Although they account for only 2,685 people or 0.5% of the city's population, Edinburgh has the highest number and proportion of people of Bangladeshi descent in Scotland. Close to 12,000 people were born in African countries (2.3% of the total population) and over 13,000 in the Americas. With the notable exception of Inner London, Edinburgh has a higher number of people born in the United States (over 6,500) than any other city in the UK.

[ 136 ] In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population expanded rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831, primarily due to migration from rural areas.

[ 95 ] : 9 As the population grew, problems of overcrowding in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped tenements that lined the present-day Royal Mile and the Cowgate , were exacerbated.

[ 95 ] : 9 Poor sanitary arrangements resulted in a high incidence of disease, [ 95 ] : 9 with outbreaks of cholera occurring in 1832, 1848, and 1866.

[ 137 ] The construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower-density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.

[ 138 ] Expansion southwards from the Old Town saw more tenements being built in the 19th century, giving rise to Victorian suburbs such as Dalry , Newington, Marchmont and Bruntsfield.

[ 138 ] Early 20th-century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh's population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central London.

[ 139 ] From the early to mid 20th century, the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as Dumbiedykes , Leith , and Fountainbridge , led to the creation of new estates such as Stenhouse and Saughton , Craigmillar and Niddrie , Pilton and Muirhouse , Piershill , and Sighthill .

[ 222 ] The council comprises 63 elected councillors , returned from 17 multi-member electoral wards in the city.

[ 223 ] Following the 2007 City of Edinburgh Council election the incumbent Labour Party lost majority control of the council after 23 years to a Liberal Democrat / SNP coalition.

[ 224 ] After the 2017 election, the SNP and Labour formed a coalition administration, which lasted until the next election in 2022. The 2022 City of Edinburgh Council election resulted in the most politically balanced council in the UK, with 19 SNP, 13 Labour, 12 Liberal Democrat, 10 Green, and 9 Conservative councillors. A minority Labour administration was formed, being voted in by Scottish Conservative and Scottish Liberal Democrat councillors. The SNP and Greens presented a coalition agreement, but could not command a majority in the council. This caused controversy amongst the Scottish Labour Party group for forming an administration supported by Conservatives, and led to the suspension of two Labour councillors on the council for abstaining on the vote to approve the new administration.

[ 225 ] The city's coat of arms was registered by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1732.

[ 226 ] Politics [ edit ] The Scottish Parliament is located in the Holyrood area of the city.

Edinburgh, like all of Scotland, is represented in the Scottish Parliament , situated in the Holyrood area of the city. For electoral purposes, the city is divided into six constituencies, which, along with 3 seats outside of the city, form part of the Lothian region .

[ 227 ] Each constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional MSPs to produce a result based on a form of proportional representation.

However, following her election as the Presiding Officer of the 6th Session of the Scottish Parliament on 13 May 2021, Alison Johnstone has abided by the established parliamentary convention for speakers and renounced all affiliation with her former political party for the duration of her term as Presiding Officer. So she presently sits as an independent MSP for the Lothians Region.

The line was later extended north onto Leith and Newhaven , opening a further eight stops to passengers in June 2023. The York Place stop was replaced by a new island stop at Picardy Place . The original plan would have seen a second line run from Haymarket through Ravelston and Craigleith to Granton Square on the Waterfront Edinburgh . This was shelved in 2011 but is now once again under consideration, as is another line potentially linking the south of the city and the Bioquarter .

[ 242 ] There were also long-term plans for lines running west from the airport to Ratho and Newbridge and another connecting Granton to Newhaven via Lower Granton Road. Lothian Buses and Edinburgh Trams are both owned and operated by Transport for Edinburgh .

[ 292 ] International relations [ edit ] Twin towns and sister cities [ edit ] See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Scotland The City of Edinburgh has entered into 14 international twinning arrangements since 1954.

[ 293 ] Most of the arrangements are styled as Twin Cities but the agreement with Kraków is designated as a Partner City , [ 293 ] and the agreement with Kyoto Prefecture is officially styled as a Friendship Link , reflecting its status as the only region to be twinned with Edinburgh.

[ 293 ] In June 2024, the City of Edinburgh Council shelved plans for a friendship arrangement with Kaohsiung , Taiwan , after a report raised concerns that the agreement could heighten cyber attacks. A few weeks before the decision, the Chinese Consul General met with Scottish government minister Angus Robertson to protest against the potential agreement. In a letter to the city council, the Chinese representative said signing a sister city agreement "will hurt the feeling of the Chinese people and bring about serious consequences to … bilateral relations".
