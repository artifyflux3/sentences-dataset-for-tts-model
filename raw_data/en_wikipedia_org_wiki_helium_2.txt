[ 4 ] All radioisotopes are short-lived; the longest-lived is 6 He with half-life 806.92(24) milliseconds . The least stable is 10 He, with half-life 260(40) yoctoseconds ( 2.6(4) × 10 −22 s ), though 2 He may have an even shorter half-life.

In Earth's atmosphere, the ratio of 3 He to 4 He is 1.343(13) × 10 −6 .

[ 5 ] However, the isotopic abundance of helium varies greatly depending on its origin. In the Local Interstellar Cloud , the proportion of 3 He to 4 He is 1.62(29) × 10 −4 , [ 6 ] which is ~121 times higher than in Earth's atmosphere. Rocks from Earth's crust have isotope ratios varying by as much as a factor of ten; this is used in geology to investigate the origin of rocks and the composition of the Earth's mantle .

[ 7 ] The different formation processes of the two stable isotopes of helium produce the differing isotope abundances.

Equal mixtures of liquid 3 He and 4 He below 0.8 K separate into two immiscible phases due to differences in quantum statistics : 4 He atoms are bosons while 3 He atoms are fermions .

[ 8 ] Dilution refrigerators take advantage of the immiscibility of these two isotopes to achieve temperatures of a few milli kelvin .

A mix of the two isotopes spontaneously separates into 3 He-rich and 4 He-rich regions.

[ 9 ] Phase separation also exists in ultracold gas systems.

[ 10 ] It has been shown experimentally in a two-component ultracold Fermi gas case.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The phase separation can compete with other phenomena as vortex lattice formation or an exotic Fulde–Ferrell–Larkin–Ovchinnikov phase .

Helium-2, 2 He, is extremely unstable. Its nucleus, a diproton , consists of two protons with no neutrons . According to theoretical calculations, it would be much more stable (but still β + decay to deuterium ) if the strong force were 2% greater.

[ 18 ] Its instability is due to spin–spin interactions in the nuclear force and the Pauli exclusion principle , which states that within a given quantum system two or more identical particles with the same half-integer spins (that is, fermions) cannot simultaneously occupy the same quantum state; so 2 He's two protons have opposite-aligned spins and the diproton itself has negative binding energy .

[ 19 ] 2 He may have been observed. In 2000, physicists first observed a new type of radioactive decay in which a nucleus emits two protons at once—perhaps 2 He.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] The team led by Alfredo Galindo-Uribarri of Oak Ridge National Laboratory announced that the discovery will help understand the strong nuclear force and provide fresh insights into stellar nucleosynthesis . Galindo-Uribarri and co-workers chose an isotope of neon with an energy structure that prevents it from emitting protons one at a time. This means the two protons are ejected simultaneously. The team fired a beam of fluorine ions at a proton-rich target to produce 18 Ne, which then decayed into oxygen and two protons. Any protons ejected from the target itself were identified by their characteristic energies. The two-proton emission may proceed in two ways: the neon might eject a diproton, which then decays into separate protons, or the protons may be emitted separately but simultaneously in a "democratic decay". The experiment was not sensitive enough to establish which of these two processes was taking place.

More evidence of 2 He was found in 2008 at Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare , in Italy.

[ 15 ] [ 22 ] A beam of 20 Ne ions was directed at a target of beryllium foil. This collision converted some of the heavier neon nuclei in the beam into 18 Ne nuclei. These nuclei then collided with a foil of lead. The second collision excited the 18 Ne nucleus into a highly unstable condition. As in the earlier experiment at Oak Ridge, the 18 Ne nucleus decayed into an 16 O nucleus, plus two protons detected exiting from the same direction. The new experiment showed that the two protons were initially ejected together, correlated in a quasibound 1 S configuration , before decaying into separate protons much less than a nanosecond later.

Further evidence comes from Riken in Japan and Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna , Russia , where beams of 6 He nuclei were directed at a cryogenic hydrogen target to produce 5 H. It was discovered that the 6 He can donate all four of its neutrons to the hydrogen.

[ citation needed ] The two remaining protons could be simultaneously ejected from the target as a diproton, which quickly decayed into two protons. A similar reaction has also been observed from 8 He nuclei colliding with hydrogen.

[ 23 ] Under the influence of electromagnetic interactions, the Jaffe-Low primitives [ 24 ] may leave the unitary cut, creating narrow two-nucleon resonances, like a diproton resonance with a mass of 2000 MeV and a width of a few hundred keV.

[ 25 ] To search for this resonance, a beam of protons with kinetic energy 250 MeV and an energy spread below 100 keV is required, which is feasible considering the electron cooling of the beam.

2 He is an intermediate in the first step of the proton–proton chain . The first step of the proton-proton chain is a two-stage process: first, two protons fuse to form a diproton: 1 H + 1 H + 1.25 MeV → 2 He; in a low-probability branch, the diproton beta-plus decays into deuterium : 2 He → 2 H + e + + ν e + 1.67 MeV ; with the overall formula 1 H + 1 H → 2 H + e + + ν e + 0.42 MeV .

More than 99.99% of the time the diproton fissions back to two protons. The hypothetical effect of a bound diproton on Big Bang and stellar nucleosynthesis , has been investigated.

[ 18 ] Some models suggest that variations in the strong force allowing a bound diproton would enable the conversion of all primordial hydrogen to helium in the Big Bang, which would be catastrophic for the development of stars and life. This notion is an example of the anthropic principle . However, a 2009 study suggests that such a conclusion cannot be drawn, as the formed diproton would still decay to deuterium, whose binding energy would also increase. In some scenarios, it is postulated that hydrogen (in the form of 2 H) could still survive in large amounts, rebutting arguments that the strong force is tuned within a precise anthropic limit.

[ 26 ] Helium-3 [ edit ] Main article: Helium-3 3 He is the only stable isotope other than 1 H with more protons than neutrons. There are many such unstable isotopes, such as 7 Be and 8 B. There is only a trace (~2ppm) [ 16 ] of 3 He on Earth, mainly present since the formation of the Earth, although some falls to Earth trapped in cosmic dust.

[ 7 ] Trace amounts are also produced by the beta decay of tritium .

[ 27 ] In stars , however, 3 He is more abundant, a product of nuclear fusion . Extraplanetary material, such as lunar and asteroid regolith , has traces of 3 He from solar wind bombardment.

To become superfluid , 3 He must be cooled to 2.5 milli kelvin , ~900 times lower than 4 He ( 2.17 K ). This difference is explained by quantum statistics : 3 He atoms are fermions , while 4 He atoms are bosons , which condense to a superfluid more easily.

Helium-4 [ edit ] Main article: Helium-4 The most common isotope, 4 He, is produced on Earth by alpha decay of heavier elements; the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized 4 He nuclei.

4 He is an unusually stable nucleus because it is doubly magic . It was formed in enormous quantities in Big Bang nucleosynthesis .

Terrestrial helium consists almost exclusively (all but ~2ppm) [ 16 ] of 4 He.

4 He's boiling point of 4.2 K is the lowest of all known substances except 3 He. When cooled further to 2.17 K , it becomes a unique superfluid with zero viscosity . It solidifies only at pressures above 25 atmospheres, where it melts at 0.95 K .

Helium-5 [ edit ] A 1987 Soviet stamp celebrating the T-15 tokamak depicts the helium-5 nucleus during deuterium–tritium fusion Fusion cross sections of major reactions. Without the resonance in helium-5, the DT reaction would be similar to the DD reaction.

Helium-5 is extremely unstable, decaying to helium-4 with a half-life of 602 yoctoseconds. It is briefly produced in the favorable fusion reaction: 2 H + 3 H ⟶ ⟶ 5 H e ∗ ∗ ⟶ ⟶ 4 H e + n + 17.6 M e V {\displaystyle {}^{2}\mathrm {H} +{}^{3}\mathrm {H} \longrightarrow {}^{5}\mathrm {He} ^{*}\longrightarrow {}^{4}\mathrm {He} +n+17.6\ \mathrm {MeV} } The reaction is greatly enhanced by the existence of a resonance. Helium-5, which has a natural spin state of -3/2 at the 0 MeV ground state, has a +3/2 excited spin state at 16.84 MeV. Because the reaction creates helium-5 nuclei with an energy level close to this state, it happens more frequently. This was discovered by Egon Bretscher , who was investigating weaponization of fusion reactions for the Manhattan Project .

The DT reaction specifically is 100 times more likely than the DD reaction at relevant energies, but would be similar without the resonance. The 2 H- 3 He reaction benefits from a similar resonance in lithium-5 , but is Coulomb -suppressed i.e. the +2 helium nucleus charge increases the electrostatic repulsion for fusing nuclei.

[ 28 ] Helium-6 and helium-8 [ edit ] Helium-6 is the longest-lived radioactive isotope of helium; it beta decays with a half-life of 806.92 milliseconds. The most widely studied heavy helium isotope is 8 He, [ citation needed ] which beta decays with a half-life of 119.5 milliseconds.

6 He and 8 He are thought to consist of a normal 4 He nucleus surrounded by a neutron "halo" (of two neutrons in 6 He and four neutrons in 8 He). The unusual structures of halo nuclei may offer insights into the isolated properties of neutrons and physics beyond the Standard Model .

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Helium-10 [ edit ] The shortest-lived and heaviest known helium isotope is 10 He. Despite being a doubly magic isotope, 10 He is not particle-bound and near-instantly drips out two neutrons (half-life ~260 yoctoseconds).
