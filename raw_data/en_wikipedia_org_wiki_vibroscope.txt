Vibroscope ( Latin : vibrare 'vibrate' + scope ) is an instrument for observing and tracing (and sometimes recording) vibration .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] For example, a primitive mechanical vibroscope consists of a vibrating object with a pointy end which leaves a wave trace on a smoked surface of a rotating cylinder .

[ 3 ] Vibroscopes are used to study properties of substances. For examples, polymers ' torsional modulus and Young's modulus may be determined by vibrating the polymers and measuring their frequency of vibration under certain external forces.

[ 4 ] Similar approach works to determine linear density of thread-shaped objects, such as fibers , filaments , and yarn .

[ 5 ] Vibroscopes are also used to study sound in different areas of the mouth during speech.

[ 6 ] Jean-Marie Duhamel published about an early recording device he called a vibroscope in 1843.
