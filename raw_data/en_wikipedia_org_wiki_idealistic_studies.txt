1786353 Links Journal homepage Online access Idealistic Studies is a triannual peer-reviewed academic journal covering studies of idealistic themes. Both historical and contemporary statements of idealistic argumentation are published, as are also historico-philosophical studies of idealism. The journal was established in 1971 by Robert N. Beck with the assistance of the Clark University philosophy department. Initially focused on American personalism and post- Kantian idealism, the journal's mission has broadened to include other topics, including historically earlier expressions as well as developments of the late 19th to mid-20th century. The journal has become a venue for a number of philosophical movements that share Idealism in their genealogies, including phenomenology , neo-Kantianism , historicism , hermeneutics , life philosophy , existentialism , and pragmatism . It is published by the Philosophy Documentation Center and the editor-in-chief is Jennifer Bates ( Duquesne University ).
