[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The UGCoP is very closely related to the Modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), and like the MAUP, arises from how we divide the land into areal units.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] It is caused by the difficulty, or impossibility, of understanding how phenomena under investigation (such as people within a census tract) in different enumeration units interact between enumeration units, and outside of a study area over time.

[ 1 ] [ 6 ] It is particularly important to consider the UGCoP within the discipline of time geography , where phenomena under investigation can move between spatial enumeration units during the study period.

[ 2 ] Examples of research that needs to consider the UGCoP include food access and human mobility.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Schematic and example of a space-time prism using transit network data: On the right is a schematic diagram of a space-time prism, and on the left is a map of the potential path area for two different time budgets.

[ 9 ] The uncertain geographic context problem, or UGCoP, was first coined by Dr.

Mei-Po Kwan in 2012.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The problem is highly related to the ecological fallacy , edge effect, and Modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) in that, it relates to aggregate units as they apply to individuals.

[ 5 ] The crux of the problem is that the boundaries we use for aggregation are arbitrary and may not represent the actual neighborhood of the individuals within them.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] While a particular enumeration unit, such as a census tract , contains a person's location, they may cross its boundaries to work, go to school, and shop in completely different areas.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Thus, the geographic phenomena under investigation extends beyond the delineated boundary .

[ 6 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Different individuals, or groups may have completely different activity spaces , making an enumeration unit that is relevant for one person meaningless to another.

[ 7 ] [ 14 ] For example, a map that aggregates people by school districts will be more meaningful when studying a population of students than the general population.

[ 15 ] Traditional spatial analysis, by necessity, treats each discrete areal unit as a self-contained neighborhood and does not consider the daily activity of crossing the boundaries.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Implications [ edit ] The UGCoP has further implications when considering the area outside of a study area.

Tobler's second law of geography states, "the phenomenon external to a geographic area of interest affects what goes on inside." [ 16 ] [ 12 ] As a study area is often a subset of the planet, data on the edges of the study area will be excluded.

[ 17 ] If the boundary demarcating the study area is permeable to travel, then the phenomena under investigation within it may extend beyond, and be impacted by, forces excluded from the analysis.

[ 6 ] [ 18 ] This uncertainty contributes to the UGCoP.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] All maps are wrong, and a cartographer must ensure that their maps' limitations are well documented to avoid misleading the users.

[ 19 ] With modern technology, there is an emphasis on individual-level data and understanding how individuals interact with their environment.

[ 5 ] [ 8 ] When making maps with this individual-level data, the UGCoP is one source of bias that can impact the results of an analysis.

[ 1 ] When these results inform policy, they can have real world ramifications.

[ 19 ] The UGCoP is particularly important when understanding food access and human mobility.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Suggested solutions [ edit ] Geographic information systems , along with technologies that can monitor the position of individuals in real time, are possible methods for addressing the UGCoP.

[ 2 ] These technologies allow scientists to analyze and visualize the 3D space-time path of people moving through a study area, and better understand their actual activity space.

[ 2 ] Web GIS has also been employed to address the UGCoP by allowing researchers to better contextualize subjects' real and perceived activity space.

[ 2 ] [ 15 ] These technologies have helped to address the problem by moving away from aggregate data and introducing a temporal component to the modeling of subject activity.
