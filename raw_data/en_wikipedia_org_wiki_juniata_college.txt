Founded in 1876 as a co-educational normal school , it was the first college started by members of the Church of the Brethren . It was originally founded as a center for vocational learning for those who could not afford formal education.

History [ edit ] Martin Grove Brumbaugh (1862-1930), of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania , became the third president of the recently-renamed Juniata College in 1895, serving until 1910. He later became the 26th Governor of Pennsylvania , serving 1915-1919, at the Pennsylvania State Capitol in the state capital of Harrisburg . He returned as the fifth president in 1924-1930, until his death.

19th century [ edit ] "Huntingdon Normal School", a normal school , was established by a young Huntingdon physician, Andrew B. Brumbaugh , and his two cousins, Henry and John Brumbaugh.  Henry provided a second-story room over his local print shop for classes, while John lodged and fed the college's first teacher, Jacob M. Zuck . Andrew was to "provide students and furniture".

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Juniata's first classes were held on April 17, 1876, with professor Zuck teaching Rebecca Cornelius, Maggie D. Miller, and Gaius M. Brumbaugh (the only son of physician Andrew Brumbaugh).

[ citation needed ] In 1877, the school changed its name to the "Brethren Normal School". At this time, Zuck also discussed adding a "Scientific Course" and issuing "Certificates of Graduation". In 1879, classes were moved into Founder's Hall, the school's first permanent building on the present-day campus then only known as "The Building". On May 11 of same year, Jacob Zuck died from pneumonia at age 32, which he probably caught from sleeping in the then unfinished Founders Hall without a heater.

James Quinter was then chosen to lead the school as the school's first president.

[ 6 ] In 1894, due to a ruling at the Brethren Church's Annual Meeting against using the term "Brethren" in naming a school, the college's name was changed to "Juniata College" for the nearby Juniata River . This was made the school's legal name two decades later in 1896.

[ 6 ] In 1895, Martin Grove Brumbaugh (1862-1930), of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania , an 1881 graduate from the Brethren Normal (Huntingdon Normal), took over the presidency of Juniata College, leading the growing institution until 1910.

[ citation needed ] He later became the 26th Governor of Pennsylvania .

[ 7 ] Governor Brumbaugh returned to Huntingdon and Juniata College in 1924 to again assume the office of college president, which he held until his death, six years later, in March 1930, while on vacation in North Carolina .

Construction was finished in the summer of 2009 and uses underground geothermal energy to heat and cool the building. This building is recognized as a LEED Gold building.

The college also owns the Raystown Field Station, a 365-acre (148-hectare) reserve on Raystown Lake, which includes a LEED Gold building and two lodges for semester-long residential programs, often focused on environmental topics.

[ 9 ] Athletics [ edit ] Juniata is a Division III collegiate sports institution.  It is a charter member of the Landmark Conference , where it competes in all sports except football and volleyball . The athletic teams are known as the Juniata Eagles.

[ citation needed ] Football [ edit ] The Juniata College football program is a member of the Landmark Conference . The Goal Post Trophy goes to the winner of the annual football game with rival Susquehanna University . It is a section of the goal post that was torn down after the 1952 Juniata-Susquehanna game. The visiting Indians (now Eagles) upset the Crusaders (now River Hawks) in Selinsgrove, and Juniata fans tore down the goal post after the game.

[ 10 ] Volleyball [ edit ] Juniata College is known for both its men's and women's volleyball program. The men's volleyball team competes in the Continental Volleyball Conference ; it previously competed in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association , where it won several titles, even while under Division I and Division III sanctions.
