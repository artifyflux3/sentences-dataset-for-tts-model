Sakabe Kōhan ( 坂部 廣胖 ; 1759 – September 16, 1824) was a Japanese mathematician in the Edo period .

[ 1 ] Sakabe served for a time in the Fire Department of the shogunate, but he resigned that position to become a rōnin or masterless samurai.  He spent the rest of this life in study, in teaching, and in promoting mathematics education in Japan.

[ 2 ] Sakabe was a student of Ajima Naonobu .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Sakabe investigated some European and Chinese works which had appeared in Japan, but his general method was later construed to be innovative, clarified and thus improved.

[ 5 ] Foreign influence shows itself indirectly some of his published work.

[ 6 ] Sakabe's Sampo Tenzan Shinan-roku ( Treatise on Tenzan Algebra ) in 1810 was the first published work in Japan proposing the use of logarithmic tables . He explained that "these tables save much labor, [but] they are but little known for the reason that they have never been printed in our country." [ 7 ] Sakabe's proposal would not be realized until twenty years after his death when the first extensive logarithmic table was published in 1844 by Koide Shuke .

[ 8 ] In Sakabe's Treatise on Tenzan Algebra , mathematical problems are arranged in order from easy problems to difficult ones. The text presents a method for finding the length of a circumference and the length an arc of an ellipse . This was the first appearance of the problems pertaining to ellipses in printed books in Japan.
