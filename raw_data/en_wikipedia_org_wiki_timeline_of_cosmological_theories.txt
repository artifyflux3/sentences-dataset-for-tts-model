This **timeline of cosmological theories** and discoveries is a [chronological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology "Chronology") record of the development of humanity's understanding of the [cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos "Cosmos") over the last two-plus millennia. Modern [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") ideas follow the development of the [scientific discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") of [physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology").

For millennia, what today is known to be the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") was regarded as the contents of the "[whole universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe")", so advances in the knowledge of both mostly paralleled. Clear distinction was not made until circa mid-17th century. See [Timeline of Solar System astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Solar_System_astronomy "Timeline of Solar System astronomy") for further details on this side.

*   c.**16th century BCE**– Mesopotamian cosmology has a [flat, circular Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth "Flat Earth") enclosed in a [cosmic ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ocean "Cosmic ocean").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-1)
*   c.**15th–11th century BCE**– The _[Rigveda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda "Rigveda")_ of [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism") has some cosmological hymns, particularly in the late [book 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala_10 "Mandala 10"), notably the [Nasadiya Sukta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasadiya_Sukta "Nasadiya Sukta") which describes the origin of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"), originating from the [monistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monistic "Monistic")_[Hiranyagarbha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiranyagarbha "Hiranyagarbha")_ or "Golden Egg". [Primal matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prak%E1%B9%9Bti "Prakṛti") remains manifest for 311.04 trillion years and [unmanifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahapralaya "Mahapralaya") for an equal length. The universe remains manifest for [4.32 billion years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpa_(time) "Kalpa (time)") and [unmanifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pralaya "Pralaya") for an equal length. Innumerable universes exist simultaneously. These cycles have and will last forever, driven by desires.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Early Hebrew conception of the cosmos.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The firmament, [Sheol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheol "Sheol") and [tehom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehom "Tehom") are depicted.

*   c.**15th–6th century BCE**– During this period, [Zoroastrian Cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism "Zoroastrianism") Develops and defines Creation as a manifestation of a cosmic conflict between existence and non-existence, good and evil, and light and darkness.
*   **6th century BCE**– The [Babylonian Map of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_Map_of_the_World "Babylonian Map of the World") shows the Earth surrounded by the cosmic ocean, with seven islands arranged around it so as to form a seven-pointed star. Contemporary [Biblical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_cosmology "Biblical cosmology") reflects the same view of a flat, circular Earth swimming on water and overarched by the solid vault of the [firmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament "Firmament") to which are fastened the stars.
*   **6th–4th century BCE**– Greek philosophers, as early as [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-2) introduce the idea of multiple or even infinite universes.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-3)[Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus") further detailed that these worlds varied in distance, size; the presence, number and size of their suns and moons; and that they are subject to destructive collisions.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-4) Also during this time period, the Greeks established that the Earth is spherical rather than flat.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-6)
*   **6th century BCE**– [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander") conceives a mechanical, non-mythological model of the world: the Earth floats very still in the centre of the infinite, not supported by anything.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-7) Its curious shape is that of a cylinder[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-8) with a height one-third of its diameter. The flat top forms the inhabited world, which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass. Anaximander considered the Sun as a huge object (larger than the land of [Peloponnesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesus "Peloponnesus")[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-9)), and consequently, he realized how far from Earth it might be. In his system the celestial bodies turned at different distances. At the origin, after the separation of hot and cold, a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form the rest of the Universe. It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the Sun was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the [occlusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation "Occultation") of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-10) and the lunar wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining [lunar phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase "Lunar phase"). The stars and the planets, located closer,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-11) followed the same model.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-12)
*   **5th century BCE**– [Parmenides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides "Parmenides") is credited to be the first Greek who declared that the Earth is spherical and is situated in [the centre of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism "Geocentrism").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-13)
*   **5th century BCE**– [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism "Pythagoreanism") as [Philolaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philolaus "Philolaus") believed the [motion of planets is caused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_astronomical_system "Pythagorean astronomical system") by an out-of-sight "fire" at the centre of the universe (not the Sun) that powers them, and Sun and Earth orbit that _Central Fire_ at different distances. The Earth's inhabited side is always opposite to the Central Fire, rendering it invisible to people. They also claimed that the Moon and the planets orbit the Earth.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-14) This model depicts a moving Earth, simultaneously self-rotating and orbiting around an external point (but not around the Sun), thus not being geocentrical, contrary to common [intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition "Intuition"). Due to philosophical concerns about the number 10 (a "[perfect number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetractys "Tetractys")" for the Pythagorians), they also added a tenth "hidden body" or [Counter-Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Earth "Counter-Earth") (_Antichthon_), always in the opposite side of the invisible Central Fire and therefore also invisible from Earth.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-Dreyer-15)
*   **4th century BCE**– [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") claimed in his _[Timaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus\_(dialogue) "Timaeus (dialogue)")_ that [circles and spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_spheres "Celestial spheres") are the preferred shape of the universe, that [the Earth is at the center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism "Geocentrism") and is circled by, ordered in-to-outwards: Moon, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and finally the [fixed stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_stars "Fixed stars") located on the [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-16) In Plato's complex [cosmogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony "Cosmogony"),[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-17) the [demiurge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge "Demiurge") gave the primacy to the motion of Sameness and left it undivided; but he divided the motion of Difference in six parts, to have seven unequal circles. He prescribed these circles to move in opposite directions, three of them with equal speeds, the others with unequal speeds, but always in proportion. These circles are the orbits of the heavenly bodies: the three moving at equal speeds are the Sun, Venus and Mercury, while the four moving at unequal speeds are the Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-19) The complicated pattern of these movements is bound to be repeated again after a period called a 'complete' or ['perfect' year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_year "Platonic year").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-20) However, others like [Philolaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philolaus "Philolaus") and Hicetas had rejected geocentrism.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-21)
*   **4th century BCE**– [Eudoxus of Cnidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus "Eudoxus of Cnidus") devised a geometric-mathematical model for the movements of the planets, the first known effort in this sense, based on (conceptual) [concentric spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric_spheres "Concentric spheres") centered on Earth.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-22) To explain the [complexity of the movements of the planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion "Apparent retrograde motion") along with that of the Sun and the Moon, Eudoxus thought they move as if they were attached to a number of [concentrical, invisible spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric_spheres "Concentric spheres"), every of them rotating around its own and different axis and at different paces. His model had twenty-seven homocentric spheres with each sphere explaining a type of observable motion for each celestial object. Eudoxus emphasised that this is a purely mathematical construct of the model in the sense that the spheres of each celestial body do not exist, it just shows the possible positions of the bodies.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-23) His model was later refined and expanded by [Callippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callippus "Callippus").

Geocentric celestial spheres; [Peter Apian's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrus_Apianus "Petrus Apianus")_Cosmographia_ (Antwerp, 1539)

*   **4th century BCE**– [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") follows the Plato's [Earth-centered universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism "Geocentrism") in which the Earth is stationary and the [cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos "Cosmos") (or universe) is finite in extent but infinite in time. He argued for a spherical Earth using [lunar eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse "Lunar eclipse")[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-24) and other observations. Aristotle adopted and expanded even more the previous Eudoxus' and Callippus' model, but by supposing the spheres were material and crystalline.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-25) Aristotle also tried to determine whether the Earth moves and concluded that all the celestial bodies fall towards Earth by natural tendency and since Earth is the centre of that tendency, it is stationary.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-26) Plato seems to have obscurely argued that the universe did have a beginning, but Aristotle and others interpreted his words differently.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-27)
*   **4th century BCE**– _[De Mundo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Mundo "De Mundo")_ – [Five elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_elements "Classical elements"), situated in spheres in five regions, the less being in each case surrounded by the greater – namely, earth surrounded by water, water by air, air by fire, and fire by [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element) "Aether (classical element)") – make up the whole Universe.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-1908DeMundo-28)
*   **4th century BCE**– [Heraclides Ponticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclides_Ponticus "Heraclides Ponticus") is said to be the first Greek who proposes that the [Earth rotates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_of_the_Earth "Rotation of the Earth") on its axis, from west to east, once every 24 hours, contradicting Aristotle's teachings. [Simplicius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicius_of_Cilicia "Simplicius of Cilicia") says that Heraclides proposed that the irregular movements of the planets can be explained if the Earth moves while the Sun stays still,[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-29) but these statements are disputed.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-30)
*   **3rd century BCE**– [Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos") proposes a [Sun-centered universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism "Heliocentrism") and Earth's rotation in its own axis. He also [provides evidences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sizes_and_Distances_(Aristarchus) "On the Sizes and Distances (Aristarchus)") for his theory from his own observations.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-31)
*   **3rd century BCE**– [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") in his essay _[The Sand Reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sand\_Reckoner "The Sand Reckoner")_, estimates the diameter of the cosmos to be the equivalent in [stadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadion_(unit_of_length) "Stadion (unit of length)") of what would in modern times be called two [light years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_year "Light year"), if Aristarchus' theories were correct.
*   **2nd century BCE**– [Seleucus of Seleucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_of_Seleucia "Seleucus of Seleucia") elaborates on Aristarchus' heliocentric universe, using the phenomenon of [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide "Tide") to explain heliocentrism. Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning. Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of tides. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a geometric model for it.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-32)
*   **2nd century BCE**– [Apollonius of Perga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga") shows the equivalence of two descriptions of the [apparent retrograde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion "Apparent retrograde motion") planet motions (assuming the geocentric model), one using eccentrics and another [deferent and epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle "Deferent and epicycle").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-33) The latter will be a key feature for future models. The epicycle is described as a small orbit within a greater one, called the _deferent_: as a planet orbits the Earth, it also orbits the original orbit, so its trajectory resembles a curve known as an [epitrochoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitrochoid "Epitrochoid"). This could explain how the planet seems to move as viewed from Earth.
*   **2nd century BCE**– [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes "Eratosthenes") determines that the radius of the Earth is roughly 6,400 km.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-34)
*   **2nd century BCE**– [Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus") uses [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax "Parallax") to determine that the distance to the Moon is roughly 380,000 km.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-35) The work of Hipparchus about the Earth-Moon system was so accurate that he could forecast solar and lunar eclipses for the next six centuries. Also, he discovers the [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession "Precession") of the [equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox "Equinox"), and compiles a [star catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_catalog "Star catalog") of about 850 entries.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-36)
*   c.**2nd century BCE–3rd century CE**– In [Hindu cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_cosmology "Hindu cosmology"), the _[Manusmriti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusmriti "Manusmriti")_ (1.67–80) and [Puranas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puranas "Puranas") describe time as cyclical, with a new [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") (planets and life) created by [Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma "Brahma") every 8.64 billion years. The universe is created, maintained, and destroyed within a _[kalpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpa\_(aeon) "Kalpa (aeon)")_ (day of [Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma "Brahma")) period lasting for 4.32 billion years, and is followed by a _[pralaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pralaya "Pralaya")_ (night) period of partial dissolution equal in duration. In some Puranas (e.g. _[Bhagavata Purana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata\_Purana "Bhagavata Purana")_), a larger cycle of time is described where matter (_[mahat-tattva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva "Tattva")_ or [universal womb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiranyagarbha "Hiranyagarbha")) is created from primal matter (_[prakriti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prak%E1%B9%9Bti "Prakṛti")_) and root matter (_[pradhana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradhana "Pradhana")_) every 622.08 trillion years, from which [Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma "Brahma") is born.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-37) The elements of the universe are created, used by Brahma, and fully dissolved within a _maha-kalpa_ (life of [Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma "Brahma"); 100 of his 360-day years) period lasting for 311.04 trillion years containing 36,000 _kalpas_ (days) and _pralayas_ (nights), and is followed by a _maha-pralaya_ period of full dissolution equal in duration.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-39)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-41) The texts also speak of innumerable worlds or universes.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-42)
*   **2nd century CE**– [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") proposes an Earth-centered universe, with the [Sun, Moon, and visible planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_planet "Classical planet") revolving around the Earth. Based on Apollonius' epicycles,[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-43) he calculates the positions, [orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") and positional equations of the [Heavenly bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") along with instruments to measure these quantities. Ptolemy emphasised that the epicycle motion does not apply to the Sun. His main contribution to the model was the [equant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equant "Equant") points. He also re-arranged the heavenly spheres in a different order than Plato did (from Earth outward): Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and fixed stars, following a long astrological tradition and the decreasing orbital periods. His book _[The Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Almagest "The Almagest")_, which also cataloged 1,022 [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") and other [astronomical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") objects (largely based upon Hipparchus'), remained the most authoritative text on astronomy and largest astronomical catalogue until the 17th century.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-45)

*   **2nd century CE-5th century CE**– Jain cosmology considers the loka, or [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"), as an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. This Universe, according to [Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism "Jainism"), is broad at the top, narrow at the middle and once again becomes broad at the bottom.
*   **5th century**(or earlier) – Buddhist texts speak of "hundreds of thousands of billions, countlessly, innumerably, boundlessly, incomparably, incalculably, unspeakably, inconceivably, immeasurably, inexplicably many worlds" to the east, and "infinite worlds in the ten directions".[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-46)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-47)
*   **5th century**[Aryabhata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata "Aryabhata") writes a treatise on motion of planets, [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") and [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") and stars. Aryabhatta puts forward the theory of rotation of the Earth in its own axis and explained [day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day "Day") and night was caused by the diurnal rotation of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"). He models a geocentric universe with the sun, moon, and planets following circular and eccentric orbits with epicycles.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-Ansari-48)
*   **5th century** – The Jewish [talmud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud "Talmud") gives an argument for finite universe theory along with explanation.

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Naboth_Capella.JPG/250px-Naboth_Capella.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Naboth_Capella.JPG)

[Naboth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentin_Naboth "Valentin Naboth")'s representation of Martianus Capella's geo-heliocentric astronomical model (1573)

*   **5th century** – [Martianus Capella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martianus_Capella "Martianus Capella") describes a modified geocentric model, in which the Earth is at rest in the center of the universe and circled by the Moon, the Sun, three planets and the stars, while Mercury and Venus circle the Sun, all surrounded by the sphere of fixed stars.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-49)
*   **6th century**– [John Philoponus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Philoponus "John Philoponus") proposes a universe that is finite in [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") and argues against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite universe
*   **7th century**– The [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran "Quran") says in Chapter 21: Verse 30 – "Have those who disbelieved not considered that the Heavens and the Earth were a joined entity, and We separated them".
*   **9th–12th centuries**– [Al-Kindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Kindi "Al-Kindi") (Alkindus), [Saadia Gaon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon "Saadia Gaon") (Saadia ben Joseph) and [Al-Ghazali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali "Al-Ghazali") (Algazel) support a universe that has a finite past and develop two logical arguments for the notion.
*   **12th century**– [Fakhr al-Din al-Razi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhr_al-Din_al-Razi "Fakhr al-Din al-Razi") discusses [Islamic cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_cosmology "Islamic cosmology"), rejects Aristotle's idea of an Earth-centered universe, and, in the context of his commentary on the [Quranic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran "Quran") verse, "All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds," and proposes that the universe has more than "a thousand worlds beyond this world."[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-50)
*   **12th century**– [Robert Grosseteste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Grosseteste "Robert Grosseteste") described the birth of the Universe in an explosion and the crystallisation of matter. He also put forward several new ideas such as rotation of the Earth around its [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt "Axial tilt") and the cause of day and night.

*   **1576**– [Thomas Digges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Digges "Thomas Digges") modifies the [Copernican system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism "Copernican heliocentrism") by removing its outer edge and replacing the edge with a [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star")-filled unbounded space.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-59)
*   **1584**– [Giordano Bruno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno "Giordano Bruno") proposes a non-hierarchical cosmology, wherein the Copernican [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") is not the center of the universe, but rather, a relatively insignificant [star system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system "Star system"), amongst an infinite multitude of others.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-60)
*   **1588**– Tycho Brahe publishes his own [Tychonic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system "Tychonic system"), a blend between Ptolemy's classical geocentric model and Copernicus' heliocentric model, in which the Sun and the Moon revolve around the Earth, in the center of universe, and all other planets revolve around the Sun.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-61) It is a geo-heliocentric model similar to that described by Somayaji.

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_cosmological_theories&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Enlightenment to Victorian Era")]

*   **1659**– [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") makes precise measurements of the angular distance between the Sun and Venus, which were based on the first absolute measurements of the [Astronomical unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit").[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-66)
*   **1672**– [Jean Richer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Richer "Jean Richer") and [Giovanni Domenico Cassini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini "Giovanni Domenico Cassini") measure the Earth-Sun distance, the [astronomical unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit"), to be about 138,370,000 km.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-67) Later it will be refined by others up to the current value of 149,597,870 km.
*   **1675**– [Ole Rømer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_R%C3%B8mer "Ole Rømer") uses the orbital mechanics of Jupiter's [moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite") to estimate that the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") is about 227,000 km/s.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-68)

The [universal force of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation") suggested that stars could not simply be fixed or at rest, as their gravitational pulls cause "mutual attraction" and therefore cause them to move in relation to each other.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-69)
*   **1704**– [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke") enters the term "[Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System")" in the English language, when he used it to refer to the Sun, planets, and comets as a whole.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-70) By then it had been stablished beyond doubt that planets are other worlds, and stars are other distant suns, so the whole Solar System is actually only a small part of an immensely large universe, and definitively something distinct.
*   **1718**– [Edmund Halley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Halley "Edmund Halley") discovers [proper motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_motion "Proper motion") of stars, dispelling the concept of the "[fixed stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_stars "Fixed stars")".[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-71)
*   **1720**– Edmund Halley puts forth an early form of [Olbers' paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox "Olbers' paradox") (if the universe is infinite, every line of sight would end at a star, thus the night sky would be entirely bright).
*   **1729**– [James Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bradley "James Bradley") discovers the [aberration of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_of_light "Aberration of light"), which proved the Earth's motion around the Sun,[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-72) and also provides a more accurate method to compute the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") closer to its actual value of about 300,000 km/s.
*   **1744**– [Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_de_Cheseaux "Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux") puts forth an early form of Olbers' paradox.

*   **1785**– [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel "William Herschel") proposes [a heliocentric model of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#William_Herschel's_heliocentrism "Heliocentrism") that the Sun is at or near the center of the universe, which at the time was assumed to only be the [Milky Way Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way_Galaxy "Milky Way Galaxy").[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-Berendzen-74)
*   **1791**– [Erasmus Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Darwin "Erasmus Darwin") pens the first description of a cyclical expanding and contracting universe in his poem _[The Economy of Vegetation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Botanic\_Garden "The Botanic Garden")_.
*   **1796**– [Pierre Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Laplace "Pierre Laplace") re-states the nebular hypothesis for the formation of the Solar System from a spinning [nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula") of gas and dust.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-75)
*   **1826**– [Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Wilhelm_Olbers "Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers") puts forth [Olbers' paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox "Olbers' paradox").

*   **1860s**– [William Huggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Huggins "William Huggins") develops astronomical [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy "Spectroscopy"); he shows that the [Orion Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula "Orion Nebula") is mostly made of gas, while the Andromeda nebula (later called [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy "Andromeda Galaxy")) is probably dominated by stars.
*   **1862**– By analysing the [spectroscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopic "Spectroscopic") signature of the Sun and comparing it to those of other stars, Father [Angelo Secchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Secchi "Angelo Secchi") determines that the Sun in itself is also a star.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-80)

Thomson") identifies the [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") as the constituent particles of the [cathode rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_rays "Cathode rays"), leading to the modern [atomic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_model "Atomic model") of matter.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-82)
*   **1897**– [William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin "William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin"), based on the thermal radiation rate and the [gravitational contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz_mechanism "Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism") forces, argues the age of the Sun to be no more than 20 million years – unless some energy source beyond what was then known was found.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-83)

*   **2020**– Scientists publish a study which suggests that the Universe is no longer [expanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_Universe "Expansion of the Universe") at the same rate in all directions and that therefore the widely accepted [isotropy hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropy#Cosmology "Isotropy") might be wrong. While previous studies already suggested this, the study is the first to examine [galaxy clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_cluster "Galaxy cluster") in X-rays and, according to Norbert Schartel, has a much greater significance. The study found a consistent and strong directional behavior of [deviations – which have earlier been described to indicate a "crisis of cosmology" by others – of the normalization parameter A, or the Hubble constant H0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law#Measured_values_of_the_Hubble_constant "Hubble's law"). Beyond the potential [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological "Cosmological") implications, it shows that studies which assume perfect isotropy in the properties of galaxy clusters and their scaling relations can produce strongly biased results.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-119)[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-120)[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-121)[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-122)[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cosmological_theories#cite_note-123)

Similarly, he made a mixture of the _Same,_ and then one of the _Different,_ in between their indivisible and their corporeal, divisible counterparts. And he took the three mixtures and mixed them together to make a uniform mixture, forcing the Different, which was hard to mix, into conformity with the Same. Now when he had mixed these two with Being, and from the three had made a single mixture, he redivided the whole mixture into as many parts as his task required, each part remaining a mixture of the Same, the Different and Being."

February 10, 2021. Mahattattva (महत्तत्त्व) or simply Mahat refers to a primordial principle of the nature of both pradhāna and puruṣa, according to the 10th century Saurapurāṇa: one of the various Upapurāṇas depicting Śaivism.—[...] From the disturbed prakṛti and the puruṣa sprang up the seed of mahat, which is of the nature of both pradhāna and puruṣa. The mahattattva is then covered by the pradhāna and being so covered it differentiates itself as the sāttvika, rājasa and tāmasa-mahat. The pradhāna covers the mahat just as a seed is covered by the skin. Being so covered there spring from the three fold mahat the threefold ahaṃkāra called vaikārika, taijasa and bhūtādi or tāmasa.
