As indicated by his nisba , he was from Shiraz, Iran . He is best known for his large synopsis of "Yunani" or Unani medicine (Greco-Roman medicine as inherited by Islam) and Hindu medicine ( Ayurveda ) that was entitled Zakhira-i Dara-Shukuhi and dedicated to the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan 's son Dara Shikuh , who ruled as emperor from 1657-9CE.

He also composed in 1628 CE a Persian pharmacological dictionary titled Alfaz al-adwiyah which he had dedicated to Shah Jahan himself, of which the National Library of Medicine has a copy.
