They are studied using a range of channelomics experimental and mathematical techniques. Insights have suggested endocannabinoids (eCBs) as molecules that can regulate the opening of these channels during diverse conditions.

[ 1 ] Properties [ edit ] Hemichannels [ edit ] A hemichannel is a membrane channel made up of six subunits.

[ 2 ] A hemichannel is defined as one-half of a gap junction channel.

[ 3 ] Hemichannels consist of connexins .

[ 2 ] Pannexin [ edit ] Pannexins are involved in the process of purinergic signalling .  They release adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which activate purinergic receptors .  On the other hand, purinergic receptor activation can also lead to the opening of the channel, via a positive feedback loop.

[ 4 ] In addition, P2Y receptors activate inositol trisphosphate , which leads to a transient increase in intracellular calcium , and opens both connexin and pannexin channels, therefore contributing to the propagation of calcium waves across astrocytes and epithelial cells.
