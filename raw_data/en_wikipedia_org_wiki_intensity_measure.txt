The intensity measure is a non-random measure and is defined as the expectation value of the random measure of a set, hence it corresponds to the average volume the random measure assigns to a set. The intensity measure contains important information about the properties of the random measure. A Poisson point process , interpreted as a random measure, is for example uniquely determined by its intensity measure.

[ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] Let Œ∂ Œ∂ {\displaystyle \zeta } be a random measure on the measurable space ( S , A ) {\displaystyle (S,{\mathcal {A}})} and denote the expected value of a random element Y {\displaystyle Y} with E ‚Å° ‚Å° [ Y ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [Y]} .

The intensity measure E ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∂ Œ∂ : : A ‚Üí ‚Üí [ 0 , ‚àû ‚àû ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \zeta \colon {\mathcal {A}}\to [0,\infty ]} of Œ∂ Œ∂ {\displaystyle \zeta } is defined as E ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∂ Œ∂ ( A ) = E ‚Å° ‚Å° [ Œ∂ Œ∂ ( A ) ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \zeta (A)=\operatorname {E} [\zeta (A)]} for all A ‚àà ‚àà A {\displaystyle A\in {\mathcal {A}}} .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Note the difference in notation between the expectation value of a random element Y {\displaystyle Y} , denoted by E ‚Å° ‚Å° [ Y ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [Y]} and the intensity measure of the random measure Œ∂ Œ∂ {\displaystyle \zeta } , denoted by E ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∂ Œ∂ {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \zeta } .

Properties [ edit ] The intensity measure E ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∂ Œ∂ {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \zeta } is always s-finite and satisfies E ‚Å° ‚Å° [ ‚à´ ‚à´ f ( x ) Œ∂ Œ∂ ( d x ) ] = ‚à´ ‚à´ f ( x ) E ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∂ Œ∂ ( d x ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \left[\int f(x)\;\zeta (\mathrm {d} x)\right]=\int f(x)\operatorname {E} \zeta (dx)} for every positive measurable function f {\displaystyle f} on ( S , A ) {\displaystyle (S,{\mathcal {A}})} .
