The editor-in-chief is Jacek Dobaczewski, University of York , England.

Scope [ edit ] The journal publishes research articles on: theoretical and experimental topics in the physics of elementary particles and fields; intermediate-energy physics and nuclear physics; experimental and theoretical research in particle, neutrino, and nuclear astrophysics; research arising from all interface areas among these fields.

Research is published in the following formats: Research Papers: Reports of original and high-quality research work; Research Notes: Contributions from individuals (or small groups) within large collaborations, containing early results of analyses, detector development, simulations, etc. which might not otherwise be published in the wider literature; Topical Reviews: Specially commissioned review articles on areas of current interest; LabTalk: Article summaries written by the researchers themselves which introduce the findings, techniques, and possible applications of their research.
