N verify ( what is Y N ?) Infobox references Chemical compound Methylamine , also known as methanamine , is an organic compound with a formula of CH 3 NH 2 . This colorless gas is a derivative of ammonia , but with one hydrogen atom being replaced by a methyl group . It is the simplest primary amine .

Methylamine is sold as a solution in methanol , ethanol , tetrahydrofuran , or water , or as the anhydrous gas in pressurized metal containers. Industrially, methylamine is transported in its anhydrous form in pressurized railcars and tank trailers. It has a strong odor similar to rotten fish. Methylamine is used as a building block for the synthesis of numerous other commercially available compounds.

Industrial production [ edit ] Methylamine has been produced industrially since the 1920s (originally by Commercial Solvents Corporation for dehairing of animal skins).

[ 4 ] This was made possible by Kazimierz Smoleński [ pl ] and his wife Eugenia who discovered amination of alcohols, including methanol, on alumina or kaolin catalyst after WWI, filed two patent applications in 1919 [ 5 ] and published an article in 1921.

[ 4 ] [ 6 ] It is now prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with methanol in the presence of an aluminosilicate catalyst .

Dimethylamine and trimethylamine are co-produced; the reaction kinetics and reactant ratios determine the ratio of the three products. The product most favored by the reaction kinetics is trimethylamine.

[ 4 ] CH 3 OH + NH 3 → CH 3 NH 2 + H 2 O In this way, an estimated 115,000 tons were produced in 2005.

[ 7 ] Laboratory methods [ edit ] Methylamine was first prepared in 1849 by Charles-Adolphe Wurtz via the hydrolysis of methyl isocyanate and related compounds.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] An example of this process includes the use of the Hofmann rearrangement , to yield methylamine from acetamide and bromine .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] In the laboratory, methylamine hydrochloride is readily prepared by various other methods. One method entails treating formaldehyde with ammonium chloride .

[ 11 ] [NH 4 ]Cl + CH 2 O → [CH 2 =NH 2 ]Cl + H 2 O [CH 2 =NH 2 ]Cl + CH 2 O + H 2 O → [CH 3 NH 3 ]Cl + HCOOH The colorless hydrochloride salt can be converted to an amine by the addition of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH): [CH 3 NH 3 ]Cl + NaOH → CH 3 NH 2 + NaCl + H 2 O Another method entails reducing nitromethane with zinc and hydrochloric acid.

[ 12 ] Another method of methylamine production is spontaneous decarboxylation of glycine with a strong base in water.

[ 13 ] Reactivity and applications [ edit ] Methylamine is a good nucleophile as it is an unhindered amine .

[ 14 ] As an amine it is considered a weak base . Its use in organic chemistry is pervasive. Some reactions involving simple reagents include: with phosgene to methyl isocyanate , with carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide to the sodium methyldithiocarbamate, with chloroform and base to methyl isocyanide and with ethylene oxide to methylethanolamines . Liquid methylamine has solvent properties analogous to those of liquid ammonia .

[ 15 ] Representative commercially significant chemicals produced from methylamine include the pharmaceuticals ephedrine and theophylline , the pesticides carbofuran , carbaryl , and metham sodium , and the solvents N -methylformamide and N -methylpyrrolidone . The preparation of some surfactants and photographic developers require methylamine as a building block.

[ 7 ] Biological chemistry [ edit ] Methylamine arises as a result of putrefaction and is a substrate for methanogenesis .

[ 16 ] Additionally, methylamine is produced during PADI4 -dependent arginine demethylation .

[ 17 ] Safety [ edit ] The LD 50 (mouse, s.c.

) is 2.5 g/kg.

[ 18 ] The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have set occupational exposure limits at 10 ppm or 12 mg/m 3 over an eight-hour time-weighted average.

[ 19 ] Regulation [ edit ] In the United States, methylamine is controlled as a List 1 precursor chemical by the Drug Enforcement Administration [ 20 ] due to its use in the illicit production of methamphetamine .

[ 21 ] In popular culture [ edit ] Fictional characters Walter White and Jesse Pinkman use aqueous methylamine as part of a process to synthesize methamphetamine in the AMC series Breaking Bad .
