[ 68 ] At the march yelling racial slurs was Jeremy Christian who was later arrested for the 2017 Portland train attack where two men were fatally stabbed.

[ 72 ] The rally caused controversy as it was scheduled one week after the stabbings by Jeremy Christian.

The General Services Administration denied the request, stating that the permit had been lawfully obtained weeks beforehand.

[ 74 ] The Oregon chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union 's legal director, Mat Dos Santos, said it was unconstitutional of Wheeler to attempt to prevent the demonstration based on the political and personal viewpoints of those who organized the event.

[ 75 ] Gibson canceled the event citing safety concerns.

[ 100 ] After it attracted over 1,000 counter-protesters, Patriot Prayer canceled their event and opted to hold a press conference at Alamo Square Park . In rapid response, the city of San Francisco built fences around the park and closed it to the public to prevent violence, which prompted Gibson to also cancel that event.

[ 101 ] [ 26 ] Gibson stated that Patriot Prayer members would attend a "No to Marxism" [ 26 ] rally near the University of California, Berkeley ; that event was also called off by its organizer.

[ 35 ] [ 102 ] The news of a planned Patriot Prayer press conference in San Francisco's Alamo Square Park drew counter-protesters to the area. The group, which had already canceled a planned rally at Crissy Field due to alleged safety concerns, held the press conference in Pacifica instead.
