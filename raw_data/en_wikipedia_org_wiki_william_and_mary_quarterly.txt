The journal originated in 1892, making it one of the oldest academic journals in the United States.

[ 1 ] It covers Old World–New World contacts to about 1820. Geographically, it focuses on North America—from New France and the Spanish American borderlands to British America and the Caribbean —and extends to Europe and West Africa.

The journal is named after the College of William and Mary where it was established in 1892. It has been published in three successive series, with volume numbers repeating with each new series. The journal's first series of 27 volumes ran from 1892 to 1919. The second series began in 1921 and ended in 1943, while the third series began in 1944 and runs through the present day.

The journal is available online through the JSTOR service.
