[ 6 ] [ 7 ] He is best known for his work on the segregation of chromosomes during cell division.

Early life and education [ edit ] Nasmyth was born in London in 1952 of James Ashley (Jan) Nasmyth and Jenny Hughes.

[ 4 ] [ 8 ] His father Jan was doubly descended from King Charles II and founder of the billion dollar publishing company Argus Media .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] He attended Eton College , Berkshire, then the University of York , where he studied Biology.

[ 4 ] Nasmyth went on to complete his graduate studies in the group of Murdoch Mitchison at the University of Edinburgh . Here he worked on the cell cycle alongside Paul Nurse [ 3 ] and his PhD thesis focused on the control of DNA replication in fission yeast .

[ 2 ] In Mitchison's lab he made substantial contributions to the study of the cell cycle in fission yeast isolating and characterising cell cycle mutants and the first identification of a gene product ( DNA ligase ) in these mutants.

[ 10 ] Career and research [ edit ] Kim Nasmyth explaining loop extrusion with a climbing rope The cohesin complex entrapping sister DNAs Nasmyth joined Ben Hall's lab in Seattle as a postdoctoral researcher where he developed ways of cloning genes by complementation in yeast and, in collaboration with Steve Reed, cloned the CDC28 gene from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae .

[ 3 ] As a group leader in Cambridge Nasmyth became interested in the phenomenon of mating-type switching in yeast. Together with Kelly Tatchell he cloned the S. cerevisiae mating-type locus and found, surprisingly, that 'silent' copies of the mating-type genes including their promoters are maintained in the yeast chromosome. This represented the first case where the position of a gene in the chromosome had demonstrable biological significance, and prompted Nasmyth to abandon work on the cell cycle for a time and concentrate instead on studying gene silencing.

[ 3 ] He was one of the first to demonstrate that gene expression can be regulated through specific control elements which are distant from the start of transcription.

[ 10 ] Max Birnstiel invited Nasmyth to join him at the then newly founded Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna , Austria , where he was director. Nasmyth became one of the first three senior group leaders that Birnstiel recruited in 1986.

[ 11 ] At the IMP, Nasmyth changed his focus from gene silencing back to cell cycle control. In the mid-1990s Nasmyth co-discovered the APC/C and showed that its activity induces chromosome segregation.

[ 12 ] Using temperature-sensitive mutants of the APC/C he found several genes which are required for sister chromatid cohesion [ 13 ] which we now know encode subunits of the cohesin complex . Nasmyth has since shown that cohesin forms a ring, [ 14 ] that sister chromatids are held together within this ring [ 15 ] and that they are released by cleavage of cohesin by separase .

[ 16 ] Following Max Birnstiel's retirement, Nasmyth became scientific director of the IMP in 1997.

[ 17 ] In 2006, Nasmyth left the IMP to become head of the Department of Biochemistry of the University of Oxford , a post he held until 2011. Nasmyth continues to head a research group at this department. He is a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] His research has been funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) , the Wellcome Trust , and Cancer Research UK .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] He plans to retire from research in 2022.

[ 23 ] Awards and honours [ edit ] Nasmyth has also been awarded the following: 1985 Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization 1989 Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society [ 25 ] 1995 FEBS Silver Medal [ 26 ] 1996 Unilever Science prize [ 26 ] 1997 Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine [ 27 ] 1999 Wittgenstein-Preis [ 28 ] 1999 Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences [ 26 ] 2002 Croonian lecture/Medal of the Royal Society [ 26 ] 2003 Boveri award for Molecular Cancer Genetics [ 26 ] 2007 Gairdner Foundation International Award [ 26 ] 2009 Elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) [ 29 ] 2018 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences [ 30 ] Personal life [ edit ] Nasmyth married Anna Dowson, daughter of Sir Philip Dowson , in 1982 [ 31 ] and has two daughters.

[ 4 ] His younger brother is furniture designer, Luke Hughes .

[ 32 ] He enjoys skiing and climbing, [ 6 ] a hobby to which he attributes his theory of how cohesin works.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] He also co-owns a vineyard in the south of France.

[ 35 ] Nasmyth held a large number of shares in his fathers billion dollar company Argus Media until its purchase by General Atlantic in 2016.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] In 2014 he was appointed director of Badger Lane Management company.

[ 5 ] During his time in Vienna, Nasmyth became Austrian citizen .
