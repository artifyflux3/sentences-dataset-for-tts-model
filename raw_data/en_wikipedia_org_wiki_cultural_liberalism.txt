In the words of Henry David Thoreau , it is often expressed as the right to "march to the beat of a different drummer".

[ 1 ] Also known as social liberalism in the United States and Canada, while cultural progressivism does overlap with cultural liberalism, it does not mean exactly the same thing as cultural liberalism .

[ 2 ] The United States refers to cultural liberalism as social liberalism; however, it is not the same as the broader political ideology known as social liberalism . In the United States, social liberalism describes progressive moral and social values or stances on socio-cultural issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage as opposed to social conservatism . A social conservative or a social liberal in this sense may hold either more conservative or progressive views on fiscal policy .

[ 3 ] Modern usage [ edit ] As with modern liberalism in general, [ 4 ] cultural liberalism often implies the fundamental liberal principles of individual liberty, autonomy, and equality.

[ citation needed ] Cultural liberalism places a strong emphasis on the protection and expansion of civil rights and liberties, recognizing them as fundamental to individual autonomy and societal progress.

[ 5 ] [ better source needed ] This philosophical stance aligns with core liberal principles articulated in foundational texts [ which?

] and international declarations such as the manifesto of the Liberal International .

[ 4 ] John Stuart Mill , in his seminal work On Liberty , argues for the paramount importance of individual liberty, asserting that society should only interfere with an individual's freedom of action to prevent harm to others .

[ 6 ] History [ edit ] The emergence of cultural liberalism is tied to the broader historical development of liberalism, which challenges traditional norms of religious conformity and ascribed status.

[ 7 ] [ better source needed ] While the term "liberal" gained political currency in the early 19th century, the underlying principles of individual liberty and tolerance have roots in the Enlightenment and movements like the Protestant Reformation , which emphasized individual conscience.

[ 7 ] In 1981, Gérard Grunberg [ fr ] , Etienne Schweisguth, et al. popularized the term "cultural liberalism" [ 8 ] in their book France de gauche, vote à droite .

[ 9 ] In recent decades, particularly since the mid-20th century, Western Europe has seen what Vincent Tournier describes as a "cultural take-off" [ 10 ] characterized by the liberalization of moral standards and lifestyles. Tournier claims that the rise cultural liberalism can be attributed to post-war changes such as increased living standards, urbanization, mass schooling, and secularization, leading to a distancing from traditional authority and a greater emphasis on individual autonomy.
