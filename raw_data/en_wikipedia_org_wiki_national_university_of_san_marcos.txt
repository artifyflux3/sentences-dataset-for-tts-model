[ 145 ] [ 146 ] The word has been in common use by the Peruvian population to refer to the close and prominent figures of this house of studies, and even to the pets and animals adopted by the university community.

[ 147 ] [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Athletics [ edit ] On August 7, 1924, San Marcos students founded the University Sports Federation of Peru. Since 1936, this federation has organized the National University Sports Games, the Regional University Sports Games and the National University Championships. Since 1963, it has participated in the Universiade .

[ 150 ] The basketball team had participated in the Lima Basketball League .

[ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ] The University of San Marcos has had various professional football teams, including the University Football Federation ( Club Universitario de Deportes ) that was founded in 1924 by students until it was separated from the university and became private due to problems with the authorities in 1932; and the Deportivo Universidad San Marcos that came to dispute the second division until 2012.

[ 154 ] The first university Games were held in 1936 in the city of Lima. Since then, four years between each Games was marked, though, recently, they have been taking place every 2 years. In 1951, the Stadium of the University of San Marcos was inaugurated in the center of the main campus.

Among them, the National University of San Marcos had its stadium remodeled to host the event .

[ 156 ] [ 157 ] The Stadium of the National University of San Marcos was the sole venue of the 2019 South American U-17 Championship that took place in Peru.

[ 158 ] Origin of the Club Universitario de Deportes [ edit ] Main article: Club Universitario de Deportes José Rubio Galindo, a student at the Faculty of Letters, and Luis Málaga Arenas, a student at the Faculty of Medicine, would join Plácido Galindo , Eduardo Astengo , Rafael Quirós, Mario de las Casas , Alberto Denegri , Luis de Souza Ferreira (who scored the first Peruvian goal in a FIFA World Cup ), [ 159 ] Andrés Rotta, Carlos Galindo, Francisco Sabroso, Jorge Góngora , Pablo Pacheco , Carlos Lassus and Carlos Cillóniz , among others. On August 7, 1924, at 7:00 p.m. (UTC-5), university students met at the headquarters of the Federation of Students of Peru, at 106 Juan de la Coba street.

[ 160 ] [ 161 ] [ 162 ] The National Sports Committee, the highest body of Peruvian sports at that time, recognized the Federación Universitaria as if it were a League. Hence, together with the Peruvian Football League, the Amateur Association, the Callao League, Circolo Sportivo Italiano and Lima Cricket and Football Club , they formed the Football Federation.

[ 163 ] After participating in inter-university tournaments between 1924 and 1927, [ 161 ] the Peruvian Football Federation invited the Federación Universitaria to participate in the Selection and Competition Championship (First Division Tournament) of 1928.

[ 161 ] Federación Universitaria team In the 1929 championship, the Federación Universitaria team of the University of San Marcos (today Club Universitario de Deportes ) only had the participation of twelve teams due to the suspension of Alianza Lima for refusing to cede its players to the national team.

[ 164 ] The Federación Universitaria team still won the championship.

[ 165 ] In 1930, the first FIFA World Cup was held in Montevideo , Uruguay. After the World Cup, the club traveled to the provinces by steamboat to face the Association White Star, which it defeated 1:0, [ 166 ] then he toured Huacho and participated in the Gubbins Cup.

[ 163 ] The following year, the rector José Antonio Encinas prohibited the use of the name—Federación Universitaria de Fútbol—and this led to the change by Club Universitario de Deportes .

[ 161 ] Club Deportivo San Marcos [ edit ] Main article: Deportivo Universidad San Marcos In 2001, the University of San Marcos created the Club Deportivo Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, where it played until 2011. Club San Marcos played at the San Marcos stadium. The team was baptized with the name "The Lions" because the animal is the symbol of Mark the Evangelist .

[ 154 ] Later, the university created Deportivo San Marcos. The club has participated since 2013 in the first division of Cercado de Lima .
