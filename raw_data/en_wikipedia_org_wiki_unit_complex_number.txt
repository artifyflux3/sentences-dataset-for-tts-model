{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} =\{z\in \mathbb {C} :|z|=1\}.} The circle group forms a subgroup of ⁠ C × × {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{\times }} ⁠ , the multiplicative group of all nonzero complex numbers. Since C × × {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{\times }} is abelian , it follows that T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } is as well.

A unit complex number in the circle group represents a rotation of the complex plane about the origin and can be parametrized by the angle measure ⁠ θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } ⁠ : θ θ ↦ ↦ z = e i θ θ = cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ + i sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ .

{\displaystyle \theta \mapsto z=e^{i\theta }=\cos \theta +i\sin \theta .} This is the exponential map for the circle group.

The circle group plays a central role in Pontryagin duality and in the theory of Lie groups .

The notation T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } for the circle group stems from the fact that, with the standard topology (see below), the circle group is a 1- torus . More generally, T n {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{n}} (the direct product of T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } with itself n {\displaystyle n} times) is geometrically an n {\displaystyle n} -torus.

The circle group is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group ⁠ S O ( 2 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (2)} ⁠ .

Elementary introduction [ edit ] One way to think about the circle group is that it describes how to add angles , where only angles between 0° and 360° or ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 2 π π ) {\displaystyle \in [0,2\pi )} or ∈ ∈ ( − − π π , + π π ] {\displaystyle \in (-\pi ,+\pi ]} are permitted. For example, the diagram illustrates how to add 150° to 270°. The answer is 150° + 270° = 420° , but when thinking in terms of the circle group, we may "forget" the fact that we have wrapped once around the circle. Therefore, we adjust our answer by 360°, which gives 420° ≡ 60° ( mod 360° ).

Another description is in terms of ordinary (real) addition, where only numbers between 0 and 1 are allowed (with 1 corresponding to a full rotation: 360° or ⁠ 2 π π {\displaystyle 2\pi } ⁠ ), i.e. the real numbers modulo the integers: ⁠ T ≅ ≅ R / Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} \cong \mathbb {R} /\mathbb {Z} } ⁠ . This can be achieved by throwing away the digits occurring before the decimal point. For example, when we work out 0.4166... + 0.75 , the answer is 1.1666..., but we may throw away the leading 1, so the answer (in the circle group) is just ⁠ 0.1 6 ¯ ¯ ≡ ≡ 1.1 6 ¯ ¯ ≡ ≡ − − 0.8 3 ¯ ¯ ( mod Z ) {\displaystyle 0.1{\bar {6}}\equiv 1.1{\bar {6}}\equiv -0.8{\bar {3}}\;({\text{mod}}\,\mathbb {Z} )} ⁠ , with some preference to 0.166..., because ⁠ 0.1 6 ¯ ¯ ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle 0.1{\bar {6}}\in [0,1)} ⁠ .

Topological and analytic structure [ edit ] The circle group is more than just an abstract algebraic object. It has a natural topology when regarded as a subspace of the complex plane. Since multiplication and inversion are continuous functions on ⁠ C × × {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{\times }} ⁠ , the circle group has the structure of a topological group . Moreover, since the unit circle is a closed subset of the complex plane, the circle group is a closed subgroup of C × × {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{\times }} (itself regarded as a topological group).

One can say even more. The circle is a 1-dimensional real manifold , and multiplication and inversion are real-analytic maps on the circle. This gives the circle group the structure of a one-parameter group , an instance of a Lie group . In fact, up to isomorphism, it is the unique 1-dimensional compact , connected Lie group. Moreover, every n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional compact, connected, abelian Lie group is isomorphic to ⁠ T n {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{n}} ⁠ .

Isomorphisms [ edit ] The circle group shows up in a variety of forms in mathematics. We list some of the more common forms here. Specifically, we show that T ≅ ≅ U ( 1 ) ≅ ≅ R / Z ≅ ≅ S O ( 2 ) , {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} \cong {\mbox{U}}(1)\cong \mathbb {R} /\mathbb {Z} \cong \mathrm {SO} (2),} where the slash ( ⁠ / {\displaystyle ~\!/~\!} ⁠ ) denotes group quotient and ≅ ≅ {\displaystyle \cong } the existence of an isomorphism between the groups.

The set of all ⁠ 1 × × 1 {\displaystyle 1\times 1} ⁠ unitary matrices coincides with the circle group; the unitary condition is equivalent to the condition that its element have absolute value 1. Therefore, the circle group is canonically isomorphic to the first unitary group ⁠ U ( 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {U} (1)} ⁠ , i.e., T ≅ ≅ U ( 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} \cong {\mbox{U}}(1).} The exponential function gives rise to a map exp : R → → T {\displaystyle \exp :\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {T} } from the additive real numbers ⁠ R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } ⁠ to the circle group ⁠ T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } ⁠ known as Euler's formula θ θ ↦ ↦ e i θ θ = cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ + i sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ , {\displaystyle \theta \mapsto e^{i\theta }=\cos \theta +i\sin \theta ,} where θ θ ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle \theta \in \mathbb {R} } corresponds to the angle (in radians ) on the unit circle as measured counterclockwise from the positive x -axis. The property e i θ θ 1 e i θ θ 2 = e i ( θ θ 1 + θ θ 2 ) , ∀ ∀ θ θ 1 , θ θ 2 ∈ ∈ R , {\displaystyle e^{i\theta _{1}}e^{i\theta _{2}}=e^{i(\theta _{1}+\theta _{2})},\quad \forall \theta _{1},\theta _{2}\in \mathbb {R} ,} makes exp : R → → T {\displaystyle \exp :\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {T} } a group homomorphism . While the map is surjective , it is not injective and therefore not an isomorphism. The kernel of this map is the set of all integer multiples of ⁠ 2 π π {\displaystyle 2\pi } ⁠ . By the first isomorphism theorem we then have that T ≅ ≅ R / 2 π π Z .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} \cong \mathbb {R} ~\!/~\!2\pi \mathbb {Z} .} After rescaling we can also say that T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } is isomorphic to ⁠ R / Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} /\mathbb {Z} } ⁠ .

The unit complex numbers can be realized as 2×2 real orthogonal matrices , i.e., e i θ θ = cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ + i sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ↔ ↔ [ cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ − − sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ] = f ( e i θ θ ) , {\displaystyle e^{i\theta }=\cos \theta +i\sin \theta \leftrightarrow {\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\\sin \theta &\cos \theta \\\end{bmatrix}}=f{\bigl (}e^{i\theta }{\bigr )},} associating the squared modulus and complex conjugate with the determinant and transpose , respectively, of the corresponding matrix. As the angle sum trigonometric identities imply that f ( e i θ θ 1 e i θ θ 2 ) = [ cos ⁡ ⁡ ( θ θ 1 + θ θ 2 ) − − sin ⁡ ⁡ ( θ θ 1 + θ θ 2 ) sin ⁡ ⁡ ( θ θ 1 + θ θ 2 ) cos ⁡ ⁡ ( θ θ 1 + θ θ 2 ) ] = f ( e i θ θ 1 ) × × f ( e i θ θ 2 ) , {\displaystyle f{\bigl (}e^{i\theta _{1}}e^{i\theta _{2}}{\bigr )}={\begin{bmatrix}\cos(\theta _{1}+\theta _{2})&-\sin(\theta _{1}+\theta _{2})\\\sin(\theta _{1}+\theta _{2})&\cos(\theta _{1}+\theta _{2})\end{bmatrix}}=f{\bigl (}e^{i\theta _{1}}{\bigr )}\times f{\bigl (}e^{i\theta _{2}}{\bigr )},} where × × {\displaystyle \times } is matrix multiplication, the circle group is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group S O ( 2 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (2)} , i.e., T ≅ ≅ S O ( 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} \cong \mathrm {SO} (2).} This isomorphism has the geometric interpretation that multiplication by a unit complex number is a proper rotation in the complex (and real) plane, and every such rotation is of this form.

Properties [ edit ] Every compact Lie group G {\displaystyle \mathrm {G} } of dimension > 0 has a subgroup isomorphic to the circle group. This means that, thinking in terms of symmetry , a compact symmetry group acting continuously can be expected to have one-parameter circle subgroups acting; the consequences in physical systems are seen, for example, at rotational invariance and spontaneous symmetry breaking .

The circle group has many subgroups , but its only proper closed subgroups consist of roots of unity : For each integer ⁠ n > 0 {\displaystyle n>0} ⁠ , the n {\displaystyle n} th roots of unity form a cyclic group of order ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ , which is unique up to isomorphism.

In the same way that the real numbers are a completion of the b -adic rationals Z [ 1 b ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} {\bigl [}{\tfrac {1}{b}}{\bigr ]}} for every natural number ⁠ b > 1 {\displaystyle b>1} ⁠ , the circle group is the completion of the Prüfer group Z [ 1 b ] / Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} {\bigl [}{\tfrac {1}{b}}{\bigr ]}~\!/~\!\mathbb {Z} } for ⁠ b {\displaystyle b} ⁠ , given by the direct limit ⁠ lim → → ⁡ ⁡ Z / b n Z {\displaystyle \varinjlim \mathbb {Z} ~\!/~\!b^{n}\mathbb {Z} } ⁠ .

Representations [ edit ] The representations of the circle group are easy to describe. It follows from Schur's lemma that the irreducible complex representations of an abelian group are all 1-dimensional. Since the circle group is compact, any representation ρ ρ : T → → G L ( 1 , C ) ≅ ≅ C × × {\displaystyle \rho :\mathbb {T} \to \mathrm {GL} (1,\mathbb {C} )\cong \mathbb {C} ^{\times }} must take values in ⁠ U ( 1 ) ≅ ≅ T {\displaystyle {\mbox{U}}(1)\cong \mathbb {T} } ⁠ . Therefore, the irreducible representations of the circle group are just the homomorphisms from the circle group to itself.

For each integer n {\displaystyle n} we can define a representation ϕ ϕ n {\displaystyle \phi _{n}} of the circle group by ⁠ ϕ ϕ n ( z ) = z n {\displaystyle \phi _{n}(z)=z^{n}} ⁠ .  These representations are all inequivalent. The representation ϕ ϕ − − n {\displaystyle \phi _{-n}} is conjugate to ⁠ ϕ ϕ n {\displaystyle \phi _{n}} ⁠ : ϕ ϕ − − n = ϕ ϕ n ¯ ¯ .

{\displaystyle \phi _{-n}={\overline {\phi _{n}}}.} These representations are just the characters of the circle group. The character group of T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } is clearly an infinite cyclic group generated by ⁠ ϕ ϕ 1 {\displaystyle \phi _{1}} ⁠ : Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( T , T ) ≅ ≅ Z .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (\mathbb {T} ,\mathbb {T} )\cong \mathbb {Z} .} The irreducible real representations of the circle group are the trivial representation (which is 1-dimensional) and the representations ρ ρ n ( e i θ θ ) = [ cos ⁡ ⁡ n θ θ − − sin ⁡ ⁡ n θ θ sin ⁡ ⁡ n θ θ cos ⁡ ⁡ n θ θ ] , n ∈ ∈ Z + , {\displaystyle \rho _{n}{\bigl (}e^{i\theta }{\bigr )}={\begin{bmatrix}\cos n\theta &-\sin n\theta \\\sin n\theta &\cos n\theta \end{bmatrix}},\quad n\in \mathbb {Z} ^{+},} taking values in ⁠ S O ( 2 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (2)} ⁠ . Here we only have positive integers ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ , since the representation ρ ρ − − n {\displaystyle \rho _{-n}} is equivalent to ⁠ ρ ρ n {\displaystyle \rho _{n}} ⁠ .

Group structure [ edit ] The circle group T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } is a divisible group . Its torsion subgroup is given by the set of all n {\displaystyle n} -th roots of unity for all n {\displaystyle n} and is isomorphic to ⁠ Q / Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} /\mathbb {Z} } ⁠ . The structure theorem for divisible groups and the axiom of choice together tell us that T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } is isomorphic to the direct sum of Q / Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} /\mathbb {Z} } with a number of copies of ⁠ Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } ⁠ .

[ 2 ] The number of copies of ⁠ Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } ⁠ must be c {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {c}}} (the cardinality of the continuum ) in order for the cardinality of the direct sum to be correct. But the direct sum of c {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {c}}} copies of ⁠ Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } ⁠ is isomorphic to ⁠ R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } ⁠ , as R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is a vector space of dimension c {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {c}}} over ⁠ Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } ⁠ . Thus, T ≅ ≅ R ⊕ ⊕ ( Q / Z ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} \cong \mathbb {R} \oplus (\mathbb {Q} /\mathbb {Z} ).} The isomorphism C × × ≅ ≅ R ⊕ ⊕ ( Q / Z ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{\times }\cong \mathbb {R} \oplus (\mathbb {Q} /\mathbb {Z} )} can be proved in the same way, since ⁠ C × × {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{\times }} ⁠ is also a divisible abelian group whose torsion subgroup is the same as the torsion subgroup of ⁠ T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } ⁠ .
