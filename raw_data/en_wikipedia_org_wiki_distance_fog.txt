[ 1 ] Because many of the shapes in graphical environments are relatively simple, and complex shadows are difficult to render , many graphics engines employ a " fog " gradient so objects further from the camera are progressively more obscured by haze and by aerial perspective .

[ 2 ] This technique simulates the effect of light scattering , which causes more distant objects to appear lower in contrast , especially in outdoor environments.

Example of distance fog on the Utah teapot Visibility in a natural haze declines exponentially , not linearly , with distance due to scattering . The colour of the light being scattered into the viewing path affects the colour of the haze ; blue under blue skies, reddish near sunset, as with alpenglow . These more subtle details are represented in some graphics.

"Fogging" is another use of distance fog in mid-to-late 1990s games, when processing power was not enough to render far viewing distances , and clipping was employed. Clipping could be very distracting since bits and pieces of polygons would flicker in and out of view instantly, and by applying a medium-ranged distance fog, the clipped polygons would appear at a sufficiently far distance that they were obscured by the fog, fading in as the player approached.
