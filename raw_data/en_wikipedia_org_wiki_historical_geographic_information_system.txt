It is a tool for historical geography .

Techniques [ edit ] Historical geographic information systems are built from a variety of sources and techniques. An especially prominent method is the digitization and georeferencing of historical maps. Old maps may contain valuable information about the past. By adding coordinates to such maps, they may be added as a feature layer to modern GIS data. This facilitates comparison of different map layers showing the geography at different times. The maps may be further enhanced by techniques such as rubbersheeting , which spatially warps the data to fit with more accurate modern maps. Large map collections, such as the David Rumsey Historical Map Collection , have digitized and georeferenced their maps and published them on the Internet, making them accessible for a variety of projects.

Georeferencing historical microdata, such as census or parish records, allows researchers to conduct spatial analysis of historical data. Comparisons between statistical areas can require reconstructing former political boundaries and other types of borders and tracking their evolution.
