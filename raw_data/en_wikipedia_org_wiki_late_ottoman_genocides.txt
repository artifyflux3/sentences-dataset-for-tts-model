It names " Armenians ", "Greeks of Asia Minor , Pontus and East Thrace " and " Aramaeans (Syriacs/ Assyrian /Chaldeans)." The late Ottoman genocides is a historiographical theory which sees the concurrent Armenian , Greek , and Assyrian genocides [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] that occurred during the 1910s–1920s as parts of a single event rather than separate events, which were initiated by the Young Turks .

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] Although some sources, including The Thirty-Year Genocide (2019) written by the historians Benny Morris and Dror Ze'evi , characterize this event as a genocide of Christians , [ 3 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] others such as those written by the historians Dominik J. Schaller and Jürgen Zimmerer [ de ] contend that such an approach "ignores the Young Turks' massive violence against non-Christians", in particular against Muslim Kurds .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Overview Uğur Ümit Üngör , a Dutch–Turkish historian and professor of genocide studies , explains that the mass violence and enslavement which occurred in the late Ottoman Empire and its successor state includes, but is not limited to, the Adana massacre ; the persecution of Muslims during Ottoman contraction ; the Armenian , Greek , and Assyrian genocides ; the 1921 Koçgiri massacres ; "the mass violence against Kurds from the 1925 Sheikh Said conflict to the 1938 Dersim massacre "; the 1934 Thrace pogroms , through the 1955 Istanbul pogrom against Greek and Armenian Christians.

[ 10 ] Other scholars sometimes also include the earlier Hamidian massacres of Christian Armenians in the 1890s or the deportations of Kurds between 1916 and 1934 .
