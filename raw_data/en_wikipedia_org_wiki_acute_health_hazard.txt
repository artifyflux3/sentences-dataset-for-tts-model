The specific problem is: **defining, "determinant," a complicated, poorly harmonized concept in medicine. Some sources use the term loosely while others use it as a technical term..**[WikiProject Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine "Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine") may be able to help recruit an expert._(July 2019)_

In [epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology "Epidemiology"), a **risk factor** or **determinant** is a variable associated with an increased [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk "Risk") of [disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease "Disease") or [infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection "Infection").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-:0-1): 38

Due to a lack of harmonization across disciplines, **determinant**, in its more widely accepted [scientific meaning](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/determine "wikt:determine"), is often used as a synonym. The main difference lies in the realm of practice: medicine ([clinical practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#Clinical_practice "Medicine")) versus [public health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health "Public health"). As an example from clinical practice, low ingestion of dietary sources of [vitamin C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C "Vitamin C") is a known risk factor for developing [scurvy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy "Scurvy"). Specific to public [health policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_policy "Health policy"), a determinant is a health risk that is general, abstract, related to inequalities, and difficult for an individual to control.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-4) For example, poverty is known to be a determinant of an individual's standard of [health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health "Health").

Risk factors may be used to identify high-risk people.

Correlation vs causation
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Risk_factor&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Correlation vs causation")]

Risk factors or determinants are [correlational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation "Correlation") and not necessarily [causal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality"), because [correlation does not prove causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_prove_causation "Correlation does not prove causation"). For example, being young cannot be said to cause [measles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles "Measles"), but young people have a higher rate of measles because they are less likely to have developed [immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical) "Immunity (medical)") during a previous epidemic. [Statistical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") methods are frequently used to assess the strength of an association and to provide causal evidence, for example in the [study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_doctors_study "British doctors study") of the link between smoking and [lung cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer "Lung cancer"). Statistical analysis along with the biological sciences can establish that risk factors are causal. Some prefer the term risk factor to mean causal determinants of increased rates of disease, and for unproven links to be called possible risks, associations, etc.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

When done thoughtfully and based on research, identification of risk factors can be a strategy for [medical screening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine) "Screening (medicine)").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-WaldHackshaw1999-5)

Terms of description
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Risk_factor&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Terms of description")]

Mainly taken from [risk factors for breast cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factors_for_breast_cancer "Risk factors for breast cancer"), risk factors can be described in terms of, for example:

*   [Relative risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk "Relative risk"), such as "A woman is more than 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer in her 60s than in her 20s."[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-Margolese-6)
*   [Odds ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio "Odds ratio"), such as "The odds of developing breast cancer are approximately 2.45 times higher for women with two or more affected first-degree relatives compared to those without a family history."[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-BreastCancerRisk-7)
*   Fraction of [incidences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology) "Incidence (epidemiology)") occurring in the group having the property of or being exposed to the risk factor, such as "99% of breast cancer cases are diagnosed in women."[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-Giordano-8)
*   Increase in incidence in the exposed group, such as "each daily alcoholic beverage increases the incidence of breast cancer by 11 cases per 1000 women."[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-pmid19244173-9)
*   [Hazard ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio "Hazard ratio"), such as "an increase in both total and invasive breast cancers in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years, with a hazard ratio of 1.24 compared to controls."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-10)

At a wedding, 74 people ate the chicken and 22 of them were ill, while of the 35 people who had the fish or vegetarian meal only 2 were ill. Did the chicken make the people ill?

![Image 2: {\displaystyle Risk={\frac {\mbox{number of persons experiencing event (food poisoning)}}{\mbox{number of persons exposed to risk factor (food)}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/44cf744836c8dfcb3b8b784e7ed4851e1b6677d6)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-11)
So the [chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken "Chicken") eaters' risk = 22/74 = 0.297

 And non-chicken eaters' risk = 2/35 = 0.057.

Those who ate the chicken had a risk over five times as high as those who did not, that is, a relative risk of more than five. This suggests that eating chicken was the cause of the illness, but this is _not_ proof.

This example of a risk factor is described in terms of the [relative risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk "Relative risk") it confers, which is evaluated by comparing the risk of those exposed to the potential risk factor to those not exposed.

General determinants
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Risk_factor&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: General determinants")]

The probability of an outcome usually depends on an interplay between multiple associated variables. When performing [epidemiological studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiological_studies "Epidemiological studies") to evaluate one or more determinants for a specific outcome, the other determinants may act as [confounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding "Confounding") factors, and need to be controlled for, e.g. by [stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratification_(statistics) "Stratification (statistics)"). The potentially confounding determinants varies with what outcome is studied, but the following general confounders are common to most epidemiological associations, and are the determinants most commonly controlled for in epidemiological studies:[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

*   Age (0 to 1.5 years for infants, 1.5 to 6 years for young children, etc.)
*   Sex or gender (Male or female)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-:1-12): 20 
*   Ethnicity (Based on race)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-:1-12): 21 

Other less commonly adjusted for possible confounders include:

*   Social status/income[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-:0-1): 39 
*   Geographic location
*   Genetic predisposition
*   Gender identity
*   Occupation
*   [Overwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwork "Overwork")[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-13)
*   Sexual orientation
*   Level of [chronic stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_stress "Chronic stress")
*   Diet
*   Level of [physical exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise "Physical exercise")
*   Alcohol consumption and [tobacco smoking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking "Tobacco smoking")
*   Other [social determinants of health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health "Social determinants of health")

A _risk marker_ is a variable that is quantitatively associated with a disease or other outcome, but direct alteration of the risk marker does not necessarily alter the risk of the outcome. For example, driving-while-intoxicated (DWI) history is a risk marker for pilots as epidemiologic studies indicate that pilots with a DWI history are significantly more likely than their counterparts without a DWI history to be involved in aviation crashes.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-14)

The term "risk factor" was coined by former [Framingham Heart Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Heart_Study "Framingham Heart Study") director, [William B. Kannel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_B._Kannel "William B. Kannel") in a 1961 article in _[Annals of Internal Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals\_of\_Internal\_Medicine "Annals of Internal Medicine")_.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_health_hazard#cite_note-15)

*   [Health risk assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_risk_assessment "Health risk assessment")
*   [Protective factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protective_factor "Protective factor")
*   [Risk factor (finance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor_(finance) "Risk factor (finance)")
*   [Social determinants of health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health "Social determinants of health")

Unlike a biomedical model that views health as the absence of disease, this dynamic framework includes functional capacity and well-being as health outcomes of interest. It also presents the behavioral and biologic responses of individuals as factors that influence health but are themselves influenced by social, physical, and genetic factors that are beyond the control of the individual.
