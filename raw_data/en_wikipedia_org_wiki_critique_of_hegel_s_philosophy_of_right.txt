In the manuscript, Marx comments on excerpts of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel 's 1820 book Elements of the Philosophy of Right that deal with 'civil society' and the state [ a ] paragraph by paragraph.  Narrative of the work develops around analysis of the relations between " civil society " and " political society ". For Marx, the modern state, originating in Europe , is characterized by an historically unprecedented separation between an individual's "real" life in civil society from his "political" life as a citizen of the state.

[ 1 ] One of Marx's major criticisms of Hegel in the document is the fact that many of his dialectical arguments begin in abstraction .

This work contains the earliest formulation of Marx's theory of alienation , [ 2 ] which was influenced by the writings of Ludwig Feuerbach [ 3 ] and Bruno Bauer .

[ 4 ] The introduction also includes Marx's most famous commentary on the function of religion.
