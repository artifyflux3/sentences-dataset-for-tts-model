A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow , causing the Moon to be darkened. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon's near side entirely passes into the Earth's umbral shadow. Unlike a solar eclipse , which can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world, a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth. A total lunar eclipse can last up to nearly two hours, while a total solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes at any given place, because the Moon's shadow is smaller. The Moon's apparent diameter was near the average diameter because it occurred 6.9 days after apogee (on April 8, 2014, at 10:50 UTC) and 7.6 days before perigee (on April 22, 2014, at 20:20 UTC).

[ 2 ] This lunar eclipse is the first of a tetrad , with four total lunar eclipses in series, the others being on October 8, 2014 ; April 4, 2015 ; and September 28, 2015 .

Background [ edit ] Main article: Lunar eclipse A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes within Earth's umbra (shadow). As the eclipse begins, the Earth's shadow first darkens the Moon slightly.  Then, the shadow begins to "cover" part of the Moon, turning it a dark red-brown color (typically - the color can vary based on atmospheric conditions).  The Moon appears to be reddish because of Rayleigh scattering (the same effect that causes sunsets to appear reddish) and the refraction of that light by the Earth's atmosphere into its umbra.

[ 3 ] The following simulation shows the approximate appearance of the Moon passing through the Earth's shadow. The Moon's brightness is exaggerated within the umbral shadow. The northern portion of the Moon was closest to the center of the shadow, making it darkest, and most red in appearance.

Simulation of the appearance of the Moon just before, during and just after the eclipse Description [ edit ] NASA chart of the eclipse The planet Mars was near opposition, as shown in this geo-centered motion of Mars from 2003 to 2018.

On April 15, 2014, the Moon passed through the southern part of the Earth's umbral shadow.

[ 4 ] It was visible over most of the western hemisphere, including eastern Australia , New Zealand , the Pacific Ocean , and the Americas.

[ 5 ] In the western Pacific, the first half of the eclipse occurred before moonrise. In Europe and Africa , the eclipse began just before moonset.

[ 4 ] Mars , which had just passed its opposition , appeared at magnitude -1.5 about 9.5° northwest of the Moon.

[ 5 ] [ 4 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Spica was 2° to the west, while Arcturus was 32° north.

Saturn was 26° east and Antares 44° southeast.

[ 4 ] The Moon entered Earth's penumbral shadow at 4:53:40 UTC and the umbral shadow at 5:58:19. Totality lasted for 1 hour 17.8 minutes, from 7:06:46 to 8:24:34. The moment of greatest eclipse occurred at 7:45:39.  At that point, the Moon's zenith was approximately 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) southwest of the Galápagos Islands . The Moon left the umbral shadow at 9:33:02 and the penumbral shadow at 10:37:33.

[ 4 ] The peak umbral magnitude was 1.29177, at which moment the northern part of the moon was 1.7 arc-minutes south of the center of Earth's shadow, while the southern part was 40.0 arc-minutes from center.  The gamma of the eclipse was −0.3017.

[ 4 ] The eclipse was a member of Lunar Saros 122 . It was the 56th such eclipse.

[ 8 ] Contact points relative to the earth's umbral and penumbral shadows, here with the moon near is descending node v t e The timing of total lunar eclipses are determined by its contacts: [ 9 ] P1 (First contact): Beginning of the penumbral eclipse. Earth's penumbra touches the Moon's outer limb.

U1 (Second contact): Beginning of the partial eclipse. Earth's umbra touches the Moon's outer limb.

U2 (Third contact): Beginning of the total eclipse. The Moon's surface is entirely within Earth's umbra.

Greatest eclipse : The peak stage of the total eclipse. The Moon is at its closest to the center of Earth's umbra.

U3 (Fourth contact): End of the total eclipse. The Moon's outer limb exits Earth's umbra.

U4 (Fifth contact): End of the partial eclipse. Earth's umbra leaves the Moon's surface.

P4 (Sixth contact): End of the penumbral eclipse. Earth's penumbra no longer makes contact with the Moon.

Viewing events [ edit ] Many museums and observatories planned special events for the eclipse.  The United States National Park Service sponsored events at Great Basin National Park and Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore .

[ 10 ] The University of Hawaii 's Institute for Astronomy held events at two locations on the islands.

[ 11 ] The Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, California streamed the eclipse live on the Internet.

[ 5 ] NASA hosted two live question-and-answer sessions online. The first happened roughly 12 hours before the eclipse via Reddit 's Ask Me Anything.  The second was a web chat hosted on NASA's site just before the eclipse began.  NASA also streamed the eclipse live on their website.

[ 12 ] NASA TV provided 3 hours of live coverage beginning at 2 a.m. EDT.

[ 14 ] The idea gained popular media attention in the United States, and prompted a response from the scientific radio show Earth & Sky .

[ 5 ] [ 15 ] According to Christian Today , only a "small group of Christians" saw the eclipse as having religious significance, despite the attention.

Only two (or occasionally three) eclipse seasons occur each year, and each season lasts about 35 days and repeats just short of six months (173 days) later; thus two full eclipse seasons always occur each year. Either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season. In the sequence below, each eclipse is separated by a fortnight .

The series started with a penumbral lunar eclipse on August 14, 1022. It contains partial eclipses from April 10, 1419 through June 24, 1545; total eclipses from July 5, 1563 through May 6, 2050 ; and a second set of partial eclipses from May 17, 2068 through July 21, 2176. The series ends at member 74 as a penumbral eclipse on October 29, 2338.

The longest duration of totality was produced by member 39 at 100 minutes, 5 seconds on October 11, 1707. All eclipses in this series occur at the Moon’s ascending node of orbit.

[ 19 ] Greatest First The greatest eclipse of the series occurred on 1707 Oct 11 , lasting 100 minutes, 5 seconds.

Their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month (period of perigee), but groupings of 3 tritos cycles (≈ 33 years minus 3 months) come close (≈ 434.044 anomalistic months), so eclipses are similar in these groupings.
