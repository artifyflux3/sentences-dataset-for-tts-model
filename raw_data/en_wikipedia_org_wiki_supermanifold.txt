Several definitions are in use, some of which are described below.

Informal definition [ edit ] An informal definition is commonly used in physics textbooks and introductory lectures. It defines a supermanifold as a manifold with both bosonic and fermionic coordinates.  Locally, it is composed of coordinate charts that make it look like a "flat", "Euclidean" superspace . These local coordinates are often denoted by ( x , θ θ , θ θ ¯ ¯ ) {\displaystyle (x,\theta ,{\bar {\theta }})} where x is the ( real-number -valued) spacetime coordinate, and θ θ {\displaystyle \theta \,} and θ θ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {\theta }}} are Grassmann-valued spatial "directions".

The physical interpretation of the Grassmann-valued coordinates are the subject of debate; explicit experimental searches for supersymmetry have not yielded any positive results.  However, the use of Grassmann variables allow for the tremendous simplification of a number of important mathematical results. This includes, among other things a compact definition of functional integrals , the proper treatment of ghosts in BRST quantization , the cancellation of infinities in quantum field theory , Witten's work on the Atiyah-Singer index theorem , and more recent applications to mirror symmetry .

The use of Grassmann-valued coordinates has spawned the field of supermathematics , wherein large portions of geometry can be generalized to super-equivalents, including much of Riemannian geometry and most of the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras (such as Lie superalgebras , etc.

) However, issues remain, including the proper extension of de Rham cohomology to supermanifolds.

Definition [ edit ] Three different definitions of supermanifolds are in use.  One definition is as a sheaf over a ringed space ; this is sometimes called the " algebro-geometric approach".

[ 1 ] This approach has a mathematical elegance, but can be problematic in various calculations and intuitive understanding. A second approach can be called a "concrete approach", [ 1 ] as it is capable of simply and naturally generalizing a broad class of concepts from ordinary mathematics. It requires the use of an infinite number of supersymmetric generators in its definition; however, all but a finite number of these generators carry no content, as the concrete approach requires the use of a coarse topology that renders almost all of them equivalent. Surprisingly, these two definitions,  one with a finite number of supersymmetric generators, and one with an infinite number of generators, are equivalent.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] A third approach describes a supermanifold as a base topos of a superpoint . This approach remains the topic of active research.

[ 3 ] Algebro-geometric: as a sheaf [ edit ] Although supermanifolds are special cases of noncommutative manifolds , their local structure makes them better suited to study with the tools of standard differential geometry and locally ringed spaces .

A supermanifold M of dimension ( p , q ) is a topological space M with a sheaf of superalgebras , usually denoted O M or C ∞ ( M ), that is locally isomorphic to C ∞ ∞ ( R p ) ⊗ ⊗ Λ Λ ∙ ∙ ( ξ ξ 1 , … … ξ ξ q ) {\displaystyle C^{\infty }(\mathbb {R} ^{p})\otimes \Lambda ^{\bullet }(\xi _{1},\dots \xi _{q})} , where the latter is a Grassmann (Exterior) algebra on q generators.

A supermanifold M of dimension (1,1) is sometimes called a super-Riemann surface .

Historically, this approach is associated with Felix Berezin , Dimitry Leites , and Bertram Kostant .

Concrete: as a smooth manifold [ edit ] A different definition describes a supermanifold in a fashion that is similar to that of a smooth manifold , except that the model space R p {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{p}} has been replaced by the model superspace R c p × × R a q {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{c}^{p}\times \mathbb {R} _{a}^{q}} .

To correctly define this, it is necessary to explain what R c {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{c}} and R a {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{a}} are. These are given as the even and odd real subspaces of the one-dimensional space of Grassmann numbers , which, by convention, are generated by a countably infinite number of anti-commuting variables: i.e. the one-dimensional space is given by C ⊗ ⊗ Λ Λ ( V ) , {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} \otimes \Lambda (V),} where V is infinite-dimensional.  An element z is termed real if z = z ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle z=z^{*}} ; real elements consisting of only an even number of Grassmann generators form the space R c {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{c}} of c-numbers , while real elements consisting of only an odd number of Grassmann generators form the space R a {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{a}} of a-numbers . Note that c -numbers commute, while a -numbers anti-commute. The spaces R c p {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{c}^{p}} and R a q {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{a}^{q}} are then defined as the p -fold and q -fold Cartesian products of R c {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{c}} and R a {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{a}} .

[ 4 ] Just as in the case of an ordinary manifold, the supermanifold is then defined as a collection of charts glued together with differentiable transition functions.

[ 4 ] This definition in terms of charts requires that the transition functions have a smooth structure and a non-vanishing Jacobian .  This can only be accomplished if the individual charts use a topology that is considerably coarser than the vector-space topology on the Grassmann algebra. This topology is obtained by projecting R c p {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{c}^{p}} down to R p {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{p}} and then using the natural topology on that. The resulting topology is not Hausdorff , but may be termed "projectively Hausdorff".

[ 4 ] That this definition is equivalent to the first one is not at all obvious; however, it is the use of the coarse topology that makes it so, by rendering most of the "points" identical.  That is, R c p × × R a q {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{c}^{p}\times \mathbb {R} _{a}^{q}} with the coarse topology is essentially isomorphic [ 1 ] [ 2 ] to R p ⊗ ⊗ Λ Λ ∙ ∙ ( ξ ξ 1 , … … ξ ξ q ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{p}\otimes \Lambda ^{\bullet }(\xi _{1},\dots \xi _{q})} Properties [ edit ] Unlike a regular manifold, a supermanifold is not entirely composed of a set of points.  Instead, one takes the dual point of view that the structure of a supermanifold M is contained in its sheaf O M of "smooth functions".  In the dual point of view, an injective map corresponds to a surjection of sheaves, and a surjective map corresponds to an injection of sheaves.

An alternative approach to the dual point of view is to use the functor of points .

If M is a supermanifold of dimension ( p , q ), then the underlying space M inherits the structure of a differentiable manifold whose sheaf of smooth functions is O M / I {\displaystyle O_{M}/I} , where I {\displaystyle I} is the ideal generated by all odd functions.  Thus M is called the underlying space, or the body, of M .  The quotient map O M → → O M / I {\displaystyle O_{M}\to O_{M}/I} corresponds to an injective map M → M ; thus M is a submanifold of M .

Examples [ edit ] Let M be a manifold.  The odd tangent bundle ΠT M is a supermanifold given by the sheaf Ω( M ) of differential forms on M .

More generally, let E → M be a vector bundle .  Then Π E is a supermanifold given by the sheaf Γ(ΛE * ).  In fact, Π is a functor from the category of vector bundles to the category of supermanifolds .

Lie supergroups are examples of supermanifolds.

Batchelor's theorem [ edit ] Batchelor's theorem states that every supermanifold is noncanonically isomorphic to a supermanifold of the form Π E .  The word "noncanonically" prevents one from concluding that supermanifolds are simply glorified vector bundles; although the functor Π maps surjectively onto the isomorphism classes of supermanifolds, it is not an equivalence of categories . It was published by Marjorie Batchelor in 1979.

[ 5 ] The proof of Batchelor's theorem relies in an essential way on the existence of a partition of unity , so it does not hold for complex or real-analytic supermanifolds.

Odd symplectic structures [ edit ] Odd symplectic form [ edit ] In many physical and geometric applications, a supermanifold comes equipped with an Grassmann-odd symplectic structure . All natural geometric objects on a supermanifold are graded. In particular, the bundle of two-forms is equipped with a grading. An odd symplectic form ω on a supermanifold is a closed, odd form, inducing a non-degenerate pairing on TM . Such a supermanifold is called a P-manifold . Its graded dimension is necessarily ( n , n ), because the odd symplectic form induces a pairing of odd and even variables. There is a version of the Darboux theorem for P-manifolds, which allows one
to equip a P-manifold locally with a set of coordinates where the odd symplectic form ω is written as ω ω = ∑ ∑ i d ξ ξ i ∧ ∧ d x i , {\displaystyle \omega =\sum _{i}d\xi _{i}\wedge dx_{i},} where x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} are even coordinates, and ξ ξ i {\displaystyle \xi _{i}} odd coordinates. (An odd symplectic form should not be confused with a Grassmann-even symplectic form on a supermanifold. In contrast, the Darboux version of an even symplectic form is ∑ ∑ i d p i ∧ ∧ d q i + ∑ ∑ j ε ε j 2 ( d ξ ξ j ) 2 , {\displaystyle \sum _{i}dp_{i}\wedge dq_{i}+\sum _{j}{\frac {\varepsilon _{j}}{2}}(d\xi _{j})^{2},} where p i , q i {\displaystyle p_{i},q_{i}} are even coordinates, ξ ξ i {\displaystyle \xi _{i}} odd coordinates and ε ε j {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{j}} are either +1 or −1.) Antibracket [ edit ] Given an odd symplectic 2-form ω one may define a Poisson bracket known as the antibracket of any two functions F and G on a supermanifold by { F , G } = ∂ ∂ r F ∂ ∂ z i ω ω i j ( z ) ∂ ∂ l G ∂ ∂ z j .

{\displaystyle \{F,G\}={\frac {\partial _{r}F}{\partial z^{i}}}\omega ^{ij}(z){\frac {\partial _{l}G}{\partial z^{j}}}.} Here ∂ ∂ r {\displaystyle \partial _{r}} and ∂ ∂ l {\displaystyle \partial _{l}} are the right and left derivatives respectively and z are the coordinates of the supermanifold.  Equipped with this bracket, the algebra of functions on a supermanifold becomes an antibracket algebra .

A coordinate transformation that preserves the antibracket is called a P-transformation .  If the Berezinian of a P-transformation is equal to one then it is called an SP-transformation .

P and SP-manifolds [ edit ] Using the Darboux theorem for odd symplectic forms one can show that P-manifolds are constructed from open sets of superspaces R n | n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}^{n|n}} glued together by P-transformations.  A manifold is said to be an SP-manifold if these transition functions can be chosen to be SP-transformations.  Equivalently one may define an SP-manifold as a supermanifold with a nondegenerate odd 2-form ω and a density function ρ such that on each coordinate patch there exist Darboux coordinates in which ρ is identically equal to one.

Laplacian [ edit ] One may define a Laplacian operator Δ on an SP-manifold as the operator which takes a function H to one half of the divergence of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field .  Explicitly one defines Δ Δ H = 1 2 ρ ρ ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ z a ( ρ ρ ω ω i j ( z ) ∂ ∂ l H ∂ ∂ z j ) .

{\displaystyle \Delta H={\frac {1}{2\rho }}{\frac {\partial _{r}}{\partial z^{a}}}\left(\rho \omega ^{ij}(z){\frac {\partial _{l}H}{\partial z^{j}}}\right).} In Darboux coordinates this definition reduces to Δ Δ = ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ x a ∂ ∂ l ∂ ∂ θ θ a {\displaystyle \Delta ={\frac {\partial _{r}}{\partial x^{a}}}{\frac {\partial _{l}}{\partial \theta _{a}}}} where x a and θ a are even and odd coordinates such that ω ω = d x a ∧ ∧ d θ θ a .

{\displaystyle \omega =dx^{a}\wedge d\theta _{a}.} The Laplacian is odd and nilpotent Δ Δ 2 = 0.

{\displaystyle \Delta ^{2}=0.} One may define the cohomology of functions H with respect to the Laplacian.  In Geometry of Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization , Albert Schwarz has proven that the integral of a function H over a Lagrangian submanifold L depends only on the cohomology class of H and on the homology class of the body of L in the body of the ambient supermanifold.

SUSY [ edit ] A pre-SUSY-structure on a supermanifold of dimension
( n , m ) is an odd m -dimensional
distribution P ⊂ ⊂ T M {\displaystyle P\subset TM} .
With such a distribution one associates
its Frobenius tensor S 2 P ↦ ↦ T M / P {\displaystyle S^{2}P\mapsto TM/P} (since P is odd, the skew-symmetric Frobenius
tensor is a symmetric operation).
If this tensor is non-degenerate,
e.g. lies in an open orbit of G L ( P ) × × G L ( T M / P ) {\displaystyle GL(P)\times GL(TM/P)} , M is called a SUSY-manifold .
SUSY-structure in dimension (1, k )
is the same as odd contact structure .
