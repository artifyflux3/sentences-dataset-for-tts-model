Biography [ edit ] He was born in Suhar , Oman . He moved then into Basra , then to Persia where he studied under Al-Biruni and Ibn Sina . Later he migrated to Jerusalem and finally settled in Valencia , in Al-Andalus (Islamic Spain).

[ 1 ] Works [ edit ] He is famous for his book Kitab Al-Ma'a ( The Book of Water ),  a medical encyclopedia that lists the names of diseases, medicines,  physiological processes, and treatments. It is the first known alphabetical classification of medical terms. In this encyclopedia, Ibn Al-Thahabi not only lists the names but adds numerous original ideas about the function of the human organs.  The book also contains an array of herbal treatments and a course for the treatment psychological symptoms. The main thesis is that cure must start from controlled food and exercise;  if it persists then use specific individual medicines;  if it still persists then use medical compounds; and if the disease continues, surgery is performed.
