It is distinctive from other food-related areas of study such as nutrition , agriculture , gastronomy , and culinary arts in that it tends to look beyond the  consumption, production, and aesthetic appreciation of food and tries to illuminate food as it relates to multiple academic fields.

Research questions [ edit ] Qualitative research questions include impact on the environment , the ethics of eating , how food contributes to systems of oppression , and its use as symbols of identity . Basic questions include Who chooses what we eat and why, traditional food preparation , the boundary between culinary heritage and invented traditions , and how to teach the subject. This has led to the development of the concept of "foodscape" [ 1 ] and the practice of foodscape mapping.

[ 2 ] Specific issues include food insecurity.

[ 3 ] Food education has health implications, especially with highly advertised fast food , [ 4 ] and the prevalence of obesity in young people.
