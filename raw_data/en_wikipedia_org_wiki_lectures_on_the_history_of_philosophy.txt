[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Overview [ edit ] Hegel's lecture notes were edited by his student, Karl Ludwig Michelet in 1833, and revised in 1840-1842. An English translation was provided by Elizabeth Haldane in 1892.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] In it, he outlined his ideas on the major philosophers. He saw consciousness as progressing from an undifferentiated pantheism of the East to a more individualistic understanding culminating in the freedom of the Germanic era .

In his lectures Hegel cites extensively the voluminous histories of philosophy written in Germany after 1740; among them: Johann Jakob Brucker 's Historia critica philosophiae , 6 vols. (1742–1767; "Critical History of Philosophy"); Johann Buhle 's Lehrbuch der Geschichte der Philosophie , 8 vols. (1796–1804; "Textbook on the History of Philosophy"); Dietrich Tiedemann 's Geist der spekulativen Philosophie von Thales bis Berkeley , 6 vols. (1791–1797; "The Spirit of Speculative Philosophy from Thales to Berkeley"); and Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann 's Geschichte der Philosophie , 11 vols. (1789–1819; "History of Philosophy").
