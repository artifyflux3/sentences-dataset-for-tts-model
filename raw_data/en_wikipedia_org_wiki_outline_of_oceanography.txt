Thermohaline circulation Oceanography (from Ancient Greek ὠκεανός ( ōkeanós ) ' ocean ' and γραφή ( graphḗ ) ' writing ' ), also known as oceanology , sea science , ocean science , and marine science , is the scientific study of the ocean , including its physics , chemistry , biology , and geology .

It is an Earth science , which covers a wide range of topics, including ocean currents , waves , and geophysical fluid dynamics ; fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries; ecosystem dynamics; and plate tectonics and seabed geology.

Oceanographers draw upon a wide range of disciplines to deepen their understanding of the world’s oceans, incorporating insights from astronomy , biology , chemistry , geography , geology , hydrology , meteorology and physics . ( See: main article.

) Below is a structured list of topics on oceanography.

What type of thing is oceanography?

[ edit ] Oceanography can be described as all of the following: The study of the physical and biological aspects of the ocean An academic discipline – branch of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.

A scientific field (a branch of science ) – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer-reviewed research is published. There are several geophysics-related scientific journals.

A natural science – one that seeks to elucidate the rules that govern the natural world using empirical and scientific methods .

A physical science – one that studies non-living systems.

An earth science – one that studies the planet Earth and its surroundings.
