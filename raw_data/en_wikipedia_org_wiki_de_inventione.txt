Quintilian tells us that Cicero considered the work rendered obsolete by his later writings.

[ 1 ] Despite Cicero’s original plan to cover all five components of Rhetoric, the final work only deals with the first component, Invention. It is also credited with the first recorded use of the term " liberal arts " or artes liberales , though whether Cicero coined the term is unclear.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The text also defines the concept of dignitas : dignitas est alicuius honesta et cultu et honore et verecundia digna auctoritas ( Dignity is honorable prestige. It merits respect, honour, and reverence.

).

[ 4 ] At the request of William of Santo Stefano , De Inventione was translated into Old French by John of Antioch in 1282.

[ 5 ] Cicero's Five Canons of Rhetoric [ edit ] In his writing De Inventione , Cicero explained the five canons or tenets of rhetoric. The five canons apply to rhetoric and public speaking. The five canons are invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery.
