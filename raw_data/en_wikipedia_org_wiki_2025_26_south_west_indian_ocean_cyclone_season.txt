It will begin on 15 November 2025, and will end on 30 April 2026, with the exception for Mauritius and the Seychelles , for which it will end on 15 May 2026. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of 90°E and south of the Equator . However, tropical cyclones can form year-round with any cyclone forming between 1 July 2025 and 30 June 2026, such as 01 and Awo , will be part of the season. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Réunion and unofficially by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center .

Seasonal summary [ edit ] Pre-season/early season activity [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( July 2025 ) The season began with the crossover of a tropical low from the Australian basin in the early pre-season. The low was designated Tropical Depression 01 by Météo-France , while the JTWC designated the depression as Tropical Storm 01S a little later.

[ citation needed ] Just under a month later on 7 August tropical storm Awo formed, affecting Agaléga.
Awo is the first named storm to form in August within the South-West Indian Ocean basin since Severe Tropical Storm Aline in 1969, though Severe Tropical Storm Tony did enter the basin during August in 1979.

Systems [ edit ] Tropical Depression 01 [ edit ] Tropical depression (MFR) Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration 16 July ( Entered basin ) – 18 July Peak intensity 55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 1001 hPa ( mbar ) See also: List of off-season South-West Indian Ocean tropical cyclones On 16 July, a tropical low moved into the basin from the Australian Region where it was classified as Zone of Disturbed Weather 01 by Météo-France . On the same day, the JTWC upgraded it to a Tropical Storm, assigning it the notation 01S .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The system moved west-southwestwards into an increasingly unfavourable environment, dissipating on 18 July.

Moderate Tropical Storm Awo [ edit ] Moderate tropical storm (MFR) Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration 7 August – 8 August Peak intensity 65 km/h (40 mph) (10-min) ; 1000 hPa ( mbar ) See also: List of off-season South-West Indian Ocean tropical cyclones On 6 August, a tropical disturbance formed in the central Indian Ocean. A day later, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Storm 02S. while MFR designated the system as Tropical Depression 02.  Six hours later, Mauritius Meteorological Services upgraded it to moderate tropical storm status and named it Awo .

[ 3 ] Awo is the first named storm to form in August within the South-West Indian Ocean basin since Severe Tropical Storm Aline in 1969, though Severe Tropical Storm Tony did enter the basin during August in 1979.

[ 4 ] Storm names [ edit ] Main article: Tropical cyclone naming Within the South-West Indian Ocean, tropical depressions and subtropical depressions that are judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h (40 mph) by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre on Réunion island, France (RSMC La Réunion) are usually assigned a name. However, it is the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centres in Mauritius and Madagascar who name the systems. The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre (Mauritius Meteorological Services) in Mauritius names a storm if it intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 55°E and 90°E . If instead a cyclone intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 30°E and 55°E then the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre (Meteo Madagascar) in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. Storm names are taken from three pre-determined lists of names, which rotate on a triennial basis, with any names that have been used automatically removed. New names this season are: Awo, Blossom, Chenge, Dudzai, Ewetse, and Fytia. They replaced Ashley, Balita, Cheneso, Dingani, Enala, Fabien during the 2022–23 season .

Information on their intensity, duration, name, areas affected, primarily comes from RSMC La Réunion. Death and damage reports come from either press reports or the relevant national disaster management agency while the damage totals are given in 2025 or 2026 USD.
