[ 1 ] The neighborhood is named after John von Neumann , who used it to define the von Neumann cellular automaton and the von Neumann universal constructor within it.

[ 2 ] It is one of the two most commonly used neighborhood types for two-dimensional cellular automata, the other one being the Moore neighborhood .

This neighbourhood can be used to define the notion of 4-connected pixels in computer graphics .

[ 3 ] The von Neumann neighbourhood of a cell is the cell itself and the cells at a Manhattan distance of 1.

The concept can be extended to higher dimensions, for example forming a 6-cell octahedral neighborhood for a cubic cellular automaton in three dimensions.

[ 4 ] Von Neumann neighborhood of range r [ edit ] An extension of the simple von Neumann neighborhood described above is to take the set of points at a Manhattan distance of r > 1. This results in a diamond-shaped region (shown for r = 2 in the illustration). These are called von Neumann neighborhoods of range or extent r . The number of cells in a 2-dimensional von Neumann neighborhood of range r can be expressed as r 2 + ( r + 1 ) 2 {\displaystyle r^{2}+(r+1)^{2}} . The number of cells in a d -dimensional von Neumann neighborhood of range r is the Delannoy number D ( d , r ).

[ 4 ] The number of cells on a surface of a d -dimensional von Neumann neighborhood of range r is the Zaitsev number (sequence A266213 in the OEIS ).
