Station crew names are in bold . The suffix (twice) refers to the individual's number of Mir visits, not their total number of space flights. Entries without a flag symbol indicate that the person was a citizen from the bloc of countries comprising the former Soviet Union at launch.

Statistics [ edit ] Between 1986 and 2000, 104 individuals visited the Mir space station. Note that this list does not double count for individuals with dual citizenship (for example, the British - American astronaut Michael Foale is only listed under the United States ).
