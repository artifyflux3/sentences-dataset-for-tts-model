These are based on the observation that, in n -dimensional Euclidean space R n , ( n − 1)-dimensional spheres (that is, the boundaries of n -dimensional balls) have dimension n − 1. Therefore it should be possible to define the dimension of a space inductively in terms of the dimensions of the boundaries of suitable open sets .

The small and large inductive dimensions are two of the three most usual ways of capturing the notion of "dimension" for a topological space, in a way that depends only on the topology (and not, say, on the properties of a metric space ). The other is the Lebesgue covering dimension . The term "topological dimension" is ordinarily understood to refer to the Lebesgue covering dimension. For "sufficiently nice" spaces, the three measures of dimension are equal.

Formal definition [ edit ] We want the dimension of a point to be 0, and a point has empty boundary, so we start with ind ⁡ ⁡ ( ∅ ∅ ) = Ind ⁡ ⁡ ( ∅ ∅ ) = − − 1 {\displaystyle \operatorname {ind} (\varnothing )=\operatorname {Ind} (\varnothing )=-1} Then inductively, ind( X ) is the smallest n such that, for every x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and every open set U containing x , there is an open set V containing x , such that the closure of V is a subset of U , and the boundary of V has small inductive dimension less than or equal to n − 1. (If X is a Euclidean n -dimensional space, V can be chosen to be an n -dimensional ball centered at x .) For the large inductive dimension, we restrict the choice of V still further; Ind( X ) is the smallest n such that, for every closed subset F of every open subset U of X , there is an open V in between (that is, F is a subset of V and the closure of V is a subset of U ), such that the boundary of V has large inductive dimension less than or equal to n − 1.

[ 1 ] Relationship between dimensions [ edit ] Let dim {\displaystyle \dim } be the Lebesgue covering dimension. For any topological space X , we have dim ⁡ ⁡ X = 0 {\displaystyle \dim X=0} if and only if Ind ⁡ ⁡ X = 0.

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Ind} X=0.} Urysohn's theorem states that when X is a normal space with a countable base , then dim ⁡ ⁡ X = Ind ⁡ ⁡ X = ind ⁡ ⁡ X .

{\displaystyle \dim X=\operatorname {Ind} X=\operatorname {ind} X.} Such spaces are exactly the separable and metrizable X (see Urysohn's metrization theorem ).

The Nöbeling–Pontryagin theorem then states that such spaces with finite dimension are characterised up to homeomorphism as the subspaces of the Euclidean spaces , with their usual topology. The Menger–Nöbeling theorem (1932) states that if X {\displaystyle X} is compact metric separable and of dimension n {\displaystyle n} , then it embeds as a subspace of Euclidean space of dimension 2 n + 1 {\displaystyle 2n+1} . ( Georg Nöbeling was a student of Karl Menger . He introduced Nöbeling space , the subspace of R 2 n + 1 {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{2n+1}} consisting of points with at least n + 1 {\displaystyle n+1} co-ordinates being irrational numbers , which has universal properties for embedding spaces of dimension n {\displaystyle n} .) Assuming only X metrizable we have ( Miroslav Katětov ) ind X ≤ Ind X = dim X ; or assuming X compact and Hausdorff ( P. S. Aleksandrov ) dim X ≤ ind X ≤ Ind X .

Either inequality here may be strict; an example of Vladimir V. Filippov shows that the two inductive dimensions may differ.

A separable metric space X satisfies the inequality Ind ⁡ ⁡ X ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ind} X\leq n} if and only if for every closed sub-space A {\displaystyle A} of the space X {\displaystyle X} and each continuous mapping f : A → → S n {\displaystyle f:A\to S^{n}} there exists a continuous extension f ¯ ¯ : X → → S n {\displaystyle {\bar {f}}:X\to S^{n}} .
