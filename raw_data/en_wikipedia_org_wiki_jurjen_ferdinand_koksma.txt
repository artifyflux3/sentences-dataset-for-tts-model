[ 2 ] Around the same time, aged 26, he was invited to become full professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam . He accepted and in 1930 became the first professor in mathematics at this university.

[ 3 ] Koksma is also one of the founders of the Dutch Mathematisch Centrum (today Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica ).
