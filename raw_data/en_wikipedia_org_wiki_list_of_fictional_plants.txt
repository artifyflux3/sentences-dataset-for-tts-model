In Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere Series [ edit ] On the planet Roshar ( The Stormlight Archive ) Firemoss: A red-brown moss that, when activated by rubbing between the thumb and forefinger, releases wisps of smoke that create feelings of euphoria when inhaled and is used as a recreational drug.

[ 15 ] Firemoss is highly addictive, limiting its medicinal use, though it is sometimes used to reduce cranial swelling and offer pain relief.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] Knobweed: Like most of the plants found on Rohsar, knobweed has adapted to survive the planet's harsh storms. The reed-like stalk anchors itself directly to stone and the frond found at the top of the stalk has the ability to contract and retreat into the stalk during storms for protection. Knobweed reproduces by releasing fluffy pappuses that carry seeds into the air. The milky white sap found inside knobweed stems is a natural and highly valuable antiseptic used in the field and by established apothecaries.

[ 16 ] Prickletac: Prickletac plants are the colonies of much smaller living buds. As each generation of buds dies it converts to a hard, stony material which the next generation builds upon.

[ 17 ] Prickletac's reproductive system is based on this oddity – when a 'limb' grows too large it breaks off and falls to the ground, scattering living buds. Also known as Twisted Spine .

[ 18 ] Rockbuds: Rockbud is both a general term for several shelled plants on Roshar, including Lavis Polyps , Vinebuds , and Prickletac Shrubs , and the proper name for a specific plant. The true Rockbud plant is a shelled plant containing lengthy tendrils that reach out to lap up water (and occasionally animal blood).

[ 16 ] The size of fully grown rockbuds depends largely on climate. In colder climates they grow no larger than a human fist, while rockbuds in warm climates can grow to the size of a barrel.

[ 17 ] Rockbuds are harvested for consumption, limited medicinal uses, and paper making.

Shalebark : A class of stony, fanlike plants often used for decoration and landscaping.

[ 16 ] On the planet Nalthis ( Warbreaker ) Tears of Edgli: Vibrantly colored flowers that grow only in the temperate T'Telir climate. Highly valuable both economically and magically.

[ 19 ] On the planet First of the Sun (Sixth of the Dusk) ; Unnamed Telepathic Trees: Many flora and fauna on this planet communicate with a form of natural telepathy. Certain unnamed plants living on the islands that make up the Pantheon send false thoughts of wounded or frightened animals to attract predators, which often fight and leave victims dead near enough to the tree to provide nutrition. These plants are not directly carnivorous.

[ 20 ] On the planet Taldain ( White Sand series) Dorim vines: Dorim vines live under the sand that covers most of Taldain's Dayside continent, reaching down to the water table where they fill themselves with water as a defensive mechanism against predators – the hard shells of many of the continents animals is dissolved by contact with water. Pouring water onto sand draws nearby vines out of the ground.

[ 21 ] In Dungeons & Dragons [ edit ] The role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons has a number of, according to Charles Elliott "not-very-ingenious", imaginary plant species, [ 14 ] as well as "a taxonomy of fungal horrors", which Ben Woodard considers eerie not only for their poisonous nature, but because many have the ability to move.

[ 26 ] Obliviax : A black moss that steals memories from intelligent creatures.

[ 24 ] The obliviax appeared on Geek.com 's list of "The most underrated monsters of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons", because ingesting the moss can transfer the memories, an "interesting" concept which lends itself to "Christopher Nolan-esque adventures that will be both universally applauded and terribly confusing at the same time.".

[ 28 ] Shambling mound : [ 22 ] An atrocious plant-like creature, also called a shambler.
