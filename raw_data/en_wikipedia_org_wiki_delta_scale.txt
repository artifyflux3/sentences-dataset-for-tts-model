It may be regarded as the beta scale 's reciprocal, since it is "as far 'down' the ( 0 3 6 9 ) circle from α as β is 'up'".

[ 1 ] As such it would split the minor second (presumably 16:15) into eight equal parts of approximately 14 cents each Play ⓘ . This would total approximately 85.7 steps per octave.

The scale step may also precisely be derived from using 50:28 (25:14, 1003.8 cents, A ♯ , Play ⓘ ) to approximate the interval 3:2 ⁄ 5:4 , which equals 6:5 (E ♭ , 315.64 cents, Play ⓘ ). Thus the step is approximately 13.946 cents, and there are 86.049 steps per octave.
