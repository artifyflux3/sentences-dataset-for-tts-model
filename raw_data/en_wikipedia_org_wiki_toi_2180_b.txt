[ 1 ] It was discovered with the help of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and is currently the exoplanet with the longest orbital period TESS was able to uncover (as of September 2022).

[ 3 ] TOI-2180 b orbits its host star every 260.16 days.

[ 2 ] Discovery [ edit ] TOI-2180 b was first identified as an exoplanet candidate due to a single transit with TESS at 12./13. December 2019 by a group of citizen scientists called the Visual Survey Group , which includes Thomas Lee Jacobs , a former U.S. naval officer .

[ 4 ] The group was using the light curve processing tool lcTools. In May 2020 the Planet Hunters: TESS collaboration announced this object as a Community TESS Object of Interest (CTOI) and it was soon promoted into a regular TOI.

[ 1 ] The TESS-Keck Survey collaboration performed radial velocity follow-up observations for nearly 2 years with the Automated Planet Finder and Keck I . The follow-up observations uncovered that the single transit was caused by a long-period planet.

[ 1 ] Orbital properties [ edit ] TOI-2180 b has a long orbital period of 260.16 days, [ 2 ] which also leads to a long transit duration of 24 hours.

[ 1 ] The distance to the host star is 82.8% the sun-earth distance.

[ 1 ] The planet does not orbit inside the habitable zone , despite this close resemblance in semi-major axis .

[ 5 ] TOI-2180 b has a high eccentricity of the orbit at 0.37.

[ 1 ] The second transit was not detected from the ground and the third transit was not observed.

[ 1 ] The fourth transit was observed at 31. January/01. February 2022, refining the orbital period. The next transit will occur on 2022 October 18 at 21:28 UTC.

[ 2 ] Physical properties [ edit ] The planet has the same size as Jupiter , but is 2.8 times heavier than Jupiter. TOI-2180 b stand out because of its cold estimated temperature of about 348 Kelvin (74.9 °C, 166.7 °F).

[ 1 ] This is closer to Jupiters 165 K than most discovered giant exoplanets. TOI-2180 b belongs to a small sample of temperate Jupiters with a temperature <400 K that transit, such as Kepler-167 e , WD 1856+534 b , Kepler-1704 b , KOI-3680 b , Kepler-1514 b and Kepler-539 b . TOI-2180 b has by far the brightest host star with a visual magnitude of 9.16, which is about 3 magnitudes brighter than the next brightest system in this sample.

[ 5 ] The planet is likely enriched in metals compared to its host star. The discovery team inferred that TOI-2180 b is enriched in metals by a factor of about 5 compared to its host star. This means it has about 100 M 🜨 of heavy elements in its envelope and interior.

[ 1 ] Future observations [ edit ] The exoplanet is a poor target for transmission spectroscopy because of its high surface gravity and the large radius of the host star. The large radius of the star causes a relative shallow transit depth of about 0.5%. The system is still an excellent target to find rings and exomoons around TOI-2180 b. It is also a good target to study the migration of exoplanets.

[ 1 ] It could be one of the best targets for exomoon searches.

[ 6 ] Host star [ edit ] The host star is a 9.16 magnitude [ 7 ] bright and slightly evolved star with a spectral type of G5. It has a mass of 1.1 M ☉ and a radius of 1.6 R ☉ . The radius is increased due to the evolved nature of the star. The star is 116 parsec (379 light-years ) distant from earth and has an age of about 8.1 billion years.

[ 1 ] Habitable Zone [ edit ] Currently the habitable zone around TOI-2180 is between 1.5 and 2.2 astronomical units .

[ 1 ] [ note 1 ] Because TOI-2180 is slightly evolved, it had a habitable zone closer to the star in the past. At an age of about 3 billion years the habitable zone was located between 1.1 and 1.6 astronomical units.

[ 1 ] [ 8 ] [ note 2 ] Outer planet candidate [ edit ] The radial velocity monitoring also showed acceleration of TOI-2180 b due to an outer planet or low-mass star in the system.

[ 1 ] A later analysis of RV data has shown that an outer companion has an orbital period of 1558 +68 −19 days, an eccentricity of about 0.31 and a minimum mass of 3.94 +0.27 −0.22 M J , making it likely a giant planet. The acceleration (TTV) and the outer companion detected in the RV could be the same object.

[ 6 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ Using a luminosity of 2.544 by Dalba et al. and using step 2 by Morris ^ Using MIST evolutionary track with initial mass=1.115 Msun (best match from isochromes), initial metallicity [Fe/H]=0.269 (Delba et al for TOI-2180) and using synthetic photometry output UBV etc. Then the approach by Morris was used, assuming the star was an F-type back then.
