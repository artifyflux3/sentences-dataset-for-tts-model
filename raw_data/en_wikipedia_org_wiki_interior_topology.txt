The point y is on the boundary of S .

In mathematics , specifically in topology ,
the interior of a subset S of a topological space X is the union of all subsets of S that are open in X .
A point that is in the interior of S is an interior point of S .

The interior of S is the complement of the closure of the complement of S .
In this sense interior and closure are dual notions.

The exterior of a set S is the complement of the closure of S ; it consists of the points that are in neither the set nor its boundary .
The interior, boundary, and exterior of a subset together partition the whole space into three blocks (or fewer when one or more of these is empty ).

The interior and exterior of a closed curve are a slightly different concept; see the Jordan curve theorem .

Definitions [ edit ] Interior point [ edit ] If S {\displaystyle S} is a subset of a Euclidean space , then x {\displaystyle x} is an interior point of S {\displaystyle S} if there exists an open ball centered at x {\displaystyle x} which is completely contained in S .

{\displaystyle S.} (This is illustrated in the introductory section to this article.) This definition generalizes to any subset S {\displaystyle S} of a metric space X {\displaystyle X} with metric d {\displaystyle d} : x {\displaystyle x} is an interior point of S {\displaystyle S} if there exists a real  number r > 0 , {\displaystyle r>0,} such that y {\displaystyle y} is in S {\displaystyle S} whenever the distance d ( x , y ) < r .

{\displaystyle d(x,y)<r.} This definition generalizes to topological spaces by replacing "open ball" with " open set ".
If S {\displaystyle S} is a subset of a topological space X {\displaystyle X} then x {\displaystyle x} is an interior point of S {\displaystyle S} in X {\displaystyle X} if x {\displaystyle x} is contained in an open subset of X {\displaystyle X} that is completely contained in S .

{\displaystyle S.} (Equivalently, x {\displaystyle x} is an interior point of S {\displaystyle S} if S {\displaystyle S} is a neighbourhood of x .

{\displaystyle x.} ) Interior of a set [ edit ] The interior of a subset S {\displaystyle S} of a topological space X , {\displaystyle X,} denoted by int X ⁡ ⁡ S {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} _{X}S} or int ⁡ ⁡ S {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S} or S ∘ ∘ , {\displaystyle S^{\circ },} can be defined in any of the following equivalent ways: int ⁡ ⁡ S {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S} is the largest open subset of X {\displaystyle X} contained in S .

{\displaystyle S.} int ⁡ ⁡ S {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S} is the union of all open sets of X {\displaystyle X} contained in S .

{\displaystyle S.} int ⁡ ⁡ S {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S} is the set of all interior points of S .

{\displaystyle S.} If the space X {\displaystyle X} is understood from context then the shorter notation int ⁡ ⁡ S {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S} is usually preferred to int X ⁡ ⁡ S .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} _{X}S.} Examples [ edit ] a {\displaystyle a} is an interior point of M {\displaystyle M} because there is an ε-neighbourhood of a {\displaystyle a} which is a subset of M .

{\displaystyle M.} In any space, the interior of the empty set is the empty set.

In any space X , {\displaystyle X,} if S ⊆ ⊆ X , {\displaystyle S\subseteq X,} then int ⁡ ⁡ S ⊆ ⊆ S .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S\subseteq S.} If X {\displaystyle X} is the real line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } (with the standard topology), then int ⁡ ⁡ ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) = ( 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} ([0,1])=(0,1)} whereas the interior of the set Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } of rational numbers is empty: int ⁡ ⁡ Q = ∅ ∅ .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} \mathbb {Q} =\varnothing .} If X {\displaystyle X} is the complex plane C , {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ,} then int ⁡ ⁡ ( { z ∈ ∈ C : | z | ≤ ≤ 1 } ) = { z ∈ ∈ C : | z | < 1 } .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} (\{z\in \mathbb {C} :|z|\leq 1\})=\{z\in \mathbb {C} :|z|<1\}.} In any Euclidean space , the interior of any finite set is the empty set.

On the set of real numbers , one can put other topologies rather than the standard one: If X {\displaystyle X} is the real numbers R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } with the lower limit topology , then int ⁡ ⁡ ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) = [ 0 , 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} ([0,1])=[0,1).} If one considers on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } the topology in which every set is open , then int ⁡ ⁡ ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) = [ 0 , 1 ] .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} ([0,1])=[0,1].} If one considers on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } the topology in which the only open sets are the empty set and R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } itself, then int ⁡ ⁡ ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} ([0,1])} is the empty set.

These examples show that the interior of a set depends upon the topology of the underlying space.
The last two examples are special cases of the following.

In any discrete space , since every set is open, every set is equal to its interior.

In any indiscrete space X , {\displaystyle X,} since the only open sets are the empty set and X {\displaystyle X} itself, int ⁡ ⁡ X = X {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} X=X} and for every proper subset S {\displaystyle S} of X , {\displaystyle X,} int ⁡ ⁡ S {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S} is the empty set.

Properties [ edit ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be a topological space and let S {\displaystyle S} and T {\displaystyle T} be subsets of X .

{\displaystyle X.} int ⁡ ⁡ S {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S} is open in X .

{\displaystyle X.} If T {\displaystyle T} is open in X {\displaystyle X} then T ⊆ ⊆ S {\displaystyle T\subseteq S} if and only if T ⊆ ⊆ int ⁡ ⁡ S .

{\displaystyle T\subseteq \operatorname {int} S.} int ⁡ ⁡ S {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S} is an open subset of S {\displaystyle S} when S {\displaystyle S} is given the subspace topology .

S {\displaystyle S} is an open subset of X {\displaystyle X} if and only if int ⁡ ⁡ S = S .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S=S.} Intensive : int ⁡ ⁡ S ⊆ ⊆ S .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S\subseteq S.} Idempotence : int ⁡ ⁡ ( int ⁡ ⁡ S ) = int ⁡ ⁡ S .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} (\operatorname {int} S)=\operatorname {int} S.} Preserves / distributes over binary intersection : int ⁡ ⁡ ( S ∩ ∩ T ) = ( int ⁡ ⁡ S ) ∩ ∩ ( int ⁡ ⁡ T ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} (S\cap T)=(\operatorname {int} S)\cap (\operatorname {int} T).} However, the interior operator does not distribute over unions since only int ⁡ ⁡ ( S ∪ ∪ T ) ⊇ ⊇ ( int ⁡ ⁡ S ) ∪ ∪ ( int ⁡ ⁡ T ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} (S\cup T)~\supseteq ~(\operatorname {int} S)\cup (\operatorname {int} T)} is guaranteed in general and equality might not hold.

[ note 1 ] For example, if X = R , S = ( − − ∞ ∞ , 0 ] , {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {R} ,S=(-\infty ,0],} and T = ( 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle T=(0,\infty )} then ( int ⁡ ⁡ S ) ∪ ∪ ( int ⁡ ⁡ T ) = ( − − ∞ ∞ , 0 ) ∪ ∪ ( 0 , ∞ ∞ ) = R ∖ ∖ { 0 } {\displaystyle (\operatorname {int} S)\cup (\operatorname {int} T)=(-\infty ,0)\cup (0,\infty )=\mathbb {R} \setminus \{0\}} is a proper subset of int ⁡ ⁡ ( S ∪ ∪ T ) = int ⁡ ⁡ R = R .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} (S\cup T)=\operatorname {int} \mathbb {R} =\mathbb {R} .} Monotone / nondecreasing with respect to ⊆ ⊆ {\displaystyle \subseteq } : If S ⊆ ⊆ T {\displaystyle S\subseteq T} then int ⁡ ⁡ S ⊆ ⊆ int ⁡ ⁡ T .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S\subseteq \operatorname {int} T.} Other properties include: If S {\displaystyle S} is closed in X {\displaystyle X} and int ⁡ ⁡ T = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} T=\varnothing } then int ⁡ ⁡ ( S ∪ ∪ T ) = int ⁡ ⁡ S .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} (S\cup T)=\operatorname {int} S.} Relationship with closure The above statements will remain true if all instances of the symbols/words "interior", "int", "open", "subset", and "largest" are respectively replaced by " closure ", "cl", "closed", "superset", and "smallest" and the following symbols are swapped: " ⊆ ⊆ {\displaystyle \subseteq } " swapped with " ⊇ ⊇ {\displaystyle \supseteq } " " ∪ ∪ {\displaystyle \cup } " swapped with " ∩ ∩ {\displaystyle \cap } " For more details on this matter, see interior operator below or the article Kuratowski closure axioms .

Interior operator [ edit ] The interior operator int X {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} _{X}} is dual to the closure operator, which is denoted by cl X {\displaystyle \operatorname {cl} _{X}} or by an overline — , in the sense that int X ⁡ ⁡ S = X ∖ ∖ ( X ∖ ∖ S ) ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} _{X}S=X\setminus {\overline {(X\setminus S)}}} and also S ¯ ¯ = X ∖ ∖ int X ⁡ ⁡ ( X ∖ ∖ S ) , {\displaystyle {\overline {S}}=X\setminus \operatorname {int} _{X}(X\setminus S),} where X {\displaystyle X} is the topological space containing S , {\displaystyle S,} and the backslash ∖ ∖ {\displaystyle \,\setminus \,} denotes set-theoretic difference .
Therefore, the abstract theory of closure operators and the Kuratowski closure axioms can be readily translated into the language of interior operators, by replacing sets with their complements in X .

{\displaystyle X.} In general, the interior operator does not commute with unions. However, in a complete metric space the following result does hold: Theorem [ 1 ] (C. Ursescu) — Let S 1 , S 2 , … … {\displaystyle S_{1},S_{2},\ldots } be a sequence of subsets of a complete metric space X .

{\displaystyle X.} If each S i {\displaystyle S_{i}} is closed in X {\displaystyle X} then cl X ( ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ N int X ⁡ ⁡ S i ) = cl X ⁡ ⁡ int X ( ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ N S i ) .

{\displaystyle {\operatorname {cl} _{X}}{\biggl (}\bigcup _{i\in \mathbb {N} }\operatorname {int} _{X}S_{i}{\biggr )}={\operatorname {cl} _{X}\operatorname {int} _{X}}{\biggl (}\bigcup _{i\in \mathbb {N} }S_{i}{\biggr )}.} If each S i {\displaystyle S_{i}} is open in X {\displaystyle X} then int X ( ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ N cl X ⁡ ⁡ S i ) = int X ⁡ ⁡ cl X ( ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ N S i ) .

{\displaystyle {\operatorname {int} _{X}}{\biggl (}\bigcap _{i\in \mathbb {N} }\operatorname {cl} _{X}S_{i}{\biggr )}={\operatorname {int} _{X}\operatorname {cl} _{X}}{\biggl (}\bigcap _{i\in \mathbb {N} }S_{i}{\biggr )}.} The result above implies that every complete metric space is a Baire space .

Exterior of a set [ edit ] The exterior of a subset S {\displaystyle S} of a topological space X , {\displaystyle X,} denoted by ext X ⁡ ⁡ S {\displaystyle \operatorname {ext} _{X}S} or simply ext ⁡ ⁡ S , {\displaystyle \operatorname {ext} S,} is the largest open set disjoint from S , {\displaystyle S,} namely, it is the union of all open sets in X {\displaystyle X} that are disjoint from S .

{\displaystyle S.} The exterior is the interior of the complement, which is the same as the complement of the closure; [ 2 ] in formulas, ext ⁡ ⁡ S = int ⁡ ⁡ ( X ∖ ∖ S ) = X ∖ ∖ S ¯ ¯ .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {ext} S=\operatorname {int} (X\setminus S)=X\setminus {\overline {S}}.} Similarly, the interior is the exterior of the complement: int ⁡ ⁡ S = ext ⁡ ⁡ ( X ∖ ∖ S ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S=\operatorname {ext} (X\setminus S).} The interior, boundary , and exterior of a set S {\displaystyle S} together partition the whole space into three blocks (or fewer when one or more of these is empty): X = int ⁡ ⁡ S ∪ ∪ ∂ ∂ S ∪ ∪ ext ⁡ ⁡ S , {\displaystyle X=\operatorname {int} S\cup \partial S\cup \operatorname {ext} S,} where ∂ ∂ S {\displaystyle \partial S} denotes the boundary of S .

{\displaystyle S.} [ 3 ] The interior and exterior are always open , while the boundary is closed .

Some of the properties of the exterior operator are unlike those of the interior operator: The exterior operator reverses inclusions; if S ⊆ ⊆ T , {\displaystyle S\subseteq T,} then ext ⁡ ⁡ T ⊆ ⊆ ext ⁡ ⁡ S .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {ext} T\subseteq \operatorname {ext} S.} The exterior operator is not idempotent .  It does have the property that int ⁡ ⁡ S ⊆ ⊆ ext ⁡ ⁡ ( ext ⁡ ⁡ S ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S\subseteq \operatorname {ext} \left(\operatorname {ext} S\right).} Interior-disjoint shapes [ edit ] The red shapes are not interior-disjoint with the blue Triangle. The green and the yellow shapes are interior-disjoint with the blue Triangle, but only the yellow shape is entirely disjoint from the blue Triangle.

Two shapes a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are called interior-disjoint if the intersection of their interiors is empty.
Interior-disjoint shapes may or may not intersect in their boundary.

^ The analogous identity for the closure operator is cl ⁡ ⁡ ( S ∪ ∪ T ) = ( cl ⁡ ⁡ S ) ∪ ∪ ( cl ⁡ ⁡ T ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {cl} (S\cup T)=(\operatorname {cl} S)\cup (\operatorname {cl} T).} These identities may be remembered with the following mnemonic. Just as the intersection ∩ ∩ {\displaystyle \cap } of two open sets is open, so too does the interior operator distribute over intersections ∩ ∩ ; {\displaystyle \cap ;} explicitly: int ⁡ ⁡ ( S ∩ ∩ T ) = ( int ⁡ ⁡ S ) ∩ ∩ ( int ⁡ ⁡ T ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {int} (S\cap T)=(\operatorname {int} S)\cap (\operatorname {int} T).} And similarly, just as the union ∪ ∪ {\displaystyle \cup } of two closed sets is closed, so too does the closure operator distribute over unions ∪ ∪ ; {\displaystyle \cup ;} explicitly: cl ⁡ ⁡ ( S ∪ ∪ T ) = ( cl ⁡ ⁡ S ) ∪ ∪ ( cl ⁡ ⁡ T ) .
