The organism is not easily defined as an animal or non-animal.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The organism is notable due to the study of related embryonic fossils (measuring about a half-millimeter in diameter) [ 1 ] which display different stages of its development: from early single-cell stages to later multicellular stages.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Such fossil studies present the earliest evidence of an essential step in animal evolution – the ability to develop distinct tissue layers and organs.

[ 1 ] According to researchers, fossil studies of Caveasphaera have suggested that animal-like embryonic development arose much earlier than the oldest clearly defined animal fossils [ 1 ] and may be consistent with studies suggesting that animal evolution may have begun about 750 million years ago.

[ 2 ] [ 6 ] Nonetheless, Caveasphaera fossils may look similar to starfish and coral embryos.

[ 1 ] Still, researchers have concluded, "Parental investment in the embryonic development of Caveasphaera and co-occurring Tianzhushania and Spiralicellula , as well as delayed onset of later development, may reflect an adaptation to the heterogeneous nature of the early Ediacaran nearshore marine environments in which early animals evolved."
