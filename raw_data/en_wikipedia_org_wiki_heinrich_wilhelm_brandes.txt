Brandes was born in 1777 in Groden near Ritzebüttel (a former exclave of the Free Imperial City of Hamburg , today in Cuxhaven ), the third son of Albert Georg Brandes, a preacher. He studied at the University of Göttingen (then in the Electorate of Hanover ) from 1796 to 1798 under Abraham Gotthelf Kästner and Georg Christoph Lichtenberg .

Carl Friedrich Gauss was a fellow student. He attained his doctorate in 1800, and spent a short time teaching privately. As an astronomer, he was noted for demonstrating that meteors occur in the upper atmosphere and thus not really a meteorological phenomenon.

[ 1 ] From 1801 to 1811 he was at first a technical designer of dykes on the Weser river at Eckwarden , Butjadingen , in the Duchy of Oldenburg , and later a dyke inspector for the lower right bank of the Weser.

In 1811 he became a professor of mathematics at the newly created University of Breslau , a merger of two Wrocław colleges. In 1826 he gained the chair of physics at the University of Leipzig .

He had a very wide range of activities. He wrote a considerable number of mathematics textbooks. In 1820 he published the first weather charts in Beiträgen zur Witterungskunde ("Contributions to Meteorology"). Thus he is considered to be a founder of synoptic meteorology . In 1824 he developed a new method to compute the Euler constant numerically. He died on 17 May 1834 in Leipzig and was buried in the Alter Johannisfriedhof .
