In the compound eye of invertebrates such as insects and crustaceans , the pseudopupil appears as a dark spot which moves across the eye as the animal is rotated.

[ 1 ] This occurs because the ommatidia that one observes "head-on" (along their optical axes ) absorb the incident light , while those to one side reflect it.

[ 2 ] The pseudopupil therefore reveals which ommatidia are aligned with the axis along which the observer is viewing.

[ 2 ] Pseudopupil analysis technique [ edit ] The pseudopupil analysis technique is used to study neurodegeneration in insects like Drosophila , where specimens are genetically engineered with transgenes to model neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's chorea . An adult Drosophila eye consists of nearly 800 unit ommatidia which are repeated in a symmetrical pattern. Each ommatidium contains 8 photoreceptor cells, each of which forms a rhabdomere (rhabdomeres 7 and 8 overlap vertically; therefore, only rhabdomere 7 is visible externally). Neurodegeneration leads to loss or degradation of photoreceptors.

[ 3 ] By visualizing and counting the intact rhabdomeres, degradation level can be measured. Thus, analyzing the pseudopupil can permit empirical study of neurodegeneration.
