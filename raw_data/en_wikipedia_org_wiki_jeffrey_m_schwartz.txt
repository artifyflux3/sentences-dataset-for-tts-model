Schwartz Occupation(s) Psychiatrist Neuroscientist Academic work Institutions UCLA School of Medicine Main interests Obsessive-compulsive disorder Neuroplasticity Intelligent design Website https://jeffreymschwartz.com/ Jeffrey M. Schwartz is an American psychiatrist, neuroscientist, and researcher in the field of neuroplasticity and its application to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He is a proponent of mind–body dualism and intelligent design .

[ 3 ] Work with OCD [ edit ] Brain lock [ edit ] Brain lock is a term coined by Schwartz to describe obsessive-compulsive behavior. His 1997 book Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior outlines the disorder and its treatment.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] In the book Schwartz claims that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a result of a bio-chemical imbalance that "locks" brain functions into an obsessive-compulsive pattern and that OCD can be self-treated by following four steps: [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Relabel the obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges as obsessions and compulsions, not as real thoughts.

Reattribute the obsessive thoughts to a brain malfunction called OCD.

Refocus on a wholesome, productive activity for at least fifteen minutes.

Revalue the entire obsession and compulsion group as having no useful meaning in your life As consultant [ edit ] Schwartz served as consultant for the 2004 biographical film The Aviator , which depicts engineer and philanthropist Howard Hughes ' struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Schwartz advised actor Leonardo DiCaprio and director Martin Scorsese on their portrayal of OCD.

[ 8 ] Views [ edit ] Schwartz is a proponent of intelligent design , stating, "You can't get the intelligence out of nature. Intelligence is an intrinsic part of nature." [ 3 ] In 2001, he signed the statement " A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism ", [ 9 ] which expressed skepticism about the ability of random mutations and natural selection to account for the complexity of life, and encourages careful examination of the evidence for " Darwinism ", a term intelligent design proponents use to refer to evolution.

[ 10 ] He appeared in the controversial 2008 film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed .

[ 11 ] Schwartz is an advocate for mind-body dualism , arguing that consciousness exists entirely separately from the brain. He provided neuroplasticity from therapy as evidence that "the mind can exert control over the brain, which [he believes] challenges the material concept of the mind".

[ 3 ] He also theorized that in sports, when an athlete focuses, they are "making a connection with something deep within nature itself, which lends itself to deepening our intelligence." [ 12 ] Other scientists have been critical of Schwartz's ideas. The Templeton Foundation rejected a grant proposed by him; the foundation's senior vice president, Charles L. Harper Jr., stated that the proposal "had to do with a lot of hocus-pocus on quantum mechanics ".
