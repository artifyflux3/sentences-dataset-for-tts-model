[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Plot [ edit ] Astronomer Galileo Galilei teaches at the University of Padua . While he questions the ideas of Ptolemy and Aristotle , the official scientific dogmas imposed by the Catholic Church , he remains secretive about his doubts. His more candid friend, philosopher Giordano Bruno , is reported to the Inquisition for his revolutionary ideas and later executed as a heretic. Still, Galileo continues his studies with a telescope constructed by Dutch technicians and perfected by him, and comes to the conclusion that Copernico 's heliocentric system is valid. He publishes his discoveries in a book, which leads to a series of interrogations by the Inquisition. Facing a possible death sentence, Galileo publicly recants his theories.
