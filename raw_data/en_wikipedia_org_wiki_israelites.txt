Map of the territorial allotment of the Twelve Tribes of Israel before Dan moved next to Naphtali due to conflict with the Philistines , based on the Book of Joshua The Israelites , also known as the Children of Israel , [ a ] were an ancient Semitic-speaking people who inhabited Canaan during the Iron Age .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] They originated as the Hebrews and spoke an archaic variety of the Hebrew language that is commonly called Biblical Hebrew by association with the Hebrew Bible .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Their community consisted of the Twelve Tribes of Israel and was concentrated in Israel and Judah , which were two adjoined kingdoms whose capital cities were Samaria and Jerusalem , respectively.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 6 ] The Israelite religion revolved around Yahweh , who was an ancient Semitic god with lesser significance in the broader Canaanite religion .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Around 720 BCE, the Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire , triggering the Assyrian captivity ; and around 586 BCE, the Kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire , triggering the Babylonian captivity .

[ 9 ] While most of Israel's population was irreversibly dispossessed as a result of Assyrian resettlement policy , Judah's population was rehabilitated by the Achaemenid Empire following the fall of Babylon in 539 BCE.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] According to the Hebrew Bible, the Israelites were the descendants of Jacob (later known as Israel ), who was a son of Isaac and thereby a grandson of Abraham . Due to a severe drought in Canaan, Jacob and his twelve sons migrated to Egypt , where each son became the progenitor and namesake of an Israelite tribe. These tribes came to constitute a distinct nation, which was enslaved by " the Pharaoh " before being led out of Egypt by the Hebrew prophet Moses , whose successor Joshua oversaw the Israelite conquest of Canaan . After taking control of Canaan, they established a kritarchy and eventually founded the United Monarchy , which split into independent Israel in the north and independent Judah in the south. Scholars generally consider the Hebrew Bible's narrative to be part of the Israelites' national myth , [ 16 ] but believe that there is a "historical core" to some of the events in it.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] The historicity of the United Monarchy is widely disputed.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] In the context of Hebrew scripture, Canaan is also variously described as the Promised Land , the Land of Israel , Zion , or the Holy Land .

Historically, Jews and Samaritans have been two closely related ethno-religious groups descended from the Israelites; Jews trace their ancestry to the tribes that inhabited the Kingdom of Judah, namely Judah , Benjamin , and partially Levi , while Samaritans trace their ancestry to the tribes that inhabited the Kingdom of Israel and remained after the Assyrian captivity, namely Ephraim , Manasseh , and partially Levi. Furthermore, Judaism and Samaritanism are fundamentally rooted in Israelite religious and cultural traditions.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] There are several other groups claiming affiliation with the Israelites , but most of them have unproven lineage and are not recognized as either Jewish or Samaritan.

1209 BCE . The inscription is very brief and says: "Israel is laid waste and his seed is not". The inscription refers to a people , not an individual or nation state , [ 27 ] who inhabit central Palestine [ 28 ] or the highlands of Samaria .

[ 29 ] Some Egyptologists suggest that Israel appeared in earlier topographical reliefs, dating to the Eighteenth Dynasty or Nineteenth Dynasty (i.e. reign of Ramesses II ) , [ 30 ] but this reading remains controversial.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] In the Hebrew Bible, Israel first appears in Genesis 32:29 , where an angel renames Jacob to Israel after Jacob fought with him .

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] According to the folk etymology given in the text, Israel is derived from yisra , "to prevail over" or "to struggle with", and El , a Canaanite- Mesopotamian creator god that is tenuously identified with Yahweh.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] However, modern scholarship interprets El as the subject, "El rules/struggles", [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] from sarar ( שָׂרַר ) 'to rule' [ 41 ] (cognate with sar ( שַׂר ) 'ruler', [ 42 ] Akkadian šarru 'ruler, king' [ 43 ] ), which is likely cognate with the similar root sara ( שׂרה ) "fought, strove, contended".

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] Dr. Tzemah Yoreh clarifies that Israel is a combination of 'to strive with' (ש.ר.ה) and 'God' (אל) and that Jacob's name alternates between Jacob and Israel in the biblical narrative, even after his renaming, due to the authors having different opinions about Jacob's moral character.

[ 46 ] Biblical timeline Mid-20th century mosaic of the 12 Tribes of Israel, from the Etz Yosef synagogue wall in Givat Mordechai , Jerusalem Genesis of the Israelite people Biblically, the Israelites referred to the direct descendants of Israel, [ 47 ] [ 48 ] a view that was reinforced by Second Temple Judaism .

[ 48 ] They referred to themselves as the sons of Israel .

[ 49 ] , gentiles (i.e.

resident aliens ) could fully assimilate into the Israelite community.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] Some scholars interpret sons of Israel as citizens of the Israelite community, especially after Israel's biological family transitioned from a clan to a society ( Exodus 1:9 ).

[ 49 ] In fact, there is evidence of gentiles (i.e.

resident aliens ) assimilating into the Israelite community.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] Whilst the Israelites called themselves the sons of Jacob , some scholars interpret this as citizens of the Israelite community, especially after Israel's biological family transitioned from a clan to a society ( Exodus 1:9 ). Contemporary ethnicities in the ancient Near East similarly named themselves this way.

[ 49 ] Likewise, tribal membership in Israel was likely based on one's self-declared allegiance or residency within an assigned tribal territory ( Ezekiel 47:21–23 ).

[ 48 ] [ 13 ] [ 50 ] Alternatively, the Israelites were a religious group that adhered to Yahwism [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] and that their ethnic identity was based on 'covenantal circumcision' rather than ancestry ( Genesis 17:9–14 ).

[ 54 ] The Israelites trace their ancestors to Jacob, who in turn descended from Abraham.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] Abraham was formerly a native of Ur Kaśdim ( Genesis 11:31 ), whose location is hotly contested. Some scholars argue that it is located in lower Mesopotamia [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] whilst others locate it further north in upper Mesopotamia , [ 59 ] around northern Syria [ 60 ] [ 61 ] or southeastern Turkey .

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Theologians suggest that Canaan always belonged to the Israelites but was initially usurped by the descendants of Canaan , resulting in their conquest by Israel as divine punishment .

[ 64 ] Israelite presence in Canaan was also established before Joshua's conquests according to a few biblical traditions.

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] The history of the Israelite people can be divided into these categories, according to the Hebrew Bible : [ 67 ] Before the United Monarchy The Israelites were named after their ancestor, Jacob /Israel, who was the grandson of Abraham . They were organized into 12 tribes: Reuben , Simeon , Levi , Judah , Dan , Naphtali , Gad , Asher , Issachar , Zebulun , Joseph (or Tribe of Ephraim and Tribe of Manasseh ) and Benjamin . Originally, they went to Egypt after a famine in Canaan but were enslaved by the Egyptians.

[ 68 ] They escaped and organized themselves as a kritarchy , [ 69 ] where they followed laws given by Moses. Afterwards, the Israelites conquered Canaan and fought with several neighbours until they established a monarchic state.

This period is covered by Genesis 12 to 1 Samuel 8 .

During the United Monarchy As a monarchic state, the Israelite tribes were united by the leadership of Saul , David and Solomon . The reigns of Saul and David were marked by military victories and Israel's transition to a mini-empire with vassal states .

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] Solomon's reign was relatively more peaceful and oversaw the construction of the First Temple , [ 72 ] with the help of Phoenician allies.

[ 73 ] This Temple was where the Ark of the Covenant was stored; its former location was the City of David .

[ 74 ] This period is covered by 1 Samuel 8 to 1 Kings 11 or alternatively, 1 Chronicles 10 to 2 Chronicles 9 .

Division of Israel and Judah Map of the Holy Land , Pietro Vesconte , 1321, showing the allotments of the tribes of Israel. Described by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld as "the first non- Ptolemaic map of a definite country" [ 75 ] The monarchic state was divided into two states, Israel and Judah , due to civil and religious disputes. Eventually, Israel and Judah met their demise after the Assyrian and Babylonian invasions respectively. According to the Biblical prophets , these invasions were divine judgements for religious apostasy and corrupt leadership.

This period is covered by 1 Kings 12 to 2 Kings 25 or alternatively, 2 Chronicles 10 to 2 Chronicles 36 . The Book of Jonah narrates the prophet Jonah going to the Neo-Assyrian Empire to deliver a divine message.

Exilic period After the Babylonians invaded Judah, they deported most of its citizens to Babylon, where they lived as "exiles".

Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon and established the First Persian Empire in 539 BCE.

[ 76 ] One year later, according to traditional dating, Cyrus permitted the Judahites to return to their homeland.

[ 76 ] This homeland was re-named as the Province of Yehud , which eventually became a satrapy of Eber-Nari .

[ 76 ] This period is covered by the entirety of the Book of Daniel .

Persian period In 537–520 BCE, Zerubbabel became Yehud's governor and started work on the Second Temple , which was stopped.

[ 77 ] In 520–516 BCE, Haggai and Zechariah goaded the Judahites to resume work on the Temple. Upon completion, Joshua became its high priest.

[ 77 ] [ 77 ] In 458–433 BCE, Ezra and Nehemiah led another group of Judahites to Yehud, with Artaxerxes 's permission. Nehemiah rebuilt the temple after some unspecified disaster and removed foreign influence from the Judahite community.

[ 78 ] [ 79 ] That said, some Judahites elected to stay in Persia, where they almost faced annihilation .

[ 80 ] [ 81 ] This period is covered by the entirety of the Book of Ezra , Book of Nehemiah , the Book of Esther , [ 67 ] the Book of Haggai , the Book of Zechariah , and the Book of Malachi .

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] Model of the Tabernacle constructed under the auspices of Moses , in Timna Park , Israel Historical timeline See also: History of ancient Israel and Judah , History of Israel , and History of Palestine Emergence of the Israelite culture Efforts to confirm the biblical ethnogenesis of Israel through archaeology have largely been abandoned as unproductive.

[ 16 ] Many scholars see the traditional narratives as national myths with little historical value, but some posit that a small group of exiled Egyptians contributed to the Exodus narrative.

[ b ] William G. Dever cautiously identifies this group with the Tribe of Joseph , while Richard Elliott Friedman identifies it with the Tribe of Levi .

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] Josephus quoting Manetho identifies them with the Hyksos .

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] Other scholars believe that the Exodus narrative was a " collective memory " of several events from the Bronze Age.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] In addition, it is unlikely that the Israelites overtook the southern Levant by force, according to archaeological evidence. Instead, they branched out of indigenous Canaanite peoples that long inhabited the region, which included Syria, ancient Israel , and the Transjordan region .

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Their culture was monolatristic , with a primary focus on Yahweh (or El) worship, [ 37 ] but after the Babylonian exile, it became monotheistic , with partial influence from Zoroastrianism . The latter decisively separated the Israelites from other Canaanites.

[ 89 ] [ 10 ] [ failed verification ] The Israelites used the Canaanite script and communicated in a Canaanite language known as Biblical Hebrew . The language's modern descendant is today the only surviving dialect of the Canaanite languages .

[ 92 ] [ 93 ] Genetic studies show that contemporary ethnicities in the Levant were, like Israel, distinguished by their unique cultures, due to their descent from a common ancestral stock.

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] Ramesses III prisoner tiles depicting precursors of the Israelites in Canaan: Canaanites from city-states and a Shasu leader.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Several theories exist for the origins of historical Israelites. Some believe they descend from raiding groups, itinerant nomads such as Habiru and Shasu or impoverished Canaanites, who were forced to leave wealthy urban areas and live in the highlands.

[ 99 ] [ 28 ] Gary Rendsburg argues that some archaic biblical traditions and other circumstantial evidence point to the Israelites emerging from the Shasu and other seminomadic peoples from the desert regions south of the Levant , later settling in the highlands of Canaan.

[ 100 ] The prevailing academic opinion is that the Israelites were a mixture of peoples predominately indigenous to Canaan, with additional input from an Egyptian matrix of peoples, which most likely inspired the Exodus narrative.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Israel's demographics were similar to the demographics of Ammon , Edom , Moab and Phoenicia .

[ 102 ] [ 104 ] [ page needed ] Besides their focus on Yahweh worship, Israelite cultural markers were defined by body, food, and time, including male circumcision , avoidance of pork consumption and marking time based on the Exodus, the reigns of Israelite kings , and Sabbath observance . The first two markers were observed by neighbouring west Semites besides the Philistines , who were of Mycenaean Greek origin. As a result, intermarriage with other Semites was common.

[ 13 ] But what distinguished Israelite circumcision from non-Israelite circumcision was its emphasis on 'correct' timing.

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] Israelite circumcision also served as a mnemonic sign for the circumcised, where their 'unnatural' erect circumcised penis would remind them to behave differently in sexual matters.

[ 105 ] Yom-Tov Lipmann-Muhlhausen suggests that Israelite identity was based on faith and adherence to sex-appropriate commandments. For men, it was circumcision.  For women, it was ritual sacrifice after childbirth ( Leviticus 12:6 ).

[ 107 ] The Mount Ebal structure , seen by many archaeologists as an early Israelite cultic site Genealogy was another ethnic marker. While it was likely that Israelite identity was not exclusively based on blood descent , [ 48 ] [ 13 ] [ 50 ] the Israelites used genealogy to engage in narcissism of small differences but also, self-criticism since their ancestors included morally questionable characters such as Jacob. Both these traits represented the "complexities of the Jewish soul".

[ 13 ] Names were significant in Israelite culture and indicated one's destiny and inherent character. Thus, a name change indicated a 'divine transformation' in one's 'destines, characters and natures'. These beliefs aligned with the Near Eastern cultural milieu, where names were 'intimately bound up with the very essence of being and inextricably intertwined with personality'.

[ 106 ] In terms of appearance, rabbis described the Biblical Jews as being "midway between black and white" and having the "color of the boxwood tree".

[ 108 ] Assuming Yurco 's debated claim that the Israelites are depicted in reliefs from Merneptah 's temple at Karnak is correct, [ 109 ] the early Israelites may have wore the same attire and hairstyles as non-Israelite Canaanites.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] Dissenting from this, Anson Rainey argued that the Israelites in the reliefs looked more similar to the Shasu.

[ 112 ] Based on biblical literature, it is implied that the Israelites distinguished themselves from peoples like the Babylonians and Egyptians by not having long beards and chin tufts. However, these fashion practices were upper class customs.

[ 113 ] Early highland settlements in Canaan Further information: Israelite highland settlement In the 12th century BCE, many Israelite settlements appeared in the central hill country of Canaan, which was formerly an open terrain. These settlements lacked evidence of pork consumption, compared to Philistine settlements, had four-room houses and lived by an egalitarian ethos , which was exemplified by the absence of elaborate tombs, governor's mansions, certain houses being bigger than others etc. They followed a mixed economy , which prioritized self-sufficiency , cultivation of crops , animal husbandry and small-scale craft production . New technologies such as terraced farming , silos for grain storage and cisterns for rainwater collection were simultaneously introduced.

[ 114 ] These settlements were built by inhabitants of the "general Southland" (i.e. modern Sinai and the southern parts of Israel and Jordan ), who abandoned their pastoral-nomadic ways. Canaanites who lived outside the central hill country were tenuously identified as Danites, Asherites, Zebulunites, Issacharites, Naphtalites and Gadites. These inhabitants do not have a significant history of migration besides the Danites, who allegedly originate from the Sea Peoples , particularly the Dan(an)u .

[ 114 ] [ 115 ] Nonetheless, they intermingled with the former nomads, due to socioeconomic and military factors. Their interest in Yahwism and its concern for the underprivileged was another factor. Possible allusions to this historical reality in the Hebrew Bible include the aforementioned tribes, except for Issachar and Zebulun, descending from Bilhah and Zilpah , who were viewed as "secondary additions" to Israel.

[ 114 ] El worship was central to early Israelite culture but currently, the number of El worshippers in Israel is unknown. It is more likely that different Israelite locales held different views about El and had 'small-scale' sacred spaces .

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] Himbaza et al. (2012) states that Israelite households were typically ill-equipped to handle conflicts between family members, which may explain the harsh sexual taboos enforced against acts like incest , homosexuality , polygamy etc. in Leviticus 18–20 . While the death penalty was legislated for these 'secret crimes', they functioned as a warning, where offenders would confess out of fear and make appropriate reparations.

[ 116 ] United Monarchy?

Main article: Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy) Part of the gift-bearing Israelite delegation of King Jehu, Black Obelisk , 841–840 BCE.

[ 117 ] The historicity of the United Monarchy is heavily debated among archaeologists and biblical scholars: biblical maximalists and centrists ( Kenneth Kitchen , William G. Dever , Amihai Mazar , Baruch Halpern and others) argue that the biblical account is more or less accurate, while biblical minimalists ( Israel Finkelstein , Ze'ev Herzog , Thomas L. Thompson and others) argue that Israel and Judah never split from a singular state. The debate has not been resolved, but recent archaeological discoveries by Eilat Mazar and Yosef Garfinkel show some support for the existence of the United Monarchy.

[ 21 ] From 850 BCE onwards, a series of inscriptions mention the " House of David ". They came from Israel's neighbours.

[ 118 ] [ 119 ] Kingdoms of Israel and Judah "To Hezekiah , son of Ahaz , king of Judah " – royal seal found at the Ophel excavations in Jerusalem Main articles: Kingdom of Israel (Samaria) , Kingdom of Judah , and Expulsions and exoduses of Jews Compared to the United Monarchy, the historicity of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah is widely accepted by historians and archaeologists.

[ 120 ] : 169–195 [ 121 ] Their destruction by the Assyrians and Babylonians respectively is also confirmed by archaeological evidence and extrabiblical sources.

[ 8 ] [ 122 ] [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 120 ] : 306 Christian Frevel argues that Yahwism was rooted in the culture of the Kingdom of Israel, who introduced it to the Kingdom of Judah via Ahab 's expansions and sociopolitical cooperation, which was prompted by Hazael 's conquests.

[ 126 ] Frevel has also argued that Judah was a 'vassal-like' state to Israel, under the Omrides .

[ 126 ] This theory has been rejected by other scholars, who argue that the archaeological evidence seems to indicate that Judah was an independent socio-political entity for most of the 9th century BCE.

[ 127 ] Avraham Faust argues that there was continued adherence to the 'ethos of egalitarianism and simplicity' in the Iron Age II (10th-6th century BCE). For example, there is minimal evidence of temples and complex tomb burials, despite Israel and Judah being more densely populated than the Late Bronze Age. Four-room houses remained the norm. In addition, royal inscriptions were scarce, along with imported and decorated pottery.

[ 128 ] According to William G. Dever , Israelite identity in the 9th-8th centuries BCE can be identified through a combination of archaeological and cultural traits that distinguish them from their neighbours. These traits include being born and living within the territorial borders of Israel or Judah, speaking Hebrew, living in specific house types, using locally produced pottery, and following particular burial practices. Israelites were also part of a rural, kin-based society, and adhered to Yahwism, though not necessarily in a monotheistic way. Their material culture was simple but distinct, and their societal organization was centered around family and inheritance. These traits, while shared with some neighbouring peoples, were uniquely Israelite in their specific combination.

[ 129 ] Wars with Assyria and Babylonia The Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire around 720 BCE .

[ 130 ] The records of Sargon II of Assyria indicate that he deported part of the population to Assyria. Some Israelites migrated to the southern kingdom of Judah, [ 131 ] while those that remained in Samaria, concentrated mainly around Mount Gerizim , developed a new ethnic identity as Samaritans .

[ 132 ] [ 133 ] Foreign groups were also settled by the Assyrians in the territories of the conquered kingdom.

[ 133 ] Research indicates that only a portion of the surviving Israelite population intermarried with Mesopotamians settlers.

[ 134 ] [ 135 ] In their native Samaritan Hebrew , the Samaritans identify as "Israel", "B'nai Israel" or "Shamerim/Shomerim" (i.e. "Guardians/Keepers/Watchers").

[ 136 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] Despite this, belief in the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel emerged because of the heavy assimilation faced by Samarian deportees.

[ 140 ] Towards the end of the same century, the Neo-Babylonian Empire emerged victorious over the Assyrians, leading to Judah's subjugation as a vassal state . In the early 6th century BC, a series of revolts in Judah prompted the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II to lay siege to and destroy Jerusalem along with the First Temple , marking the kingdom's demise. Subsequently, a segment of the Judahite populace was exiled to Babylon in several waves.

[ 141 ] Judeans were progenitors of the Jews, [ 142 ] who practised Second Temple Judaism during the Second Temple period .

[ 143 ] [ 144 ] Persian period Main articles: Jewish History , Samaritans § History , and Ten Lost Tribes With the fall of Babylon to the rising Achaemenid Persian Empire , king Cyrus the Great issued a proclamation known as the Edict of Cyrus , encouraging the exiles to return to their homeland after the Persians raised it as an autonomous Jewish-governed province named Yehud . Under the Persians ( c.

539–332 BCE ), the returned Jewish population restored the city and rebuilt the Temple in Jerusalem. The Cyrus Cylinder is controversially cited as evidence for Cyrus allowing the Judeans to return.

[ 145 ] [ 146 ] The returnees showed a "heightened sense" of their ethnic identity and shunned exogamy , which was treated as a "permissive reality" in Babylon.

[ 147 ] [ 148 ] Circumcision was no longer a significant ethnic marker, with increased emphasis on genealogical descent or faith in Yahweh.

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] Jason A. Staples argues that the majority of contemporary Jews, regardless of theology, wished for the reunion of northern Israelites and southern Jews.

[ 149 ] Hellenistic period In 332 BCE, the Achaemenid Empire fell to Alexander the Great , and the region was later incorporated into the Ptolemaic Kingdom ( c.

301–200 BCE ) and the Seleucid Empire ( c.

200–167 BCE ). The Maccabean Revolt against Seleucid rule ushered in a period of nominal independence for the Jewish people under the Hasmonean dynasty (140–37 BCE). Initially operating semi-autonomously within the Seleucid sphere, the Hasmoneans gradually asserted full independence through military conquest and diplomacy, establishing themselves as the final sovereign Jewish rulers before a prolonged hiatus in Jewish sovereignty in the region.

[ 150 ] [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ] Some scholars argue that Jews also engaged in active missionary efforts in the Greco-Roman world , which led to conversions.

[ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] [ 157 ] Several scholars, such as Scot McKnight and Martin Goodman , reject this view while holding that conversions occasionally occurred.

[ 158 ] A similar diaspora existed for Samaritans but their existence is poorly documented.

[ 159 ] Roman period In 63 BCE, the Roman Republic conquered the kingdom. In 37 BCE, the Romans appointed Herod the Great as king of a vassal Judea . In 6 CE, Judea was fully incorporated into the Roman Empire as the province of Judaea . During this period, the main areas of Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel were Judea, Galilee and Perea , while the Samaritans had their demographic center in Samaria . Growing dissatisfaction with Roman rule and civil disturbances eventually led to the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE), resulting in the destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple, which ended the Second Temple period . This event marked a cataclysmic moment in Jewish history, [ 160 ] prompting a reconfiguration of Jewish identity and practice to ensure continuity. The cessation of Temple worship and disappearance of Temple-based sects [ 161 ] facilitated the rise of Rabbinic Judaism , which stemmed from the Pharisaic school of Second Temple Judaism, emphasizing communal synagogue worship and Torah study , eventually becoming the predominant expression of Judaism.

[ 162 ] [ 160 ] [ 163 ] [ 164 ] Concurrently, Christianity began to diverge from Judaism, evolving into a predominantly Gentile religion.

[ 165 ] Decades later, the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–135 CE) further diminished the Jewish presence in Judea , leading to a geographical shift of Jewish life to Galilee and Babylonia , with smaller communities scattered across the Mediterranean .

Genetic studies and descendants Further information: Genetic history of the Middle East and Canaan § Genetic studies See also: Genetic studies on Jews and Samaritans § Genetic studies A Samaritan elder participates in Passover prayer services held on Mount Gerizim , 1991 As of 2024, only one study has directly examined ancient Israelite genetic material. The analysis examined First Temple -era skeletal remains excavated in Abu Ghosh , and showed one male individual belonging to the J2 Y-DNA haplogroup, a set of closely related DNA sequences thought to have originated in the Caucasus or Eastern Anatolia, as well as the T1a and H87 mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, the former of which has also been detected among Canaanites, and the latter in Basques, Tunisian Arabs, and Iraqis, suggesting a Mediterranean, Near Eastern, or perhaps Arabian origin.

[ 166 ] A 2004 study (by Shen et al.) comparing Samaritans to several Jewish populations (including Ashkenazi Jews , Iraqi Jews , Libyan Jews , Moroccan Jews , and Yemenite Jews ) found that "the principal components analysis suggested a common ancestry of Samaritan and Jewish patrilineages. Most of the former may be traced back to a common ancestor in what is today identified as the paternally inherited Israelite high priesthood ( Cohanim ), with a common ancestor projected to the time of the Assyrian conquest of the kingdom of Israel ." [ 167 ] A 2020 study (by Agranat-Tamr et al.) stated that there was genetic continuity between the Bronze Age and Iron Age southern Levantines, which included the Israelites and Judahites. They could be "modeled as a mixture of local earlier Neolithic populations and populations from the northeastern part of the Near East (e.g.

Zagros Mountains , Caucasians / Armenians and possibly, Hurrians )". Reasons for the continuity include resilience from the Bronze Age collapse , which was mostly true for inland cities such as Tel Megiddo and Tel Abel Beth Maacah . Elsewhere, European -related and East African -related components were added to the population, from a north-south and south-north gradient respectively.

Late Neolithic and Bronze Age Europeans and Somalis were used as representatives.

[ 168 ] Modern Levantine groups with Israelite ancestry Samaritans and ethnic Jews have historically been regarded as being descended from the Israelites.

[ 169 ] [ 170 ] [ 171 ] With regard to the Jewish diaspora , it is held that each Jewish community originates from exiled Israelite settlement in various parts of the world, particularly as a result of the Jewish–Roman wars . It is also argued that some Palestinian people are similarly descended from those Israelites who were not exiled from the region and who consequently converted to Christianity under the Byzantine Empire and then to Islam following the Arab conquest of the Levant , save for those who remained identified as Palestinian Jews , .

[ 172 ] [ 173 ] Non-Levantine groups claiming Israelite ancestry Largely owing to the spread of Christianity and Islam globally, several groups of people outside of the Levant have claimed Israelite ancestry on an ethnic or racial basis, while some Christian groups have claimed spiritual continuity of the Israelite identity on the basis of their religion. These include Pashtuns , [ 174 ] [ 175 ] British Israelists , [ 176 ] Black Hebrew Israelites , [ 177 ] Igbos , [ 178 ] Mormons , [ 179 ] and evangelical Christians who subscribe to covenant theology .

[ 180 ] The phenomenon became especially prevalent after the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, as the country's Law of Return grants citizenship to qualified Jews and to non-Jews who are either married to a Jew or provide sufficient evidence of having Jewish ancestry .

'Children of Israel ' ^ "While there is a consensus among scholars that the Exodus did not take place in the manner described in the Bible, surprisingly most scholars agree that the narrative has a historical core and that some of the highland settlers came, one way or another, from Egypt ..." "Archaeology does not really contribute to the debate over the historicity or even historical background of the Exodus itself, but if there was indeed such a group, it contributed the Exodus story to that of all Israel. While I agree that it is most likely that there was such a group, I must stress that this is based on an overall understanding of the development of collective memory and of the authorship of the texts (and their editorial process). Archaeology, unfortunately, cannot directly contribute (yet?) to the study of this specific group of Israel's ancestors." [ 84 ] References ^ "Israelite" .

^ a b Mark Smith in "The Early History of God: Yahweh and Other Deities of Ancient Israel" states "Despite the long regnant model that the Canaanites and Israelites were people of fundamentally different culture, archaeological data now casts doubt on this view. The material culture of the region exhibits numerous common points between Israelites and Canaanites in the Iron I period (c. 1200–1000 BCE). The record would suggest that the Israelite culture largely overlapped with and derived from Canaanite culture ... In short, Israelite culture was largely Canaanite in nature. Given the information available, one cannot maintain a radical cultural separation between Canaanites and Israelites for the Iron I period." (pp. 6–7). Smith, Mark (2002).

After a century of exhaustive investigation, all respectable archaeologists have given up hope of recovering any context that would make Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob credible 'historical figures' ... archaeological investigation of Moses and the Exodus has similarly been discarded as a fruitless pursuit.

As this essay will show, however, the premonarchic period long ago became a literary description of the mythological roots, the early beginnings of the nation and the way to describe the right of Israel on its land. The archaeological evidence also does not support the existence of a united monarchy under David and Solomon as described in the Bible, so the rubric of 'united monarchy' is best abandoned, although it remains useful for discussing how the Bible views the Israelite past. ... Although the kingdom of Judah is mentioned in some ancient inscriptions, they never suggest that it was part of a unit comprised of Israel and Judah. There are no extrabiblical indications of a united monarchy called 'Israel'.

This tiny community called by the Jews and the Christians, the Samaritans, call themselves Israel or Shomerim, the Keepers (of the Torah, i.e., Tawr?t).

^ "The Samaritan Identity" . The Israelite Samaritan Community in Israel . Retrieved 15 September 2023 .

Our real name is, 'Bene- Yisrael Ha -Shamerem (D'nU- -D'7nU) - in Hebrew , which means 'The Keepers', or to be precise, the Israelite - Keepers, as we observe the ancient Israelite tradition, since the time of our prophet Moses and the people of Israel. The modern terms, 'Samaritans' and 'Jews', given by the Assyrians, indicate the settlement of the Samaritans in the area of Samaria, and the Jews in the area of Judah.

^ "The Keepers: Israelite Samaritan Identity" . Israelite Samaritan Information Institute. 26 May 2020 . Retrieved 15 September 2023 .

We are not Samaritans; this is what the Assyrians called the people of Samaria. We, The Keepers, Sons of Israel, Keepers of the Word of the Torah, never adopted the name Samaritans. Our forefathers only used the name when speaking to outsiders about our community. Through the ages we have referred to ourselves as The Keepers.

The ensuing power struggle left Hyrcanus with a free hand in Judea, and he quickly reasserted Jewish sovereignty... Hyrcanus then engaged in a series of military campaigns aimed at territorial expansion. He first conquered areas in the Transjordan. He then turned his attention to Samaria, which had long separated Judea from the northern Jewish settlements in Lower Galilee. In the south, Adora and Marisa were conquered; (Aristobulus') primary accomplishment was annexing and Judaizing the region of Iturea, located between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains ^ Ben-Sasson, H.H. (1976).

The expansion of Hasmonean Judea took place gradually. Under Jonathan, Judea annexed southern Samaria and began to expand in the direction of the coast plain... The main ethnic changes were the work of John Hyrcanus... it was in his days and those of his son Aristobulus that the annexation of Idumea, Samaria and Galilee and the consolidation of Jewish settlement in Trans-Jordan was completed. Alexander Jannai, continuing the work of his predecessors, expanded Judean rule to the entire coastal plain, from the Carmel to the Egyptian border... and to additional areas in Trans-Jordan, including some of the Greek cities there.

Many historians have chronicled the Hasmonaeans' territorial acquisitions. In sum, it took them twenty-five years to win control of the tiny territory of Judaea and get rid of the Seleucid colony of royalist Jews (with, presumably, gentile officials and garrison) in Jerusalem. [...] However, in the last years before its fall, the Hasmonaeans were already strong enough to acquire, partly by negotiation, partly by conquest, a little territory north and south of Judaea and a corridor on the west to the coast at Jaffa/Joppa. This was briefly taken from them by Antiochus Sidetes, but soon regained, and in the half-century from Sidetes' death in 129 to Alexander Jannaeus' death in 76 they overran most of Palestine and much of western and northern Transjordan. First John Hyrcanus took over the hills of southern and central Palestine (Idumaea and the territories of Shechem, Samaria and Scythopolis) in 128–104; then his son, Aristobulus I, took Galilee in 104–103, and Aristobulus' brother and successor, Jannaeus, in about eighteen years of warfare (103–96, 86–76) conquered and reconquered the coastal plain, the northern Negev, and western edge of Transjordan.

From the beginning of the Second Temple period until the Muslim conquest—the land was part of imperial space. This was true from the early Persian period, as well as the time of Ptolemy and the Seleucids. The only exception was the Hasmonean Kingdom, with its sovereign Jewish rule—first over Judah and later, in Alexander Jannaeus's prime, extending to the coast, the north, and the eastern banks of the Jordan.

Until the modern period, the destruction of the Temple was the most cataclysmic moment in the history of the Jewish people. Without the Temple, the Sadducees no longer had any claim to authority, and they faded away. The sage Yochanan ben Zakkai, with permission from Rome, set up the outpost of Yavneh to continue develop of Pharisaic, or rabbinic, Judaism.

As neither the Byzantines nor the Muslims carried out any large-scale population resettlement projects, the Christians were the offspring of the Jewish and Samaritan farmers who converted to Christianity in the Byzantine period; while the Muslim fellaheen in Palestine in modern times are descendants of those Christians who were the descendants of Jews, and had turned to Islam before the Crusaders' conquest." ^ A tragic misunderstanding – Times online, 13 January 2009.
