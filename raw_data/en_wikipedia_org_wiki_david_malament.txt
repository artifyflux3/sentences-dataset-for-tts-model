Biography [ edit ] Malament attended Stuyvesant High School and received a B.A.

in mathematics 1968 at Columbia College, Columbia University , and Ph.D. in philosophy 1975 at Rockefeller University . After teaching for nearly a quarter-century at the University of Chicago , Malament left to become Distinguished Professor of Logic and Philosophy of Science at the University of California, Irvine , where he is now emeritus.  His book Topics in the Foundations of General Relativity and Newtonian Gravitation Theory (Chicago, 2012) was awarded the 2014 Lakatos Award .

Malament's work focuses the conceptual foundations of the special and general theories of relativity .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Regarding whether simultaneity in special relativity , the Einstein synchronisation is conventional, Malament argues against conventionalism and is regarded by some as having refuted Adolf Grünbaum 's argument for conventionalism.

[ 4 ] Grünbaum, [ 5 ] as well as Sahotra Sarkar and John Stachel , [ 6 ] don't agree, whereas Robert Rynasiewicz sides with Malament.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] During the Vietnam War Malament was a conscientious objector to the draft, spending time in jail for refusing induction into the military.

[ 9 ] He published an article on the subject of selective conscientious objection in an early issue of the journal Philosophy and Public Affairs .
