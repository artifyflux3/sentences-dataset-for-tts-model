**Ḥasan Ibn al-Haytham** ([Latinized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinization_of_names "Latinization of names") as **Alhazen**; ; full name _Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥasan ibn al-Ḥasan ibn al-Haytham_ أبو علي، الحسن بن الحسن بن الهيثم; c. 965– c. 1040) was a medieval [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam "Mathematics in medieval Islam"), [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world "Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world"), and [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world "Physics in the medieval Islamic world") of the [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age") from present-day Iraq.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Vernet_1996_788-9) Referred to as "the father of modern optics",[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Khalili-12) he made significant contributions to the principles of [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics") and [visual perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception "Visual perception") in particular. His most influential work is titled _[Kitāb al-Manāẓir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")_ ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic"): كتاب المناظر, "Book of Optics"), written during 1011–1021, which survived in a Latin edition.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-13) The works of Alhazen were frequently cited during the scientific revolution by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler"), [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens"), and [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei").

Ibn al-Haytham was the first to correctly explain the theory of vision,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Adamson_2016_77-14) and to argue that vision occurs in the brain, pointing to observations that it is subjective and affected by personal experience.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaker2012445-15) He also stated the principle of least time for refraction which would later become [Fermat's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_principle "Fermat's principle").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-16) He made major contributions to catoptrics and dioptrics by studying reflection, refraction and nature of images formed by light rays.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-FOOTNOTESelin20081817-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-18) Ibn al-Haytham was an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be supported by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical reasoning– an early pioneer in the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method") five centuries before [Renaissance scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_in_the_Renaissance "History of science in the Renaissance"),[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-FOOTNOTEToomer1964464-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-22) he is sometimes described as the world's "first true scientist".[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Khalili-12) He was also a [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath"), writing on [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology") and [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-23)

Born in [Basra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basra "Basra"), he spent most of his productive period in the [Fatimid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid_Caliphate "Fatimid Caliphate") capital of [Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo "Cairo") and earned his living authoring various treatises and tutoring members of the nobilities.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-24) Ibn al-Haytham is sometimes given the [byname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisba_(onomastics) "Nisba (onomastics)")_al-Baṣrī_ after his birthplace,[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-25) or _al-Miṣrī_ ("the Egyptian").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-27) Al-Haytham was dubbed the "Second [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy")" by [Abu'l-Hasan Bayhaqi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Hasan_Bayhaqi "Abu'l-Hasan Bayhaqi")[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-bayhaqi-28) and "The Physicist" by [John Peckham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peckham "John Peckham").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-29) Ibn al-Haytham paved the way for the modern science of physical optics.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-30)

Biography
---------

Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) was born c. 965 to a family of [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs")[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Vernet_1996_788-9)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Simon_2006-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-34) or [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persians "Persians")[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-39) origin in [Basra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basra "Basra"), [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Iraq "Medieval Iraq"), which was at the time part of the [Buyid emirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyid_dynasty "Buyid dynasty"). His initial influences were in the study of religion and service to the community. At the time, society had a number of conflicting views of religion that he ultimately sought to step aside from religion. This led to him delving into the study of mathematics and science.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Tbakhi-40) He held a position with the title of [_vizier_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizier_(Abbasid_Caliphate) "Vizier (Abbasid Caliphate)") in his native Basra, and became famous for his knowledge of applied mathematics, as evidenced by his attempt to regulate the [flooding of the Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_of_the_Nile "Flooding of the Nile").[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Corbin_1993_149-41)

Upon his return to Cairo, he was given an administrative post. After he proved unable to fulfill this task as well, he contracted the ire of the caliph [Al-Hakim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hakim_bi-Amr_Allah "Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah"),[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-42) and is said to have been forced into hiding until the caliph's death in 1021, after which his confiscated possessions were returned to him.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-43) Legend has it that Alhazen [feigned madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feigned_madness "Feigned madness") and was kept under house arrest during this period.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-44) During this time, he wrote his influential _[Book of Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")_. Alhazen continued to live in Cairo, in the neighborhood of the famous [University of al-Azhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Azhar_University "Al-Azhar University"), and lived from the proceeds of his literary production[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-45) until his death in c. 1040.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Corbin_1993_149-41) (A copy of [Apollonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga")' _Conics_, written in Ibn al-Haytham's own handwriting exists in [Aya Sofya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia "Hagia Sophia"): (MS Aya Sofya 2762, 307 fob., dated Safar 415 A.H. [1024]).)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-46): Note 2

Among his students were Sorkhab (Sohrab), a Persian from [Semnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semnan_(city) "Semnan (city)"), and [Abu al-Wafa Mubashir ibn Fatek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mubashshir_ibn_Fatik "Al-Mubashshir ibn Fatik"), an Egyptian prince.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-47)[_[verification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

_Book of Optics_
----------------

Alhazen's most famous work is his seven-volume treatise on [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics")_Kitab al-Manazir_ (_Book of Optics_), written from 1011 to 1021.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-48) In it, Ibn al-Haytham was the first to explain that vision occurs when light reflects from an object and then passes to one's eyes,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Adamson_2016_77-14) and to argue that vision occurs in the brain, pointing to observations that it is subjective and affected by personal experience.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaker2012445-15)

_Optics_ was [translated into Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_translations_of_the_12th_century "Latin translations of the 12th century") by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-49)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-50)

This work enjoyed a great reputation during the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"). The Latin version of _De aspectibus_ was translated at the end of the 14th century into Italian vernacular, under the title _De li aspecti_.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-51)

It was printed by [Friedrich Risner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Risner "Friedrich Risner") in 1572, with the title _Opticae thesaurus: Alhazeni Arabis libri septem, nuncprimum editi; Eiusdem liber De Crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus_ (English: Treasury of Optics: seven books by the Arab Alhazen, first edition; by the same, on twilight and the height of clouds).[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-52) Risner is also the author of the name variant "Alhazen"; before Risner he was known in the west as Alhacen.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-53) Works by Alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the [Bibliothèque nationale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_nationale "Bibliothèque nationale") in [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris") in 1834 by E. A. Sedillot. In all, A. Mark Smith has accounted for 18 full or near-complete manuscripts, and five fragments, which are preserved in 14 locations, including one in the [Bodleian Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodleian_Library "Bodleian Library") at [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford "Oxford"), and one in the library of [Bruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges "Bruges").[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-54)

### Theory of optics

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Thesaurus_opticus_Titelblatt.jpg/250px-Thesaurus_opticus_Titelblatt.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thesaurus_opticus_Titelblatt.jpg)

Front page of the _Opticae Thesaurus_, which included the first printed Latin translation of Alhazen's _Book of Optics_. The illustration incorporates many examples of optical phenomena including perspective effects, the rainbow, mirrors, and refraction.

Two major theories on vision prevailed in [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"). The first theory, the [emission theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_theory_(vision) "Emission theory (vision)"), was supported by such thinkers as [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") and [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy"), who believed that sight worked by the [eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye "Eye") emitting [rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(optics) "Ray (optics)") of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light"). The second theory, the [intromission theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intromission_theory "Intromission theory") supported by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as [al-Kindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Kindi "Al-Kindi")) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the _Book of Optics_ was from Ptolemy's [_Optics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#Optics "Ptolemy"), while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-55) Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen"), and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that "from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point".[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}.-56) This left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye.

What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}.-56) He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object– for any one point on the eye, only the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued, using a physical analogy, that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays: in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-57) He later asserted (in book seven of the _Optics_) that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived _as if_ perpendicular.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-58) His arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why _only_ perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-59) His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-60) However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe. Directly or indirectly, his _De Aspectibus_ ([Book of Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Optics "Book of Optics")) inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries. [Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler "Kepler")'s later theory of the [retinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina "Retina") image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-61)

Alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with [lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics) "Lens (optics)"), [mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror "Mirror"), [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction"), and [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-auto-62) His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-63)

Alhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the [visual system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system "Visual system"). Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 _[Perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception\_(journal) "Perception (journal)")_ article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century [Hering's law of equal innervation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hering%27s_law_of_equal_innervation "Hering's law of equal innervation"). He wrote a description of vertical [horopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horopter "Horopter") 600 years before [Aguilonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguilonius "Aguilonius") that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's– and his work on [binocular disparity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_disparity "Binocular disparity") was repeated by Panum in 1858.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-64) Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy"), with whom Alhazen was extremely familiar. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-65) In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-66)

In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-67) and Sabra,[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}.-68) Raynaud[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-69) showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-Müller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.

The structure of the [human eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye "Human eye") according to Ibn al-Haytham. Note the depiction of the [optic chiasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_chiasm "Optic chiasm"). —Manuscript copy of his [Kitāb al-Manāẓir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit%C4%81b_al-Man%C4%81%E1%BA%93ir "Kitāb al-Manāẓir") (MS Fatih 3212, vol. 1, fol. 81b, [Süleymaniye Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCleymaniye_Mosque "Süleymaniye Mosque") Library, Istanbul)

Alhazen's most original contribution was that, after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-70) His understanding of [pinhole projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera_model "Pinhole camera model") from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye,[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-71) which he sought to avoid.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-72) He maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens (or glacial humor as he called it) were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-73) He followed [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") in believing that the [lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(anatomy) "Lens (anatomy)") was the receptive organ of sight, although some of his work hints that he thought the [retina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina "Retina") was also involved.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-74)

Alhazen's synthesis of light and vision adhered to the Aristotelian scheme, exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical, complete fashion.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-75)

His research in [catoptrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catoptrics "Catoptrics") (the study of optical systems using mirrors) was centred on spherical and [parabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola") mirrors and [spherical aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration "Spherical aberration"). He made the observation that the ratio between the [angle of incidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence_(optics) "Angle of incidence (optics)") and [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction") does not remain constant, and investigated the [magnifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification "Magnification") power of a [lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics) "Lens (optics)").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-auto-62)

Alhazen was the first physicist to give complete statement of the law of reflection.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-76)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-77)[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-78) He was first to state that the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface all lie in a same plane perpendicular to reflecting plane.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-FOOTNOTESelin20081817-17)[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-79)

### Alhazen's problem

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Theorem_of_al-Haitham.JPG/250px-Theorem_of_al-Haitham.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Theorem_of_al-Haitham.JPG)

The [theorem of Ibn Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#Theorems "Circle")

His work on [catoptrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catoptrics "Catoptrics") in Book V of the Book of Optics contains a discussion of what is now known as Alhazen's problem, first formulated by [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") in 150 AD. It comprises drawing lines from two points in the [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") of a circle meeting at a point on the [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference "Circumference") and making equal angles with the [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry) "Normal (geometry)") at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular [billiard table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiard_table "Billiard table") at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, "Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer." This leads to an [equation of the fourth degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_equation "Quartic equation").[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-80) This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of [fourth powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_power "Fourth power"), where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an [integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral"), where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [paraboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraboloid "Paraboloid").[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-81) Alhazen eventually solved the problem using [conic sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section") and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. Later mathematicians used [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes")' analytical methods to analyse the problem.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-82) An algebraic solution to the problem was finally found in 1965 by Jack M. Elkin, an actuarian.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-83) Other solutions were discovered in 1989, by Harald Riede[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-84) and in 1997 by the [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford "University of Oxford") mathematician [Peter M. Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_M._Neumann "Peter M. Neumann").[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-85)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-86) Recently, [Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Electric_Research_Laboratories "Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories") (MERL) researchers solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-87)

### Camera Obscura

The [camera obscura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura "Camera obscura") was known to the [ancient Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Science_and_Technology_in_China "History of Science and Technology in China"), and was described by the [Han Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese "Han Chinese")[polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath")[Shen Kuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Kuo "Shen Kuo") in his scientific book _[Dream Pool Essays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream\_Pool\_Essays "Dream Pool Essays")_, published in the year 1088 C.E. [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") had discussed the basic principle behind it in his _Problems_, but Alhazen's work contained the first clear description of [camera obscura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura "Camera obscura").[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-88) and early analysis[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-89) of the device.

Ibn al-Haytham used a [camera obscura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura "Camera obscura") mainly to observe a partial solar eclipse.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-90) In his essay, Ibn al-Haytham writes that he observed the sickle-like shape of the sun at the time of an eclipse. The introduction reads as follows: "The image of the sun at the time of the eclipse, unless it is total, demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow, round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moonsickle."

It is admitted that his findings solidified the importance in the history of the [camera obscura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura "Camera obscura")[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-91) but this treatise is important in many other respects.

Ancient optics and medieval optics were divided into optics and burning mirrors. Optics proper mainly focused on the study of vision, while burning mirrors focused on the properties of light and luminous rays. _On the shape of the eclipse_ is probably one of the first attempts made by Ibn al-Haytham to articulate these two sciences.

Very often Ibn al-Haytham's discoveries benefited from the intersection of mathematical and experimental contributions. This is the case with _On the shape of the eclipse_. Besides the fact that this treatise allowed more people to study partial eclipses of the sun, it especially allowed to better understand how the camera obscura works. This treatise is a physico-mathematical study of image formation inside the camera obscura. Ibn al-Haytham takes an experimental approach, and determines the result by varying the size and the shape of the aperture, the focal length of the camera, the shape and intensity of the light source.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-92)

In his work he explains the inversion of the image in the camera obscura,[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-93) the fact that the image is similar to the source when the hole is small, but also the fact that the image can differ from the source when the hole is large. All these results are produced by using a point analysis of the image.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-94)

### Refractometer

In the seventh tract of his book of optics, Alhazen described an apparatus for experimenting with various cases of refraction, in order to investigate the relations between the angle of incidence, the angle of refraction and the angle of deflection. This apparatus was a modified version of an apparatus used by Ptolemy for similar purpose.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-95)[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-96)[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-97)

### Unconscious inference

Alhazen basically states the concept of unconscious inference in his discussion of colour before adding that the inferential step between sensing colour and differentiating it is shorter than the time taken between sensing and any other visible characteristic (aside from light), and that "time is so short as not to be clearly apparent to the beholder." Naturally, this suggests that the colour and form are perceived elsewhere. Alhazen goes on to say that information must travel to the central nerve cavity for processing and:

> the sentient organ does not sense the forms that reach it from the visible objects until after it has been affected by these forms; thus it does not sense color as color or light as light until after it has been affected by the form of color or light. Now the affectation received by the sentient organ from the form of color or of light is a certain change; and change must take place in time; .....and it is in the time during which the form extends from the sentient organ's surface to the cavity of the common nerve, and in (the time) following that, that the sensitive faculty, which exists in the whole of the sentient body will perceive color as color...Thus the last sentient's perception of color as such and of light as such takes place at a time following that in which the form arrives from the surface of the sentient organ to the cavity of the common nerve.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-98)

### Color constancy

Alhazen explained [color constancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy "Color constancy") by observing that the light reflected from an object is modified by the object's color. He explained that the quality of the light and the color of the object are mixed, and the visual system separates light and color. In Book II, Chapter 3 he writes:

> Again the light does not travel from the colored object to the eye unaccompanied by the color, nor does the form of the color pass from the colored object to the eye unaccompanied by the light. Neither the form of the light nor that of the color existing in the colored object can pass except as mingled together and the last sentient can only perceive them as mingled together. Nevertheless, the sentient perceives that the visible object is luminous and that the light seen in the object is other than the color and that these are two properties.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-99)

### Other contributions

The _Kitab al-Manazir_ (Book of Optics) describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies. He conducted experiments with [projectiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile "Projectile") and concluded that only the impact of [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect [oblique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_angle "Oblique angle") projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-100) He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones. The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray, since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-101)

Sudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered the founder of [experimental psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology "Experimental psychology"), for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and [optical illusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_illusion "Optical illusion").[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-auto2-102) Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the "founder of [psychophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics "Psychophysics")", a sub-discipline and precursor to modern psychology.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-auto2-102) Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-103)

Alhazen offered an explanation of the [Moon illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_illusion "Moon illusion"), an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-104) Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky. Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by [Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon "Roger Bacon"), [John Pecham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pecham "John Pecham") and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-105) Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. [Cleomedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleomedes "Cleomedes") (c. 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to [Posidonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonius "Posidonius") (c. 135–50 BCE).[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-106) Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his _Optics_, but the text is obscure.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-107) Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit.

Scientific method
-----------------

> Therefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and ... attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.

— Alhazen[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}.-68)

An aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation (_i'tibar_)(Arabic: اختبار) and [controlled testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control "Scientific control") in his scientific inquiries. Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics (_ilm tabi'i_) with mathematics (_ta'alim_; geometry in particular). This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in _Kitab al-Manazir_ (_The Optics_; _De aspectibus_ or _Perspectivae_)[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-108) and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and [dioptrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptrics "Dioptrics") (the study of the reflection and refraction of light, respectively).[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvs|nb|last=el-bizri|year=2005a|year2=2005b}}.-109)

According to Matthias Schramm,[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-thiele2005-110) Alhazen "was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the [moonlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight "Moonlight") through two small [apertures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apertures "Apertures") onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up."[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-111) G. J. Toomer expressed some skepticism regarding Schramm's view,[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-auto1-112) partly because at the time (1964) the _Book of Optics_ had not yet been fully translated from Arabic, and Toomer was concerned that without context, specific passages might be read anachronistically. While acknowledging Alhazen's importance in developing experimental techniques, Toomer argued that Alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-auto1-112) Toomer concluded his review by saying that it would not be possible to assess Schramm's claim that Ibn al-Haytham was the true founder of modern physics without translating more of Alhazen's work and fully investigating his influence on later medieval writers.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-toomer1964Review-113)

Other works on physics
----------------------

### Optical treatises

Besides the _Book of Optics_, Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his _Risala fi l-Daw'_ (_Treatise on Light_). He investigated the properties of [luminance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance "Luminance"), the [rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow "Rainbow"), [eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse "Eclipse"), [twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight "Twilight"), and [moonlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight "Moonlight"). Experiments with mirrors and the refractive interfaces between air, water, and glass cubes, hemispheres, and quarter-spheres provided the foundation for his theories on [catoptrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catoptrics "Catoptrics").[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}.-114)

### Celestial physics

Alhazen discussed the [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") of the celestial region in his _Epitome of Astronomy_, arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses– in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred [Ptolemaic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_model "Ptolemaic model") "greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West". Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses "were accountable to the [laws of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law")", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-115)

He also wrote _Maqala fi daw al-qamar_ (_On the Light of the Moon_).

### Mechanics

In his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") of a body.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}.-114)

Astronomical works
------------------

### _On the Configuration of the World_

In his _On the Configuration of the World_ Alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth:

> The earth as a whole is a round sphere whose center is the center of the world. It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-116)

The book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's _[Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest")_, which was eventually translated into [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") and [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as [Georg von Peuerbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_von_Peuerbach "Georg von Peuerbach")[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|lorch|2008}}.-117) during the European [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") and [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance").[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-118)

### _Doubts Concerning Ptolemy_

In his _Al-Shukūk ‛alā Batlamyūs_, variously translated as _Doubts Concerning Ptolemy_ or _Aporias against Ptolemy_, published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy")'s _Almagest_, _Planetary Hypotheses_, and _Optics_, pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's _Almagest_ concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the _Hypotheses_ concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}.-119) He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the [equant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equant "Equant"), failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-120)

> Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (_hay'a_) that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist... [F]or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens, and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet's motion.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-121)

Having pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen believed there was a "true configuration" of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}.-119) In the _Doubts Concerning Ptolemy_ Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:

> Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}.-68)

He held that the criticism of existing theories– which dominated this book– holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.

### _Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets_

Alhazen's _The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets_ was written c. 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his _Doubts on Ptolemy_, Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of [epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycles "Epicycles") to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's [equant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equant "Equant"). In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-122)

### Other astronomical works

Alhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as _Exact Determination of the Meridian_, a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way"); Alhazen made the first systematic effort of evaluating the Milky Way's parallax, combining Ptolemy's data and his own. He concluded that the parallax is (probably very much) smaller than Lunar parallax, and the Milky way should be a celestial object. Though he was not the first who argued that the Milky Way does not belong to the atmosphere, he is the first who did quantitative analysis for the claim.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-123) The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the _Doubts_ and _Model of the Motions_ discussed above.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-124)

Mathematical works

Alhazen's geometrically proven summation formula

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_mathematics "Islamic mathematics"), Alhazen built on the mathematical works of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") and [Thabit ibn Qurra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thabit_ibn_Qurra "Thabit ibn Qurra") and worked on "the beginnings of the link between [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") and [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry")". Alhazen made developments in [conic sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section") and number theory.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-125)

He developed a formula for summing the first 100 natural numbers, using a geometric proof to prove the formula.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-126)

### Geometry

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/LunesOfAlhazen.svg/190px-LunesOfAlhazen.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LunesOfAlhazen.svg)

The lunes of Alhazen. The two blue lunes together have the same area as the green right triangle.

Alhazen explored what is now known as the [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry")[parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate"), the fifth [postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") in [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements"), using a [proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum "Reductio ad absurdum"),[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-127) and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-128) He formulated the [Lambert quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_quadrilateral "Lambert quadrilateral"), which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the "Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral".[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-129) He was criticised by Omar Khayyam who pointed that Aristotle had condemned the use of [motion in geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(geometry) "Motion (geometry)").[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-130)

In elementary geometry, Alhazen attempted to solve the problem of [squaring the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle "Squaring the circle") using the area of [lunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lune_(mathematics) "Lune (mathematics)") (crescent shapes), but later gave up on the impossible task.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}.-131) The two lunes formed from a [right triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle") by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangle's sides, inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides, are known as the [lunes of Alhazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lune_of_Hippocrates "Lune of Hippocrates"); they have the same total area as the triangle itself.[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-132)

### Number theory

Alhazen's contributions to [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory") include his work on [perfect numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number "Perfect number"). In his _Analysis and Synthesis_, he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form 2 _n_−1(2 _n_−1) where 2 _n_−1 is [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number"), but he was not able to prove this result; [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") later proved it in the 18th century, and it is now called the [Euclid–Euler theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%E2%80%93Euler_theorem "Euclid–Euler theorem").[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}.-131)

Alhazen solved problems involving [congruences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_relation "Congruence relation") using what is now called [Wilson's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_theorem "Wilson's theorem"). In his _Opuscula_, Alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences, and gives two general methods of solution. His first method, the canonical method, involved Wilson's theorem, while his second method involved a version of the [Chinese remainder theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem "Chinese remainder theorem").[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}.-131)

### Calculus

Alhazen discovered the sum formula for the fourth power, using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power. He used this to find the volume of a [paraboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraboloid "Paraboloid"). He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-133)

Other works
-----------

### _Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals_

Alhazen also wrote a _Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals_, although no copies have survived. It appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music, for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace.

### Engineering

In [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventions_in_the_Islamic_world "Inventions in the Islamic world"), one account of his career as a [civil engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineer "Civil engineer") has him summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid [Caliph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliph "Caliph"), [Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hakim_bi-Amr_Allah "Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah"), to regulate the [flooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding "Flooding") of the [Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile "Nile") River. He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual [inundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inundation "Inundation") of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a [dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam "Dam"), at the site of the modern-day [Aswan Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan_Dam "Aswan Dam"). His field work, however, later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and he soon [feigned madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feigned_madness "Feigned madness") so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-134)

### Philosophy

In his _Treatise on Place_, Alhazen disagreed with [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s view that nature abhors a [void](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"), and he used [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") in an attempt to demonstrate that place (_al-makan_) is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}.-135)[Abd-el-latif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Latif_al-Baghdadi_(medieval_writer) "Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)"), a supporter of Aristotle's philosophical view of place, later criticized the work in _Fi al-Radd 'ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan_ (_A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham's place_) for its geometrization of place.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}.-135)

Alhazen also discussed [space perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception "Depth perception") and its [epistemological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") implications in his _[Book of Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")_. In "tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhazen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things."[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-136)

### Theology

Alhazen was a Muslim and most sources report that he was a Sunni and a follower of the [Ash'ari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash%27ari "Ash'ari") school.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-ishaq-137)[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-george-138)[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Sardar_1998-139)[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Bettany_1995_251-140)[Ziauddin Sardar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziauddin_Sardar "Ziauddin Sardar") says that some of the greatest [Muslim scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_medieval_Islam "Science in medieval Islam"), such as Ibn al-Haytham and [Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab%C5%AB_Rayh%C4%81n_al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB "Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī"), who were pioneers of the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method"), were themselves followers of the Ashʿari school of Islamic theology.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Sardar_1998-139) Like other Ashʿarites who believed that faith or _taqlid_ should apply only to Islam and not to any ancient [Hellenistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_civilization "Hellenistic civilization") authorities,[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-141) Ibn al-Haytham's view that _taqlid_ should apply only to [prophets of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophets_of_Islam "Prophets of Islam") and not to any other authorities formed the basis for much of his [scientific skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_skepticism "Scientific skepticism") and criticism against [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") and other ancient authorities in his _Doubts Concerning Ptolemy_ and _[Book of Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")_.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-142)

Alhazen wrote a work on Islamic theology in which he discussed prophethood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-143) He also wrote a treatise entitled _Finding the Direction of Qibla by Calculation_ in which he discussed finding the [Qibla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibla "Qibla"), where prayers ([salat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salat "Salat")) are directed towards, mathematically.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-144)

There are occasional references to theology or religious sentiment in his technical works, e.g. in _Doubts Concerning Ptolemy_:

> Truth is sought for its own sake ... Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. For the truths are plunged in obscurity. ... God, however, has not preserved the scientist from error and has not safeguarded science from shortcomings and faults. If this had been the case, scientists would not have disagreed upon any point of science...[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-Sambursky1974-145)

In _The Winding Motion_:

> From the statements made by the noble Shaykh, it is clear that he believes in Ptolemy's words in everything he says, without relying on a demonstration or calling on a proof, but by pure imitation (_taqlid_); that is how experts in the prophetic tradition have faith in Prophets, may the blessing of God be upon them. But it is not the way that mathematicians have faith in specialists in the demonstrative sciences.[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-146)

Regarding the relation of objective truth and God:

> I constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the effulgence and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-147)

Cover page of the Latin translation of _[Kitāb al-Manāẓir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")_

Alhazen made significant contributions to optics, number theory, geometry, astronomy and natural philosophy. Alhazen's work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment.

His main work, _[Kitab al-Manazir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")_ (_Book of Optics_), was known in the [Muslim world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world "Muslim world") mainly, but not exclusively, through the thirteenth-century commentary by [Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kam%C4%81l_al-D%C4%ABn_al-F%C4%81ris%C4%AB "Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī"), the _Tanqīḥ_ al-Manāẓir _li-dhawī l-abṣār wa l-baṣā'ir_.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-148) In [al-Andalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus"), it was used by the eleventh-century prince of the [Banu Hud dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Hud "Banu Hud") of [Zaragossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaragoza "Zaragoza") and author of an important mathematical text, [al-Mu'taman ibn Hūd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mu%27taman_ibn_Hud "Al-Mu'taman ibn Hud"). A Latin translation of the _Kitab al-Manazir_ was made probably in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century.[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-149) This translation was read by and greatly influenced a number of scholars in Christian Europe including: [Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon "Roger Bacon"),[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-150)[Robert Grosseteste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Grosseteste "Robert Grosseteste"),[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-151)[Witelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witelo "Witelo"), [Giambattista della Porta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_della_Porta "Giambattista della Porta"),[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-152)[Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci"),[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-153)[Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei"),[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-154)[Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens"),[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-155)[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"),[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-156) and [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler").[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-157) Meanwhile, in the Islamic world, Alhazen's legacy was further advanced through the 'reforming' of his _Optics_ by Persian scientist [Kamal al-Din al-Farisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamal_al-Din_al-Farisi "Kamal al-Din al-Farisi") (died c. 1320) in the latter's _Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir_ (_The Revision of_ [Ibn al-Haytham's] _Optics_).[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-{{harvs|nb|last=el-bizri|year=2005a|year2=2005b}}.-109) Alhazen wrote as many as 200 books, although only 55 have survived. Some of his treatises on optics survived only through Latin translation. During the Middle Ages his books on [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") were translated into Latin, [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") and other languages.

H. J. J. Winter, a British historian of science, summing up the importance of Ibn al-Haytham in the history of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") wrote:

> After the death of Archimedes no really great physicist appeared until Ibn al-Haytham. If, therefore, we confine our interest only to the history of physics, there is a long period of over twelve hundred years during which the Golden Age of Greece gave way to the era of Muslim Scholasticism, and the experimental spirit of the noblest physicist of Antiquity lived again in the Arab Scholar from Basra.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-158)

Although only one commentary on Alhazen's optics has survived the Islamic Middle Ages, [Geoffrey Chaucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer "Geoffrey Chaucer") mentions the work in _[The Canterbury Tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Canterbury\_Tales "The Canterbury Tales")_:[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-159)

> "They spoke of Alhazen and Vitello,
> 
>  And Aristotle, who wrote, in their lives,
> 
>  On strange mirrors and optical instruments."

The [impact crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_crater "Impact crater")[Alhazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen_(crater) "Alhazen (crater)") on the Moon is named in his honour,[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-160) as was the [asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid")[59239 Alhazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/59239_Alhazen "59239 Alhazen").[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-161) In honour of Alhazen, the [Aga Khan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aga_Khan_University "Aga Khan University") (Pakistan) named its Ophthalmology endowed chair as "The Ibn-e-Haitham Associate Professor and Chief of Ophthalmology".[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-162)

The 2015 [International Year of Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Year_of_Light "International Year of Light") celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the works on optics by Ibn Al-Haytham.[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-163)

[![Image 8: Frontispiece of book showing two persons in robes, one holding a geometrical diagram, the other holding a telescope.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Houghton_Typ_620.47.452_-_Selenographia%2C_title.jpg/250px-Houghton_Typ_620.47.452_-_Selenographia%2C_title.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Houghton_Typ_620.47.452_-_Selenographia,_title.jpg)

[Hevelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hevelius "Hevelius")'s _[Selenographia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenographia "Selenographia")_, showing Alhasen [_[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")_] representing reason, and [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") representing the senses

In 2014, the "[Hiding in the Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiding_in_the_Light "Hiding in the Light")" episode of _[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:\_A\_Spacetime\_Odyssey "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey")_, presented by [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson "Neil deGrasse Tyson"), focused on the accomplishments of Ibn al-Haytham. He was voiced by [Alfred Molina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Molina "Alfred Molina") in the episode.

Over forty years previously, [Jacob Bronowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bronowski "Jacob Bronowski") presented Alhazen's work in a similar television documentary (and the corresponding book), _[The Ascent of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Ascent\_of\_Man "The Ascent of Man")_. In episode 5 (_The Music of the Spheres_), Bronowski remarked that in his view, Alhazen was "the one really original scientific mind that Arab culture produced", whose theory of optics was not improved on till the time of Newton and Leibniz.

[UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") declared 2015 the [International Year of Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Year_of_Light "International Year of Light") and its Director-General Irina Bokova dubbed Ibn al-Haytham 'the father of optics'.[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-164) Amongst others, this was to celebrate Ibn Al-Haytham's achievements in optics, mathematics and astronomy. An international campaign, created by the [1001 Inventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Inventions "1001 Inventions") organisation, titled _1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham_ featuring a series of interactive exhibits, workshops and live shows about his work, partnering with science centers, science festivals, museums, and educational institutions, as well as digital and social media platforms.[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-165) The campaign also produced and released the short educational film [1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Inventions_and_the_World_of_Ibn_Al-Haytham "1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham").

Ibn al-Haytham appears on the 10,000 dinar banknote of the [Iraqi dinar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_dinar "Iraqi dinar"), series 2003.[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-166)

List of works
-------------

According to medieval biographers, Alhazen wrote more than 200 works on a wide range of subjects, of which at least 96 of his scientific works are known. Most of his works are now lost, but more than 50 of them have survived to some extent. Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects.[[166]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-167) Not all his surviving works have yet been studied, but some of the ones that have are given below.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen#cite_note-168)

Al-Haytham's contributions to geometry and number theory went well beyond the Archimedean tradition. Al-Haytham also worked on analytical geometry and the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry. Subsequently, this work led in pure mathematics to the harmonious fusion of algebra and geometry that was epitomised by Descartes in geometric analysis and by Newton in the calculus. Al-Haytham was a scientist who made major contributions to the fields of mathematics, physics and astronomy during the latter half of the tenth century.
