Dynkin systems are sometimes referred to as 𝜆-systems (Dynkin himself used this term) or d-system .

[ 2 ] These set families have applications in measure theory and probability .

A major application of 𝜆-systems is the π -𝜆 theorem, see below.

Definition [ edit ] Let Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } be a nonempty set, and let D {\displaystyle D} be a collection of subsets of Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } (that is, D {\displaystyle D} is a subset of the power set of Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } ). Then D {\displaystyle D} is a Dynkin system if Ω Ω ∈ ∈ D ; {\displaystyle \Omega \in D;} D {\displaystyle D} is closed under complements of subsets in supersets: if A , B ∈ ∈ D {\displaystyle A,B\in D} and A ⊆ ⊆ B , {\displaystyle A\subseteq B,} then B ∖ ∖ A ∈ ∈ D ; {\displaystyle B\setminus A\in D;} D {\displaystyle D} is closed under countable increasing unions : if A 1 ⊆ ⊆ A 2 ⊆ ⊆ A 3 ⊆ ⊆ ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle A_{1}\subseteq A_{2}\subseteq A_{3}\subseteq \cdots } is an increasing sequence [ note 1 ] of sets in D {\displaystyle D} then ⋃ ⋃ n = 1 ∞ ∞ A n ∈ ∈ D .

{\displaystyle \bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n}\in D.} It is easy to check [ note 2 ] that any Dynkin system D {\displaystyle D} satisfies: ∅ ∅ ∈ ∈ D ; {\displaystyle \varnothing \in D;} D {\displaystyle D} is closed under complements in Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } : if A ∈ ∈ D , {\textstyle A\in D,} then Ω Ω ∖ ∖ A ∈ ∈ D ; {\displaystyle \Omega \setminus A\in D;} Taking A := Ω Ω {\displaystyle A:=\Omega } shows that ∅ ∅ ∈ ∈ D .

{\displaystyle \varnothing \in D.} D {\displaystyle D} is closed under countable unions of pairwise disjoint sets: if A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , … … {\displaystyle A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},\ldots } is a sequence of pairwise disjoint sets in D {\displaystyle D} (meaning that A i ∩ ∩ A j = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle A_{i}\cap A_{j}=\varnothing } for all i ≠ ≠ j {\displaystyle i\neq j} ) then ⋃ ⋃ n = 1 ∞ ∞ A n ∈ ∈ D .

{\displaystyle \bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n}\in D.} To be clear, this property also holds for finite sequences A 1 , … … , A n {\displaystyle A_{1},\ldots ,A_{n}} of pairwise disjoint sets (by letting A i := ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle A_{i}:=\varnothing } for all i > n {\displaystyle i>n} ).

Conversely, it is easy to check that a family of sets that satisfy conditions 4-6 is a Dynkin class.

[ note 3 ] For this reason, a small group of authors have adopted conditions 4-6 to define a Dynkin system.

An important fact is that any Dynkin system that is also a π -system (that is, closed under finite intersections) is a 𝜎-algebra . This can be verified by noting that conditions 2 and 3 together with closure under finite intersections imply closure under finite unions, which in turn implies closure under countable unions.

Given any collection J {\displaystyle {\mathcal {J}}} of subsets of Ω Ω , {\displaystyle \Omega ,} there exists a unique Dynkin system denoted D { J } {\displaystyle D\{{\mathcal {J}}\}} which is minimal with respect to containing J .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {J}}.} That is, if D ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {D}}} is any Dynkin system containing J , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {J}},} then D { J } ⊆ ⊆ D ~ ~ .

{\displaystyle D\{{\mathcal {J}}\}\subseteq {\tilde {D}}.} D { J } {\displaystyle D\{{\mathcal {J}}\}} is called the Dynkin system generated by J .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {J}}.} For instance, D { ∅ ∅ } = { ∅ ∅ , Ω Ω } .

{\displaystyle D\{\varnothing \}=\{\varnothing ,\Omega \}.} For another example, let Ω Ω = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } {\displaystyle \Omega =\{1,2,3,4\}} and J = { 1 } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {J}}=\{1\}} ; then D { J } = { ∅ ∅ , { 1 } , { 2 , 3 , 4 } , Ω Ω } .

{\displaystyle D\{{\mathcal {J}}\}=\{\varnothing ,\{1\},\{2,3,4\},\Omega \}.} Sierpiński–Dynkin's π-λ theorem [ edit ] Sierpiński-Dynkin's π -𝜆 theorem: [ 3 ] If P {\displaystyle P} is a π -system and D {\displaystyle D} is a Dynkin system with P ⊆ ⊆ D , {\displaystyle P\subseteq D,} then σ σ { P } ⊆ ⊆ D .

{\displaystyle \sigma \{P\}\subseteq D.} In other words, the 𝜎-algebra generated by P {\displaystyle P} is contained in D .

{\displaystyle D.} Thus a Dynkin system contains a π -system if and only if it contains the 𝜎-algebra generated by that π -system.

One application of Sierpiński-Dynkin's π -𝜆 theorem is the uniqueness of a measure that evaluates the length of an interval (known as the Lebesgue measure ): Let ( Ω Ω , B , ℓ ℓ ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {B}},\ell )} be the unit interval [0,1] with the Lebesgue measure on Borel sets .  Let m {\displaystyle m} be another measure on Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } satisfying m [ ( a , b ) ] = b − − a , {\displaystyle m[(a,b)]=b-a,} and let D {\displaystyle D} be the family of sets S {\displaystyle S} such that m [ S ] = ℓ ℓ [ S ] .

{\displaystyle m[S]=\ell [S].} Let I := { ( a , b ) , [ a , b ) , ( a , b ] , [ a , b ] : 0 < a ≤ ≤ b < 1 } , {\displaystyle I:=\{(a,b),[a,b),(a,b],[a,b]:0<a\leq b<1\},} and observe that I {\displaystyle I} is closed under finite intersections, that I ⊆ ⊆ D , {\displaystyle I\subseteq D,} and that B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} is the 𝜎-algebra generated by I .

{\displaystyle I.} It may be shown that D {\displaystyle D} satisfies the above conditions for a Dynkin-system.  From Sierpiński-Dynkin's π -𝜆 Theorem it follows that D {\displaystyle D} in fact includes all of B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} , which is equivalent to showing that the Lebesgue measure is unique on B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} .

Application to probability distributions [ edit ] This section is transcluded from pi system .

( edit | history ) The π -𝜆 theorem motivates the common definition of the probability distribution of a random variable X : ( Ω Ω , F , P ) → → R {\displaystyle X:(\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},\operatorname {P} )\to \mathbb {R} } in terms of its cumulative distribution function . Recall that the cumulative distribution of a random variable  is defined as F X ( a ) = P ⁡ ⁡ [ X ≤ ≤ a ] , a ∈ ∈ R , {\displaystyle F_{X}(a)=\operatorname {P} [X\leq a],\qquad a\in \mathbb {R} ,} whereas the seemingly more general law of the variable is the probability measure L X ( B ) = P ⁡ ⁡ [ X − − 1 ( B ) ] for all B ∈ ∈ B ( R ) , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X}(B)=\operatorname {P} \left[X^{-1}(B)\right]\quad {\text{ for all }}B\in {\mathcal {B}}(\mathbb {R} ),} where B ( R ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(\mathbb {R} )} is the Borel 𝜎-algebra. The random variables X : ( Ω Ω , F , P ) → → R {\displaystyle X:(\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},\operatorname {P} )\to \mathbb {R} } and Y : ( Ω Ω ~ ~ , F ~ ~ , P ~ ~ ) → → R {\displaystyle Y:({\tilde {\Omega }},{\tilde {\mathcal {F}}},{\tilde {\operatorname {P} }})\to \mathbb {R} } (on two possibly different probability spaces ) are equal in distribution (or law ), denoted by X = D Y , {\displaystyle X\,{\stackrel {\mathcal {D}}{=}}\,Y,} if they have the same cumulative distribution functions; that is, if F X = F Y .

{\displaystyle F_{X}=F_{Y}.} The motivation for the definition stems from the observation that if F X = F Y , {\displaystyle F_{X}=F_{Y},} then that is exactly to say that L X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X}} and L Y {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{Y}} agree on the π -system { ( − − ∞ ∞ , a ] : a ∈ ∈ R } {\displaystyle \{(-\infty ,a]:a\in \mathbb {R} \}} which generates B ( R ) , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(\mathbb {R} ),} and so by the example above : L X = L Y .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X}={\mathcal {L}}_{Y}.} A similar result holds for the joint distribution of a random vector. For example, suppose X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are two random variables defined on the same probability space ( Ω Ω , F , P ) , {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},\operatorname {P} ),} with respectively generated π -systems I X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}_{X}} and I Y .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}_{Y}.} The joint cumulative distribution function of ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle (X,Y)} is F X , Y ( a , b ) = P ⁡ ⁡ [ X ≤ ≤ a , Y ≤ ≤ b ] = P ⁡ ⁡ [ X − − 1 ( ( − − ∞ ∞ , a ] ) ∩ ∩ Y − − 1 ( ( − − ∞ ∞ , b ] ) ] , for all a , b ∈ ∈ R .

{\displaystyle F_{X,Y}(a,b)=\operatorname {P} [X\leq a,Y\leq b]=\operatorname {P} \left[X^{-1}((-\infty ,a])\cap Y^{-1}((-\infty ,b])\right],\quad {\text{ for all }}a,b\in \mathbb {R} .} However, A = X − − 1 ( ( − − ∞ ∞ , a ] ) ∈ ∈ I X {\displaystyle A=X^{-1}((-\infty ,a])\in {\mathcal {I}}_{X}} and B = Y − − 1 ( ( − − ∞ ∞ , b ] ) ∈ ∈ I Y .

{\displaystyle B=Y^{-1}((-\infty ,b])\in {\mathcal {I}}_{Y}.} Because I X , Y = { A ∩ ∩ B : A ∈ ∈ I X , and B ∈ ∈ I Y } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}_{X,Y}=\left\{A\cap B:A\in {\mathcal {I}}_{X},{\text{ and }}B\in {\mathcal {I}}_{Y}\right\}} is a π -system generated by the random pair ( X , Y ) , {\displaystyle (X,Y),} the π -𝜆 theorem is used to show that the joint cumulative distribution function suffices to determine the joint law of ( X , Y ) .

{\displaystyle (X,Y).} In other words, ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle (X,Y)} and ( W , Z ) {\displaystyle (W,Z)} have the same distribution if and only if they have the same joint cumulative distribution function.

In the theory of stochastic processes , two processes ( X t ) t ∈ ∈ T , ( Y t ) t ∈ ∈ T {\displaystyle (X_{t})_{t\in T},(Y_{t})_{t\in T}} are known to be equal in distribution if and only if they agree on all finite-dimensional distributions; that is, for all t 1 , … … , t n ∈ ∈ T , n ∈ ∈ N , {\displaystyle t_{1},\ldots ,t_{n}\in T,\,n\in \mathbb {N} ,} ( X t 1 , … … , X t n ) = D ( Y t 1 , … … , Y t n ) .

{\displaystyle \left(X_{t_{1}},\ldots ,X_{t_{n}}\right)\,{\stackrel {\mathcal {D}}{=}}\,\left(Y_{t_{1}},\ldots ,Y_{t_{n}}\right).} The proof of this is another application of the π -𝜆 theorem.

Proof of (5) : Property (5) follows from (1) and (2) by using B := Ω Ω .

{\displaystyle B:=\Omega .} The following lemma will be used to prove (6).

Lemma : If A , B ∈ ∈ D {\displaystyle A,B\in {\mathcal {D}}} are disjoint then A ∪ ∪ B ∈ ∈ D .

{\displaystyle A\cup B\in {\mathcal {D}}.} Proof of Lemma : A ∩ ∩ B = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle A\cap B=\varnothing } implies B ⊆ ⊆ Ω Ω ∖ ∖ A , {\displaystyle B\subseteq \Omega \setminus A,} where Ω Ω ∖ ∖ A ⊆ ⊆ Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega \setminus A\subseteq \Omega } by (5). Now (2) implies that D {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}} contains ( Ω Ω ∖ ∖ A ) ∖ ∖ B = Ω Ω ∖ ∖ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) {\displaystyle (\Omega \setminus A)\setminus B=\Omega \setminus (A\cup B)} so that (5) guarantees that A ∪ ∪ B ∈ ∈ D , {\displaystyle A\cup B\in {\mathcal {D}},} which proves the lemma.

Proof of (6) Assume that A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , … … {\displaystyle A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},\ldots } are pairwise disjoint sets in D .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}.} For every integer n > 0 , {\displaystyle n>0,} the lemma implies that D n := A 1 ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ ∪ ∪ A n ∈ ∈ D {\displaystyle D_{n}:=A_{1}\cup \cdots \cup A_{n}\in {\mathcal {D}}} where because D 1 ⊆ ⊆ D 2 ⊆ ⊆ D 3 ⊆ ⊆ ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle D_{1}\subseteq D_{2}\subseteq D_{3}\subseteq \cdots } is increasing, (3) guarantees that D {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}} contains their union D 1 ∪ ∪ D 2 ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ = A 1 ∪ ∪ A 2 ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ , {\displaystyle D_{1}\cup D_{2}\cup \cdots =A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup \cdots ,} as desired.

Proof of (2) : If A , B ∈ ∈ D {\displaystyle A,B\in {\mathcal {D}}} satisfy A ⊆ ⊆ B {\displaystyle A\subseteq B} then (5) implies Ω Ω ∖ ∖ B ∈ ∈ D {\displaystyle \Omega \setminus B\in {\mathcal {D}}} and since ( Ω Ω ∖ ∖ B ) ∩ ∩ A = ∅ ∅ , {\displaystyle (\Omega \setminus B)\cap A=\varnothing ,} (6) implies that D {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}} contains ( Ω Ω ∖ ∖ B ) ∪ ∪ A = Ω Ω ∖ ∖ ( B ∖ ∖ A ) {\displaystyle (\Omega \setminus B)\cup A=\Omega \setminus (B\setminus A)} so that finally (4) guarantees that Ω Ω ∖ ∖ ( Ω Ω ∖ ∖ ( B ∖ ∖ A ) ) = B ∖ ∖ A {\displaystyle \Omega \setminus (\Omega \setminus (B\setminus A))=B\setminus A} is in D .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}.} Proof of (3) : Assume A 1 ⊆ ⊆ A 2 ⊆ ⊆ ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle A_{1}\subseteq A_{2}\subseteq \cdots } is an increasing sequence of subsets in D , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}},} let D 1 = A 1 , {\displaystyle D_{1}=A_{1},} and let D i = A i ∖ ∖ A i − − 1 {\displaystyle D_{i}=A_{i}\setminus A_{i-1}} for every i > 1 , {\displaystyle i>1,} where (2) guarantees that D 2 , D 3 , … … {\displaystyle D_{2},D_{3},\ldots } all belong to D .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}.} Since D 1 , D 2 , D 3 , … … {\displaystyle D_{1},D_{2},D_{3},\ldots } are pairwise disjoint, (6) guarantees that their union D 1 ∪ ∪ D 2 ∪ ∪ D 3 ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ = A 1 ∪ ∪ A 2 ∪ ∪ A 3 ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle D_{1}\cup D_{2}\cup D_{3}\cup \cdots =A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup A_{3}\cup \cdots } belongs to D , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}},} which proves (3).
