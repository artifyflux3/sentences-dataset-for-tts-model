The cooled expanded gas then passes through a heat exchanger where it cools the incoming compressed gas.

[ 1 ] Regenerative cycles [ edit ] Stirling cycle Gifford–McMahon cycle Vuilleumier cycle Pulse tube refrigerator History [ edit ] In 1857, Siemens introduced the regenerative cooling concept with the Siemens cycle .

[ 2 ] In 1895, William Hampson in England [ 3 ] and Carl von Linde in Germany [ 4 ] independently developed and patented the Hampson–Linde cycle to liquefy air using the Joule–Thomson expansion process and regenerative cooling.

[ 5 ] On 10 May 1898, James Dewar used regenerative cooling to become the first to statically liquefy hydrogen .
