He also developed the first mathematical description of dipole–dipole interactions in 1921. Thus, dipole–dipole interactions are also known as Keesom interactions .
He was previously a student of Heike Kamerlingh Onnes , who had discovered superconductivity (a feat for which Kamerlingh Onnes received the 1913 Nobel Prize in Physics).

He also discovered the lambda point transition specific-heat maximum between Helium-I and Helium-II in 1930.

[ 3 ] In 1924 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences .

[ 4 ] In 1966, the minor planet 9686 Keesom was named after him.
