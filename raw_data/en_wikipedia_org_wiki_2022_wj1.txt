[ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] A fireball was widely visible.

Meteorites were also detected by weather radar during dark flight .

It was the 6th asteroid in history to be discovered before impact.

Discovery [ edit ] The asteroid was discovered three hours before impact by David Rankin at Mount Lemmon Observatory , during routine observations for the Mount Lemmon Survey .

[ 2 ] The first image was taken at 04:53 UT when the asteroid was 0.000859 AU (128.5 thousand km ; 79.8 thousand mi ; 0.334 LD ) from Earth.

[ 11 ] Using the first four images of the asteroid, Scout estimated a 25% chance of an Earth impact.

[ 12 ] The next four images raised the chance to 50%. Within about an hour, further observations raised the chance of impact to 100%. The final observation was from Mauna Kea, 32 minutes before impact, just before it entered Earth's shadow .

[ 13 ] The asteroid brightened to about apparent magnitude 15 (about the brightness of Pluto ) before disappearing into Earth's shadow.

[ 1 ] It is the sixth successfully-predicted asteroid impact.

[ 9 ] [ b ] With an absolute magnitude of 33.6, it is the smallest asteroid discovered while it was in space.

[ 14 ] Impact [ edit ] A meteorite fall was presumed to have occurred along the south shores of Lake Ontario , from east of Grimsby to Niagara-on-the-Lake with most meteorites landing in the water.

[ 15 ] Larger fragments would have fallen farther to the east.

[ 15 ] During dark flight , weather radar signatures appeared from an altitude of ~15 km down to 850 metres.

[ 15 ] Meteorites should have a fresh black fusion crust .

[ 16 ] Most findable fragments would likely be around 5 grams and the size of a nickel . The main mass might be the size of a soccer ball and be located between Port Weller and Virgil.

[ 16 ] There was also an observed ordinary chondrite meteorite fall in Grimsby at 01:03 UT 26 September 2009 with 13 recovered meteorites totaling 215 grams (the main mass was 69 grams).

[ 17 ] The 2009 fall has a strewn field of 8 km x 4 km.

[ 17 ] The Minor Planet Center noted that Earth's atmosphere was impacted above Brantford 70 km from Grimsby.

[ 2 ] The resulting sonic boom was mostly heard in Hamilton while the fireball was visible to observers in the Greater Toronto Area and as far as the U.S. states of Maryland , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York .

View from sunlit side of Earth. Without Earth's gravity, 2022 WJ 1 's trajectory would have missed Earth. Red markers show inside Earth's shadow.

Orbit [ edit ] The Apollo asteroid was inbound approaching a mid-December perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) when it impacted Earth.

[ 5 ] Even at opposition on 15 October 2022 when 2022 WJ 1 was 0.2 AU (30 million km ; 78 LD ) from Earth, it had an unobservable apparent magnitude of 31 which is about 600 times too faint to be detected by even the most sensitive automated allsky surveys .

[ 8 ] [ c ] 2022 WJ 1 orbited from inside Earth's orbit with perihelion at 0.92 AU to the middle of the asteroid belt at 2.8 AU.
