Career [ edit ] From 1982-1989, he was a researcher at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Science of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences . From 1990-1995, he was the head of Section for Functional Analysis at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences . From 1992 until his death, he was full professor of mathematics at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics . From 1996-1999 and 2002-2006, he was chair of the Department for Mathematical Analysis at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics . From 1996-2004, he was vice director of the Mathematical Institute of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics . From 1998-2002, he was vice dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics . From 2004 until his death, he was research professor at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences . From 2008 until his death, he was professor of mathematics at the Eötvös Loránd University .
