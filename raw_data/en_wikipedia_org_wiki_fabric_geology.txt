For other uses, see Fabric (disambiguation) .

Primary fabric in anorthosite intrusion , Rogaland , Norway Deformed waterlain volcanic sediments. Primary fabric (bedding) shown by abrupt change in clast size , secondary fabric shown by penetrative S-fabric, cleavage , in fine-grained rock, and by shape fabric in deformed volcanic clasts.

Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia In geology , a rock's fabric describes the spatial and geometric configuration of all the elements that make it up.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In sedimentary rocks , the fabric developed depends on the depositional environment and can provide information on current directions at the time of deposition. In structural geology , fabrics may provide information on both the orientation and magnitude of the strains that have affected a particular piece of deformed rock.

Types of fabric [ edit ] Primary fabric — a fabric created during the original formation of the rock, e.g. a preferred orientation of clast long axes in a conglomerate , parallel to the flow direction, deposited by a fast waning current.

Shape fabric — a fabric that is defined by the preferred orientation of inequant elements within the rock, such as platy- or needle-like mineral grains. It may also be formed by the deformation of originally equant elements such as mineral grains.

[ 3 ] Crystallographic preferred orientation — in plastically deformed rocks, the constituent minerals commonly display a preferred orientation of their crystal axes as a result of dislocation processes.

S-fabric — a planar fabric such as cleavage or foliation ; when it forms the dominant fabric in a rock, it may be called an S- tectonite .

L-fabric — a linear fabric such as mineral stretching lineation where aggregates of recrystallised grains are stretched out into the long axis of the finite strain ellipsoid , where it forms the dominant fabric in a rock, it may be called an L-tectonite.

Penetrative fabric — a fabric that is present throughout the rock, generally down to the grain scale , although this does also depend on the scale at which the observations take place.

[ 4 ] Magnetic fabric — orientation of magnetic particles within a rock sample or in soils to determine paleomagnetic history [ 5 ] or to quantify tectonic strain.
