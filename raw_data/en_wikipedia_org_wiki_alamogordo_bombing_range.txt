McCabe (2007–2008) White Sands Missile Range ( WSMR ) is a United States Army military testing area and firing range located in the US state of New Mexico . The range was originally established in 1941 as the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range , where the Trinity test site lay at the northern end of the Range, in Socorro County near the towns of Carrizozo and San Antonio . It then became the White Sands Proving Ground on 9 July 1945.

White Sands National Park founded in the 1930s is located within the range.

Significant events [ edit ] The missile range was originally established in 1941 as the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range.

On 16 July 1945, the first atomic bomb (code named Trinity ) was test detonated at Trinity Site near the northern boundary of the range, seven days after the White Sands Proving Ground was officially established, [ 7 ] near the towns of Carrizozo and San Antonio . ( 33°40.636′N 106°28.525′W ﻿ / ﻿ 33.677267°N 106.475417°W ﻿ / 33.677267; -106.475417 ).

[ 8 ] After the conclusion of World War II , 100 long-range German V-2 rockets that were captured by U.S. military troops were brought to WSMR. Of these, 67 were test-fired between 1946 and 1951 from the White Sands V-2 Launching Site . (This was followed by the testing of American rockets, which continues to this day, along with testing other technologies.) On 15 May, 1947, a V-2 rocket fired from WSMR veered off course and landed 4 miles (6.4 km) northeast of Alamogordo, New Mexico.

[ 9 ] Exactly two weeks later, on May 29, 1947, a modified V-2 sounding rocket veered off course and crashed on top of a rocky knoll about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) south of the Juárez business district, leaving a 24 feet (7.3 m) deep by 50 feet (15 m) wide crater.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] On 11 July 1970, the United States Air Force launched an Athena sounding rocket, equipped with re-entry vehicle V-123-D, from the Green River Launch Complex in Utah . While its intended target was inside of WSMR, the rocket instead flew south and impacted 180–200 miles (290–320 km) south of the Mexican border in the Mapimi Desert in the northeastern corner of the Mexican state of Durango .

[ 11 ] On 30 March 1982 NASA 's Space Shuttle Columbia landed on the Northrop Strip at WSMR as the conclusion to mission STS-3 .

[ 12 ] This was the only time that NASA used WSMR as a landing site for the space shuttle.

The site of the 1945 Trinity explosion became part of WSMR.

Geography [ edit ] For the geography and ecology of the WSMR area, see White Sands, New Mexico and Basin and Range Province .

As the largest military installation in the United States , WSMR encompasses almost 3,200 sq mi (8,300 km 2 ) including parts of Doña Ana , Otero , Socorro , Sierra , and Lincoln counties in southern New Mexico .

Nearby military bases [ edit ] Holloman Air Force Base borders WSMR to the east; and WSMR borders the 600,000-acre (2,400 km 2 ) McGregor Range Complex at Fort Bliss to the south (southeast Tularosa Basin and on Otero Mesa ) making them contiguous areas for military testing.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Nearby cities [ edit ] WSMR is located between Las Cruces, New Mexico to the west, Alamogordo, New Mexico 40 miles to the east, and Chaparral, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas to the south.

National park and wildlife refuge [ edit ] White Sands National Park and the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge are federally-protected natural areas contained within the borders of WSMR.

Transportation [ edit ] Major highways [ edit ] New Mexico State Road 213 enters the range from the south from Chaparral, New Mexico and terminates at U.S. Highway 70 , which traverses the southern part of the range in a west-northeast direction and is subject to periodic road closures during test firings at the range.

U.S. Highway 380 runs east-west along the northern edge of WSMR between San Antonio and Carrizozo , and is also subject to periodic closures during test firings.

New Mexico State Road 525 provides access from U.S. Highway 380 to the north end of WSMR near Stallion Army Airfield .

Nearby airports [ edit ] El Paso International Airport is the nearest airport with regularly scheduled commercial flights. There have been no regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights from Las Cruces International Airport since 25 July 2005, when Westward Airways ceased operations; general aviation, New Mexico Army National Guard (4 UH-72 Lakota Helicopters), private charters and CAP, among others, still use the airport. Regularly scheduled commercial flights are also available at the Albuquerque International Sunport , which is located 200 miles (320 km) north of White Sands Missile Range's main base, but is closer to the northern test ranges than El Paso.

National Historic Landmarks [ edit ] On 21 December 1965, the Trinity Site , selected in November 1944 for the Trinity nuclear test conducted on 16 July 1945 [ 15 ] , was designated a National Historic Landmark district, [ 16 ] [ 17 ] and added to the National Register of Historic Places on 15 October 1966.

[ 18 ] The White Sands V-2 Launching Site used for a V-2 static test firing on 15 March 1946, and for the first US V-2 launch on 16 April 1946, received landmark designation on 3 October 1985.

[ 19 ] Current operations [ edit ] Ground-based electro-optical deep-space surveillance telescopes performing space surveillance mission.

The White Sands Test Center , headquartered at the WSMR post area, has branches for tactical systems and electromagnetic radiation, and conducts missile testing and range recovery operations.

[ 20 ] "WSMR Main Post" includes several smaller areas such as the housing area, golf course, "Navy Area", and "Technical Area" [ 21 ] The WSMR Museum offers tours and exhibits including a V-2 rocket returned in May 2004 after restoration.  The White Sands Missile Range Hall of Fame inducts members such as the first range commander, Colonel Harold Turner (1945–1947), in 1980.

[ 22 ] A recreational shooting range just inside the "El Paso gate" on the south is outside of the Post Area.

The 1972 DoD Centers for Countermeasures (CCM) evaluates precision guided munitions and other devices in electronic counter- and counter-countermeasures environments.

[ 23 ] Other operations on WSMR land include the Launch Abort Flight Test Complex for the Pad Abort-1 , the White Sands Launch Complex 37 built for Nike Hercules tests, the White Sands Launch Complex 38 built for Nike Zeus tests with Launch Control Building now used for Patriot missile firings, the North Oscura Peak facility of the Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Directorate, and the 1963 NASA White Sands Test Facility 's ground station for Tracking and Data Relay Satellites , and the SDO ground station with two 18 m (59 ft) antennas.
