Russell is the originator of the theory that life emerged at alkaline submarine hydrothermal vents . Russell's theory is that hydrogen , hydrogen sulfide , and methane , released from submarine alkaline hydrothermal vents, acted upon nitrate , ferrous and ferric iron , carbon dioxide , and protons in ambient ocean waters to form simple organic molecules [ 1 ] Russell studied 360-million-year-old mineral deposits in Ireland , which led to his insight that iron sulfide and hydroxide cells may have provided three-dimensional molds for the first cell walls.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Career [ edit ] Russell attended Chigwell School between 1950 and 1958, [ 6 ] and then was an undergraduate in geology at Queen Mary College of the University of London .
He worked as a mineral exploration geologist in the Solomon Islands and Canada prior to taking his PhD in geochemistry at the University of Durham .
He taught at the Department of Applied Geology at the University of Strathclyde before joining the University of Glasgow as the Dixon Professor of Applied Geology. He was a visiting professor at the University of Grenoble . He was NASA senior research fellow and then a principal scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , California Institute of Technology from 2006 until 2019 and a member of the NASA Astrobiology Institute until 2021.

[ 7 ] Russell has appeared on BBC programmes [ 8 ] [ 9 ] including Horizon's Life on Mars [ 10 ] and Origin of Life [ 11 ] Awards and honours [ edit ] In June 2009, Russell was awarded the William Smith Medal from the Geological Society of London for his lifetime contributions to applied geology.

[ 12 ] In 2018, he was awarded NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal for his research into the emergence of life.
