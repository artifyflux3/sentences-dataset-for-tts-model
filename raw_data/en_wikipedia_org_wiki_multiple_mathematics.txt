In mathematics , a multiple is the product of any quantity and an integer .

[ 1 ] In other words, for the quantities a and b , it can be said that b is a multiple of a if b = na for some integer n , which is called the multiplier . If a is not zero , this is equivalent to saying that b / a {\displaystyle b/a} is an integer.

When a and b are both integers, and b is a multiple of a , then a is called a divisor of b . One says also that a divides b . If a and b are not integers, mathematicians prefer generally to use integer multiple instead of multiple , for clarification. In fact, multiple is used for other kinds of product; for example, a polynomial p is a multiple of another polynomial q if there exists third polynomial r such that p = qr .

Examples [ edit ] 14, 49, −21 and 0 are multiples of 7, whereas 3 and −6 are not. This is because there are integers that 7 may be multiplied by to reach the values of 14, 49, 0 and −21, while there are no such integers for 3 and −6. Each of the products listed below, and in particular, the products for 3 and −6, is the only way that the relevant number can be written as a product of 7 and another real number: 14 = 7 × × 2 ; {\displaystyle 14=7\times 2;} 49 = 7 × × 7 ; {\displaystyle 49=7\times 7;} − − 21 = 7 × × ( − − 3 ) ; {\displaystyle -21=7\times (-3);} 0 = 7 × × 0 ; {\displaystyle 0=7\times 0;} 3 = 7 × × ( 3 / 7 ) , 3 / 7 {\displaystyle 3=7\times (3/7),\quad 3/7} is not an integer; − − 6 = 7 × × ( − − 6 / 7 ) , − − 6 / 7 {\displaystyle -6=7\times (-6/7),\quad -6/7} is not an integer.

Properties [ edit ] 0 is a multiple of every number ( 0 = 0 ⋅ ⋅ b {\displaystyle 0=0\cdot b} ).

The product of any integer n {\displaystyle n} and any integer is a multiple of n {\displaystyle n} . In particular, n {\displaystyle n} , which is equal to n × × 1 {\displaystyle n\times 1} , is a multiple of n {\displaystyle n} (every integer is a multiple of itself), since 1 is an integer.

If a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are multiples of x , {\displaystyle x,} then a + b {\displaystyle a+b} and a − − b {\displaystyle a-b} are also multiples of x {\displaystyle x} .

Submultiple [ edit ] In some texts [ which?

] , " a is a submultiple of b " has the meaning of " a being a unit fraction of b " ( a = b / n ) or, equivalently, " b being an integer multiple n of a " ( b = n a ). This terminology is also used with units of measurement (for example by the BIPM [ 2 ] and NIST [ 3 ] ), where a unit submultiple is obtained by prefixing the main unit, defined as the quotient of the main unit by an integer, mostly a power of 10 3 . For example, a millimetre is the 1000-fold submultiple of a metre .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] As another example, one inch may be considered as a 12-fold submultiple of a foot , or a 36-fold submultiple of a yard .
