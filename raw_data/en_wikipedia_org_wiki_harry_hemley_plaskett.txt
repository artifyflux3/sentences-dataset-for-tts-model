From 1932 to 1960, he served as the Savilian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford , and in 1963 was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society .

[ 2 ] Life [ edit ] Harry Hemley Plaskett was born in Toronto , Ontario on July 5, 1893. His parents were Rebecca Hemley and John Stanley Plaskett , who at the time was working as a machinist in the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto , but who would later go on to become the first director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, and a Gold Medal winner in his own right.

[ 3 ] After receiving his B.A. from Toronto in 1916, he joined the Canadian Corps , serving in the field artillery in France from 1917-1918.

[ 2 ] Following this, and a year spent working with Professor Alfred Fowler at Imperial College , he returned to Canada, and was appointed to the staff of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria , B.C. In 1928, he was appointed Professor of Astrophysics at Harvard University , and in 1932 succeeded H. H. Turner as Savilian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford.

[ 2 ] In May, 1936 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society .

[ 4 ] He was president of the Royal Astronomical Society just after World War II.

His time at Oxford was interrupted by war service: from 1939 to 1940, he was an anti-aircraft officer, and from 1940 to 1944 he worked on experimental navigation for the Ministry of Aircraft Production .

[ 2 ] From 1951 to 1955 he worked alongside Walter Stibbs .

[ 5 ] He retired from Oxford in 1960, becoming a Professor Emeritus of the university, but remained active in astronomical research almost until the end of his life.

Family [ edit ] He had married in 1921 Edith Alice Smith, with whom he had two children, Barbara and John Stanley. They were to remain married until his death in 1980.

[ 6 ] Honors [ edit ] The asteroid 2905 Plaskett , discovered by Edward Bowell in 1982, was named in his and his father's memory.
