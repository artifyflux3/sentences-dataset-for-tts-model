[ 1 ] Initially the observatory was dedicated to astrometry , geodetic and meteorological observation and tracking the time.

The minor planet 1346 Gotha was named after the city of Gotha in recognition of the observatory.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] Planning for the observatory began in 1787 by the court astronomer Baron Franz Xaver von Zach , with the financing of Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg . It was based upon the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford , England . The building was divided into five parts, with the central section holding a revolving dome. There were two wings to provide quarters for the staff.

[ 3 ] During Peter Andreas Hansen 's term, the observatory was dismantled and moved to a less exposed location in Gotha.

[ 3 ] The observatory was closed in 1934.

[ 4 ] Instruments [ edit ] Meridian Circle, at Gotha Observatory till 1936 Around 1800, the observatory became an international center for astronomy, being the most modern astronomical institute primarily for its instruments.

[ 5 ] The instruments came from London , England , the standard place to acquire them in the 18th century.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] These included an eighteen-inch quadrant , a two-foot transit instrument , three Hadley sextants , an achromatic heliometer , a two-foot achromatic refractor , a Gregorian reflector and many clocks.

[ 5 ] By the start of the nineteenth century improved instrumentation was acquired from Munich , the standard place to acquire them in the 19th century: [ 4 ] consisting of a theodolite ( Reichenbach , Utzschneider & Liebherr), a different heliometer ( Fraunhofer ), new mounting, and three-foot meridian circle (Ertel, Utzschneider & Fraunhofer ). No spectroscopy or photography was performed at the observatory and the only astrophysical equipment of the observatory was a Zöllner photometer .

[ 5 ] Directors [ edit ] The observatory directors were as follows: [ 7 ] Franz Xaver von Zach , 1787–1802 Bernhard von Lindenau , 1802 - ?

Johann Franz Encke , 1822–1825 [ 8 ] Peter Andreas Hansen 1825 - 1876 [ 8 ] Karl Nikolaus Adalbert Krueger 1876 for four years [ 9 ] Hugo von Seeliger , 1881 [ 10 ] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Seeberg-Sternwarte Gotha .
