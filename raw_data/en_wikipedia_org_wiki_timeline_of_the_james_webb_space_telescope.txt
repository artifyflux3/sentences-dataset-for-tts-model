( July 2022 ) The first six primary mirror segments being prepared for final cryogenic acceptance testing, 2011 The 18 main mirror segments for JWST in special shipping cans, 2012 Backplane being transported to California, 2013 Vacuum Chamber A prepared for the James Webb Space Telescope, 2014 Main mirror assembled, May 2016 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is an international 21st-century space observatory that was launched on 25 December 2021.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is intended to be the premier observatory of the 2020s, combining the largest mirror yet on a near-infrared space telescope with a suite of technologically advanced instruments from around the world.

[ 3 ] The telescope is designed to last at least five and a half years (six months calibration plus five years science operations), but with a goal of ten years.

[ 4 ] The limiting factor is expected to be fuel to maintain its halo orbit , of which there is enough for at least ten years.

[ 4 ] It was announced in December 2021 that due to the accuracy of the orbital insertion and course correction burns, the telescope had more fuel available than originally planned and could operate for "significantly" longer than the original ten year planned life span.

[ 5 ] JWST cost approximately $10 billion in its design, construction, and five years of operations (does not include extended mission funding), as well as international contributions.

[ 2 ] After-launch [ edit ] After launch, the James Webb Space Telescope was unfolded in the following planned order.

[ 44 ] spacecraft appendages (solar arrays, high gain antenna) sunshield extend tower secondary mirror primary mirror For 29 days after launch, JWST took a 1.51 million kilometer (940,000 mile) trajectory to L2 halo orbit .

[ 45 ] For six months JWST prepared for full-time science operation. This included letting all instruments cool down, calibrating the mirrors and instruments, and other procedures.

[ 46 ] Five-year science mission began after six months.

[ 46 ] Ten years of operation goal, and enough fuel to maintain halo orbit for at least ten years is included.

[ 4 ] After-launch deployment [ edit ] Nominal deployment sequence James Webb Space Telescope post-launch deployment timeline [ 47 ] Nearly a month after launch, a trajectory correction was initiated to place the James Webb Space Telescope into a halo orbit at L 2 .

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] Its next five months were spent cooling NIRCam and the Mid-Infrared Instrument down further, aligning and calibrating its mirrors while focusing on HD 84406, a bright star in the constellation Ursa Major , and testing the instruments.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] First images [ edit ] Webb’s First Deep Field ( MIRI and NIRCam Images Side by Side), showing SMACS J0723.3-7327 .

[ 54 ] Webb's first operational image was the Webb's First Deep Field , released on July 11, 2022, with it being the deepest sharp infrared image of the universe to date.
