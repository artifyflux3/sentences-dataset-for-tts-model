He was awarded a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award in 2013.

[ 2 ] Background [ edit ] He graduated with a first-class degree in natural sciences from Robinson College, Cambridge in 1994 and completed his PhD under Andrew Watson at the University of East Anglia in 1998.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] Gaia hypothesis [ edit ] Lenton has taken an interest in the Gaia hypothesis for much of his career. Early in his career, in the journal Nature , [ 4 ] Lenton addressed a concern that the Gaia hypothesis was incompatible with the theory of natural selection by demonstrating that a model based on Daisyworld was strengthened by incorporating natural selection. In the same year, Lenton co-authored the paper "Spora and Gaia" with W. D. Hamilton , proposing that marine algae's tendency to release dimethyl sulfide , which in turn acts as a chemical precursor for cloud condensation nuclei , is an adaptive trait, as the algae can use the clouds to disperse themselves around the world.

[ 5 ] Lenton, with Andy Watson , co-authored the book Revolutions that Made the Earth ; [ 6 ] it expands on the ideas of James Lovelock on the Gaia hypothesis, by highlighting mechanisms by which the Earth system has been stabilised by negative feedbacks throughout Earth history.

Climate change [ edit ] Impacts [ edit ] Lenton has participated in studies of possible population displacement due to climate change .

[ 7 ] Tipping points [ edit ] Lenton has been called 'a leading tipping point expert'.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Lenton was awarded the OBE in the 2025 Birthday Honours , for services to understanding climate tipping points.
