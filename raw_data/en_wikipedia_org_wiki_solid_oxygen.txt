For solids used as a source of oxygen or as an oxidizer, see Oxidizing agent .

Solid oxygen is the solid ice phase of oxygen. It forms below 54.36 K (−218.79 °C; −361.82 °F) at standard atmospheric pressure . Solid oxygen O 2 , like liquid oxygen , is a clear substance with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red part of the visible light spectrum.

Oxygen molecules have a relationship between the molecular magnetization and crystal structures , electronic structures , and superconductivity . Oxygen is the only simple diatomic molecule (and one of the few molecules in general) to carry a magnetic moment .

[ 1 ] This makes solid oxygen particularly interesting, as it is considered a "spin-controlled" crystal [ 1 ] that displays antiferromagnetic magnetic order in the low temperature phases. The magnetic properties of oxygen have been studied extensively.

[ 2 ] At very high pressures, solid oxygen changes from an insulating to a metallic state; [ 3 ] and at very low temperatures, it transforms to a superconducting state .

[ 4 ] Structural investigations of solid oxygen began in the 1920s and, at present, six distinct crystallographic phases are established unambiguously.

The density of solid oxygen ranges from 21 cm 3 / mol in the α-phase, to 23.5 cm 3 /mol in the γ-phase.

[ 5 ] Phases [ edit ] Phase diagram for solid oxygen Six different phases of solid oxygen are known to exist: [ 1 ] [ 6 ] α-phase: light blue –  forms at 1 atm, below  23.8 K, monoclinic crystal structure, space group C 2/ m (no. 12).

β-phase: faint blue to pink –  forms at 1 atm, below  43.8 K, rhombohedral crystal structure, space group R 3 m (no. 166). At room temperature and high pressure begins transformation to tetraoxygen.

γ-phase: faint blue –  forms at 1 atm, below  54.36 K, cubic crystal structure, Pm 3 n (no. 223).

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] δ-phase: orange –  forms at room temperature at a pressure of 9 GPa ε-phase: dark-red to black –  forms at room temperature at pressures greater than 10 GPa ζ-phase: metallic –  forms at pressures greater than 96 GPa It has been found that oxygen is solidified into a state called the β-phase at room temperature by applying pressure, and with further increasing pressure, the β-phase undergoes phase transitions to the δ-phase at 9 GPa and the ε-phase at 10 GPa; and, due to the increase in molecular interactions , the color of the β-phase changes to pink, orange, then red (the stable octaoxygen phase), and the red color further darkens to black with increasing pressure. It was found that a metallic ζ-phase appears at 96 GPa when ε-phase oxygen is further compressed.

[ 6 ] Red oxygen [ edit ] Main article: Octaoxygen As the pressure of oxygen at room temperature is increased through 10 gigapascals (1,500,000 psi), it undergoes a dramatic phase transition . Its volume decreases significantly [ 9 ] and it changes color from sky-blue to deep red.

[ 10 ] However, this is a different allotrope of oxygen , O 8 , not merely a different crystalline phase of O 2 .

Ball-and-stick model of O 8 Part of the crystal structure of ε-oxygen Metallic oxygen [ edit ] A ζ -phase appears at 96 GPa when ε-phase oxygen is further compressed.

[ 9 ] This phase was discovered in 1990 by pressurizing oxygen to 132 GPa.

[ 3 ] The ζ-phase with metallic cluster [ 11 ] exhibits superconductivity at pressures over 100 GPa and a temperature below 0.6 K.
