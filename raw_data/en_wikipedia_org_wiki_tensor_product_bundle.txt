In differential geometry , the tensor product of vector bundles E , F (over the same space X ) is a vector bundle, denoted by E ⊗ F , whose fiber over each point x ∈ X is the tensor product of vector spaces E x ⊗ F x .

[ 1 ] Example: If O is a trivial line bundle, then E ⊗ O = E for any E .

Example: E ⊗ E ∗ is canonically isomorphic to the endomorphism bundle End( E ) , where E ∗ is the dual bundle of E .

Example: A line bundle L has a tensor inverse: in fact, L ⊗ L ∗ is (isomorphic to) a trivial bundle by the previous example, as End( L ) is trivial. Thus, the set of the isomorphism classes of all line bundles on some topological space X forms an abelian group called the Picard group of X .

Variants [ edit ] One can also define a symmetric power and an exterior power of a vector bundle in a similar way. For example, a section of Λ Λ p T ∗ ∗ M {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{p}T^{*}M} is a differential p -form and a section of Λ Λ p T ∗ ∗ M ⊗ ⊗ E {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{p}T^{*}M\otimes E} is a differential p -form with values in a vector bundle E .

See also [ edit ] Tensor product of modules Notes [ edit ] ^ To construct a tensor-product bundle over a paracompact base, first note the construction is clear for trivial bundles. For the general case, if the base is compact, choose E ' such that E ⊕ E ' is trivial. Choose F ' in the same way. Then let E ⊗ F be the subbundle of ( E ⊕ E ' ) ⊗ ( F ⊕ F ' ) with the desired fibers. Finally, use the approximation argument to handle a non-compact base. See Hatcher for a general direct approach.
