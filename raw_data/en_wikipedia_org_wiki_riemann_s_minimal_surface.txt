In differential geometry , Riemann's minimal surface is a one-parameter family of minimal surfaces described by Bernhard Riemann in a posthumous paper published in 1867.

[ 1 ] Surfaces in the family are singly periodic minimal surfaces with an infinite number of ends asymptotic to parallel planes, each plane "shelf" connected with catenoid -like bridges to the neighbouring ones. Their intersections with horizontal planes are circles or lines; Riemann proved that they were the only minimal surfaces fibered by circles in parallel planes besides the catenoid , helicoid and plane. They are also the only nontrivial embedded minimal surfaces in Euclidean 3-space invariant under the group generated by a nontrivial translation.

[ 2 ] It is possible to attach extra handles to the surfaces, producing higher- genus minimal surface families.
