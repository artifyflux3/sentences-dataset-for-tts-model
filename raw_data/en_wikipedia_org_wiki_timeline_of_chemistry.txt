This timeline of chemistry lists important works, discoveries, ideas, inventions, and experiments that significantly changed humanity's understanding of the modern science known as chemistry, defined as the scientific study of the composition of matter and of its interactions.

Known as " the central science ", the study of chemistry is strongly influenced by, and exerts a strong influence on, many other scientific and technological fields.  Many historical developments that are considered to have had a significant impact upon our modern understanding of chemistry are also considered to have been key discoveries in such fields as physics, biology, astronomy, geology, and materials science.

[ 1 ] Pre-17th century [ edit ] Aristotle (384–322 BCE) Ambix, cucurbit and retort, the alchemical implements of Zosimus c. 300 (man. Paris, Grec 2327 ).

Imaginative depiction of Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (Latin: Geber ) Prior to the acceptance of the scientific method and its application to the field of chemistry, it is somewhat controversial to consider many of the people listed below as "chemists" in the modern sense of the word. However, the ideas of certain great thinkers, either for their prescience, or for their wide and long-term acceptance, bear listing here.

c. 450 BC [ edit ] Empedocles asserts that all things are composed of four primal roots (later to be renamed stoicheia or elements ): earth, air, fire, and water, whereby two active and opposing cosmic forces , love and strife, act upon these elements, combining and separating them into infinitely varied forms.

[ 2 ] c. 440 BC [ edit ] Leucippus and Democritus propose the idea of the atom, an indivisible particle that all matter is made of.  This idea is largely rejected by natural philosophers in favor of the Aristotelian view (see below).

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] c. 360 BC [ edit ] Plato coins term ‘ elements ’ ( stoicheia ) and in his dialogue Timaeus , which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a rudimentary treatise on chemistry, assumes that the minute particle of each element had a special geometric shape: tetrahedron (fire), octahedron (air), icosahedron (water), and cube (earth).

[ 5 ] c. 350 BC [ edit ] Aristotle , expanding on Empedocles, proposes idea of a substance as a combination of matter and form .  Describes theory of the Five Elements , fire, water, earth, air, and aether.  This theory is largely accepted throughout the western world for over 1000 years.

[ 6 ] c. 50 BC [ edit ] Lucretius publishes De Rerum Natura , a poetic description of the ideas of atomism .

[ 7 ] c. 300 [ edit ] Zosimos of Panopolis writes some of the oldest known books on alchemy , which he defines as the study of the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying and disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies.

This achievement, characterized of fully artificial chemicals as source for synthesis process, opened an era called as "Woodwardian era" or "chemical era" when many drugs and chemicals, as well as organic synthesis methods invented. Due to the growth of chemical industry, many fields has grown, such as drug industry .

[ 121 ] 1945–1946 [ edit ] Felix Bloch and Edward Mills Purcell develop the process of nuclear magnetic resonance , an analytical technique important in elucidating structures of molecules, especially in organic chemistry .

[ 122 ] Jacob A. Marinsky , Lawrence E. Glendenin , and Charles D. Coryell perform the first confirmed synthesis of Promethium , filling in the last "gap" in the periodic table.

[ 123 ] 1951 [ edit ] Linus Pauling uses X-ray crystallography to deduce the secondary structure of proteins.

[ 110 ] 1952 [ edit ] Alan Walsh pioneers the field of atomic absorption spectroscopy , an important quantitative spectroscopy method that allows one to measure specific concentrations of a material in a mixture.

[ 124 ] 1952 [ edit ] Robert Burns Woodward , Geoffrey Wilkinson , and Ernst Otto Fischer discover the structure of ferrocene , one of the founding discoveries of the field of organometallic chemistry .

[ 126 ] 1957 [ edit ] Jens Skou discovers Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase , the first ion-transporting enzyme.

[ 127 ] 1958 [ edit ] Max Perutz and John Kendrew use X-ray crystallography to elucidate a protein structure, specifically sperm whale myoglobin .

[ 128 ] 1962 [ edit ] Neil Bartlett synthesizes xenon hexafluoroplatinate , showing for the first time that the noble gases can form chemical compounds.

[ 129 ] 1962 [ edit ] George Olah observes carbocations via superacid reactions.

[ 130 ] 1964 [ edit ] Richard R. Ernst performs experiments that will lead to the development of the technique of Fourier transform NMR.  This would greatly increase the sensitivity of the technique, and open the door for magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.

[ 131 ] 1965 [ edit ] Robert Burns Woodward and Roald Hoffmann propose the Woodward–Hoffmann rules , which use the symmetry of molecular orbitals to explain the stereochemistry of chemical reactions.

[ 132 ] [ 133 ] 1970 [ edit ] John Pople develops the Gaussian program greatly easing computational chemistry calculations.

[ 134 ] 1971 [ edit ] Yves Chauvin offered an explanation of the reaction mechanism of olefin metathesis reactions.

[ 135 ] 1975 [ edit ] Karl Barry Sharpless and group discover a stereoselective oxidation reactions including Sharpless epoxidation , [ 136 ] [ 137 ] Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation , [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] and Sharpless oxyamination .

[ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] Buckminsterfullerene, C 60 1985 [ edit ] Harold Kroto , Robert Curl and Richard Smalley discover fullerenes , a class of large carbon molecules superficially resembling the geodesic dome designed by architect R. Buckminster Fuller .

[ 144 ] 1991 [ edit ] Sumio Iijima uses electron microscopy to discover a type of cylindrical fullerene known as a carbon nanotube , though earlier work had been done in the field as early as 1951.  This material is an important component in the field of nanotechnology .

[ 145 ] 1994 [ edit ] First total synthesis of Taxol by Robert A. Holton and his group.

[ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ] 1995 [ edit ] Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman produce the first Bose–Einstein condensate , a substance that displays quantum mechanical properties on the macroscopic scale.
