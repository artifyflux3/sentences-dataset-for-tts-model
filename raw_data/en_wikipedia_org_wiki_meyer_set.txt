Meyer sets have several equivalent characterizations; they are named after Yves Meyer , who introduced and studied them in the context of diophantine approximation. Nowadays Meyer sets are best known as mathematical model for quasicrystals . However, Meyer's work precedes the discovery of quasicrystals by more than a decade and was entirely motivated by number theoretic questions.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Definition and characterizations [ edit ] A subset X of a metric space is relatively dense if there exists a number r such that all points of X are within distance r of X , and it is uniformly discrete if there exists a number ε such that no two points of X are within distance ε of each other. A set that is both relatively dense and uniformly discrete is called a Delone set . When X is a subset of a vector space , its Minkowski difference X − X is the set { x − y | x , y in X } of differences of pairs of elements of X .

[ 3 ] With these definitions, a Meyer set may be defined as a relatively dense set X for which X − X is uniformly discrete. Equivalently, it is a Delone set for which X − X is Delone, [ 1 ] or a Delone set X for which there exists a finite set F with X − X ⊂ X + F [ 4 ] Some additional equivalent characterizations involve the set X ϵ ϵ = { y ∣ ∣ | x ⋅ ⋅ y − − 1 | ≤ ≤ ε ε for all x ∈ ∈ X } {\displaystyle X^{\epsilon }=\{y\mid |x\cdot y-1|\leq \varepsilon {\text{ for all }}x\in X\}} defined for a given X and ε , and approximating (as ε approaches zero) the definition of the reciprocal lattice of a lattice . A relatively dense set X is a Meyer set if and only if For all ε > 0, X ε is relatively dense, or equivalently There exists an ε with 0 < ε < 1/2 for which X ε is relatively dense.

[ 1 ] A character of an additively closed subset of a vector space is a function that maps the set to the unit circle in the plane of complex numbers , such that the sum of any two elements is mapped to the product of their images. A set X is a harmonious set if, for every character χ on the additive closure of X and every ε > 0, there exists a continuous character on the whole space that ε -approximates χ . Then a relatively dense set X is a Meyer set if and only if it is harmonious.

[ 1 ] Examples [ edit ] Meyer sets include The points of any lattice The vertices of any rhombic Penrose tiling [ 5 ] The Minkowski sum of another Meyer set with any nonempty finite set [ 4 ] Any relatively dense subset of another Meyer set [ 6 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b c d Moody, Robert V.

^ Moody gives different definitions for relative density and uniform discreteness, specialized to locally compact groups, but remarks that these definitions coincide with the usual ones for real vector spaces.
