The magnitude of an Euler measure [ edit ] By induction, it is easy to show that independent of dimension , the Euler measure of a closed bounded convex polyhedron always equals 1, while the Euler measure of a d -D relative - open bounded convex polyhedron is ( ‚àí ‚àí 1 ) d {\displaystyle (-1)^{d}} .
