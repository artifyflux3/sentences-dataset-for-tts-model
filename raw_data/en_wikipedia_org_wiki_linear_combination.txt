In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **linear combination** or **superposition** is an [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics) "Expression (mathematics)") constructed from a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of terms by multiplying each term by a constant and adding the results (e.g. a linear combination of _x_ and _y_ would be any expression of the form _ax_ + _by_, where _a_ and _b_ are constants).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination#cite_note-4) The concept of linear combinations is central to [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") and related fields of mathematics. Most of this article deals with linear combinations in the context of a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), with some generalizations given at the end of the article.

Let _V_ be a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over the field _K_. As usual, we call elements of _V_ _[vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector\_space "Vector space")_ and call elements of _K_ _[scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar\_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)")_. If **v**1,...,**v**_n_ are vectors and _a_ 1,...,_a_ _n_ are scalars, then the _linear combination of those vectors with those scalars as coefficients_ is

![Image 6: {\displaystyle a_{1}\mathbf {v} _{1}+a_{2}\mathbf {v} _{2}+a_{3}\mathbf {v} _{3}+\cdots +a_{n}\mathbf {v} _{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06a8dab6b20c2d8f396fac1847e39cc3e1a3e7dc)
There is some ambiguity in the use of the term "linear combination" as to whether it refers to the expression or to its value. In most cases the value is emphasized, as in the assertion "the set of all linear combinations of **v**1,...,**v**_n_ always forms a subspace". However, one could also say "two different linear combinations can have the same value" in which case the reference is to the expression. The subtle difference between these uses is the essence of the notion of [linear dependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_dependence "Linear dependence"): a family _F_ of vectors is linearly independent precisely if any linear combination of the vectors in _F_ (as value) is uniquely so (as expression). In any case, even when viewed as expressions, all that matters about a linear combination is the coefficient of each **v**_i_; trivial modifications such as permuting the terms or adding terms with zero coefficient do not produce distinct linear combinations.

In a given situation, _K_ and _V_ may be specified explicitly, or they may be obvious from context. In that case, we often speak of _a linear combination of the vectors_**v**1,...,**v**_n_, with the coefficients unspecified (except that they must belong to _K_). Or, if _S_ is a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of _V_, we may speak of _a linear combination of vectors in S_, where both the coefficients and the vectors are unspecified, except that the vectors must belong to the set _S_ (and the coefficients must belong to _K_). Finally, we may speak simply of _a linear combination_, where nothing is specified (except that the vectors must belong to _V_ and the coefficients must belong to _K_); in this case one is probably referring to the expression, since every vector in _V_ is certainly the value of some linear combination.

Note that by definition, a linear combination involves only [finitely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set") many vectors (except as described in the [§Generalizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination#Generalizations) section. However, the set _S_ that the vectors are taken from (if one is mentioned) can still be [infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity"); each individual linear combination will only involve finitely many vectors. Also, there is no reason that _n_ cannot be [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number) "0 (number)"); in that case, we declare by convention that the result of the linear combination is the [zero vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_vector "Zero vector") in _V_.

Examples and counterexamples
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linear_combination&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Examples and counterexamples")]

Let the field _K_ be the set **R** of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), and let the vector space _V_ be the [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space")**R**3. Consider the vectors **e**1 = (1,0,0), **e**2 = (0,1,0) and **e**3 = (0,0,1). Then _any_[vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") in **R**3 is a linear combination of **e**1, **e**2, and**e**3.

To see that this is so, take an arbitrary vector (_a_ 1,_a_ 2,_a_ 3) in **R**3, and write:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3})&=(a_{1},0,0)+(0,a_{2},0)+(0,0,a_{3})\\[6pt]&=a_{1}(1,0,0)+a_{2}(0,1,0)+a_{3}(0,0,1)\\[6pt]&=a_{1}\mathbf {e} _{1}+a_{2}\mathbf {e} _{2}+a_{3}\mathbf {e} _{3}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe009e7f4298edf1f8c3cb4a91ad37cf55138972)
Let _K_ be the set **C** of all [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"), and let _V_ be the set C**C**(_R_) of all [continuous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") from the [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line")**R** to the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane")**C**. Consider the vectors (functions) _f_ and _g_ defined by _f_(_t_):= _e_ _it_ and _g_(_t_):= _e_−_it_. (Here, _e_ is the [base of the natural logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant) "E (mathematical constant)"), about 2.71828..., and _i_ is the [imaginary unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit "Imaginary unit"), a square root of −1.) Some linear combinations of _f_ and _g_ are:

*   ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \cos t={\tfrac {1}{2}}\,e^{it}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,e^{-it}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9caf0dd7272872ad9b6048360604e016136033d2)

*   ![Image 9: {\displaystyle 2\sin t=(-i)e^{it}+(i)e^{-it}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a9ce545de87b3da60ed2d598aeb2c731f748ce8)

On the other hand, the constant function 3 is _not_ a linear combination of _f_ and _g_. To see this, suppose that 3 could be written as a linear combination of _e_ _it_ and _e_−_it_. This means that there would exist complex scalars _a_ and _b_ such that _ae_ _it_ + _be_−_it_ = 3 for all real numbers _t_. Setting _t_ = 0 and _t_ = π gives the equations _a_ + _b_ = 3 and _a_ + _b_ = −3, and clearly this cannot happen. (See [Euler's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity "Euler's identity").)

Let _K_ be **R**, **C**, or any field, and let _V_ be the set _P_ of all [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") with coefficients taken from the field _K_. Consider the vectors (polynomials) _p_ 1:=1, _p_ 2:= _x_ + 1, and _p_ 3:= _x_ 2 + _x_ + 1.

Is the polynomial _x_ 2−1 a linear combination of _p_ 1, _p_ 2, and _p_ 3? To find out, consider an arbitrary linear combination of these vectors and try to see when it equals the desired vector _x_ 2−1. Picking arbitrary coefficients _a_ 1, _a_ 2, and _a_ 3, we want

![Image 10: {\displaystyle a_{1}(1)+a_{2}(x+1)+a_{3}(x^{2}+x+1)=x^{2}-1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6115ddcd36c0c6733807246de416d226a2a3f21)
Multiplying the polynomials out, this means

![Image 11: {\displaystyle (a_{1})+(a_{2}x+a_{2})+(a_{3}x^{2}+a_{3}x+a_{3})=x^{2}-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0cfebc344eb126e2f4bc4cc3874512758d4bfa0f)
and collecting like powers of _x_, we get

![Image 12: {\displaystyle a_{3}x^{2}+(a_{2}+a_{3})x+(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3})=1x^{2}+0x+(-1).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3e947732aab5d7355541468b439980019357ee87)
Two polynomials are equal [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") their corresponding coefficients are equal, so we can conclude

![Image 13: {\displaystyle a_{3}=1,\quad a_{2}+a_{3}=0,\quad a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=-1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fa859cbabc345c7c2b1f1029f5a68957ae03e7cf)
This [system of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations "System of linear equations") can easily be solved. First, the first equation simply says that _a_ 3 is 1. Knowing that, we can solve the second equation for _a_ 2, which comes out to −1. Finally, the last equation tells us that _a_ 1 is also −1. Therefore, the only possible way to get a linear combination is with these coefficients. Indeed,

![Image 14: {\displaystyle x^{2}-1=-1-(x+1)+(x^{2}+x+1)=-p_{1}-p_{2}+p_{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/42bc7f8e4e0e20316742991f0716610c916302b7)
so _x_ 2−1 _is_ a linear combination of _p_ 1, _p_ 2, and _p_ 3.

On the other hand, what about the polynomial _x_ 3−1? If we try to make this vector a linear combination of _p_ 1, _p_ 2, and _p_ 3, then following the same process as before, we get the equation

![Image 15: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&0x^{3}+a_{3}x^{2}+(a_{2}+a_{3})x+(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3})\\[5pt]={}&1x^{3}+0x^{2}+0x+(-1).\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/afb000b9840823f66f23ced29ab3970f598eba9e)
However, when we set corresponding coefficients equal in this case, the equation for _x_ 3 is

![Image 16: {\displaystyle 0=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2bb1a7bcdbd7e274b7b8581e4357f09dbeee7fa)
which is always false. Therefore, there is no way for this to work, and _x_ 3−1 is _not_ a linear combination of _p_ 1, _p_ 2, and _p_ 3.

Take an arbitrary field _K_, an arbitrary vector space _V_, and let **v**1,...,**v**_n_ be vectors (in _V_). It is interesting to consider the set of _all_ linear combinations of these vectors. This set is called the _[linear span](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear\_span "Linear span")_ (or just _span_) of the vectors, say _S_ = {**v**1, ..., **v**_n_}. We write the span of _S_ as span(_S_)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination#cite_note-6) or sp(_S_):

![Image 17: {\displaystyle \operatorname {span} (\mathbf {v} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {v} _{n}):=\{a_{1}\mathbf {v} _{1}+\cdots +a_{n}\mathbf {v} _{n}:a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}\in K\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ef16da42a979f6f6f816ad6272d17b1c967775f)

Linear independence
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linear_combination&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Linear independence")]

Suppose that, for some sets of vectors **v**1,...,**v**_n_, a single vector can be written in two different ways as a linear combination of them:

![Image 18: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\sum _{i}a_{i}\mathbf {v} _{i}=\sum _{i}b_{i}\mathbf {v} _{i}{\text{ where }}a_{i}\neq b_{i}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f6b1fa5f144d43a3756d0a062fa4611f2457f7ab)
This is equivalent, by subtracting these (![Image 19: {\displaystyle c_{i}:=a_{i}-b_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f4d3008ec40ae4edaa8eacf9d546d595753d7a10)), to saying a non-trivial combination is zero:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination#cite_note-8)

![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbf {0} =\sum _{i}c_{i}\mathbf {v} _{i}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22e3abb22b48074ec991013f1800319118477119)
If that is possible, then **v**1,...,**v**_n_ are called _[linearly dependent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly\_dependent "Linearly dependent")_; otherwise, they are _linearly independent_. Similarly, we can speak of linear dependence or independence of an arbitrary set _S_ of vectors.

If _S_ is linearly independent and the span of _S_ equals _V_, then _S_ is a [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)") for _V_.

Affine, conical, and convex combinations
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linear_combination&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Affine, conical, and convex combinations")]

By restricting the coefficients used in linear combinations, one can define the related concepts of [affine combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_combination "Affine combination"), [conical combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conical_combination "Conical combination"), and [convex combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_combination "Convex combination"), and the associated notions of sets closed under these operations.

| [Convex combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_combination "Convex combination") | ![Image 24: {\displaystyle a_{i}\geq 0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6aefe5d34ff87d51c5218190cb4139ec9e35d8a9) and ![Image 25: {\textstyle \sum a_{i}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/127931a1f73db310d9661793631ab0ec58400dc6) | [Convex set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set "Convex set") | [Simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex "Simplex") |

Because these are more _restricted_ operations, more subsets will be closed under them, so affine subsets, convex cones, and convex sets are _generalizations_ of vector subspaces: a vector subspace is also an affine subspace, a convex cone, and a convex set, but a convex set need not be a vector subspace, affine, or a convex cone.

These concepts often arise when one can take certain linear combinations of objects, but not any: for example, [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution") are closed under convex combination (they form a convex set), but not conical or affine combinations (or linear), and [positive measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_measure "Positive measure") are closed under conical combination but not affine or linear – hence one defines [signed measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_measure "Signed measure") as the linear closure.

Linear and affine combinations can be defined over any field (or ring), but conical and convex combination require a notion of "positive", and hence can only be defined over an [ordered field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field "Ordered field") (or [ordered ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_ring "Ordered ring")), generally the real numbers.

If one allows only [scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication"), not addition, one obtains a (not necessarily convex) [cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(linear_algebra) "Cone (linear algebra)"); one often restricts the definition to only allowing multiplication by positive scalars.

All of these concepts are usually defined as subsets of an ambient vector space (except for affine spaces, which are also considered as "vector spaces forgetting the origin"), rather than being axiomatized independently.

More abstractly, in the language of [operad theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operad_theory "Operad theory"), one can consider vector spaces to be [algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_(ring_theory) "Algebra (ring theory)") over the operad ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{\infty }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/673301487749dd943aa0f7cf88f146b74ab03d3b) (the infinite [direct sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_sum_of_modules "Direct sum of modules"), so only finitely many terms are non-zero; this corresponds to only taking finite sums), which parametrizes linear combinations: the vector ![Image 27: {\displaystyle (2,3,-5,0,\dots )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ee687afd19f25b304d7a94ebe045946c85bfbc8) for instance corresponds to the linear combination ![Image 28: {\displaystyle 2\mathbf {v} _{1}+3\mathbf {v} _{2}-5\mathbf {v} _{3}+0\mathbf {v} _{4}+\cdots }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a74cca7eadd08f4ecc246dd4389d729e658fc4e7). Similarly, one can consider affine combinations, conical combinations, and convex combinations to correspond to the sub-operads where the terms sum to 1, the terms are all non-negative, or both, respectively. Graphically, these are the infinite affine hyperplane, the infinite hyper-octant, and the infinite simplex. This formalizes what is meant by ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ed657d7f0d7aa156e7b9b171f22b4a3aa6482c3) being or the standard simplex being model spaces, and such observations as that every bounded [convex polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polytope "Convex polytope") is the image of a simplex. Here suboperads correspond to more restricted operations and thus more general theories.

From this point of view, we can think of linear combinations as the most general sort of operation on a vector space – saying that a vector space is an algebra over the operad of linear combinations is precisely the statement that _all possible_ algebraic operations in a vector space are linear combinations.

The basic operations of addition and scalar multiplication, together with the existence of an [additive identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_identity "Additive identity") and additive inverses, cannot be combined in any more complicated way than the generic linear combination: the basic operations are a [generating set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set "Generating set") for the operad of all linear combinations.

Ultimately, this fact lies at the heart of the usefulness of linear combinations in the study of vector spaces.

If _V_ is a [topological vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space "Topological vector space"), then there may be a way to make sense of certain _infinite_ linear combinations, using the topology of _V_. For example, we might be able to speak of _a_ 1**v**1+ _a_ 2**v**2+ _a_ 3**v**3+⋯, going on forever. Such infinite linear combinations do not always make sense; we call them _convergent_ when they do. Allowing more linear combinations in this case can also lead to a different concept of span, linear independence, and basis. The articles on the various flavors of topological vector spaces go into more detail about these.

If _K_ is a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring") instead of a field, then everything that has been said above about linear combinations generalizes to this case without change. The only difference is that we call spaces like this _V_[modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics) "Module (mathematics)") instead of vector spaces. If _K_ is a [noncommutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_ring "Noncommutative ring"), then the concept still generalizes, with one caveat: since modules over noncommutative rings come in left and right versions, our linear combinations may also come in either of these versions, whatever is appropriate for the given module. This is simply a matter of doing scalar multiplication on the correct side.

A more complicated twist comes when _V_ is a [bimodule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodule "Bimodule") over two rings, _K_ L and _K_ R. In that case, the most general linear combination looks like

![Image 30: {\displaystyle a_{1}\mathbf {v} _{1}b_{1}+\cdots +a_{n}\mathbf {v} _{n}b_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc1e6bb80267c13aac5eafdeb69106cefcaac2f3)
where _a_ 1,...,_a_ _n_ belong to _K_ L, _b_ 1,...,_b_ _n_ belong to _K_ R, and **v**1,…,**v**_n_ belong to _V_.
