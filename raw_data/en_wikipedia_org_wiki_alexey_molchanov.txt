He is  multiple world champion in freediving, the current world record holder in various freediving disciplines, president of the Freediving Federation, head of the Natalia Molchanova Freediving School, ambassador for the Lake Baikal Foundation, and the founder and equipment designer for the Molchanovs freediving brand. He is the son of Natalia Molchanova, a multiple world champion and freediving record holder.

Career [ edit ] Alexey Molchanov set his first freediving world record in 2008, swimming 250 meters underwater in a pool with a monofin on a single breath. Since then, he has focused on depth disciplines and competing in open water.

In 2012, he set a world record in Sharm El-Sheikh , Egypt, diving to 125 meters with a monofin. Later that year, he broke his own record by diving to 126 meters in Dean's Blue Hole in the Bahamas. At the 2013 AIDA World Championship in Kalamata, Greece, he set a new world record of 128 meters. In 2016, he improved it to 129 meters in Baia, and in 2018, he achieved 130 meters in the Bahamas, once again surpassing his own mark. This achievement was featured in the Netflix sports documentary series *Religion of Sports*. In 2021, during the Vertical Blue competition, he extended the record to 131 meters. In August 2023, at the CMAS World Championship, Molchanov reached a depth of 136 meters, setting another absolute depth record in competitive freediving, a performance he confirmed in September under AIDA rules.

Originally a competitive swimmer, Alexey began freediving in his teens when his mother, Natalia Molchanova, was already a champion. She developed a unique instructional method that helped establish her as one of the greatest competitive freedivers in history and contributed significantly to the sport's popularity in Russia. Following in her footsteps, Alexey not only leads the Freediving Federation but also founded Molchanovs, a company that provides education and manufactures freediving gear.

Personal life [ edit ] From 2016 to 2024, he was married to Elena Molchanova (née Sokolova), a Russian swimmer, Universiade champion (2013), and participant in the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics . She holds the title of International Master of Sports of Russia.
