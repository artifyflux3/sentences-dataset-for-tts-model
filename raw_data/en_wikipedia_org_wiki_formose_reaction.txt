The term formose is a portmanteau of form aldehyde and -ose (a suffix that means "sugar").

Reaction and mechanism [ edit ] The reaction is catalyzed by a base and a divalent metal such as calcium .  The intermediary steps taking place are aldol reactions , reverse aldol reactions , and aldose-ketose isomerizations . Intermediates are glycolaldehyde , glyceraldehyde , dihydroxyacetone , and tetrose sugars.  In 1959, Breslow proposed a mechanism for the reaction, consisting of the following steps: [ 3 ] Formose reaction Another depiction of the Breslow catalytic cycle for formaldehyde dimerization and C2-C6 saccharide formation.

The reaction exhibits an induction period, during which only the nonproductive Cannizzaro disproportionation of formaldehyde (to methanol and formate) occurs.  The initial dimerization of formaldehyde to give glycolaldehyde ( 1 ) occurs via an unknown mechanism, possibly promoted by light or through a free radical process and is very slow.  However, the reaction is autocatalytic: 1 catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of formaldehyde to produce an additional molecule of 1 .  Hence, even a trace (as low as 3 ppm [ 4 ] ) of glycolaldehyde is enough to initiate the reaction.  The autocatalytic cycle begins with the aldol reaction of 1 with formaldehyde to make glyceraldehyde ( 2 ). An aldose-ketose isomerization of 2 forms dihydroxyacetone ( 3 ).  A further aldol reaction of 3 with formaldehyde produces tetrulose ( 6 ), which undergoes another ketose-aldose isomerization to form aldotetrose 7 (either threose or erythrose).  The retro-aldol reaction of 7 generates two molecules of 1 , resulting in the net production of a molecule of 1 from two molecules of formaldehyde, catalyzed by 1 itself ( autocatalysis ).   During this process, 3 can also react with 1 to form ribulose ( 4 ), which can isomerize to give rise to ribose ( 5 ), an important building block of ribonucleic acid . The reaction conditions must be carefully controlled, otherwise the alkaline conditions will cause the aldoses to undergo the Cannizzaro reaction .

The aldose-ketose isomerization steps are promoted by chelation to calcium.  However, these steps have been shown to proceed through a hydride shift mechanism by isotope labeling studies, instead of via an intermediate enediolate , as previously proposed.

[ 5 ] Significance [ edit ] The formose reaction is of importance to the question of the origin of life , as it leads from simple formaldehyde to complex sugars like ribose , a building block of RNA . In one experiment simulating early Earth conditions, pentoses formed from mixtures of formaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, and borate minerals such as colemanite (Ca 2 B 6 O 11 5H 2 O) or kernite (Na 2 B 4 O 7 ).

[ 6 ] However, issues remain with both the thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility of binding pre-made sugars to a pre-made nucleobase, as well as a method to selectively employ ribose from the mixture. Both formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde have been observed spectroscopically in outer space , making the formose reaction of particular interest to the field of astrobiology .
