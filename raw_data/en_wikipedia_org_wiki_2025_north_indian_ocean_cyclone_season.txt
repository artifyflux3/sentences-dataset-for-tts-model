The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has no official bounds, but cyclones tend to form between April and December, with the peak from May to November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean .

The scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere , east of the Horn of Africa and west of the Malay Peninsula . There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean — the Arabian Sea to the west of the Indian subcontinent , abbreviated ARB by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east as BOB . The systems that form over land are abbreviated as LAND .

The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the IMD , while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. On average, four to five cyclonic storms form in this basin every season.

[ 1 ] Season summary [ edit ] Systems [ edit ] Depression ARB 01 [ edit ] Depression (IMD) Duration 24 May – 25 May Peak intensity 45 km/h (30 mph) (3-min) ; 997 hPa ( mbar ) On 21 May, a tropical disturbance designated as Invest 93A formed in the Arabian Sea near the west coast of India, approximately 165 nautical miles (306 km) south-southwest of Mumbai . Favorable environmental conditions including warm sea surface temperatures and moderate wind shear allowed the system to gradually consolidate. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasted its intensification into a cyclonic storm within 2 to 3 days, prompting orange and yellow weather warnings along the Konkan and Gujarat coasts, as well as widespread rainfall alerts across Kerala. This system marked the onset of tropical cyclone activity in the North Indian Ocean basin for the 2025 season.

[ 2 ] Under the influence of the tropical disturbance, a low pressure area formed over the eastern Arabian Sea off the southern Konkan-Goa coasts by 05:30 IST on 22 May.

[ 3 ] By 05:30 IST on 23 May, it became a well marked low pressure area off the southern Konkan coast and persisted over the same region as of 08:30 IST.

[ 4 ] The system organised into a depression by 05:30 IST on 24 May about 40 km northwest of Ratnagiri .

[ 5 ] Over the next 6 hours, the depression moved slowly eastward at a speed of 5 km/h and between 11:30 and 12:30 IST it made landfall , crossing the south Konkan coast near Ratnagiri. The maximum sustained windspeed at the time was 25 knots (46 km/h) gusting to 35 knots (65 km/h).

[ 6 ] The system then moved eastwards inland and [ 7 ] by 05:30 IST on 25 May, the system had weakened back into a well marked low pressure area over southern Madhya Maharastra and the adjoining regions of Marathwada and Karnataka .

[ 8 ] Deep Depression BOB 01 [ edit ] Deep depression (IMD) Duration 29 May – 30 May Peak intensity 55 km/h (35 mph) (3-min) ; 988 hPa ( mbar ) A low pressure area formed over northwest Bay of Bengal off the coast of Odisha at 08:30 IST on 27 May.

[ 9 ] Favorable environmental conditions including warm sea surface temperatures, moderate vertical wind shear over the system and the presence of warm air over Gangetic West Bengal and Bangladesh allowed it to gradually consolidate. However, the strong wind shear in the region due to the advancing southwest monsoon and insufficient time over sea before landfall limited its intensification. It became well marked at 05:30 IST on 28 May and persisted over the same region.

[ 10 ] By 05:30 IST on 29 May, the system coalesced into a depression near the coasts of West Bengal and Bangladesh.

[ 11 ] Thereafter, the depression moved nearly northwards and by 08:30 IST on the same day, it intensified into a deep depression.

[ 12 ] Over the next 6 hours, the system continued to move nearly northwards and made landfall on the West Bengal–Bangladesh coast between Sagar Island and Khepupara , close to Raidighi . Its maximum sustained windspeed at the time was 30 knots (56 km/h) gusting to 40 knots (74 km/h).

[ 13 ] It then tracked north-northeastward inland, [ 14 ] and by 05:30 IST on 30 May the system had weakened back into a depression over Bangladesh.

[ 15 ] By 17:30 IST on the same day, it had degenerated into a well marked low over Meghalaya due to interaction with rugged terrain.

[ 16 ] As a result of the system, Noakhali received 168 mm (6.6 in) [ 17 ] and Dhaka 88 mm (3.5 in) of rainfall on 29 May.

[ 18 ] The same day, Kolkata received light to moderate rainfall with Jinjirabazar receiving 23 mm (0.91 in) of rainfall in a timespan from noon to 20:00 IST.

[ 19 ] It caused floods and landslides which killed 61, left 10 missing and affected 6.1 million people in India, with 27 deaths in Assam , [ 20 ] 12 in Arunachal Pradesh , 6 each in Meghalaya and Mizoram , 4 in Manipur , 3 in Sikkim , 2 in Tripura and 1 in Nagaland .

[ 21 ] Four additional deaths occurred in Bangladesh , including 2 in Dhaka and 1 in Moheshkhali , while 8 others went missing when a trawler sank near Kutubdia . In Moheshkhali and Kutubdia, over 100 homes and farmland were flooded.

[ 22 ] Another person was killed by a collapsing wall, 11 were injured by lightning strikes, over 1,400 homes were damaged and 53 landslides were observed across 33 Rohingya refugee camps .

[ 23 ] The system brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Myanmar as well. As a result, 26 homes were destroyed and 22 others were damaged in Yegyi and Dedaye Townships .

[ 24 ] Depression BOB 02/LAND 03 [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( July 2025 ) Depression (IMD) Duration 14 July – 20 July Peak intensity 45 km/h (30 mph) (3-min) ; On 14 July, a circulation previously marked as a well-defined low consolidated into a depression while over West Bengal , near Bangladesh , at 06:00 UTC, according to the IMD.

[ 25 ] It weakened to a well-defined low on 16 July.

[ citation needed ] It re-intensified to a depression on the next day.

[ 26 ] Depression LAND 01 [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( July 2025 ) Depression (IMD) Duration 15 July – 16 July Peak intensity 35 km/h (25 mph) (3-min) ; On 15 July, a low pressure area over parts of north Rajasthan concentrated into a depression.

[ 27 ] Depression BOB 04 [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( July 2025 ) Depression (IMD) Duration 25 July – 27 July Peak intensity 45 km/h (30 mph) (3-min) ; 988 hPa ( mbar ) The remnants of Wipha continued developing over the North Indian Ocean on 23 July. On 25 July, the low pressure area over Northwestern part of the Bay of Bengal concentrated into a depression by the IMD at 05:30 IST (00:00 UTC).

As a result of the depression, Pagladanga in Kolkata recorded 186 mm (7.3 in) in a 15 hour period from 24 July to 25 July, while Alipore recorded 120 mm (4.7 in) in a 24 hour period.

[ 28 ] Gusts of 50 km/h (31 mph; 27 kn) were also reported from the city.

[ 28 ] Many parts of the city were waterlogged.

[ 28 ] Storm names [ edit ] Within this basin, a tropical cyclone is assigned a name when it is judged to have reached cyclonic storm intensity with winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). The names were selected by a new list from the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in New Delhi by mid year of 2020.

[ 29 ] There is no retirement of tropical cyclone names in this basin as the list of names is only scheduled to be used once before a new list of names is drawn up. Should a named tropical cyclone move into the basin from the Western Pacific, then it will retain its original name. The next eight available names from the List of North Indian Ocean storm names are below.
