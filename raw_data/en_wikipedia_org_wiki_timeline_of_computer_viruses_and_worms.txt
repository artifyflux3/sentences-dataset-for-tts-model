( November 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Hex dump of the Blaster worm , showing a message left for Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates by the worm's programmer This timeline of computer viruses and worms presents a chronological timeline of noteworthy computer viruses , computer worms , Trojan horses , similar malware , related research and events.

1960s [ edit ] John von Neumann 's article on the "Theory of self-reproducing automata" is published in 1966.

[ 1 ] The article is based on lectures given by von Neumann at the University of Illinois about the "Theory and Organization of Complicated Automata" in 1949.

1970s [ edit ] 1970 [ edit ] The first story written about a computer virus, The Scarred Man by Gregory Benford , was published in the May 1970 issue of Venture Science Fiction .

[ 2 ] 1971 [ edit ] The Creeper system , an experimental self-replicating program, is written by Bob Thomas at BBN Technologies to test John von Neumann's theory.

[ 3 ] Creeper infected DEC PDP-10 computers running the TENEX operating system . Creeper gained access via the ARPANET and copied itself to the remote system where the message "I'm the creeper : catch me if you can!" was displayed. The Reaper program was later created to delete Creeper.

[ 4 ] At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , a graduate student named Alan Davis (working for Prof. Donald Gillies ) created a process on a PDP-11 that (a) checked to see if an identical copy of itself was currently running as an active process, and if not, created a copy of itself and started it running; (b) checked to see if any disk space (which all users shared) was available, and if so, created a file the size of that space; and (c) looped back to step (a). As a result, the process stole all available disk space. When users tried to save files, the operating system advised them that the disk was full and that they needed to delete some existing files. Of course, if they did delete a file, this process would immediately snatch up the available space. When users called in a system administrator to fix the problem, he examined the active processes, discovered the offending process, and deleted it. Of course, before he left the room, the still existing process would create another copy of itself, and the problem would not go away. The only way to make the computer work again was to reboot.

[ 5 ] 1972 [ edit ] The science fiction novel, When HARLIE Was One , by David Gerrold , contains one of the first fictional representations of a computer virus , as well as one of the first uses of the word "virus" to denote a program that infects a computer.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] 1973 [ edit ] In fiction, the 1973 Michael Crichton movie Westworld made an early mention of the concept of a computer virus, being a central plot theme that causes androids to run amok.

[ 8 ] Alan Oppenheimer 's character summarizes the problem by stating that "[...] there's a clear pattern here which suggests an analogy to an infectious disease process, spreading from one [...] area to the next." To which the replies are stated: "Perhaps there are superficial similarities to disease" and, "I must confess I find it difficult to believe in a disease of machinery." [ 9 ] [ note 1 ] 1974 [ edit ] The Rabbit (or Wabbit) virus, more a fork bomb than a virus, is written. The Rabbit virus makes multiple copies of itself on a single computer (and was named " rabbit " for the speed at which it did so) until it clogs the system, reducing system performance, before finally reaching a threshold and crashing the computer.

[ 10 ] 1975 [ edit ] April: ANIMAL is written by John Walker for the UNIVAC 1108 .

[ 11 ] ANIMAL asked several questions of the user in an attempt to guess the type of animal the user was thinking of, while the related program PERVADE would create a copy of itself and ANIMAL in every directory to which the current user had access. It spread across the multi-user UNIVACs when users with overlapping permissions discovered the game, and to other computers when tapes were shared. The program was carefully written to avoid damaging existing file or directory structures, and to avoid copying itself if permissions did not exist or if harm would result. Its spread was halted by an OS upgrade that changed the format of the file status tables PERVADE used. Though non-malicious, "Pervading Animal" represents the first Trojan "in the wild".

[ 12 ] The novel The Shockwave Rider by John Brunner is published, coining the word " worm " to describe a program that propagates itself through a computer network .

[ 13 ] 1977 [ edit ] The Adolescence of P-1 novel, [ 14 ] describes a worm program that propagates through modem-based networks, eventually developing its own strategy-developing AI, which deals with cross-hardware and cross-os issues, eventually infecting hardware manufactures and defense organizations.

1980s [ edit ] 1982 [ edit ] A program called Elk Cloner , written for Apple II systems, was created by Mt. Lebanon High School student Richard Skrenta , originally as a prank. The Apple II was particularly vulnerable due to the need for a floppy disk to be present in order to bootstrap the computer. Elk Cloner's design combined with the public's general lack of knowledge regarding malware and how to protect against it led to Elk Cloner being responsible for the first large-scale [ failed verification ] computer virus outbreak in history.

[ 15 ] 1983 [ edit ] November: The term "virus" is re-coined by Frederick B. Cohen in describing self-replicating computer programs. In 1984 Cohen uses the phrase "computer virus" (suggested by his teacher Leonard Adleman ) to describe the operation of such programs in terms of "infection". He defines a "virus" as "a program that can 'infect' other programs by modifying them to include a possibly evolved copy of itself." Cohen demonstrates a virus-like program on a VAX11/750 system at Lehigh University . The program could install itself in, or infect, other system objects.

[ 16 ] [ failed verification ] 1984 [ edit ] August: Ken Thompson publishes his seminal paper, " Reflections on Trusting Trust ", in which he describes how he modified a C compiler so that when used to compile a specific version of the Unix operating system, it inserts a backdoor into the login command, and when used to compile a new copy of itself, it inserts the backdoor insertion code, even if neither the backdoor nor the backdoor insertion code is present in the source code of this new copy.

[ 17 ] 1986 [ edit ] January: The Brain boot sector virus is released. Brain is considered the first IBM PC compatible virus, and the program responsible for the first IBM PC compatible virus epidemic. The virus is also known as Lahore, Pakistani, Pakistani Brain, and Pakistani flu as it was created in Lahore , Pakistan, by 19-year-old Pakistani programmer Basit Farooq Alvi and his brother, Amjad Farooq Alvi.

[ 18 ] December: Ralf Burger presented the Virdem model of programs at a meeting of the underground Chaos Computer Club in Germany. The Virdem model represented the first programs that could replicate themselves via addition of their code to executable DOS files in COM format.

[ 19 ] 1987 [ edit ] Appearance of the Vienna virus, which was subsequently neutralized – the first time this had happened on the IBM platform.

[ 20 ] Appearance of Lehigh virus (discovered at its namesake university ), [ 20 ] boot sector viruses such as Yale from the US, Stoned from New Zealand, Ping Pong from Italy, and appearance of the first self-encrypting file virus, Cascade . Lehigh was stopped on campus before it spread to the "wild" (to computers beyond the university), and as a result, has never been found elsewhere. A subsequent infection of Cascade in the offices of IBM Belgium led to IBM responding with its own antivirus product development. Prior to this, antivirus solutions developed at IBM were intended for staff use only.

October: The Jerusalem virus , part of the (at that time unknown) Suriv family, is detected in the city of Jerusalem . The virus destroys all executable files on infected machines upon every occurrence of Friday the 13th (except Friday 13 November 1987 making its first trigger date May 13, 1988). Jerusalem caused a worldwide epidemic in 1988.

[ 20 ] November: The SCA virus , a boot sector virus for Amiga computers, appears. It immediately creates a pandemic virus-writer storm. A short time later, SCA releases another, considerably more destructive virus, the Byte Bandit .

December: Christmas Tree EXEC was the first widely disruptive replicating network program, which paralyzed several international computer networks in December 1987. It was written in Rexx on the VM/CMS operating system and originated in West Germany . It re-emerged in 1990.

1988 [ edit ] March 1: The Ping-Pong virus (also called Boot, Bouncing Ball, Bouncing Dot, Italian, Italian-A or VeraCruz), an MS-DOS boot sector virus, is discovered at the University of Turin in Italy.

June: The CyberAIDS and Festering Hate Apple ProDOS viruses spreads from underground pirate BBS systems and starts infecting mainstream networks. Festering Hate was the last iteration of the CyberAIDS series extending back to 1985 and 1986. Unlike the few Apple viruses that had come before which were essentially annoying, but did no damage, the Festering Hate series of viruses was extremely destructive, spreading to all system files it could find on the host computer (hard drive, floppy, and system memory) and then destroying everything when it could no longer find any uninfected files.

November 2: The Morris worm , created by Robert Tappan Morris , infects DEC VAX and Sun machines running BSD UNIX that are connected to the Internet , and becomes the first worm to spread extensively "in the wild", and one of the first well-known programs exploiting buffer overrun vulnerabilities.

December: The Father Christmas worm attacks DEC VAX machines running VMS that are connected to the DECnet Internet (an international scientific research network using DECnet protocols), affecting NASA and other research centers. Its purpose was to deliver a Christmas greeting to all affected users.

1989 [ edit ] October: Ghostball , the first multipartite virus, is discovered by Friðrik Skúlason . It infects both executable .COM files and boot sectors on MS-DOS systems.

December: Several thousand floppy disks containing the AIDS Trojan , the first known ransomware , are mailed to subscribers of PC Business World magazine and a WHO AIDS conference mailing list. This DOS Trojan lies dormant for 90 boot cycles, then encrypts all filenames on the system, displaying a notice asking for $189 to be sent to a post office box in Panama in order to receive a decryption program.

1990s [ edit ] 1990 [ edit ] Mark Washburn, working on an analysis of the Vienna and Cascade viruses with Ralf Burger, develops the first family of polymorphic viruses , the Chameleon family. Chameleon series debuted with the release of 1260 .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] June: The Form computer virus is isolated in Switzerland. It would remain in the wild for almost 20 years and reappear afterward; during the 1990s it tended to be the most common virus in the wild with 20 to more than 50 percent of reported infections.

1991 [ edit ] Mattel releases a toyline called "Computer Warriors," bringing computer viruses into mainstream media. The villain, Megahert, is a sentient computer virus.

1992 [ edit ] March: The Michelangelo virus was expected to create a digital apocalypse on March 6, with millions of computers having their information wiped, according to mass media hysteria surrounding the virus. Later assessments of the damage showed the aftermath to be minimal.

John McAfee had been quoted by the media as saying that five million computers would be affected. He later said that pressed by the interviewer to come up with a number, he had estimated a range from five thousand to five million, but the media naturally went with just the higher number.

October: Milton-Bradley releases Omega Virus , a board game containing one of the first examples of a sentient computer virus in mainstream media.

1993 [ edit ] "Leandro" or "Leandro & Kelly" [ 24 ] and "Freddy Krueger" [ 25 ] spread quickly due to popularity of BBS and shareware distribution.

Once installed, it quietly downloads additional malware, making it difficult for signature-based anti-virus programs to detect. It is believed to have been created by the United States and United Kingdom as a tool for espionage and mass surveillance.

[ citation needed ] 2015 [ edit ] The BASHLITE malware is leaked leading to a massive spike in DDoS attacks.

[ 83 ] Linux.Wifatch is revealed to the general public. It is found to attempt to secure devices from other more malicious malware.

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] 2016 [ edit ] January: A trojan named " MEMZ " is created. The creator, Leurak, explained that the trojan was intended merely as a joke.

[ 87 ] The trojan alerts the user to the fact that it is a trojan and warns them that if they proceed, the computer may no longer be usable. It contains complex payloads that corrupt the system, displaying artifacts on the screen as it runs. Once run, the application cannot be closed without causing further damage to the computer, which will stop functioning properly regardless. When the computer is restarted, in place of the bootsplash is a message that reads "Your computer has been trashed by the MEMZ Trojan. Now enjoy the Nyan cat...", which follows with an animation of the Nyan Cat .

[ 88 ] February: Ransomware Locky with its over 60 derivatives spread throughout Europe and infected several million computers. At the height of the spread over five thousand computers per hour were infected in Germany alone.

[ 89 ] Although ransomware was not a new thing at the time, insufficient cyber security as well as a lack of standards in IT was responsible for the high number of infections.

[ 90 ] Unfortunately, even up to date antivirus and internet security software was unable to protect systems from early versions of Locky.

[ 91 ] February: Tiny Banker Trojan (Tinba) makes headlines.

[ 92 ] Since its discovery, it has been found to have infected more than two dozen major banking institutions in the United States, including TD Bank, Chase, HSBC, Wells Fargo, PNC and Bank of America.

[ 93 ] [ 94 ] Tiny Banker Trojan uses HTTP injection to force the user's computer to believe that it is on the bank's website. This spoof page will look and function just as the real one. The user then enters their information to log on, at which point Tinba can launch the bank webpage's "incorrect login information" return, and redirect the user to the real website. This is to trick the user into thinking they had entered the wrong information and proceed as normal, although now Tinba has captured the credentials and sent them to its host.

[ 95 ] [ 96 ] August: Journalists and researchers report the discovery of spyware , called Pegasus , developed and distributed by a private company which can and has been used to infect iOS and Android smartphones often – based on 0-day exploits – without the need for any user-interaction or significant clues to the user and then be used to exfiltrate data, track user locations, capture film through its camera, and activate the microphone at any time.

The investigation suggests it was used on many targets worldwide and revealed its use for e.g. governments' espionage on journalists, opposition politicians, activists, business people and others.

[ 97 ] September: Mirai creates headlines by launching some of the most powerful and disruptive DDoS attacks seen to date by infecting the Internet of Things . Mirai ends up being used in the DDoS attack on 20 September 2016 on the Krebs on Security site which reached 620 Gbit/s.

[ 98 ] Ars Technica also reported a 1 Tbit/s attack on French web host OVH .

[ 99 ] On 21 October 2016 multiple major DDoS attacks in DNS services of DNS service provider Dyn occurred using Mirai malware installed on a large number of IoT devices , resulting in the inaccessibility of several high-profile websites such as GitHub , Twitter , Reddit , Netflix , Airbnb and many others.

[ 100 ] The attribution of the attack to the Mirai botnet was originally reported by BackConnect Inc., a security firm.

[ 101 ] 2017 [ edit ] May: The WannaCry ransomware attack spreads globally. Exploits revealed in the NSA hacking toolkit leak of late 2016 were used to enable the propagation of the malware.

[ 102 ] Shortly after the news of the infections broke online, a UK cybersecurity researcher in collaboration with others found and activated a "kill switch" hidden within the ransomware, effectively halting the initial wave of its global propagation.

[ 103 ] The next day, researchers announced that they had found new variants of the malware without the kill switch.

[ 104 ] June: The Petya attack spreads globally affecting Windows systems. Researchers at Symantec reveal that this ransomware uses the EternalBlue exploit, similar to the one used in the WannaCry ransomware attack .

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] September: The Xafecopy Trojan attacks 47 countries, affecting only Android operating systems. Kaspersky Lab identified it as a malware from the Ubsod family, stealing money through click based WAP billing systems.

[ 108 ] [ 109 ] September: A new variety of Remote Access Trojan (RAT), Kedi RAT, is distributed in a Spear Phishing Campaign. The attack targeted Citrix users. The Trojan was able to evade usual system scanners. Kedi Trojan had all the characteristics of a common Remote Access Trojan and it could communicate to its Command and Control center via Gmail using common HTML, HTTP protocols.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] 2018 [ edit ] February: Thanatos, a ransomware, becomes the first ransomware program to accept ransom payment in Bitcoin Cash .

[ 112 ] 2019 [ edit ] November: Titanium is an advanced backdoor malware , developed by the PLATINUM APT .

[ 113 ] 2020s [ edit ] 2024 [ edit ] March 2: Researchers Nassi, Cohen, and Bitton developed a computer worm called Morris II, targeting generative AI email assistants to steal data and send spam, thereby breaching security protections of systems like ChatGPT and Gemini . Conducted in a test environment, this research highlights the security risks of multimodal large language models (LLMs) that now generate text, images, and videos. Generative AI systems, which operate on prompts, can be exploited through weaponized prompts. For instance, hidden text on a webpage could instruct an LLM to perform malicious activities, such as phishing for bank details. While generative AI worms like Morris II haven’t been observed in the public, their potential threat is a concern for the tech industry.

[ 114 ] March 29: XZ Utils backdoor is discovered.

[ 115 ] April 1: The Linux's WALLSCAPE Bug is discovered.

June 29: Brain Cipher - a variant of LockBit 3.0 Ransomware behind Indonesia's Data Center attacks.
