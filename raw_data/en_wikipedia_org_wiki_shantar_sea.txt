It is bounded to the north by Bolshoy Shantar Island , to the east by Malyy Shantar Island , and to the south by Tugur Bay .

History [ edit ] The sea was frequented by American whaleships hunting bowhead whales between 1853 and 1874.

[ 1 ] Russian schooners from Mamga also cruised for bowheads in the sea from 1865 to 1871.
