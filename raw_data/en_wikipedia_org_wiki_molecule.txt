A **molecule** is a group of two or more [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") that are held together by [attractive forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") known as [chemical bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond"); depending on context, the term may or may not include [ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ions "Ions") that satisfy this criterion.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-iupac-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-8) In [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics"), [organic chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry "Organic chemistry"), and [biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry"), the distinction from ions is dropped and _molecule_ is often used when referring to [polyatomic ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyatomic_ion "Polyatomic ion").

A molecule may be [homonuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonuclear "Homonuclear"), that is, it consists of atoms of one [chemical element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element"), e.g. two atoms in the [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") molecule (O 2); or it may be [heteronuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronuclear "Heteronuclear"), a [chemical compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound") composed of more than one element, e.g. [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(molecule) "Water (molecule)") (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom; H 2 O). In the [kinetic theory of gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases "Kinetic theory of gases"), the term _molecule_ is often used for any gaseous [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle") regardless of its composition. This relaxes the requirement that a molecule contains two or more atoms, since the [noble gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gases "Noble gases") are individual atoms.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-9) Atoms and complexes connected by [non-covalent interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-covalent_interactions "Non-covalent interactions"), such as [hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond "Hydrogen bond") or [ionic bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bond "Ionic bond"), are typically not considered single molecules.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-10)

Concepts similar to molecules have been discussed since ancient times, but modern investigation into the nature of molecules and their bonds began in the 17th century. Refined over time by scientists such as [Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle"), [Amedeo Avogadro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amedeo_Avogadro "Amedeo Avogadro"), [Jean Perrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Perrin "Jean Baptiste Perrin"), and [Linus Pauling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling "Linus Pauling"), the study of molecules is today known as [molecular physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_physics "Molecular physics") or molecular chemistry.

Etymology
---------

According to [Merriam-Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam-Webster "Merriam-Webster") and the [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Etymology_Dictionary "Online Etymology Dictionary"), the word "molecule" derives from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") "[moles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit) "Mole (unit)")" or small unit of mass. The word is derived from French _[molécule](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mol%C3%A9cule "wikt:molécule")_ (1678), from [Neo-Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Latin "Neo-Latin")_[molecula](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/molecula "wikt:molecula")_, diminutive of Latin _[moles](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/moles "wikt:moles")_ "mass, barrier". The word, which until the late 18th century was used only in Latin form, became popular after being used in works of philosophy by [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-12)

History
-------

The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_particles#Molecules "List of particles") of pure [chemical substances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance "Chemical substance") that still retain their [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound") and chemical properties.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-13) This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology) "Rock (geology)"), [salts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry) "Salt (chemistry)"), and [metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal "Metal"), are composed of large crystalline networks of [chemically bonded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond") atoms or [ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion"), but are not made of discrete molecules.

The modern concept of molecules can be traced back towards pre-scientific and Greek philosophers such as [Leucippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucippus "Leucippus") and [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus") who argued that all the universe is composed of [atoms and voids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory "Atomic theory"). Circa 450 BC [Empedocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empedocles "Empedocles") imagined [fundamental elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element") ([fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(classical_element) "Fire (classical element)") ([![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Alchemical_fire_symbol_%28fixed_width%29.svg/20px-Alchemical_fire_symbol_%28fixed_width%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alchemical_fire_symbol_(fixed_width).svg)), [earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(classical_element) "Earth (classical element)") ([![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Alchemical_earth_symbol_%28fixed_width%29.svg/20px-Alchemical_earth_symbol_%28fixed_width%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alchemical_earth_symbol_(fixed_width).svg)), [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(classical_element) "Air (classical element)") ([![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Alchemical_air_symbol_%28fixed_width%29.svg/20px-Alchemical_air_symbol_%28fixed_width%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alchemical_air_symbol_(fixed_width).svg)), and [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(classical_element) "Water (classical element)") ([![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Alchemical_water_symbol_%28fixed_width%29.svg/20px-Alchemical_water_symbol_%28fixed_width%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alchemical_water_symbol_(fixed_width).svg))) and "forces" of attraction and repulsion allowing the elements to interact.

A fifth element, the incorruptible quintessence [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element) "Aether (classical element)"), was considered to be the fundamental building block of the heavenly bodies. The viewpoint of Leucippus and Empedocles, along with the aether, was accepted by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") and passed to medieval and renaissance Europe.

In a more concrete manner, however, the concept of aggregates or units of bonded atoms, i.e. "molecules", traces its origins to [Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle")'s 1661 hypothesis, in his famous treatise _[The Sceptical Chymist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sceptical\_Chymist "The Sceptical Chymist")_, that matter is composed of _clusters of particles_ and that chemical change results from the rearrangement of the clusters. Boyle argued that matter's basic elements consisted of various sorts and sizes of particles, called "corpuscles", which were capable of arranging themselves into groups. In 1789, [William Higgins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Higgins_(chemist) "William Higgins (chemist)") published views on what he called combinations of "ultimate" particles, which foreshadowed the concept of [valency bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valency_bonds "Valency bonds"). If, for example, according to Higgins, the force between the ultimate particle of oxygen and the ultimate particle of nitrogen were 6, then the strength of the force would be divided accordingly, and similarly for the other combinations of ultimate particles.

[Amedeo Avogadro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amedeo_Avogadro "Amedeo Avogadro") created the word "molecule".[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-ley196606-14) His 1811 paper "Essay on Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies", he essentially states, i.e. according to [Partington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Partington "J. R. Partington")'s _A Short History of Chemistry_, that:[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-15)

> The smallest particles of gases are not necessarily simple atoms, but are made up of a certain number of these atoms united by attraction to form a single **molecule**.

In coordination with these concepts, in 1833 the French chemist [Marc Antoine Auguste Gaudin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Antoine_Auguste_Gaudin "Marc Antoine Auguste Gaudin") presented a clear account of Avogadro's hypothesis,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-16) regarding atomic weights, by making use of "volume diagrams", which clearly show both semi-correct molecular geometries, such as a linear water molecule, and correct molecular formulas, such as H 2 O:

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Gaudins-volume-diagrams.jpg/500px-Gaudins-volume-diagrams.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gaudins-volume-diagrams.jpg)

In 1917, an unknown American undergraduate chemical engineer named [Linus Pauling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling "Linus Pauling") was learning the [Dalton hook-and-eye bonding method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_model "Dalton model"), which was the mainstream description of bonds between atoms at the time. Pauling, however, was not satisfied with this method and looked to the newly emerging field of quantum physics for a new method. In 1926, French physicist [Jean Perrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Perrin "Jean Perrin") received the Nobel Prize in physics for proving, conclusively, the existence of molecules. He did this by calculating the [Avogadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant "Avogadro constant") using three different methods, all involving liquid phase systems. First, he used a [gamboge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamboge "Gamboge") soap-like emulsion, second by doing experimental work on [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion "Brownian motion"), and third by confirming Einstein's theory of particle rotation in the liquid phase.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-17)

In 1927, the physicists [Fritz London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_London "Fritz London") and [Walter Heitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Heitler "Walter Heitler") applied the new quantum mechanics to the deal with the saturable, nondynamic forces of attraction and repulsion, i.e., exchange forces, of the hydrogen molecule. Their valence bond treatment of this problem, in their joint paper,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-18) was a landmark in that it brought chemistry under quantum mechanics. Their work was an influence on Pauling, who had just received his doctorate and visited Heitler and London in Zürich on a [Guggenheim Fellowship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guggenheim_Fellowship "Guggenheim Fellowship").

Subsequently, in 1931, building on the work of Heitler and London and on theories found in Lewis' famous article, Pauling published his ground-breaking article "The Nature of the Chemical Bond"[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-19) in which he used [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") to calculate properties and structures of molecules, such as angles between bonds and rotation about bonds. On these concepts, Pauling developed [hybridization theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_theory "Hybridization theory") to account for bonds in molecules such as CH 4, in which four sp³ hybridised orbitals are overlapped by [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen")'s _1s_ orbital, yielding four [sigma (σ) bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_bond "Sigma bond"). The four bonds are of the same length and strength, which yields a molecular structure as shown below:

Molecular science
-----------------

The science of molecules is called _molecular chemistry_ or _[molecular physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular\_physics "Molecular physics")_, depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of chemical bonds, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([bound state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state "Bound state")) composed of two or more atoms. [Polyatomic ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyatomic_ion "Polyatomic ion") may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term _unstable molecule_ is used for very [reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry) "Reactivity (chemistry)") species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([resonances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance_(chemistry) "Resonance (chemistry)")) of electrons and [nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"), such as [radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry) "Radical (chemistry)"), [molecular ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyatomic_ion "Polyatomic ion"), [Rydberg molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydberg_molecule "Rydberg molecule"), [transition states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_state "Transition state"), [van der Waals complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_bonding "Van der Waals bonding"), or systems of colliding atoms as in [Bose–Einstein condensate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate "Bose–Einstein condensate").

Prevalence
----------

Molecules as components of matter are common. They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. Most organic substances are molecules. The substances of life are molecules, e.g. proteins, the amino acids of which they are composed, the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), sugars, carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins. The nutrient minerals are generally ionic compounds, thus they are not molecules, e.g. iron sulfate.

However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth are made partly or completely of crystals or ionic compounds, which are not made of molecules. These include all of the minerals that make up the substance of the Earth, sand, clay, pebbles, rocks, boulders, [bedrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology) "Crust (geology)"), the [molten interior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology) "Mantle (geology)"), and the [core of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_core "Earth core"). All of these contain many chemical bonds, but are _not_ made of identifiable molecules.

No typical molecule can be defined for salts nor for [covalent crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_solid "Network solid"), although these are often composed of repeating [unit cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_cell "Unit cell") that extend either in a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)"), e.g. [graphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene "Graphene"); or three-dimensionally e.g. [diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond "Diamond"), [quartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz "Quartz"), [sodium chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride "Sodium chloride"). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most metals which are condensed phases with [metallic bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_bond "Metallic bond"). Thus solid metals are not made of molecules. In [glasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass "Glass"), which are solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state, the atoms are held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating unit-cellular-structure that characterizes salts, covalent crystals, and metals.

Bonding
-------

Molecules are generally held together by [covalent bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bonding "Covalent bonding"). Several non-metallic elements exist only as molecules in the environment either in compounds or as homonuclear molecules, not as free atoms: for example, hydrogen.

While some people say a metallic crystal can be considered a single giant molecule held together by [metallic bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_bonding "Metallic bonding"),[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-20) others point out that metals behave very differently than molecules.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-21)

### Covalent

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Covalent_bond_hydrogen.svg/250px-Covalent_bond_hydrogen.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Covalent_bond_hydrogen.svg)

A covalent bond forming H 2 (right) where two [hydrogen atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom "Hydrogen atom") share the two electrons

A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of [electron pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_pair "Electron pair") between atoms. These electron pairs are termed _shared pairs_ or _bonding pairs_, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed _covalent bonding_.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-22)

### Ionic

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/NaF.gif/250px-NaF.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NaF.gif)

[Sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium "Sodium") and [fluorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine "Fluorine") undergoing a redox reaction to form [sodium fluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride "Sodium fluoride"). Sodium loses its outer [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") to give it a stable [electron configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration "Electron configuration"), and this electron enters the fluorine atom [exothermically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic "Exothermic").

Ionic bonding is a type of chemical bond that involves the [electrostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic "Electrostatic") attraction between oppositely charged ions, and is the primary interaction occurring in [ionic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_compound "Ionic compound"). The ions are atoms that have lost one or more [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") (termed [cations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation "Cation")) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed [anions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anion "Anion")).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-23) This transfer of electrons is termed _electrovalence_ in contrast to [covalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond "Covalent bond"). In the simplest case, the cation is a [metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal "Metal") atom and the anion is a [nonmetal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonmetal_(chemistry) "Nonmetal (chemistry)") atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH 4+ or SO 4 2−. At normal temperatures and pressures, ionic bonding mostly creates solids (or occasionally liquids) without separate identifiable molecules, but the vaporization/sublimation of such materials does produce separate molecules where electrons are still transferred fully enough for the bonds to be considered ionic rather than covalent.

Molecular size
--------------

Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, although molecules of many [polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer "Polymer") can reach [macroscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic "Macroscopic") sizes, including [biopolymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopolymer "Biopolymer") such as [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA"). Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few [angstroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angstrom "Angstrom") (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an [atomic force microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscope "Atomic force microscope"). Some of the largest molecules are [macromolecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecule "Macromolecule") or [supermolecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermolecule "Supermolecule").

The smallest molecule is the [diatomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic "Diatomic") hydrogen (H 2), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-24)

Effective molecular radius is the size a molecule displays in solution.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-26) The [table of permselectivity for different substances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_permselectivity_for_different_substances "Table of permselectivity for different substances") contains examples.

Molecular formulas
------------------

### Chemical formula types

The [chemical formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula "Chemical formula") for a molecule uses one line of chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and _plus_ (+) and _minus_ (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.

A compound's [empirical formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_formula "Empirical formula") is a very simple type of chemical formula.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-27) It is the simplest [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer")[ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio") of the chemical elements that constitute it.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-28) For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms, and [ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol "Ethanol") (ethyl alcohol) is always composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely– [dimethyl ether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_ether "Dimethyl ether") has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") in different arrangements are called [isomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomer "Isomer"). Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.

The [molecular formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_formula "Molecular formula") reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.

The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [acetylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene "Acetylene") has molecular formula C 2 H 2, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.

The [molecular mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mass "Molecular mass") can be calculated from the chemical formula and is typically expressed in [daltons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit) "Dalton (unit)"), which are equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (12[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon")[isotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope")) atom. For [network solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_solid "Network solid"), the term [formula unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_unit "Formula unit") is used in [stoichiometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometric "Stoichiometric") calculations.

### Structural formula

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Atisane3.png/500px-Atisane3.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atisane3.png)

[3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") (left and center) and [2D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_geometric_model "2D geometric model") (right) representations of the [terpenoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpenoid "Terpenoid") molecule atisane

For molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural chemical formula may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a [structural formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_formula "Structural formula") may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [chemical nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_nomenclature "Chemical nomenclature") requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.

Molecular geometry
------------------

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Cyanostar_STM.png/250px-Cyanostar_STM.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cyanostar_STM.png)

Structure and [STM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscopy "Scanning tunneling microscopy") image of a "cyanostar" [dendrimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrimer "Dendrimer") molecule.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-29)

Molecules have fixed [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equilibrium "Mechanical equilibrium") geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [reactivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry) "Reactivity (chemistry)"). [Isomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomers "Isomers") share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [Stereoisomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoisomer "Stereoisomer"), a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [biochemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry") activities.

Molecular spectroscopy
----------------------

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Dehydrogenation_of_H2TPP_by_STM.jpg/330px-Dehydrogenation_of_H2TPP_by_STM.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dehydrogenation_of_H2TPP_by_STM.jpg)

Hydrogen can be removed from individual [H 2 TPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraphenylporphyrin "Tetraphenylporphyrin") molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [scanning tunneling microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope "Scanning tunneling microscope") (STM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode "Diode") like (red curve in b) to [resistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor "Resistor") like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H 2 TPP and TPP molecules. While scanning image (d), excess voltage was applied to H 2 TPP at the black dot, which instantly removed hydrogen, as shown in the bottom part of (d) and in the rescan image (e). Such manipulations can be used in [single-molecule electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-molecule_electronics "Single-molecule electronics").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-30)

**Molecular spectroscopy** deals with the response ([spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_spectrum "Frequency spectrum")) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") (or [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency"), according to the [Planck relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_relation "Planck relation")). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through [absorbance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance "Absorbance") or [emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_(electromagnetic_radiation) "Emission (electromagnetic radiation)").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-iupac2-31) Spectroscopy does not generally refer to [diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction "Diffraction") studies where particles such as [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron"), electrons, or high energy [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray") interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).

[Microwave spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_spectroscopy "Microwave spectroscopy") commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [Infrared spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy "Infrared spectroscopy") measures the vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [functional groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group "Functional group") in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [near infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_infrared "Near infrared") light, and result in colour. [Nuclear resonance spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy") measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.

Theoretical aspects
-------------------

The study of molecules by molecular physics and [theoretical chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_chemistry "Theoretical chemistry") is largely based on [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanic "Quantum mechanic") and is essential for the understanding of the chemical bond. The simplest of molecules is the [hydrogen molecule-ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_molecule-ion "Hydrogen molecule-ion"), H 2+, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [one-electron bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_bond "One-electron bond"). H 2+ is composed of two positively charged [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and one negatively charged [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), which means that the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation") for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [computational chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry "Computational chemistry").

When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is _sufficiently stable_ to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it "must correspond to a depression on the [potential energy surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy_surface "Potential energy surface") that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-iupac-4) This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium")[dimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimer_(chemistry) "Dimer (chemistry)"), [He 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_dimer "Helium dimer"), which has one vibrational bound state[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule#cite_note-32) and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures.

Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is _sufficiently stable_ to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [elementary particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle")); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.
