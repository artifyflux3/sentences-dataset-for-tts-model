The red seems lighter combined with the white, and darker combined with the black.

The Bezold effect is an optical illusion , named after a German professor of meteorology Wilhelm von Bezold (1837–1907), who discovered that a color may appear different depending on its relation to adjacent colors. It was observed when Bezold was experimenting with ways to modify rug design by only changing one color [ 1 ] It happens when small areas of color are interspersed. An assimilation effect called the von Bezold spreading effect , similar to spatial color mixing , is achieved.

The opposite effect is observed when large areas of color are placed adjacent to each other, resulting in color contrast .
