She is a professor emerita of computer science at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis [ 2 ] and at the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo .

[ 3 ] Education and career [ edit ] Gersting graduated from Stetson University in 1962, [ 4 ] and completed a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1969 at Arizona State University . Her dissertation, Some Results on t {\displaystyle t} -Regressive Isols , concerned recursive function theory and was supervised by Matt Hassett.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] After holding a faculty position in the department of mathematical sciences at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) for ten years, and becoming a full professor there, she spent a year at the University of Central Florida before returning to IUPUI in 1981 as professor of mathematics and acting chair of the department of computer and information science.

[ 4 ] She came to the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo in 1990, [ 7 ] and chaired the computer science department there for many years. After retiring from the University of Hawaiʻi, she became a part-time faculty member at IUPUI.

[ 3 ] Books [ edit ] Gersting's books include: Abstract Algebra: A First Look (with Joseph E. Kuczkowski, Marcel Dekker , 1977) [ 8 ] The Metric System (with Elaine V. Alton, Cummings, 1977) [ 9 ] Yes–No; Stop–Go: Some Patterns in Mathematical Logic (with Joseph E. Kuczkowski and Don Madden, Crowell, 1977) [ 10 ] Mathematical Structures for Computer Science (W. H. Freeman, 1982; 7th ed., 2014) [ 11 ] Technical Calculus with Analytic Geometry (Wadsworth, 1984; Dover, 1992) [ 12 ] The Computer: History, Workings, Uses & Limitations (with Michael C. Gemignani, Ardsley House, 1988) [ 13 ] The Programming Process with Pascal (West Publishing, 1989) Invitation to Computer Science (with G. Michael Schneider, West Publishing, 1995; 8th ed., Cengage , 2018) Visual Basic Programming: A Laboratory Approach (Computer Science Press, 1996) With Henry M. Walker, she was co-chair and co-editor of the annual symposium on computer science education of SIGCSE in 2002.

[ 14 ] Recognition [ edit ] The University of Hawaii system awarded Gersting the Regents’ Excellence in Teaching Award in 2006.
