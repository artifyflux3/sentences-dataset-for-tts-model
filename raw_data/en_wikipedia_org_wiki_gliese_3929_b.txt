[ 2 ] Discovery date 2022 Detection method Transit Designations Alternative names Gliese 3929 b, TOI 2013 b, G 180-18 b [ 3 ] Orbital characteristics [ 4 ] Semi-major axis 0.0252 ± 0.0005 AU Eccentricity 0 (fixed) Orbital period (sidereal) 2.616 d Inclination 88.442 ° ± 0.008 ° Star GJ 3929 Physical characteristics [ 4 ] Mean radius 1.09 ± 0.04 R 🜨 Mass 1.75 +0.44 −0.45 M 🜨 Mean density 7.3 ± 2.0 g/cm 3 Temperature 568 ± 6 K ( 295 °C ) GJ 3929 b (Gliese 3929 b, TOI-2013 b) is a confirmed exoplanet located 52 light-years away orbiting the red dwarf star GJ 3929 .

[ 3 ] It is an Earth-sized planet, having a radius only 9% larger than that of Earth.

[ 4 ] It orbits its star at a distance of 0.0252 astronomical units (3,770,000 km), being located in the Venus zone of its star, and completes one orbit around it every 2 days and 15 hours.

[ 4 ] Because of the proximity of its star, and its low mass, GJ 3929 b is classified as a Venus -like planet, having an equilibrium temperature of around 300 °C and receiving planetary insolation 17 times more intense than Earth receives from the Sun.

[ 4 ] Characteristics [ edit ] Size, mass and density [ edit ] Initially, the radius of GJ 3929 b was calculated at 1.15 ± 0.04 R 🜨 , and its mass at 1.21 ± 0.42 M 🜨 , giving a density of 4.4 ± 1.6 g/cm 3 .

[ 5 ] Later, observations using the NEID spectrometer on the WIYN 3.5 m Telescope measured the planet's mass to be 1.75 ± 0.45 M 🜨 ; and observations using the ARCTIC imager , plus photometry from TESS and LCOGT , constrained the planet's radius to 1.09 ± 0.04 R 🜨 , this time giving a higher density of 7.3 ± 2 g/cm 3 (about 33% larger than Earth's [ a ] ).

[ 4 ] The characteristics of this planet make it similar to Earth in terms of mass and radius.

Orbit [ edit ] GJ 3929 b orbits its star at a distance of 0.0252 astronomical units (3,770,000 km), which makes it located in its host star's Venus zone , a region where rocky planets would have runaway greenhouse conditions like Venus .

[ 4 ] GJ 3929 b completes an orbit around its star every 2 days, 14 hours and 47 minutes (2.616 days).

[ 4 ] As a terrestrial planet that orbits in the Venus zone of its star, GJ 3929 b classifies as a Venus -like planet, having a planetary equilibrium temperature of 295 °C and receiving planetary insolation 17 times greater than that of Earth receives from the Sun.

[ 4 ] Atmosphere [ edit ] The high density of GJ 3929 b does not suggest a dense atmosphere.

[ 4 ] Atmospheric scenarios such as a thin atmosphere of volatiles , a thin atmosphere of silicate enriched in refractory elements , or even no atmosphere at all are plausible.

[ 4 ] Due to its proximity to its star, GJ 3929 b has probably already lost much of its atmosphere since its formation .

[ 4 ] GJ 3929 b is an excellent planet for atmospheric study with the James Webb Space Telescope .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The study of this planet's atmosphere can help reveal the evolutionary history of its planetary system, and provide more information about planetary formation models.

[ 4 ] Artist's impression and size comparison of the two planets in the GJ 3929 system with Earth Discovery [ edit ] GJ 3929 b was discovered by a team of astronomers led by Jonas Kermer, from the Heidelberg University in Germany .

[ 2 ] They reported a transit signal identified in the host star ( GJ 3929 )'s light curve detected by NASA 's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).

[ 2 ] Afterwards, the planetary nature of this transit signal was confirmed using radial velocity observations with the CARMENES spectrograph , in addition to transit observations made with SAINT-EX and LCOGT .

[ 5 ] [ 2 ] The discovery was announced in 2022.

[ 1 ] The radial velocity observation with CARMENES also helped discover another planet in the planetary system, GJ 3929 c , a sub-Neptune detected by radial velocity.

[ 5 ] Host star [ edit ] Main article: GJ 3929 GJ 3929 is a red dwarf of spectral type M3.5V [ 7 ] that is located 51.6 light years from Earth, in the constellation Corona Borealis .

[ 3 ] [ note 1 ] This star is smaller, cooler and less luminous than the Sun , having a radius of 0.32 R ☉ , an effective temperature of 3,384 K (3,111 °C) and a luminosity equivalent to 1% of solar luminosity .

[ 4 ] Its age is estimated between 2.2 and 11 billion years.

[ 4 ] The star also hosts another planet, called GJ 3929 c , a sub-Neptune orbits 3 times further than the innermost planet, at a distance of 0.081 astronomical units (12,100,000 km), [ 5 ] but still below the habitable zone .
