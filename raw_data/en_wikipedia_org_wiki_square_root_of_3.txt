Continued fraction 1 + 1 1 + 1 2 + 1 1 + 1 2 + 1 1 + ⋱ ⋱ {\displaystyle 1+{\cfrac {1}{1+{\cfrac {1}{2+{\cfrac {1}{1+{\cfrac {1}{2+{\cfrac {1}{1+\ddots }}}}}}}}}}} The square root of 3 is the positive real number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the number 3 . It is denoted mathematically as 3 {\textstyle {\sqrt {3}}} or 3 1 / 2 {\displaystyle 3^{1/2}} . It is more precisely called the principal square root of 3 to distinguish it from the negative number with the same property. The square root of 3 is an irrational number . It is also known as Theodorus' constant , after Theodorus of Cyrene , who proved its irrationality.

[ 1 ] In 2013, its numerical value in decimal notation was computed to ten billion digits.

[ 2 ] Its decimal expansion , written here to 65 decimal places, is given by OEIS : A002194 : 1.73205 08075 68877 29352 74463 41505 87236 69428 05253 81038 06280 55806 Archimedes reported a range for its value: ( 1351 780 ) 2 > 3 > ( 265 153 ) 2 {\textstyle ({\frac {1351}{780}})^{2}>3>({\frac {265}{153}})^{2}} .

[ 3 ] The upper limit 1351 780 {\textstyle {\frac {1351}{780}}} is an accurate approximation for 3 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}} to 1 608 , 400 {\textstyle {\frac {1}{608,400}}} (six decimal places, relative error 3 × × 10 − − 7 {\textstyle 3\times 10^{-7}} ) and the lower limit 265 153 {\textstyle {\frac {265}{153}}} to 2 23 , 409 {\textstyle {\frac {2}{23,409}}} (four decimal places, relative error 1 × × 10 − − 5 {\textstyle 1\times 10^{-5}} ).

Geometry and trigonometry [ edit ] The height of an equilateral triangle with edge length 2 is √ 3 . Also, the long leg of a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse 2.

And, the height of a regular hexagon with sides of length 1 The space diagonal of the unit cube is √ 3 .

The square root of 3 can be found as the leg length of an equilateral triangle that encompasses a circle with a diameter of 1.

If an equilateral triangle with sides of length 1 is cut into two equal halves, by bisecting an internal angle across to make a right angle with one side, the right angle triangle's hypotenuse is length one, and the sides are of length 1 2 {\textstyle {\frac {1}{2}}} and 3 2 {\textstyle {\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}} . From this, tan ⁡ ⁡ 60 ∘ ∘ = 3 {\textstyle \tan {60^{\circ }}={\sqrt {3}}} , sin ⁡ ⁡ 60 ∘ ∘ = 3 2 {\textstyle \sin {60^{\circ }}={\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}} , and cos ⁡ ⁡ 30 ∘ ∘ = 3 2 {\textstyle \cos {30^{\circ }}={\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}} .

The square root of 3 also appears in algebraic expressions for various other trigonometric constants , including [ 4 ] the sines of other angles.

It is the distance between parallel sides of a regular hexagon with sides of length 1.

It is the length of the space diagonal of a unit cube .

The vesica piscis has a major axis to minor axis ratio equal to 1 : 3 {\displaystyle 1:{\sqrt {3}}} . This can be shown by constructing two equilateral triangles within it.
