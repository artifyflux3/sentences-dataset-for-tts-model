Biography [ edit ] Bastian was born at Truro, Cornwall and graduated from University of London in 1861.

[ 1 ] He obtained his M.D.

in 1866. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1868 and a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1870.

[ 1 ] In 1867, Bastian was elected Professor of Pathology and Assistant Physician at UCL Medical School and successively became Professor of Clinical Medicine at UCL Medical School.

[ 1 ] In 1868, he became assistant physician to the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic , then full physician in 1887. He served at the National Hospital until he retired in 1912.

[ 1 ] He was an advocate of the doctrine of archebiosis .

[ 1 ] He believed he witnessed the spontaneous generation of living organisms out of non living matter under his microscope and therefore argued against the concept of germ theory . He promoted a theory of "heterogenesis", a process by which existing living beings give birth to wholly different forms.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Bastian's criticism of the germ theory of disease has been linked to the theory's initially slow impact in the UK.

[ 4 ] The term biogenesis was coined by Henry Bastian.
