[ 1 ] It was founded by Nimbarka , [ 2 ] [ 1 ] [ 3 ] a Telugu Brahmin yogi and philosopher. It propounds the Vaishnava Bhedabheda theology of Dvaitadvaita (dvaita-advaita) or dualistic non-dualism .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Dvaitadvaita states that humans are both different and non-different from Isvara , God or Supreme Being. Specifically, this Sampradaya is a part of Krishnaism — Krishna -centric traditions.

[ 7 ] Guru Parampara [ edit ] Śrī Haṃsa Bhagavān , the originator of the Śrī Nimbārka Sampradāya Nimbarka Sampradaya is also known as Kumāra Sampradāya, Hamsa Sampradāya, and Sanakādi Sampradāya. According to tradition, the Nimbarka Sampradaya Dvaita-advaita philosophy was revealed by Śrī Hansa Bhagavān to Sri Sanakadi Bhagawan , one of the Four Kumaras; who passed it to Sri Narada Muni ; and then on to Nimbarka . The Four Kumaras : Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanātana, and Sanat Kumāra, are traditionally regarded as the four mind-born sons of Lord Brahmā . They were created by Brahmā in order to advance creation, but chose to undertake lifelong vows of celibacy ( brahmacarya ), becoming renowned yogis , who requested from Brahma the boon of remaining perpetually five years old.

[ 8 ] Śrī Sanat Kumāra Samhitā , a treatise on the worship of Śrī Rādhā Kṛṣṇa , is attributed to the brothers, just like the Śrī Sanat Kumāra Tantra , which is part of the Pancarātra literature.

[ 9 ] In the creation of this universe as narrated by the Paurāṇika literature, Śrī Nārada Muni is the younger brother of the Four Kumāras, who took initiation from his older brothers . Their discussions as guru and disciple are recorded in the Upaniṣads with a famous conversation in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad , and in the Śrī Nārada Purāṇa and the Pañcarātra literature.

Nārada Muni is recorded as main teacher in all four of the Vaiṣṇava Sampradāyas . According to tradition, he initiated Śrī Nimbārkācārya into the sacred 18-syllabled Śrī Gopāla Mantra (Klim Krishnaya Govindaya Gopijanavallabhaya Svaha), and introduced him to the philosophy of the Yugala upāsana , the devotional worship of the divine couple Śrī Rādhā Kṛṣṇa . According to tradition, this was the first time that Śrī Rādhā Kṛṣṇa were worshipped together by anyone on earth other than the Gopis of Vṛndāvana . Śrī Nārada Muni then taught Nimbarka the essence of devotional service in the Śrī Nārada Bhakti Sūtras .

[ 10 ] Śrī Nimbārkācārya already knew the Vedas , Upaniṣads and the rest of the scriptures, but perfection was found in the teachings of Śrī Nārada Muni.

[ 11 ] Nimbarka [ edit ] Dating [ edit ] Nimbarka is conventionally dated at the 7th or 11th century, but this dating has been questioned, suggesting that Nimbarka lived somewhat earlier than Shankara, in the 6th or 7th century CE. According to Roma Bose, Nimbarka lived in the 13th century, on the presupposition that Śrī Nimbārkāchārya was the author of the work Madhvamukhamardana .

[ 12 ] [ note 1 ] Meanwhile, Vijay Ramnarace concluded that the work Madhvamukhamardana has been wrongly attributed to Nimbarkacharya.

[ 13 ] This view is also supported by traditional scholars, who hold a similar perspective.

[ 14 ] Bhandarkar has placed him after Ramanuja, suggesting 1162 AD as the date of his demise.

[ 15 ] S.N. Dasgupta, on the other hand, dates Nimbārka to the mid-14th century.

[ 16 ] Dasgupta bases this dating on the absence of Nimbārka's mention in the Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha , a doxography by 14th-century author Mādhava Vidyāraṇya .

[ 17 ] However, it is important to note that none of the Bhedābhedins—whether Bhartṛprapañca, Nimbārka, Bhāskara , or Yādavaprakāśa —are referenced in the Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha .

[ 18 ] while S. A. A. Rizvi assigns a date of c. 1130–1200 AD.

[ 19 ] According to Satyanand, Bose's dating of the 13th century is an erroneous attribution.

[ 20 ] Malkovsky, following Satyanand, notes that in Bhandarkar's own work it is clearly stated that his dating of Nimbarka was an approximation based on an extremely flimsy calculation; yet most scholars chose to honour his suggested date, even until modern times.

[ 2 ] According to Malkovsky, Satyanand has convincingly demonstrated that Nimbarka and his immediate disciple Srinivasacharya flourished well before Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE), arguing that Srinivasacharya was a contemporary, or just after Sankaracarya (early 8th century).

[ 2 ] According to Ramnarace, summarising the available research, Nimbarka must be dated in the 7th century CE.

[ 3 ] Traditional accounts [ edit ] According to the Bhavishya Purana , and his eponymous tradition, the Nimbārka Sampradāya, Śrī Nimbārkāchārya appeared in the year 3096 BCE, when the grandson of Arjuna was on the throne. According to tradition, Nimbārka was born in Vaidūryapattanam, the present-day Mungi Village, Paithan in East Maharashtra .

[ citation needed ] His parents were Aruṇa Ṛṣi and Jayantī Devī. Together, they migrated to Mathurā and settled at what is now known as Nimbagrāma (Neemgaon), situated between Barsānā and Govardhan.

Philosophy [ edit ] Main article: Svabhavika Bhedabheda Dvaitādvaita [ edit ] The Nimbarka Sampradaya follows the doctrine of Svābhāvika Bhedabheda also known as dvaitādvaita. The doctrine of Svābhāvika Bhedābheda is primarily elaborated in the works of Nimbārka and Srinivasacharya , particularly Nimbarka's Vedānta pārijāta saurabha and Vedānta Kaustubha , commentaries on the Brahma Sūtras.

Svābhāvika Bhedābheda discern three foundational elements of reality: Brahman , which is the metaphysical ultimate reality ; [ 21 ] the controller.

[ 22 ] Chit , representing the Jivātman , which is the sentient, individual soul; [ 21 ] the enjoyer.

[ 22 ] Achit, which is the non-sentient universe ; [ 21 ] the object to be enjoyed.

[ 22 ] Svābhāvika Bhedābheda holds that the individual soul ( jīva ) and the non-sentient universe (jagat) are both distinct from and identical to Brahman, the ultimate reality, depending on the perspective. Brahman alone is svatantra tattva (independent reality), while the activities and existence of the other two realities depend on Brahman are regarded as paratantra tattva (dependent reality).

[ 23 ] In this approach the relation between Atman and Brahman is " svābhāvika or natural, not brought about by any external agency, and therefore it cannot be dispensed with. An adventitious relation can be finished away by removing the cause or agency which has brought it, but what is inherent or more appropriately natural cannot be taken away." [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Brahman pervades the entire universe and is immanent in all beings, yet they retain their individuality.

[ 26 ] The non-sentient universe is not considered an illusion (māyā), but a real manifestation of Brahman's power.

[ 27 ] The philosophy draws on metaphors like the sun and its rays, fire and its sparks, to demonstrate the natural, inherent connection between Brahman and its manifestations.

Brahman [ edit ] They regard Brahman as the universal soul, both transcendent and immanent, referred to by various names such as Śrī Kṛṣṇa , Viṣnu , Vāsudeva , Purushottama , Nārāyaņa , Paramatman , Bhagawan and so on.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Similarly, Nimbārkācārya , in his Vedanta Kamadhenu Daśaślokī , refers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa alongside his consort Rādhā.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Brahman is the supreme being, the source of all auspicious qualities, and possesses unfathomable attributes. It is omnipresent , omniscient , the lord of all, and greater than all.

[ 35 ] None can be equal to or superior to Brahman. He is the creator, cause of creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe.

[ 28 ] [ 36 ] In Dvaitādvaita, Brahman is saguṇa (with qualities). Therefore, they interprets scriptural passages that describe Brahman as nirguṇa (without qualities)  differently as they argues that nirguṇa , when applied to Brahman, signifies the absence of inauspicious qualities, rather than the complete negation of all attributes.

[ 37 ] Similarly, terms like nirākāra (formless) are understood to denote the absence of an undesirable or inauspicious form. It upheld the view that Śrī Kṛṣṇa possesses all auspicious attributes and that relative qualities such as virtue and vice, or auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, do not affect him.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Sri Nimbarkacharya, on the  worship of the divine couple, in Dasha Shloki (verse 5): [ 3 ] aṅge tu vāme vṛṣabhānujāṁ mudā virājamānām anurūpasaubhagām । sakhīsahasraiḥ parisevitāṁ sadā smarema devīṁ sakaleṣṭakāmadām I reflect on the daughter of Vrsabhānu (Radhikā), who shines with a corresponding beauty on the left side (of Krsna), is attended on by thousands of female friends, and who always confers objects.

[ 31 ] Jivātman (chit) [ edit ] Jivatman is different from physical body , sense organs , mind , prāṇa and Buddhi , all of these are dependent on Individual soul and serve as instrument in such actions as seeing, hearing and so on. Individual soul (Jivātman) is eternal, being of the nature of Knowledge, and knower (possesses the attribute of knowledge).

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] The attribute of knowledge extends beyond the soul, i.e. its occupying a larger space. As in the case of smell, just like smell occupying a larger space than the flower which occupies a smaller space.

[ 43 ] [ 41 ] Practices [ edit ] The basic practice consists of the worship of Sri Radha Madhav , with Sri Radha being personified as the inseparable part of Sri Krishna . Nimbarka Sampradaya became the first Krishnaite tradition in late medieval time.

[ 7 ] Nimbarka refers to five methods to salvation, namely karma (ritual action); vidya (knowledge); upasana or dhyana (meditation); prapatti (surrender to the Lord/devotion); Gurupasatti (devotion and self-surrender to God as Shri Radha Krsna).

Karma (ritual action) [ edit ] Performed conscientiously in a proper spirit, with one's varna and asrama (phase of life) thereby giving rise to knowledge which is a means to salvation).

Vidya (knowledge) [ edit ] Main article: Vidya (Knowledge) Not as a subordinate factor of karma but also not as an independent means for everyone; only for those inclined to spending vast lengths of time in scriptural study and reflection on deeper meanings.

Upasana or dhyana (meditation) [ edit ] It is of three types. First is meditation on the Lord as one's self, i.e. meditation on the Lord as the Inner Controller of the sentient. Second is meditation on the Lord as the Inner Controller of the non-sentient. Final one is meditation on Lord Himself, as different from the sentient and non-sentient. This is again not an independent means to Salvation for all, as only those qualified to perform the upasana (with Yajnopavitam) can perform this Sadhana.

Śaraṇāgati [ edit ] Śaraṇāgati is the complete entrusting of one's own self to the infinitely merciful Lord through the means recommended by the good, when one is convinced of one's incapacity for resorting to other sādhanas like knowledge and the rest.

[ 44 ] In this tradition there are six constituent elements of Śaraṇāgati (total surrender) in Vedāntaratnamañjūṣā: The resolve to treat everyone with good will and friendliness, being convinced of the great truth that everyone and everything, down to as tuft of grass, deserves respect.

[ 45 ] [ 44 ] Discarding what is contrary to the above solemn determination, i.e. refraining from all violence, malice, back- biting, falsehood, etc.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] Strong faith in the protection of the Lord.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] Praying to the Lord for protection, being aware of the fact that the Lord, though all-merciful, does not release anyone who does not pray to Him but is, on the contrary, adverse to Him [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Discarding all false pride and sense of egoity, i.e. assuming an attitude of utter humility [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Complete entrusting of one's own self and whatever belongs to one's self to the Lord, being convinced that such a complete resignation of the 'I' and the 'mine' to the Lord alone induce the mercy and grace of the Lord.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] Literature [ edit ] The literature of the Nimbarka Sampradaya reflects its theological, philosophical, and devotional aspects.

Commentaries on Brahmasūtras [ edit ] The Brahmasūtras of Bādarāyaṇa have been extensively interpreted and commented upon by several distinguished scholars. Among the six primary commentaries are: Vedānta Pārijāta Saurabha by Śrī Nimbārkāchārya.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] Vedānta Kaustubha by Śrī Śrīnivāsāchārya .

[ 49 ] [ 48 ] [ 50 ] Siddhānta Jahnavi by Śrī Devāchārya.

[ 51 ] [ 27 ] Siddhānta Setukā by Śrī Sundara Bhaṭṭāchārya.

[ 52 ] [ 27 ] Vedānta Kaustubha Prabhā by Śrī Keśava Kāśmīrī Bhaṭṭāchārya .

[ 53 ] [ 48 ] Vedānta Kaustubha Prabhā Bhāvadipikā by Śrī Pandita Amolakrama Śāstrī.

[ 54 ] Vedāntakāmadhenu Daśaślokī [ edit ] A small work of Nimbārkāchārya containing ten stanzas [ 55 ] The Daśaślokī have been extensively commented upon by several scholars. Among them, the three primary commentaries [ 26 ] are: Vedāntaratnamañjūṣā of Śrī Puruṣottamāchārya [ 56 ] [ 26 ] Vedānta Siddhāntaratnāñjali of Śrī Harivyāsa Devāchārya [ 55 ] [ 26 ] Vedāntalaghumañjūṣā of Śrī Giridhara dāsa [ 56 ] [ 26 ] Nimbarka Sampradaya Devachāryas [ edit ] Sri Bhatta [ edit ] As themes of Radha and Krishna gained popularity, Keshava Kashmiri 's disciple Sribhatta in the 15th century, amplified Nimbarka 's insights and brought Radha Krishna once more into the theological forefront through the medium of brajbhasha. A range of poets and theologians who flourished in the milieu of Vrindavana, Vallabha , Surdas , rest of Vallabha's disciples, Svami Haridas , Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and the Six Goswamis of Vrindavana were influenced in some manner by Sribhatta. The theological insights by this particular teacher were developed by his disciple Harivyasa, whose works reveal not only the theology of Radha Krisna and the sakhis the nitya nikunja lilas of goloka vrindavana, but also embody a fairly developed vedantic theory propagating the unique branch of Bhedabheda philosophy, ultimately the legacy of Nimbarka's original re-envisaging role of Radha.

[ 57 ] Śrī Harivyāsa Devacārya (c. 1443–1543 CE) [ edit ] Main article: Harivyas devacharya Harivyasa devacharya ( c.

See also [ edit ] Svayam Bhagavan Vrindavan Srinivasacharya Notes [ edit ] ^ Bose: "There is a manuscript called " Madhva -mukha-mardana", a criticism of Madhva's religion, attributed to Nimbarka. This places Nimbarka after Madhva, provided the work is really by Nimbarka. The fact that the manuscript is not lent to anybody by the followers of Madhva, perhaps prevented us as well from having it, no reply even being given to our enquiries. It seems Nimbarka undertook the work because it was Madhva's immediate influence upon the people which he had to fight against for making his own campaign successful. Thus, from internal evidences from well-known works by Nimbarka, we can definitely assert that Nimbarka oould not have flourished before Samkara, whereas we are led to think, on the evidence of the manuscript mentioned above, that he did not flourish also before Madhva; i.e. not before the 13th century A.D.
