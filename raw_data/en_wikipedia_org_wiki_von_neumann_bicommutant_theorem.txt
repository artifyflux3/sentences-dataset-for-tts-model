( September 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , specifically functional analysis , the von Neumann bicommutant theorem relates the closure of a set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space in certain topologies to the bicommutant of that set. In essence, it is a connection between the algebraic and topological sides of operator theory .

The formal statement of the theorem is as follows: Von Neumann bicommutant theorem.

Let M be an algebra consisting of bounded operators on a Hilbert space H , containing the identity operator, and closed under taking adjoints . Then the closures of M in the weak operator topology and the strong operator topology are equal, and are in turn equal to the bicommutant M ′′ of M .

This algebra is called the von Neumann algebra generated by M .

There are several other topologies on the space of bounded operators, and one can ask what are the *-algebras closed in these topologies. If M is closed in the norm topology then it is a C*-algebra , but not necessarily a von Neumann algebra. One such example is the C*-algebra of compact operators (on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space). For most other common topologies the closed *-algebras containing 1 are von Neumann algebras; this applies in particular to the weak operator, strong operator, *-strong operator, ultraweak , ultrastrong , and *-ultrastrong topologies.

It is related to the Jacobson density theorem .

Proof [ edit ] Let H be a Hilbert space and L ( H ) the bounded operators on H . Consider a self-adjoint unital subalgebra M of L ( H ) (this means that M contains the adjoints of its members, and the identity operator on H ).

The theorem is equivalent to the combination of the following three statements: (i) cl W ( M ) ⊆ M ′′ (ii) cl S ( M ) ⊆ cl W ( M ) (iii) M ′′ ⊆ cl S ( M ) where the W and S subscripts stand for closures in the weak and strong operator topologies, respectively.

Proof of (i) [ edit ] For any x and y in H , the map T → < Tx , y > is continuous in the weak operator topology, by its definition. Therefore, for any fixed operator O , so is the map T → → ⟨ ⟨ ( O T − − T O ) x , y ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ T x , O ∗ ∗ y ⟩ ⟩ − − ⟨ ⟨ T O x , y ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle T\to \langle (OT-TO)x,y\rangle =\langle Tx,O^{*}y\rangle -\langle TOx,y\rangle } Let S be any subset of L ( H ) , and S ′ its commutant . For any operator T in S ′, this function is zero for all O in S . For any T not in S ′, it must be nonzero for some O in S and some x and y in H . By its continuity there is an open neighborhood of T for the weak operator topology on which it is nonzero, and which therefore is also not in S ′. Hence any commutant S ′ is closed in the weak operator topology.  In particular, so is M ′′ ; since it contains M , it also contains its weak operator closure.

Proof of (ii) [ edit ] This follows directly from the weak operator topology being coarser than the strong operator topology: for every point x in cl S ( M ) , every open neighborhood of x in the weak operator topology is also open in the strong operator topology and therefore contains a member of M ; therefore x is also a member of cl W ( M ) .

Proof of (iii) [ edit ] Fix X ∈ M ′′ . We must show that X ∈ cl S ( M ) , i.e. for each h ∈ H and any ε > 0 , there exists T in M with || Xh − Th || < ε .

Fix h in H . The cyclic subspace M h = { Mh : M ∈ M } is invariant under the action of any T in M . Its closure cl( M h ) in the norm of H is a closed linear subspace, with corresponding orthogonal projection P : H → cl( M h ) in L ( H ). In fact, this P is in M ′ , as we now show.

Lemma.

P ∈ M ′ .

Proof.

Fix x ∈ H . As Px ∈ cl( M h ) , it is the limit of a sequence O n h with O n in M . For any T ∈ M , TO n h is also in M h , and by the continuity of T , this sequence converges to TPx . So TPx ∈ cl( M h ) , and hence PTPx = TPx . Since x was arbitrary, we have PTP = TP for all T in M .

Since M is closed under the adjoint operation and P is self-adjoint , for any x , y ∈ H we have ⟨ ⟨ x , T P y ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ x , P T P y ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ ( P T P ) ∗ ∗ x , y ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ P T ∗ ∗ P x , y ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ T ∗ ∗ P x , y ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ P x , T y ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ x , P T y ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle x,TPy\rangle =\langle x,PTPy\rangle =\langle (PTP)^{*}x,y\rangle =\langle PT^{*}Px,y\rangle =\langle T^{*}Px,y\rangle =\langle Px,Ty\rangle =\langle x,PTy\rangle } So TP = PT for all T ∈ M , meaning P lies in M ′ .

By definition of the bicommutant , we must have XP = PX . Since M is unital, h ∈ M h , and so h = Ph . Hence Xh = XPh = PXh ∈ cl( M h ) . So for each ε > 0 , there exists T in M with || Xh − Th || < ε , i.e.

X is in the strong operator closure of M .

Non-unital case [ edit ] A C*-algebra M acting on H is said to act non-degenerately if for h in H , M h = {0} implies h = 0 . In this case, it can be shown using an approximate identity in M that the identity operator I lies in the strong closure of M . Therefore, the conclusion of the bicommutant theorem holds for M .
