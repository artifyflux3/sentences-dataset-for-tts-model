In 1839, he became a member of the Royal Society .

John Hogg is credited with the creation of a fourth kingdom, accompanying Carl Linnaeus 's Lapides, Plantae and Animalia, to classify Life , namely Protoctista .

Background [ edit ] In 1735, the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus formalized living things into two supergroups, in his monumental Systema Naturae . All organisms were placed into the Kingdoms Plantae and Animalia. Linnaeus added a third kingdom of the natural world in 1766; Lapides ( rocks ). These were deemed to be similar to plants in that they were, neither living nor sentient, i.e. not having senses. They were further characterised as solid bodied.

[ 1 ] Fourth kingdom [ edit ] In 1860, Hogg created a fourth kingdom, the Regnum Primigenum or Protoctista .

[ 2 ] His rationale was simply that a kingdom of 'first beings' was necessary, as these entities were believed to have existed prior to plants and animals.

Hogg attempted to justify his arguments for a fourth kingdom with Spongilla , a freshwater green sponge, that was an animal known to exude oxygen in the light. However, the photosynthesis was later shown to be a result of symbiotic ' algae '.

[ 3 ] Such an attempt to apply non-reductionist thought to classification systems during a period of biological debate made Hogg a protagonist within the field of nineteenth century biology along with Ernst Haeckel and Charles Darwin .

The standard author abbreviation J.Hogg is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .
