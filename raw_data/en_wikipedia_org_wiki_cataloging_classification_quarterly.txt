4538259 Links Journal homepage Cataloging & Classification Quarterly is a peer-reviewed, scholarly journal that publishes articles about library cataloging , classification , metadata , indexing , information retrieval , information management , and other topics related to library cataloging. Despite its name, the journal is published eight times a year, but occasionally some issues are combined. Thematic issues are interspersed with general issues.

[ 1 ] The editor-in-chief since volume 42 has been Sandra K. Roe. The journal was published by Haworth Press until 2007 when the company was acquired by Taylor and Francis , the current publisher.
