One or more editors believe it holds the title of a broad-concept article . Please check the talk page to read the discussion or establish consensus. The article may be written here or drafted elsewhere and then moved.

A horizon is a boundary in spacetime satisfying prescribed conditions.

There are several types of horizons that play a role in Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity : Absolute horizon , a boundary in spacetime in general relativity inside of which events cannot affect an external observer Event horizon , a boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect the observer, thus referring to a black hole 's boundary and the boundary of an expanding universe Apparent horizon , a surface defined in general relativity Cauchy horizon , a surface found in the study of Cauchy problems Cosmological horizon , a limit of observability Killing horizon , a null surface on which there is a Killing vector field Particle horizon , the maximum distance from which particles can have travelled to an observer in the age of the universe See also [ edit ] Horizon (disambiguation) NewPP limit report
