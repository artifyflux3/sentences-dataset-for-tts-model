There are a number of ways of defining the ordinary Euclidean geometric trigonometric functions on real numbers , for example right-angled triangle definitions , unit circle definitions , series definitions [ broken anchor ] , definitions via differential equations [ broken anchor ] , and definitions using functional equations .

Generalizations of trigonometric functions are often developed by starting with one of the above methods and adapting it to a situation other than the real numbers of Euclidean geometry. Generally, trigonometry can be the study of triples of points in any kind of geometry or space . A triangle is the polygon with the smallest number of vertices, so one direction to generalize is to study higher-dimensional analogs of angles and polygons: solid angles and polytopes such as tetrahedrons and n -simplices .

Trigonometry [ edit ] In spherical trigonometry , triangles on the surface of a sphere are studied. The spherical triangle identities are written in terms of the ordinary trigonometric functions but differ from the plane triangle identities .

Hyperbolic functions in Euclidean geometry: The unit circle is parameterized by (cos t , sin t ) whereas the equilateral hyperbola is parameterized by (cosh t , sinh t ).

Gyrotrigonometry : A form of trigonometry used in the gyrovector space approach to hyperbolic geometry , with applications to special relativity and quantum computation .

[ 10 ] In time scale calculus , differential equations and difference equations are unified into dynamic equations on time scales which also includes q-difference equations . Trigonometric functions can be defined on an arbitrary time scale (a subset of the real numbers).

The series definitions [ broken anchor ] of sin and cos define these functions on any algebra where the series converge such as complex numbers [ broken anchor ] , p -adic numbers , matrices , and various Banach algebras .
