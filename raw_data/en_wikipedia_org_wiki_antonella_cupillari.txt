She is an associate professor of mathematics at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College .

[ 2 ] Education and career [ edit ] Cupillari earned a laurea at the University of L'Aquila in 1978, and completed her Ph.D. at the University at Albany, SUNY in 1984.

[ 2 ] Her dissertation, A Small Boundary for H ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle H^{\infty }} on a Strictly Pseudoconvex Domain , concerned functional analysis , and was supervised by R. Michael (Rolf) Range; [ 3 ] she also published it in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 4 ] Cupillari joined the faculty at Penn State Erie in 1984 and was promoted to associate professor in 1992.

[ 2 ] Books [ edit ] Cupillari is the author of books on mathematics and the history of mathematics including: The Nuts and Bolts of Proofs (Wadsworth, 1989; 2nd & 3rd eds., Harcourt/Academic Press, 2000 & 2005; 4th ed., Academic Press, 2011) [ 5 ] Intermediate Algebra in Action (PWS Publishing, 1995) A Biography of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, an Eighteenth-Century Woman Mathematician: With Translations of Some of Her Work from Italian into English (Edwin Mellen Press, 2007) [ 6 ] Recognition [ edit ] Cupillari was the 2008 winner of the Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics of the Allegheny Mountain Section of the Mathematical Association of America .
