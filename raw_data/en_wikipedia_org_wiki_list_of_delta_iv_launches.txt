Originally designed by Boeing 's Defense, Space and Security division for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, the Delta IV became a United Launch Alliance (ULA) product in 2006. The Delta IV was primarily a launch vehicle for United States Air Force (USAF) military payloads, but was also used to launch a number of United States government non-military payloads and a single commercial satellite.

[ 1 ] The Delta IV originally had two main versions which allowed the family to cover a range of payload sizes and masses: the Medium (which had four configurations) and Heavy .

[ 2 ] Since September 2019, only the Heavy remained active, with payloads that would previously fly on Medium moving to either the existing Atlas V or the forthcoming Vulcan . Retirement of the Delta IV occurred in 2024.

[ 3 ] Delta IV vehicles were built in the ULA facility in Decatur, Alabama . Final assembly was completed at the launch site by ULA: at the horizontal integration facility for launches from SLC-37B pad at Cape Canaveral and in a similar facility for launches from SLC-6 pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base .
