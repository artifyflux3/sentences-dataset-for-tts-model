Dana Professor of Sociology and chair of the department of sociology at Colby College .

[ 2 ] He is also a visiting scholar at New York University 's Institute for Public Knowledge.

[ 3 ] He has written several books on sociological and political topics, and also blogs for The Chronicle of Higher Education .

[ 4 ] Gross edited the American Sociological Association 's journal Sociological Theory from 2009 to 2015.

[ 5 ] He previously taught at the University of Southern California , Harvard University , Princeton University , and the University of British Columbia .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Gross grew up near Berkeley, California , raised by his stay-at-home mother and his father, a legal editor. Both of his parents were avid readers.

[ 7 ] Gross earned a B.A. in Legal Studies from the University of California, Berkeley in 1992, and a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2002.

[ 5 ] Before going to graduate school, Gross was a patrolman in the Berkeley Police Department .

[ 8 ] Career [ edit ] From 2004 to 2008, Gross was an assistant professor of sociology at Harvard University , after which he joined the faculty of the University of British Columbia .

[ 9 ] He was the editor-in-chief of Sociological Theory for six years (2009–2015).

[ 2 ] In 2015, he left the University of British Columbia to become Charles A. Dana professor and chair of sociology at Colby College.

[ 2 ] Biography of Richard Rorty [ edit ] Gross garnered considerable attention for his 2008 book Richard Rorty : The Making of an American Philosopher, which was described by philosopher Barry Allen as using Rorty's life to "build a theory of the sociology of ideas." [ 1 ] [ 10 ] In his review, sociologist Neil Mclaughlin commended Gross for his "careful archival research, innovative theoretical synthesis and substantive contributions." [ 1 ] [ 11 ] On liberalism in academia [ edit ] Another focus of Gross' work has been the political leanings of university professors. With Solon Simmons, he began in 2006 a survey of 1417 faculty members at 927 U.S. universities, colleges, and community colleges, called the Politics of the American Professoriate .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] : 25–26 [ 14 ] According to Inside Higher Ed , several experts said the survey data collected by Gross and Simmons "may become the definitive source for understanding professors' political views." [ 14 ] Gross published an extensive analysis of the survey results in his 2013 book Why Are Professors Liberal and Why Do Conservatives Care?

[ 15 ] He and Simmons further analyzed this field of research in their 2014 compilation, Professors and Their Politics .

[ 13 ] : 25–26 Sociologist Joseph Hermanowicz regarded the compilation as an important work, on a par with " Paul Lazarsfeld and Wagner Theilen's classic study of 1958 and Seymour Martin Lipset and Everett Carll Ladd 's 1976 work." [ 16 ] Gross has found, along with numerous other researchers, that there are more liberals than conservatives in university faculty, [ 13 ] : 25–26 but he added that there is relatively little evidence indicating students are indoctrinated into liberal opinions during college.

[ 5 ] In a field of study where experts disagree, [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] and some have taken opposing views specifically on Gross' methods and interpretations, [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] he has criticized what he sees as conservative political bias intentionally distorting the results of demographic research on campus politics.

[ 13 ] : 20 In a 2017 New York Times editorial entitled "Professors Behaving Badly", Gross wrote that the occasional "political outbursts" by professors on social media may not be a consequence of their far-left politics. Instead, he suggested that professors are becoming alienated by their bleak employment prospects and precarious economic status in the growing adjunct tier of the academic work force.
