[ 6 ] Evie has described itself as a "conservative Cosmo ".

[ 3 ] In September 2022, Evie launched a femtech app called "28byEvie" (later renamed to 28.co) which collects menstruation data and uses it to provide non-scientific exercise and diet advice. The app was funded by Peter Thiel .

[ 4 ] [ 11 ] [ 6 ] Evie has published posts promoting 28.co without explicitly disclosing its founders' connections to the app.

[ 6 ] In December 2024, Evie released a " raw milkmaid " dress aimed at tradwives .

[ 12 ] In May 2025, Evie was sued by Elle magazine owner Hachette Filipacchi Presse for trademark infringement . Hachette alleged that Evie 's logo was nearly identical to that of Elle .

[ 13 ] [ 3 ] Content [ edit ] Evie is an antifeminist publication.

[ 16 ] It has been characterized as alt-right [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and far-right .

[ 17 ] In 2023, the Southern Poverty Law Center identified Evie as a preeminent publication supporting the male supremacist politics of the hard right.

[ 14 ] In 2025, The New York Times described Evie 's content as promoting "positions that are fringe even within conservative circles — criticisms of no-fault divorce and I.V.F.

, for example — packaged in a fun and approachable format." [ 17 ] Evie has published misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines , [ 10 ] transphobic content [ 18 ] [ 1 ] and conspiracy theories , [ 7 ] including QAnon [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and on topics such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 United States presidential election .

[ 6 ] Articles in Evie have denounced the body positivity movement [ 6 ] [ 2 ] and urged women to stop using hormonal contraception .

[ 14 ] [ 19 ] In 2023, Rolling Stone described Evie as "a girlboss -ified Breitbart " and reported that it uses the traditional format of women's fashion publications, including Met Gala slideshows and breakdowns of Taylor Swift 's Eras tour outfits, to attract a Generation Z audience.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] In 2021, Vice said that Evie "attempt[s] to fit vaccine skepticism and outright COVID denial into what's represented as a 'classical' and 'traditional' worldview... While they are, in and of themselves, nothing especially original, Evie 's anti-vax blogs provide[s] a neat little window into how COVID denialism and misinformation are being marketed in one particularly cynical corner of right-wing women's media." [ 5 ] In March 2024, Evie was cited by The Washington Post as an example of "prominent conservative commentators ... sowing misinformation as a way to discourage the use of birth control ." [ 19 ] In August 2024, Futurism characterized Evie as an alt-right women's lifestyle publication whose content "range[s] from innocuous lifestyle posts about fashion trends to a range of bizarre and often harmful content including vaccine misinformation, a bevy of wildly unscientific assertions about women's health, anti-trans fearmongering, unsupported ' psyop ' conspiracies , and pro-life messaging that often includes false claims about safe and effective abortion drugs ." [ 1 ] It added, "In other words, Evie isn't a reliable source of news and information, nor is it simply a conservative outlet. It's a deeply conspiratorial website that ignores scientific facts and critical reasoning", citing an Evie article [ 21 ] asserting that a "recent projection" had found that 45% of women were expected to be single and childless by 2030; the estimate was from a Morgan Stanley report published in September 2019.

[ 1 ] Evie 's 2024 edition praised Donald Trump 's nomination of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

for Secretary of Health and Human Services , and described Dutch far-right commentator Eva Vlaardingerbroek as a " shieldmaiden ", [ 20 ] a term that has been co-opted by the alt-right to describe the female faces of white supremacy and conservatism .

[ 22 ] [ 20 ] Influence [ edit ] Between May 2022 and 2023, Evie 's Instagram following increased from about 34,000 to over 66,000, according to Social Blade . In the same time period, data from Semrush indicated that search traffic to the website had increased from 40,535 users to 226,002 users.

[ 6 ] By April 2025, Evie had 210,000 Instagram followers.

[ 23 ] Evie also maintains a TikTok account.

[ 3 ] In April 2023, Evie 's website received about 1.5 million views. For comparison, in the same month, Cosmopolitan received about 54 million pageviews.

[ 6 ] Contributors and staff [ edit ] In 2023, Rolling Stone reported that Evie had recruited several contributors from Hillsdale College , a private Christian college based in Michigan .

[ 6 ] Contributors to Evie have included: Lauren Chen [ 15 ] Sabrina Kosmas, senior director of outreach for PragerU [ 6 ] Abigail Shapiro, sister of Ben Shapiro [ 6 ] Notable staff members include: Vani Hari , food editor [ 20 ] See also [ edit ] List of women's magazines Notes [ edit ] ^ Martinez uses her maiden name, Martinez, on Evie , [ 24 ] and her married name, Hugoboom, on X (formerly Twitter) [ 25 ] and TikTok .
