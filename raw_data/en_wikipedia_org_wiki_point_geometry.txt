A finite set of points (in red) in the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane").

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **point** is an abstract idealization of an exact [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(geometry) "Position (geometry)"), without size, in [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOhmer196934&ndash;37-1) or its generalization to other kinds of mathematical [spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)"). As [zero-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-dimensional "Zero-dimensional") objects, points are usually taken to be the fundamental indivisible elements comprising the space, of which [one-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional "One-dimensional")[curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve"), [two-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional "Two-dimensional")[surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)"), and [higher-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-dimensional "Higher-dimensional") objects consist.

In classical [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), a point is a [primitive notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion "Primitive notion"), defined as "that which has no part". Points and other primitive notions are not defined in terms of other concepts, but only by certain formal properties, called [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom"), that they must satisfy; for example, _"there is exactly one [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight\_line "Straight line") that passes through two distinct points"_. As physical diagrams, [geometric figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_figure "Geometric figure") are made with tools such as a [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_(drawing_tool) "Compass (drawing tool)"), [scriber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriber "Scriber"), or pen, whose pointed tip can mark a small dot or prick a small hole representing a point, or can be drawn across a surface to represent a curve.

A point can also be determined by the [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(geometry) "Intersection (geometry)") of two curves or three surfaces, called a _[vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex\_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)")_ or _corner_. Since the advent of [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), points are often defined or represented in terms of numerical [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system"). In modern mathematics, a space of points is typically treated as a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)"), a **point set**.

An _[isolated point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated\_point "Isolated point")_ is an element of some subset of points which has some [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)") containing no other points of the subset.

Points in Euclidean geometry
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_(geometry)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Points in Euclidean geometry")]

Points, considered within the framework of [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), are one of the most fundamental objects. [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") originally defined the point as "that which has no part".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeath1956153-2) In the two-dimensional [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane"), a point is represented by an [ordered pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair") (x, y) of numbers, where the first number [conventionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm) "Convention (norm)") represents the [horizontal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane "Horizontal plane") and is often denoted by x, and the second number conventionally represents the [vertical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction "Vertical direction") and is often denoted by y. This idea is easily generalized to three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), where a point is represented by an ordered triplet (x, y, z) with the additional third number representing depth and often denoted by z. Further generalizations are represented by an ordered [tuplet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") of n terms, (_a_ 1, _a_ 2, â€¦ , _a_ _n_) where n is the [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(mathematics) "Dimension (mathematics)") of the space in which the point is located.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTESilverman19697-3)

Many constructs within Euclidean geometry consist of an [infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity") collection of points that conform to certain axioms. This is usually represented by a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of points; As an example, a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(mathematics) "Line (mathematics)") is an infinite set of points of the form ![Image 2: {\displaystyle L=\lbrace (a_{1},a_{2},...a_{n})\mid a_{1}c_{1}+a_{2}c_{2}+...a_{n}c_{n}=d\rbrace ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6357085474a4e3e350092e9ef6a23d710896bd1)where _c_ 1 through _c n_ and d are constants and n is the dimension of the space. Similar constructions exist that define the [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)"), [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment"), and other related concepts.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEde_Laguna1922-4) A line segment consisting of only a single point is called a [degenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics) "Degeneracy (mathematics)") line segment.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In addition to defining points and constructs related to points, Euclid also postulated a key idea about points, that any two points can be connected by a straight line.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeath1956154-5) This is easily confirmed under modern extensions of Euclidean geometry, and had lasting consequences at its introduction, allowing the construction of almost all the geometric concepts known at the time. However, Euclid's postulation of points was neither complete nor definitive, and he occasionally assumed facts about points that did not follow directly from his axioms, such as the ordering of points on the line or the existence of specific points. In spite of this, modern expansions of the system serve to remove these assumptions.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)#cite_note-6)

Dimension of a point
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_(geometry)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Dimension of a point")]

There are several inequivalent definitions of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(mathematics_and_physics) "Dimension (mathematics and physics)") in mathematics. In all of the common definitions, a point is 0-dimensional.

### Vector space dimension

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_(geometry)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Vector space dimension")]

The dimension of a vector space is the maximum size of a [linearly independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly_independent "Linearly independent") subset. In a vector space consisting of a single point (which must be the zero vector **0**), there is no linearly independent subset. The zero vector is not itself linearly independent, because there is a non-trivial linear combination making it zero: ![Image 3: {\displaystyle 1\cdot \mathbf {0} =\mathbf {0} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5e78dd0dbd40c1cff9f389dd57f92deef32f883e).

### Topological dimension

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_(geometry)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Topological dimension")]

The topological dimension of a topological space ![Image 4: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is defined to be the minimum value of _n_, such that every finite [open cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cover "Open cover")![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/280ae03440942ab348c2ca9b8db6b56ffa9618f8) of ![Image 6: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) admits a finite open cover ![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e5622de88a69f68340f8dcb43d0b8bd443ba9e13) of ![Image 8: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) which [refines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinement_(topology) "Refinement (topology)")![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/280ae03440942ab348c2ca9b8db6b56ffa9618f8) in which no point is included in more than _n_+1 elements. If no such minimal _n_ exists, the space is said to be of infinite covering dimension.

A point is [zero-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-dimensional_space "Zero-dimensional space") with respect to the covering dimension because every open cover of the space has a refinement consisting of a single open set.

### Hausdorff dimension

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_(geometry)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Hausdorff dimension")]

Let _X_ be a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"). If _S_ âŠ‚ _X_ and _d_ âˆˆ [0, âˆž), the _d_-dimensional **Hausdorff content** of _S_ is the [infimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum "Infimum") of the set of numbers _Î´_ â‰¥ 0 such that there is some (indexed) collection of [balls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space")![Image 10: {\displaystyle \{B(x_{i},r_{i}):i\in I\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d56213bec375403acbcfdc24a4572832d5dd2124) covering _S_ with _r i_> 0 for each _i_ âˆˆ _I_ that satisfies ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \sum _{i\in I}r_{i}^{d}<\delta .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0400074f098e97bbff8b5fdf452f6b2b744fcc78)

The **Hausdorff dimension** of _X_ is defined by ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \operatorname {dim} _{\operatorname {H} }(X):=\inf\{d\geq 0:C_{H}^{d}(X)=0\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/42a3f5a9afa984b2594bc9ccdec947f9db3143dc)

A point has Hausdorff dimension 0 because it can be covered by a single ball of arbitrarily small radius.

Geometry without points
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_(geometry)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Geometry without points")]

Although the notion of a point is generally considered fundamental in mainstream geometry and topology, there are some systems that forgo it, e.g. [noncommutative geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_geometry "Noncommutative geometry") and [pointless topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_topology "Pointless topology"). A "pointless" or "pointfree" space is defined not as a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)"), but via some structure ([algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C*-algebra "C*-algebra") or [logical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_Heyting_algebra "Complete Heyting algebra") respectively) which looks like a well-known function space on the set: an algebra of [continuous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") or an [algebra of sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets "Algebra of sets") respectively. More precisely, such structures generalize well-known spaces of [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") in a way that the operation "take a value at this point" may not be defined.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGerla1995-7) A further tradition starts from some books of [A. N. Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._N._Whitehead "A. N. Whitehead") in which the notion of [region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_(mathematics) "Region (mathematics)") is assumed as a primitive together with the one of _inclusion_ or _connection_.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)#cite_note-8)

Point masses and the Dirac delta function
-----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_(geometry)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Point masses and the Dirac delta function")]

Often in physics and mathematics, it is useful to think of a point as having non-zero mass or charge (this is especially common in [classical electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism "Classical electromagnetism"), where electrons are idealized as points with non-zero charge). The **Dirac delta function**, or **Î´ function**, is (informally) a [generalized function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_function "Generalized function") on the real number line that is zero everywhere except at zero, with an [integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") of one over the entire real line.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDirac195858More_specifically,_see_%C2%A715._The_%CE%B4_functionGelfandShilov19641%E2%80%935See_%C2%A7%C2%A71.1,_1.3Schwartz19503-9) The delta function is sometimes thought of as an infinitely high, infinitely thin spike at the origin, with total area one under the spike, and physically represents an idealized [point mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass "Point mass") or [point charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_charge "Point charge").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEArfkenWeber200584-10) It was introduced by theoretical physicist [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac"). In the context of [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing "Signal processing") it is often referred to as the **unit impulse symbol** (or function).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBracewell1986Chapter_5-11) Its discrete analog is the [Kronecker delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta "Kronecker delta") function which is usually defined on a finite domain and takes values 0 and 1.
