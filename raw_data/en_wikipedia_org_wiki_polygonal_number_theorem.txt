In additive number theory , the Fermat polygonal number theorem states that every positive integer is a sum of at most n n -gonal numbers . That is, every positive integer can be written as the sum of three or fewer triangular numbers , and as the sum of four or fewer square numbers , and as the sum of five or fewer pentagonal numbers , and so on. That is, the n -gonal numbers form an additive basis of order n .

Examples [ edit ] Three such representations of the number 17, for example, are shown below: 17 = 10 + 6 + 1 ( triangular numbers ) 17 = 16 + 1 ( square numbers ) 17 = 12 + 5 ( pentagonal numbers ).

History [ edit ] Gauss's diary entry related to sum of triangular numbers (1796) The theorem is named after Pierre de Fermat , who stated it, in 1638, without proof, promising to write it in a separate work that never appeared.

[ 1 ] Joseph Louis Lagrange proved the square case in 1770, which states that every positive number can be represented as a sum of four squares, for example, 7 = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 .

[ 1 ] Gauss proved the triangular case in 1796,  commemorating the occasion by writing in his diary the line " ΕΥΡΗΚΑ!

num = Δ + Δ + Δ ", [ 2 ] and published a proof in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae . For this reason, Gauss's result is sometimes known as the Eureka theorem .

[ 3 ] The full polygonal number theorem was not resolved until it was finally proven by Cauchy in 1813.

[ 1 ] The proof of Nathanson (1987) is based on the following lemma due to Cauchy: For odd positive integers a and b such that b 2 < 4 a and 3 a < b 2 + 2 b + 4 we can find nonnegative integers s , t , u , and v such that a = s 2 + t 2 + u 2 + v 2 and b = s + t + u + v .
