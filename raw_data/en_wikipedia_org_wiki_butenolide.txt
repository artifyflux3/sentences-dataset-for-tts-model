[ 2 ] They are sometimes considered oxidized derivatives of furan . The simplest butenolide is 2-furanone , which is a common component of larger natural products and is sometimes referred to as simply "butenolide".  A common biochemically important butenolide is ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Butenolide derivatives known as karrikins are produced by some plants on exposure to high temperatures due to brush fires . In particular, 3-methyl-2 H -furo[2,3- c ]pyran-2-one was found to trigger seed germination in plants whose reproduction is fire-dependent.
