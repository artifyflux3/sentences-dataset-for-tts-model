Spain and Portugal are themselves sometimes included in some Ibero-American diplomatic circles, such as the Ibero-American Summit and the Organization of Ibero-American States . The Organization of Ibero-American States also includes Spanish-speaking Equatorial Guinea , in Central Africa , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] but not the Portuguese-speaking African countries . The Latin Recording Academy , the organization responsible for the Latin Grammy Awards , also includes Spain and Portugal as well as the Latino population of Canada and the United States in their definition of Ibero-America.

[ 3 ] The prefix Ibero- and the adjective Iberian refer to the Iberian Peninsula in Europe, which includes Portugal and Spain. Ibero-America includes all Hispanic American countries in North , Central , and South America plus the Hispanophone Caribbean , as well as Portuguese-speaking Brazil. Ibero-America makes up the overwhelming bulk of and is synonymous with the common definition of Latin America , but is differentiated from the expanded definition of Latin America by the exclusion of the French-speaking country of Haiti , the French overseas departments of French Guiana , Guadeloupe and Martinique , and the French collectivities of Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin , which are sometimes included in a few definitions of Latin America.

Belize and Guyana , whose official language is English, and Dutch-speaking Suriname , Aruba , Bonaire , Curaçao , Saba , Sint Eustatius , and Sint Maarten are usually not considered to be either Ibero-American or Latin American.

Since 1991, the Iberoamerican Community of Nations organizes a yearly Ibero-American Summit meeting of the heads of state and governments of the Ibero-American countries, including Spain, Portugal and Andorra , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] this has since changed to biannually from 2014.
