It separates Ōmaha Bay to the north from Kawau Bay and Kawau Island to the south. The nearest sizable town is Warkworth .

Tāwharanui Regional Park covers 588 hectares of the peninsula's land and Tāwharanui Marine Reserve covers the northern coastal sea. Both are administered by Auckland Council [ 1 ] which also owns the regional park.

Geologically the peninsula consists of Waitemata Sandstone on top of folded and uplifted greywacke .

[ 2 ] Tāwharanui Marine Park was established offshore of the peninsula in 1981 as New Zealand's first Marine Protected Area .

[ 2 ] The marine park was replaced by Tāwharanui Marine Reserve in September 2011.

[ 3 ] North Island brown kiwi was reintroduced into the area.

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] Māori lived in the area for over 800 years. The Māori name Tāwhara-nui refers to "the abundant bracts of the kiekie vine".

[ 5 ] Until the 1870s, the park was occupied by a small hapū (sub-tribe) of the Te Kawerau people called Ngati Raupo. The people lived mainly around the catchment of the Mangatawhiri Stream. A significant pā , Oponui, was near the entrance to the park and above the stream outlet was Pa-hi (meaning "lofty fortified settlement"). Tāwharanui provided a large variety of marine and forest resources. This was celebrated in the saying, " He wha tāwhara ki uta; he kiko tamure ki tai " – "The flowering bracts of the kiekie on the land, the flesh of the snapper in the sea". Waikokowai (Anchor Bay) provided a valued source of kokowai or red ochre , which was used for decorative and ceremonial purposes.

Tāwharanui was sold by the Māori owners in 1873–1877 and developed as a farm by the Martin, Jones and Young families.

Kauri timber was milled and manuka cut for firewood for many years. Shingle was extracted for a hundred years, creating the Jones Bay Lagoon. Nine vessels were wrecked on the Tāwharanui coastline between 1871 and 1978.

[ 2 ] Anchor Bay is named after the anchor of the Phoenix , wrecked in 1879.

[ 6 ] The Auckland Regional Authority, forerunner of the Auckland Council, purchased the parkland from the Georgetti family in 1973.

Demographics [ edit ] Tawharanui Peninsula statistical area covers the area east of Matakana and Sandspit , including Ōmaha , Point Wells , Baddeleys Beach-Campbells Beach and Buckleton Beach .
