[ 2 ] Biography [ edit ] Robb studied at Queen's College, Belfast (BA 1894) and at St John's College, Cambridge (Tripos 1897, MA 1901).

[ 3 ] He then proceeded to University of Göttingen , where, guided by Woldemar Voigt , he wrote his dissertation on the Zeeman effect . He also worked under J. J. Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory . The Croix de Guerre was awarded to him for WWI service in the Red Cross , and in 1921 he became a fellow of the Royal Society .

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] He is known for his four books on special relativity (1911, 1914, 1921, 1936) where he gave a spacetime derivation of the theory in an axiomatic-geometric way.

[ 5 ] Robb therefore was sometimes called the "Euclid of relativity". In the first of these works he used a hyperbolic angle ω to introduce the concept of rapidity [ 6 ] : 9 and showed that the kinematic space of velocities is hyperbolic , so that "instead of a Euclidean triangle of velocities, we get a Lobachevski triangle of rapidities".

[ 6 ] : 29 However, contrary to the scientific mainstream, he believed that the works of Joseph Larmor and Hendrik Lorentz were more important for relativity than the works of Albert Einstein and Hermann Minkowski .
