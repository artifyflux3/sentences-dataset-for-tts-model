It was discovered on 25 September 1929, by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany.

[ 3 ] It is named after Johannes Kepler .

[ 2 ] Orbit and classification [ edit ] Kepler orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.4–3.9 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,601 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.47 and an inclination of 15 ° with respect to the ecliptic .

[ 1 ] The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg, the night after its official discovery observation.

[ 3 ] Physical characteristics [ edit ] In the SMASS taxonomy, Kepler is a stony S-type asteroid .

[ 1 ] Diameter and albedo [ edit ] Its diameter has not been estimated by any of the prominent space-based surveys such as the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS (1982), the Japanese Akari satellite (2006), NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (2009) or its subsequent NEOWISE mission (2013).

[ 1 ] Based on a generic magnitude -to-diameter conversion, Kepler ' s diameter is between 3 and 8 kilometer for an absolute magnitude of 14.2 and an assumed albedo in the range of 0.25 to 0.05.

[ 4 ] Since its spectral type falls into the class of stony asteroids, which have an averaged standard albedo around 0.20, Kepler ' s generic diameter is close to 4 kilometers, as the higher a body's albedo (reflectivity), the shorter its diameter at a fixed absolute magnitude (brightness).

[ 4 ] Kepler ' s rotation period is 0.1148 day, [ 5 ] a pretty common value for asteroids of this size.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Naming [ edit ] This minor planet was named on the commemoration of the 300th death anniversary of astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), best known for his laws of planetary motion . Kepler is also honored by a lunar and Martian crater, by Kepler Dorsum – a mountain ridge on the Martian moon Phobos, and by Kepler's Supernova .

[ 2 ] Naming citation was first published in 1930, in the astronomy journal Astronomical Notes ( AN 240, 135).

[ 2 ] The space observatory Kepler and its many discovered exoplanets also bear his name (see also Kepler (disambiguation) ) .
