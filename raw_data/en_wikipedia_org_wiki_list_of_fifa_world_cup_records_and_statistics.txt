Following World War II and the division of Germany, the DFB was re-admitted to FIFA after the 1950 World Cup as West Germany .

Saar competed in the 1954 World Cup qualifying before joining West Germany in 1956.

East Germany fielded teams of their own from 1958 to 1990 before joining with West Germany and the DFB during the German reunification . FIFA officially attributes all international results of the DFB team since 1908 to Germany, including the results of West Germany from 1954–1990.

^ The Soviet Union qualified seven times prior to its dissolution in 1991. The 15 former nations Soviet republics now compete separately. FIFA considers Russia as the successor team of the Soviet Union.

^ The Yugoslavia national football team qualified eight times during eras of Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1930) and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1950–1990). They qualified from 1930–1990 under the name Yugoslavia before its breakup in 1992 by the secession of many of its constituent republics. They qualified once in 1998 as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , then changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, only qualifying under that name in 2006. All of these teams are considered the predecessors of the current Serbia team by FIFA, which first qualified under that name in 2010. The other national teams that resulted from the breakup of the SFR Yugoslavia in 1992 — Croatia , Slovenia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , and North Macedonia — are considered distinct entities from the Yugoslavia team of 1930–1990.

Montenegro now also competes separately after independence in 2006 and Kosovo was recognized by FIFA in 2016.

^ a b Czechoslovakia qualified eight times prior to being divided into Slovakia and the Czech Republic in 1993. FIFA considers both the Czech Republic and Slovakia the successor team of Czechoslovakia. The Czech Republic national team qualified for the World Cup for the first time as a separate nation in 2006, with Slovakia doing the same in 2010.

^ Indonesia competed as the Dutch East Indies in 1938.

^ The Democratic Republic of the Congo competed as Zaire in 1974.

^ Uruguay (76 years) and England (60 years) have longer active streaks.

^ Only played in first two matches; medal awarded retroactively by FIFA in 2007.

[ 43 ] ^ Pelé , Lothar Matthäus , Pierre Littbarski and Ronaldo each appeared three times in the squads of the teams that reached the finals, but none of them played in all three games.

[ 45 ] ^ Different sources give Pelé between 8 and 10 assists.

[ 78 ] ^ Zuberbühler kept goal throughout every minute of Switzerland's four matches. Other keepers have kept clean sheets only playing part of their team's matches.

^ a b Attended three tournaments but did not act as main referee in all of them. Instead, he was exclusively used as a fourth official in a minimum of one edition.

[ 148 ] ^ Biyik missed the team's second game after receiving a red card in the first, [ 150 ] and then missed Cameroon's fifth game after yellow cards in the third and fourth.
