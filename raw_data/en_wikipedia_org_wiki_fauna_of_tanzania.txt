[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Wildlife resources of Tanzania are described as "without parallel in Africa" and "the prime game viewing country".

Serengeti National Park , the country's second largest national park area at 14,763 square kilometres (5,700 sq mi), is located in northern Tanzania and is famous for its extensive migratory herds of wildebeests and zebra while also having the reputation as one of the great natural wonders of the world. The Ngorongoro Conservation Area , established in 1959, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site [ 3 ] and inhabited by the Maasai people .

[ 4 ] Its Ngorongoro Crater is the largest intact caldera in the world.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The national parks are also part of the wetlands of Tanzania. The wild animals tend to be closer to the wetlands, particularly the water loving species such as the hippopotamus , waterbuck , common warthog , elephant , crocodile , sitatunga as well as water birds such as flamingoes and ducks .

[ 7 ] Background [ edit ] The relief map of Tanzania Since the colonial era, wildlife conservation in Tanzania has been the prerogative of the government. Under this structure, the use of wildlife resources by local communities had always been restrictive, causing increased rural poverty and poaching . In recent years, the Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA) has initiated corrective actions to involve the local community in conservation efforts, which is aimed at contribution to local economies by way of equitable benefits sharing.

[ 8 ] Exports of the Nile perch yield US$100 million annually to Tanzania.

The wildlife resources in Tanzania provide an annual income of US$30 million to the national exchequer, and an income of US$9 million as revenue from the leasing companies. Illegal hunting is estimated to be worth US$50 million. In the 1990s, exports of 1.68 million birds, 523,000 reptiles, 12,000 mammals and 148,000 amphibians occurred, in addition to an increase in wildlife related tourism by about 30%. Fishery resources have also contributed richly to the export revenue of the country, with export value of US$130 million reported in 2003, with the export of the Nile perch accounting for a major share of US$100 million.

[ 8 ] National parks [ edit ] Tanzania’s wildlife, extolled as the "finest safari experiences and wildlife spectacles found anywhere on the planet", has 40 national parks and game reserves .

The habitat, bounded by Kenya and bordered by Lake Victoria on the west, is characterized by vast plains, savannah, wooded hills, large termite mounds, rivers, and acacia woodlands. The spectacular wildlife witnessed in the park generally refers to the great wildebeest migration [ 32 ] where a million wildebeests [ 33 ] chase green lands across the rolling plains of Serengeti in Tanzania and Masai Mara in Kenya. Sometimes they are seen in 40 square kilometres (15 sq mi) long columns migrating across the rivers to the north, over a distance of 1,000 square kilometres (390 sq mi), after spending three weeks of mating and giving birth to 8000 calves daily. This migration and life cycle creation is an annual feature witnessed in the park. This migration is in unison with 200,000 zebra and 300,000 Thomson's gazelle in search of grazing pastures, aptly described as "six million hooves pound the open plains". Other mammals seen here are buffaloes, elephants, giraffe, large number of elands, topis , kongonis , impalas, and Grant's gazelles . The predators inhabiting the park are lions , leopards , jackals , spotted hyenas , rock hyrax and serval cats . Reptiles include agama lizards and crocodiles .

Sometimes called an "African Galapagos" for the uniqueness of its wildlife, the park encompasses hills ranging in elevation between 250 metres (820 ft) and the 2,576 metres (8,451 ft) of Lohomero peak, the highest in the park. The park shares border with eastern Njombe Region and Kilombero District . The park's habitat covers tropical rainforest, mountain forest, miombo woodland, grassland and steppe. The park has the distinction of holding 30–40 percent of plants and animal species of Tanzania. More than 400 bird species and 6 primate species are reported from the park. It has the second largest biodiversity of a national park within Africa. It is included in the list of 34 "World Biodiversity Hotspots". It is also listed as one of the 200 WWF Eco regions of global critical importance. Six primate species have been recorded, five of which are endemic. The Udzungwa red colobus and Sanje mangabey are only found in the Udzungwa Mountains National Park; that mangabey was only recognised as a distinct species in 1986.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] Ngorongoro Conservation Area [ edit ] Although it is not a national park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) with an area of 8,292 square kilometres (3,202 sq mi) [ 39 ] In Arusha Region was recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as a World Heritage Site in 1979.

[ 4 ] The criteria cited for this recognition include: (1) crucial evidence found within the NCA about human evolution and human-environment dynamics (this criterion added in 2010); (2) the "stunning landscape" of Ngorongoro Crater, the largest unbroken caldera in the world; (3) the NCA's large concentration of wildlife, including 25,000 large animals; and (4) the NCA's variations in climate, landforms and altitude, resulting in several overlapping ecosystems and distinct habitats.

[ 4 ] Fauna [ edit ] Wildebeest in Mikumi National Park The faunal diversity of wild life in Tanzania in its national parks and game reserves is also dramatic. There are 310 mammal species (fourth largest in Africa); 960 species of birds (third place in Africa); and many amphibians and reptiles, which are stated to form the fourth largest population in Africa.

[ 8 ] The endangered fauna species are; the black rhino ; Uluguru bushshrikes ; hawksbill , green turtles , olive ridley turtle and leatherback turtles ; red colobus monkeys ; wild dogs ; and Pemba flying foxes .

[ 40 ] However, Lonely Planet also mentions a figure of 430 species of four million animals, and 60,000 insect species, 100 species of snakes and 25 species of reptiles, 1000 species of birds. More details of fauna species as reported by the Museum of Zoology of the University of Michigan , Bucknell University , Avibase data profiles and BirdLife International data profiles are the following. In the East Usambara Mountains , the forests display many rare species, so much so that the fauna found here have been compared to the Galapagos Islands in terms of biological importance.

[ 41 ] Mammals Main article: List of mammals in Tanzania African bush elephant ( Loxodonta africana ) in Tanzania Three hundred species of mammals have been reported in Tanzania.

Conservation [ edit ] A lioness roars in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania.

Poaching and anthropological pressure to meet the huge demand of wildlife meat has been a major problem in Tanzania with reported removal of 160,000 to 200,000 animals annually in the 1990s. The Government of Tanzania, in collaboration with international aid agencies, has made serious efforts to contain this problem through wildlife law enactment and enforcement and finding solutions to the conflict between wildlife conservation and the needs of rural communities dependent on these resources. Anti-poaching operations have been conducted on several occasions and game-viewing tourism has been a success in the easily accessible northern wildlife area of the country.

Trophy hunting has also provided some respite to the problem and this has helped in generating revenue, generally in the northern, southern and western wildlife areas.

[ 5 ] A February 2020 report on wildlife censuses carried out in October 2018 and November 2018 in the Selous-Mikumi ecosystem indicates that populations of elephants, hippopotamuses, and zebras have increased and that poaching has been brought under control.
