[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] McMahon was sworn in as the 13th U.S. Secretary of Education on March 3, 2025.

Early life [ edit ] McMahon was born Linda Marie Edwards [ 8 ] in New Bern, North Carolina , in a Welsh-American family, the daughter of Evelyn and Henry Edwards.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] She was an only child and grew up as a " tomboy " playing basketball and baseball .

[ 11 ] Her parents were both employees at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point , a military base. She grew up in a conservative Baptist family, but converted to Roman Catholicism in her later years.

[ 12 ] Linda M. Edwards, at the age of 13, met Vince McMahon , who was then 16.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Her mother worked in the same building as McMahon's mother, but they had not previously met.

Vince's mother became good friends with the Edwards family, and Vince, who had lived with several abusive stepfathers , enjoyed the feeling of stability that he felt at their home.

[ 10 ] Edwards and McMahon dated throughout their high school years; she attended New Bern High School [ 15 ] and he attended Fishburne Military School in Virginia. During this time, Vince was a "permanent fixture" at her home, [ 16 ] and spent hours with Linda and her family.

Shortly after her high school graduation, Vince asked her to marry him. They married on August 26, 1966, when she was 17, and he was 21.

[ 13 ] [ 17 ] She enrolled at East Carolina University in 1966, where she obtained a bachelor's degree in French .

[ 18 ] The academic program she completed was designed to prepare teachers for instruction.

[ 19 ] From 1968 to 1971, Vince worked as a traveling cup salesman before joining his father 's company, the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, later WWF, now WWE).

[ 20 ] Their son Shane was born in 1970, followed by daughter Stephanie in 1976.

Early career [ edit ] In 1969, the McMahons moved to Gaithersburg , Maryland . Linda worked as a receptionist at the corporate law firm of Covington & Burling ; she translated French documents, trained as a paralegal in the probate department, and studied intellectual property rights.

[ 21 ] Financially, the couple fared poorly for several years and, despite her husband working at a quarry , [ 22 ] briefly received food stamps .

[ 23 ] In 1976, after a series of failed business ventures including financing stunt performer Evel Knievel's Snake River Canyon Jump , [ 24 ] and while pregnant with Stephanie , McMahon and her husband filed for bankruptcy .

[ 25 ] By 1979, Vince decided to start promoting wrestling events at the Cape Cod Coliseum . He purchased the Coliseum in Massachusetts and founded Titan Sports, Inc.

in 1980. The McMahons held small hockey and other sporting events in addition to wrestling at the Cape Cod Coliseum. At one point, Linda cooked meatball sandwiches to feed the fans at these sporting events.

[ 26 ] As the company grew, Linda assisted Vince with administration and used her knowledge of intellectual property law to assist in trademark protection for the company. During much of those early years, she had little interest in professional wrestling.

[ 27 ] In 1983, the McMahons moved to Greenwich , Connecticut . They have six grandchildren.

[ 28 ] World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment [ edit ] Corporate roles [ edit ] Main article: History of WWE Linda McMahon and Vince McMahon co-founded Titan Sports, Inc. in 1980. Many workers in the company referred to her as the "co-chief executive".

[ 29 ] McMahon became president in 1993 and CEO of the company in 1997.

[ 30 ] The company's explosive growth and the way it transformed the wrestling industry caused some observers to label her and Vince "business geniuses".

[ 31 ] One of her major interests in WWF and WWE was product merchandising .

[ 32 ] She negotiated many of the company's business deals with outside vendors and established the company's first line of action figures, Wrestling Superstars , in 1984.

[ 33 ] It was a first in the wrestling industry and helped expand the company's popularity with children. She was also the primary negotiator for the World Wrestling Federation's 2000 TV deal with Viacom .

[ 33 ] During an interview with The Detroit News , when asked what it was like being CEO in a " testosterone -charged industry," McMahon replied, "It's lots of fun. I'm an only child, so I grew up as my father's son and mother's daughter. I was quite a jock. I played baseball, basketball—I think that background made Vince and I very compatible. I really have a very good understanding of the male psyche—I'm very comfortable in a guy environment. I have to say that there are very strong women in this company as well. Our human resources division and our consumer goods division are headed by women—It's still a testosterone business, and I like it." [ 13 ] On September 16, 2009, Linda McMahon resigned from her position as CEO of WWE and left WWE to run as a Republican for a seat in the United States Senate from Connecticut .

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] McMahon's memorandum to Pat Patterson [ edit ] In a 1989 memo to the company's vice president, Pat Patterson , McMahon directed Patterson to fire on-call physician George Zahorian and inform him of imminent legal charges charging him with steroid distribution.

[ 37 ] Although you and I discussed before about continuing to have Zahorian at our events as the doctor on call, I think that is now not a good idea. Vince agreed, and would like for you to call Zahorian and to tell him not to come to any more of our events and to also clue him in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking.

— Linda McMahon, December 1989 memo [ 38 ] This memo became known publicly as the "Tip-Off Memo" during her campaign for Senate in 2010.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] Federal steroids investigation [ edit ] Main article: WWE's Wellness Program Following the murder-suicide of Chris Benoit in 2007 , the Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigated steroid usage in the wrestling industry.

[ 42 ] The Committee investigated WWE and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), asking for documentation of their companies' drug policies. The McMahons both testified. The documents stated that 75 wrestlers—roughly 40 percent—had tested positive for drug use since 2006, most commonly for steroids.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] McMahon was asked why there had been no follow-up during a televised interview with CBS Face the State on January 20, 2010, and responded: "There's not been any follow-up from any of the inquiries that were made because I believe we had furnished thousands of documents and testimony for them, and I think if they looked at our policy and really delved into it, they would be very satisfied." [ 45 ] PG rating [ edit ] Main article: PG Era Chair shots to the head were discontinued by the WWE in order to prevent concussions.

In July 2008, WWE changed its TV parental guidelines rating from TV-14 to TV-PG. In December 2008, at a UBS Media Conference, McMahon described the new rating as a marketing strategy to attract a young generation of wrestling fans and create loyalty to the brand. Due to the TV-PG rating, chair shots to the head were banned, as well as sex scenes, blood, and vulgar language.

[ 55 ] By 2000, fewer than half of the 50 states had athletic regulations on the wrestling industry.

[ 56 ] Following common practice in professional sports, WWE classifies its wrestlers as independent contractors rather than employees. The classification allowed the company to avoid paying Social Security , Medicare and unemployment insurance for wrestlers. McMahon stated the WWE wrestlers had lucrative contracts, merchandising deals, royalty payments, and appearance fees.

[ 57 ] She noted that many of the wrestlers had agents and considered them to be on par with "singers, golfers, or tennis players". The company offered seminars to help wrestlers select health insurance plans.

[ 58 ] Under McMahon's tenure, WWE became one of the largest recipients of special tax credits for film and TV production granted by the state of Connecticut.

[ 80 ] [ 81 ] The lawsuit alleged that the McMahons fostered a culture of sexual abuse within the WWE.

[ 72 ] The State Senate approved her nomination by a vote of 34–1 and the House by 96–45 with some opponents expressing concerns that the nature of her WWE activities would send the wrong message. State representative Bruce Morris claimed she lacked "depth of knowledge regarding education". However, state representative John Hetherington said it "would be good to have someone outside the establishment on the board".

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] On April 1, 2010, McMahon resigned from the State Board of Education, in response to a state election  commission's legal opinion that disallowed board members from soliciting campaign contributions. McMahon had entered the race for U.S. Senate months earlier.

McMahon and Simmons engaged in a frequently bitter contest. At the party convention, McMahon received the most support, but Simmons received enough votes to qualify for the ballot for the August 10 primary , although he was not actively campaigning.

[ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ] She lost to Democratic U.S. representative Chris Murphy in the general election, marking her second consecutive defeat.
