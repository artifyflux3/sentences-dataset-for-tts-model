The first edition was published by Collection Enseignement des Sciences in Paris , and was translated to English by Wiley .

[ 1 ] The book was originally divided into two volumes. A third volume was published in 2017.

[ 2 ] The book structure is notable for having an extensive set of complementary chapters, introduced along with a "reader's guide", at the end of each main chapter.

[ 1 ] Table of contents [ edit ] Vol. 1 [ edit ] Waves and particles . Introduction to the ideas of quantum mechanics Mathematical tools of quantum mechanics The postulates of quantum mechanics Applications of the postulates to simple cases: Spin-1/2 and two-level systems The one dimensional harmonic oscillator General properties of angular momentum in quantum mechanics Particle in a central potential: the hydrogen atom Vol. 2 [ edit ] An elementary approach to the quantum theory of scattering by a potential Electron spin Addition of angular momenta Stationary perturbation theory An application of perturbation theory: The fine and hyperfine structure of the hydrogen atom Approximation methods for time-dependent problems Systems of identical particles Appendices Vol. 3 [ edit ] Creation and annihilation operators for identical particles Field operator Paired states of identical particles Review of classical electrodynamics Quantization of electromagnetic radiation Absorption, emission and scattering of photons by atoms Quantum entanglement , measurements , Bell's inequalities Appendices Reception [ edit ] Bernd Crasemann writing for the American Journal of Physics praised the book for its clarity and its unusual structure that introduces the reader to intermediate topics.

[ 1 ] According to him, the "gems" of the book are the complements related to atomic, molecular, and optical physics ; condensed matter physics and nuclear physics .

[ 1 ] The book has also been suggested as a complement to simplified introductory books in quantum mechanics.

[ 3 ] Experimental physicist and 2022 Nobel laureate in Physics Alain Aspect , has frequently mentioned that the book was a revelation early in his career, helping him better understand the research papers of quantum mechanics and the work of John Stewart Bell .
