The Union was founded in 1908 by former members of the Freeminded Union ( Freisinnigen Vereinigung ). The party demanded full equal voting rights for all, and a strict separation of church and state .

[ 1 ] It was not principled, or "revolutionary" against Wilhelmine Germany though.

Important party members were Theodor Barth , Rudolf Breitscheid (first chairman) and Hellmut von Gerlach .

Carl von Ossietzky joined the party in 1908, and from 1911 onwards published the party's weekly Das freie Volk .

The First World War brought an end to the party.

Hellmut von Gerlach , and some of his followers, helped found the German Democratic Party in 1918.
