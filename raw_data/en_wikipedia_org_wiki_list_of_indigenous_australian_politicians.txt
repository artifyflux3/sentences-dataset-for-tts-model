Linda Burney (right) is the ALP 's first Indigenous Australian MP; later joined by Gordon Reid and Marion Scrymgour .

This list of Indigenous Australian politicians includes Indigenous Australians who have been members of Australian legislatures —federal, state or territory. It does not include those elected to local councils (including mayors ), Governors / Governors-General , leaders of political parties (outside of parliament), Indigenous Australians actively involved in political institutions and those who have run unsuccessfully for office.

There have been 53 Indigenous members of the ten Australian legislatures, beginning when Neville Bonner entered the Australian Senate on 15 August 1971. Of these, 23 have been elected to the Northern Territory assembly , eleven to the Australian Federal Parliament , six to the parliament of Western Australia , five to the parliament of Queensland , two each to the parliaments of Tasmania , Victoria and New South Wales , and one each to the parliament of South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory assembly . Three have served in multiple parliaments.

As of 2023 [update] , Indigenous Australians make up 10.5% of the Senate and 1.9% of the House of Representatives. The total representation is at 4.8%, which is above their representation in the total population (3.3%).

[ 1 ] Out of the 53 Indigenous Australians elected or appointed to any Australian parliament, 24 have been women.

Nobody of acknowledged Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander ancestry has yet been a member of the Norfolk Island assembly.

Note: There is considerable debate surrounding the complexity of Indigenous identity. Therefore, this list only includes those who identify themselves as Indigenous Australian . Also note that "origin" or "ancestry" refers to the Indigenous groups, communities, countries, place names or languages which that person identifies with. Some individuals do not have any specific Indigenous group identity and some have multiple identities.

Federal Parliament [ edit ] Sixteen Indigenous Australian people have been members of the Parliament of Australia (the Federal Parliament), eleven in the Senate and five in the House of Representatives . Nine of them are in it today.
