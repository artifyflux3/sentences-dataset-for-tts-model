The pig Classification Striking tool Inventor Chris Moren Manufacturer Lonestar Axe LLC The pig is a specialty firefighting tool used mainly for roof ventilation, forcible entry and wall breaching.

[ 1 ] Invented by a member of the Austin Fire Department , the tool combines the butt-end of a flat head axe on one side and a pick on the other.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The pig can be married with a Halligan to create a forcible entry system as an alternative to the classic axe and Halligan combination.
