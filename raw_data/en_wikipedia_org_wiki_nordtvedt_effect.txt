If observed, the Nordtvedt effect would violate the strong equivalence principle , which indicates that an object's movement in a gravitational field does not depend on its mass or composition. No evidence of the effect has been found.

The effect is named after Kenneth L. Nordtvedt , who first demonstrated that some theories of gravity suggest that massive bodies should fall at different rates, depending upon their gravitational self-energy.

Nordtvedt then observed that if gravity did in fact violate the strong equivalence principle, then the more-massive Earth should fall towards the Sun at a slightly different rate than the Moon, resulting in a polarization of the lunar orbit. To test for the existence (or absence) of the Nordtvedt effect, scientists have used the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment , which is capable of measuring the distance between the Earth and the Moon with near-millimetre accuracy. Thus far, the results have failed to find any evidence of the Nordtvedt effect, demonstrating that if it exists, the effect is exceedingly weak.

[ 1 ] Subsequent measurements and analysis to even higher precision have improved constraints on the effect.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Measurements of Mercury's orbit by the MESSENGER Spacecraft have further refined the Nordvedt effect to be below an even smaller scale.

[ 4 ] A wide range of scalar–tensor theories have been found to naturally lead to a tiny effect only, at present epoch. This is due to a generic attractive mechanism that takes place during the cosmic evolution of the universe.

[ 5 ] Other screening mechanisms [ 6 ] ( chameleon , pressuron , Vainshtein etc.) could also be at play.
