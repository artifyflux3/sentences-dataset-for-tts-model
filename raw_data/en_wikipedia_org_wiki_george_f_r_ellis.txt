FRSSAf (born 11 August 1939), is the emeritus distinguished professor of complex systems in the Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Cape Town in South Africa . He co-authored The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time with University of Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking , published in 1973, and is considered one of the world's leading theorists in cosmology .

[ 3 ] From 1989 to 1992 he served as president of the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation . He is a past president of the International Society for Science and Religion . He is an A-rated researcher with the NRF .

Ellis, an active Quaker , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] was a vocal opponent of apartheid during the National Party reign in the 1970s and 1980s, [ 7 ] and it is during this period that Ellis's research focused on the more philosophical aspects of cosmology , for which he won the Templeton Prize in 2004.

[ 8 ] He was also awarded the Order of the Star of South Africa by Nelson Mandela in 1999.

[ citation needed ] On 18 May 2007, he was elected a fellow of the British Royal Society .

[ citation needed ] Life [ edit ] Born in 1939 to George Rayner Ellis, a newspaper editor, and Gwendoline Hilda MacRobert Ellis in Johannesburg, George Francis Rayner Ellis attended the University of Cape Town , where he graduated with honours in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics with distinction.

[ citation needed ] He represented the university in fencing, rowing and flying.

[ citation needed ] While a student at St John's College, Cambridge , where he received a PhD in applied maths and theoretical physics in 1964, he was on college rowing teams.

[ citation needed ] At Cambridge, Ellis served as a research fellow from 1965 to 1967, was assistant lecturer in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics until 1970, and was then appointed university lecturer, serving until 1974.

[ citation needed ] Ellis became a visiting professor at the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago in 1970, a lecturer at the Cargese Summer School in Corsica in 1971 and the Erice Summer School in Sicily in 1972, and a visiting H3 professor at the University of Hamburg , also in 1972.

The following year, Ellis co-wrote The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time with Stephen Hawking , debuting at a strategic moment in the development of General Relativity Theory .

In the following year, Ellis returned to South Africa to accept an appointment as professor of applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town , a position he held until his retirement in 2005.

In 2005 Ellis appeared as a guest speaker at the Nobel Conference in St. Peter, Minnesota .

Work [ edit ] George Ellis has worked for many decades on anisotropic cosmologies ( Bianchi models ) and inhomogeneous universes , and on the philosophy of cosmology.

[ 9 ] He is currently writing on the emergence of complexity, and the way this is enabled by top-down causation in the hierarchy of complexity .

[ 10 ] Recently Ellis has also collaborated with Teppo Felin , Denis Noble , and Jan Koenderink on a set of articles published in the journal Genome Biology.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] In terms of philosophy of science , Ellis is a Platonist .
