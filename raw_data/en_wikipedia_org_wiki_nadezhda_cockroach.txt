Scientists monitoring the mission from Voronezh announced that Nadezhda had successfully produced 33 offspring on Earth.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] While it was reported that Nadezhda's offspring were the first earthlings to be conceived in microgravity , Japanese rice fish successfully conceived and produced offspring in microgravity as part of the IML-2 experiment aboard STS-65 in 1994.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Nadezhda and the rest of the insects were traveling inside a sealed special container, and a video-camera was filming the whole process.

[ 5 ] What was considered unnatural for the newborn cockroaches was that their carapace had darkened in colour much earlier, in comparison with natural-condition cockroaches who develop that darker tone later in their life cycle. But the rest of the conditions and capacities of the cockroaches remained normal.

[ 2 ] Later it was reported that Nadezhda's grandchildren, born to one of the space-born insects, had given birth on Earth to normal cockroaches, with a life cycle and development similar to that of any other cockroach.
