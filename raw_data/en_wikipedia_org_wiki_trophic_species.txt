( December 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Species are grouped trophically on the left, however distinctions such as herbivore and predator are merely the simplest definitions.

Trophic species are a scientific grouping of organisms according to their shared trophic (feeding) positions in a food web or food chain . Trophic species have identical prey and a shared set of predators in the food web. This means that members of a trophic species share many of the same kinds of ecological functions.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The idea of trophic species was first devised by Frederic Briand and Joel Cohen in 1984 when investigating scaling laws applying to food webs.

[ 3 ] The category may include species of plants, animals, a combination of plants and animals, and biological stages of an organism. When assigning groups in a trophic manner, relationships are linear in scale, which allowed the same authors to predict the proportion of different trophic links in food webs.

[ 4 ] Furthermore grouping similar species according to feeding habit rather than genetics results in a ratio of predator to prey that is generally 1:1 in food webs.
