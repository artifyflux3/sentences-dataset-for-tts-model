Founded as the Medical College of Louisiana in 1834 by a cohort of medical doctors, it became a comprehensive public university as the University of Louisiana in 1847.

[ 8 ] The institution became private under the endowments of Paul Tulane and Josephine Louise Newcomb in 1884 and 1887. The Tulane University School of Law and Tulane University Medical School are, respectively, the 12th oldest law school and 15th oldest medical school in the United States.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Tulane has been a member of the Association of American Universities since 1958 and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 11 ] Alumni include 12 governors of Louisiana ; 1 Chief Justice of the United States ; members of the United States Congress , including a Speaker of the House ; 2 Surgeons General of the United States ; [ 12 ] [ 13 ] 23 Marshall Scholars ; [ 14 ] 18 Rhodes Scholars ; [ 15 ] 15 Truman Scholars ; [ 16 ] 155 Fulbright Scholars ; [ 17 ] 4 living billionaires; and a former President of Costa Rica .

[ 18 ] Two Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the university.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] History [ edit ] Founding and early history – 19th century [ edit ] Paul Tulane , eponymous philanthropist of the school The university was founded as the Medical College of Louisiana [ 1 ] in 1834 partly as a response to the fears of smallpox , yellow fever , and cholera in the United States.

[ 21 ] The university became the second medical school in the South, and the 15th in the United States at the time. In 1847, the state legislature established the school as the University of Louisiana , [ 1 ] a public university , and the law department was added to the university. Subsequently, in 1851, the university established its first academic department. The first president chosen for the new university was Francis Lister Hawks , an Episcopal priest and prominent citizen of New Orleans at the time.

The university was closed from 1861 to 1865 during the American Civil War .

[ 22 ] After reopening, it went through a period of financial challenges because of an extended agricultural depression in the South which affected the nation's economy.

Paul Tulane , owner of a prospering dry goods and clothing business, donated extensive real estate within New Orleans for the support of education. This donation led to the establishment of a Tulane Educational Fund (TEF), whose board of administrators sought to support the University of Louisiana instead of establishing a new university. In response, through the influence of former Confederate general Randall Lee Gibson , the Louisiana state legislature transferred control of the University of Louisiana to the administrators of the TEF in 1884.

[ 1 ] This act created the Tulane University of Louisiana .

[ 23 ] The university was privatized, and is one of only a few American universities to be converted from a state public institution to a private one.

[ 24 ] Paul Tulane's endowment to the school specified that the institution could only admit white students, and Louisiana law passed in 1884 reiterated this condition.

[ 25 ] In 1884, William Preston Johnston became the first president of Tulane. He had succeeded Robert E. Lee as president of Washington and Lee University after Lee's death. He had moved to Louisiana and become president of Louisiana State University in 1880.

[ 26 ] In 1885, the university established its graduate division, later becoming the Graduate School. One year later, gifts from Josephine Louise Newcomb totaling over $3.6 million, led to the establishment of the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College within Tulane University. Newcomb was the first coordinate college for women in the United States and became a model for such institutions as Pembroke College and Barnard College .

[ 27 ] In 1894 the College of Technology formed, which would later become the School of Engineering. In the same year, the university moved to its present-day uptown campus on historic St. Charles Avenue , five miles (8 km) by streetcar from downtown New Orleans.

[ 27 ] 20th century [ edit ] Gibson Hall , located on the uptown campus of Tulane University in 1904 With the improvements to Tulane University in the late 19th century, Tulane had a firm foundation to build upon as the premier university of the Deep South and continued the legacy with growth in the 20th century. During 1907, the school established a four-year professional curriculum in architecture through the College of Technology, growing eventually into the Tulane School of Architecture . One year later, Schools of Dentistry and Pharmacy were established, albeit temporarily. The School of Dentistry ended in 1928, and Pharmacy six years later.

[ 27 ] In 1914, Tulane established a College of Commerce, the first business school in the South .

[ 27 ] In 1925, Tulane established the independent Graduate School. Two years later, the university set up a School of Social Work , also the first in the southern United States.

[ 27 ] Tulane was instrumental in promoting the arts in New Orleans and the South in establishing the Newcomb School of Art with William Woodward as director, thus establishing the renowned Newcomb Pottery . The Middle American Research Institute was established in 1925 at Tulane "for the purpose of advanced research into the history (both Indian and colonial), archaeology, tropical botany (both economic and medical), the natural resources and products, of the countries facing New Orleans across the waters to the south; to gather, index and disseminate data thereupon; and to aid in the upbuilding of the best commercial and friendly relations between these Trans-Caribbean peoples and the United States." [ 28 ] University College was established in 1942 as Tulane's division of continuing education. By 1950, the School of Architecture had grown out of Engineering into an independent school. In 1958, the university was elected to the Association of American Universities , an organization consisting of 62 of the leading research universities in North America. The School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine again became independent from the School of Medicine in 1967. It was established in 1912. Tulane's School of Tropical Medicine also remains the only one of its kind in the country. On April 23, 1975, US President Gerald Ford spoke at Tulane University's Fogelman Arena at the invitation of F. Edward Hebert , the US representative of Louisiana's 1st Congressional District. During the historic speech, Ford announced that the Vietnam War was "finished as far as America is concerned" one week before the fall of Saigon . Ford drew parallels to the Battle of New Orleans and said that such positive activity could do for America's morale what the battle did in 1815.

[ 29 ] During World War II , Tulane was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

[ 30 ] In 1963, Tulane enrolled its first African American students.

[ 25 ] In 1990, Rhonda Goode-Douglas, alongside other black, female students, founded the first African American sorority in Tulane's history, AKA Omicron Psi.

Gibson Hall today. Facing historic St. Charles Avenue , it is the entry landmark on the uptown campus.

A detailed account of the history of Tulane University from its founding through 1965 was published by Dyer.

[ 31 ] 21st century [ edit ] In July 2004, Tulane received two $30 million donations to its endowment , the largest individual or combined gifts in the university's history. The donations came from James H. Clark , a member of the university's board of trustees and founder of Netscape , and David Filo , a graduate of its School of Engineering and co-founder of Yahoo!

. A fund-raising campaign called "Promise & Distinction" raised $730.6 million by October 3, 2008, increasing the university's total endowment to more than $1.1 billion; by March 2009, Yvette Jones, Tulane's Chief Operating Officer, told Tulane's Staff Advisory Council that the endowment "has lost close to 37%", affected by the Great Recession .

[ 32 ] In 2021, Tulane had to evacuate all students and close down for a month due to damage from Hurricane Ida . No classes took place for two weeks, then there were virtual classes for the remaining two weeks.

In June 2024, non-tenure track faculty at Tulane voted to form Tulane Workers United, the first higher education faculty union in the state of Louisiana. The union is formally affiliated with Workers United and SEIU .

[ 33 ] In 2025, an environmental researcher resigned in protest of what she called a " gag order " imposed on her by Tulane after complaints in the state legislature that her research was "anti-chemical." [ 34 ] Hurricane Katrina [ edit ] Main article: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Tulane University Main hall at the Freeman School of Business As a result of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and its damaging effects on New Orleans, most of the university was closed for the second time in its history—the first being during the Civil War . The closing affected the first semester of the school calendar year. The School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine's distance learning programs and courses stayed active. The School of Medicine relocated to Houston , Texas for a year. Aside from student-athletes attending college classes together on the same campuses, most undergraduate and graduate students dispersed to campuses throughout the U.S. The storm inflicted more than $650 million in damages to the university, with some of the greatest losses impacting the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library and its collections.

[ 35 ] Facing a budget shortfall, the Board of Administrators announced a "Renewal Plan" in December 2005 to reduce its annual operating budget and create a "student-centric" campus. Addressing the school's commitment to New Orleans, a course credit involving service learning became a requirement for an undergraduate degree. In 2006 Tulane became the first Carnegie ranked "high research activity" institution to have an undergraduate public service graduation requirement.

[ 36 ] In May 2006, graduation ceremonies included commencement speakers former Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton , who commended the students for their desire to return to Tulane and serve New Orleans in its renewal.

After Hurricane Katrina , Tulane has continued to build new facilities and renovate old spaces on its campus. The newest dorm buildings, Lake and River Residence Halls, were completed in 2023 following the demolition of Phelps Hall and Irby Hall. Weatherhead Hall was completed in 2011, and it now houses sophomore students. Construction on Greenbaum House, a Residential College in the Newcomb Campus area, began in January 2013 and was completed by Summer 2014. The Lallage Feazel Wall Residential College was completed in August 2005 and took in its first students when Tulane re-opened in January 2006. Usually an honors dorm, Wall began accommodating students of all academic standings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Lavin-Bernick Center for University Life (LBC) was renovated to be a green, environmentally friendly building and opened for student use in January 2007.

[ 41 ] In 2009, the university altered McAlister Drive, a street that ran through the middle of the uptown campus into a pedestrian walkway renamed McAlister Place. The area was resurfaced, and the newly added green spaces were adorned with Japanese magnolias, irises and new lighting. In late November 2008 the City of New Orleans announced plans to add bicycle lanes to the St. Charles Avenue corridor that runs in front of campus.

[ 42 ] In 2019, a new student space located in the middle of the uptown campus, The Malkin Sacks Commons, was opened by President Mike Fitts. The Commons is the central dining area on campus. Catering to most dietary restrictions, The Commons directly connects to the Lavin-Bernick Center on the second floor, and on its third floor houses the Newcomb Institute.

[ 100 ] In 2021, the Newcomb-Tulane College (NTC) created programming for First Year Honors Scholars and phased out its honors program. Many of the components of the honors program have been incorporated into other NTC programs.

[ 101 ] Scholarships [ edit ] The Dean's Honor Scholarship is a merit-based scholarship awarded by Tulane which covers full tuition for the duration of the recipient's undergraduate program. The scholarship is offered to between 75 and 100 incoming freshmen by the Office of Undergraduate Admission and is awarded only through a separate application. This scholarship is renewable provided that the recipient maintains a minimum 3.0 GPA at the end of each semester and maintains continuous enrollment in a full-time undergraduate division. Typically, recipients have SAT I score of 1450 or higher or an ACT composite score of 33 or higher, rank in the top 5% of their high school graduating class, have a rigorous course load including honors and Advanced Placement classes, and an outstanding record of extracurricular activities.

[ 102 ] Notable recipients include Sean M. Berkowitz and David Filo .

Beginning in 2014, Tulane has partnered with the Stamps Family Charitable Foundation to offer the full-ride merit-based Stamps Leadership Scholarship, Tulane's most prestigious scholarship.

[ 103 ] Approximately 5 incoming students are awarded the Stamps Scholarship each year, and Tulane graduated its first class of Stamps Scholars in May 2018.

Student life [ edit ] Student body composition as of May 2, 2022 Race and ethnicity [ 104 ] Total White 69% Hispanic 8% Black 6% Other [ a ] 6% Foreign national 5% Asian 5% Economic diversity Low-income [ b ] 7% Affluent [ c ] 93% The student body of Tulane University is represented by the Associated Student Body (ASB). In 1998, the students of Tulane University voted by referendum to split the Associated Student Body (ASB) Senate into two separate houses, the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GAPSA). USG and GAPSA came together twice a semester to meet as the ASB Senate, where issues pertaining to the entire Tulane student body were discussed, presided over by the ASB President. However, starting in 2021, Tulane students and administrators collaborated to create a new student governance model. The USG was dissolved, and in its place, the Tulane Undergraduate Assembly (TUA) was formed.

[ 105 ] Tulane maintains 3,600 beds in 14 residence halls on its uptown campus for undergraduate students. First year residence halls include Warren House, Sharp Hall, Monroe Hall, Paterson Hall, Josephine Louise Hall, Wall Hall, and Butler Hall.

[ 106 ] Sophomore residence halls include Aron Residences, Décou-Labat Residences, Greenbaum Hall, Lake Hall, River Hall, and Weatherhead Hall. Per the Renewal Plan instituted after Hurricane Katrina, Tulane requires all freshmen and sophomores to live on campus, except those who are from surrounding neighborhoods in New Orleans. Due to the increasing size of incoming classes, Tulane has allowed a small number of rising sophomores to reside off campus instead of being required to remain in campus housing. Housing is not guaranteed for juniors and seniors.

Student media [ edit ] The Tulane Hullabaloo is the university's weekly student-run newspaper.

Athletics [ edit ] Main article: Tulane Green Wave Wordmark for Tulane Athletics Tulane's football team plays its home games Uptown in Yulman Stadium .

Tulane competes in NCAA Division I as a member of the American Athletic Conference (The American). The university was a charter member of the Southeastern Conference , in which it competed until 1966. Just before leaving the SEC, it had notably become the first conference school to field a black athlete when Stephen Martin, who was on an academic scholarship, played on the baseball team in the 1966 season.

[ 107 ] Tulane, along with other academically oriented, private schools had considered forming the "Southern Ivy League" ( Magnolia Conference ) in the 1950s. Tulane's intercollegiate sports include football , baseball , men's and women's basketball , women's volleyball, men's and women's track , men's and women's tennis , and cross country , women's swimming and diving , women's tennis , women's golf , women's bowling , and women's beach volleyball . Tulane's graduation rate for its student-athletes consistently ranks among the top of Division I athletics programs.

Tulane Green Wave teams have seen moderate success over the years. The school's national championships have all come from men's tennis , with one team title in 1959 and multiple singles and doubles titles. The baseball team has won multiple conference titles, and in both 2001 and 2005 , it finished with 56 wins and placed 5th at the College World Series . The women's basketball team has won multiple conference titles and gone to numerous NCAA tournaments . The women's volleyball team won the 2008 Conference USA Championship tournament.

[ 108 ] The Green Wave football team won the 2002 Hawaii Bowl , the 1970 Liberty Bowl , and the inaugural Sugar Bowl . In 1998 it went 12–0, winning the Liberty Bowl and finishing the season ranked 7th in the nation by the AP and 10th by the BCS .

[ 109 ] On January 2, 2023, Tulane beat a favored USC team in the Cotton Bowl , finishing the 2022 season with a 12–2 record.

[ 110 ] Most administrative and athletic support facilities are located in the Wilson Athletic Center in the center of Tulane's athletic campus. The adjacent area was once home to Tulane Stadium , which seated more than 80,000 people, held three Super Bowls , was home to the New Orleans Saints , and gave rise to the Sugar Bowl . Home football games moved to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome when it opened in 1975, and Tulane Stadium was demolished in 1980. The university has committed to upgrading its athletic facilities in recent years, extensively renovating Turchin Stadium (baseball) in 2008, Fogelman Arena (now Devlin Fieldhouse; basketball and volleyball) in 2006 and 2012, [ 111 ] and Goldring Tennis Center in 2008. The Hertz Center, a new practice facility for the basketball and volleyball teams that includes athletic training and strength and conditioning rooms, offices, film rooms, and lockers, opened in 2011. Tulane completed construction of Yulman Stadium in September 2014 and began using it for home football games that season.

Tulane made some hard decisions after Katrina, and we are not in as difficult position that many institutions are in now. We are conditioned in times like this because of how we have worked so long. Endowment has lost close to 38%, the incoff of that is only 6% of our revenue base. The challenge is the endowments whose market value is lower and we cannot pay out on, but generally we are in good shape.
