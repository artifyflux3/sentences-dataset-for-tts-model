In earlier days of computing (before the 1980s), the term was used interchangeably with programming language , but today, used primarily for taxonomy , is a broader term that encompasses languages that are not programming in nature. Sub-categories (with possibly contended hierarchical relationships) include: Construction Programming – for controlling computer behavior Command – for controlling the tasks of a computer, such as starting programs Query – for querying databases and information systems Transformation – for transforming the text of a formal language into text that meets a specific goal Structural Configuration – for writing configuration files Data exchange – examples: JSON , XML Markup – for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, such as HTML Page description – for describing the appearance of a printed page in a higher level than an actual output bitmap Style sheet – for expressing the presentation of structured documents, such as CSS Modeling – for designing systems Architecture description – for describing and representing system architecture Hardware description – for modeling integrated circuits Simulation – for simulating Specification – for describing what a system should do See also [ edit ] Domain-specific language – Computer language specialized to a particular set of requirements or functionality Expression language – Computer language for creating a machine readable representation of domain knowledge General-purpose language – Computer language that is broadly applicable across domains Lists of programming languages Natural language processing – Processing of natural language by a computer External links [ edit ] Media related to Computer languages at Wikimedia Commons v t e Types of computer language Types Architecture description Data exchange Hardware description Knowledge representation Markup Modeling Programming language Query Shading Specification Stylesheet Transformation See also Category:Lists of computer languages Category:Lists of programming languages List of programming languages by type NewPP limit report
