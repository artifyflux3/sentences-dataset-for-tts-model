( October 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) This is a comprehensive list of interplanetary spaceflights , spaceflight between two or more bodies of the Solar System , listed in chronological order by launch date.  It includes only flights that escaped Earth orbit and reached the vicinity of another planet, asteroid, or comet. Flights that were planned but not executed, were destroyed at or shortly after launch, or missed their target entirely are not included. Flights which reached, but failed to return useful scientific data regarding their target, are given a gray background.

The list is divided between flights that stopped at a destination, and those that flew by their target.

Overview [ edit ] The lists below encompass 66 completed flights: 21 to Venus, 27 to Mars, 4 to Jupiter, 11 to minor planets , 1 to Saturn and 2 to Mercury.

Additionally there have been 85 passing interplanetary flights: 19 past Venus, 15 past Mars, 8 past Jupiter, 3 past Saturn, 1 past Neptune, 1 past Uranus, 3 past Mercury, 35 past minor planets.

Completed flights [ edit ] The following flights were completed by matching velocity with the target object, whether by station-keeping, entering orbit, landing, or impact.
