Portrait of Denis Diderot by Louis-Michel van Loo , 1767 The painting depicts the French polygraph Denis Diderot A polygraph (from Ancient Greek : πολύς, poly = "many" and γράφειν, graphein = "to write") is an author who writes in a variety of fields.

[ 1 ] In literature, the term polygraph is often applied to certain writers of antiquity such as Aristotle , Plutarch , Varro , Cicero and Pliny the Elder . Polygraphs still existed in the Middle Ages and Renaissance , but, other than writers of books for children, they have become rarer in modern times due to the specialisation of knowledge.

Voltaire and Diderot are examples of modern polygraphs.
