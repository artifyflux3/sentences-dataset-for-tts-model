The Isthmus of Panama is a land bridge whose appearance 3 million years ago closed the Central American Seaway and enabled the Great American Biotic Interchange , in which animals and plants from the north colonized the south, and vice versa.

[ 1 ] In biogeography , a land bridge is an isthmus or wider land connection between otherwise separate areas, over which animals and plants are able to cross and colonize new lands. A land bridge can be created by marine regression , in which sea levels fall, exposing shallow, previously submerged sections of continental shelf ; or when new land is created by plate tectonics ; or occasionally when the sea floor rises due to post-glacial rebound after an ice age .

[ 3 ] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, vanished land bridges were an explanation for observed affinities of plants and animals in distant locations. Such scientists as Joseph Dalton Hooker noted puzzling geological, botanical, and zoological similarities between widely separated areas, and proposed land bridges between appropriate land masses that allowed species to spread between land masses.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In geology, the concept was first proposed by Jules Marcou in Lettres sur les roches du Jura  et leur distribution géographique dans les deux hémisphères ("Letters on the rocks of the Jura [Mountains] and their geographic distribution in the two hemispheres"), 1857–1860.

[ 4 ] Hypothesized land bridges included: [ 4 ] Archatlantis from the West Indies to North Africa Archhelenis from Brazil to South Africa Archiboreis in the North Atlantic Archigalenis from Central America through Hawaii to Northeast Asia Archinotis from South America to Antarctica Lemuria in the Indian Ocean The theory of continental drift provided an alternate explanation that did not require land bridges.

[ 5 ] However the continental drift theory was not widely accepted until the development of plate tectonics in the early 1960s, which more completely explained the motion of continents over geological time.
