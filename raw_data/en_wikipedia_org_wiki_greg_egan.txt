Egan has won multiple awards including the John W. Campbell Memorial Award , the Hugo Award , and the Locus Award .

Life and work [ edit ] Egan holds a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from the University of Western Australia .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] He published his first work in 1983.

[ 5 ] He specialises in hard science fiction stories with mathematical and quantum ontology themes, including the nature of consciousness . Other themes include genetics , simulated reality , posthumanism , mind uploading , sexuality , artificial intelligence , and the superiority of rational naturalism to religion . He often deals with complex technical material, like new physics and epistemology . He is a Hugo Award winner (with eight other works shortlisted for the Hugos) and has also won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel .

[ 6 ] His early stories feature strong elements of supernatural horror .

Egan's short stories have been published in a variety of genre magazines, including regular appearances in Interzone and Asimov's Science Fiction .

Mathematics [ edit ] In 2002, Egan co-authored two papers about Riemannian 10j symbols, spin networks appearing in Riemannian quantum gravity , together with John Baez and Dan Christensen. Spin networks also play a central role in his novel Schild's Ladder released the same year.

In 2014, Egan conjectured a generalization of the Grace–Danielsson inequality about the relation of the radii of two spheres and the distance of their respective centres to fit a simplex between them to also hold in higher dimensions , which later became known as the Egan conjecture . A proof of the inequality being sufficient was published by him in 2014 under a blog post of John Baez . They were lost due to a rearrangement of the website, but the central parts were copied into the original blog post. Further comments by Greg Egan on 16 April 2018 concern the search for a generalized conjecture involving ellipsoids .

[ 7 ] A proof of the inequality also being necessary was published by Sergei Drozdov on 16 October 2023 on ArXiv .

[ 8 ] In 2018, Egan described a construction of superpermutations , thus giving an upper bound to their minimum length. On 27 February 2019, using ideas developed by Robin Houston and others, Egan produced a superpermutation of seven symbols of length 5906, breaking previous records.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Personal life [ edit ] As of 2015, Egan lives in Perth. He is a vegetarian [ 2 ] [ 11 ] and an atheist.

[ 12 ] Egan does not attend science fiction conventions, [ 13 ] does not sign books, and has stated that he appears in no photographs on the web, [ 14 ] though both SF fan sites and Google Search have at times mistakenly identified him as the subject of photos of other people with the same name.

[ 15 ] Awards [ edit ] Egan's work has won the Japanese Seiun Award for best translated fiction eight times.

[ 6 ] Teranesia was named the winner of the 2000 Ditmar Award for best novel, but Egan declined the award.

^ Dust was incorporated into the novel Permutation City as the first few chapters in one narrative thread.

^ Wang refers to the mathematician Hao Wang – the carpets are living embodiments of Wang tiles . This story, minorly reworked, became a section of the novel Diaspora .
