The number of patent families (in red) and non-patent publications (in blue) about superconductivity by year. Also shown as black vertical lines are the main breakthroughs in the field.

[Superconductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity "Superconductivity") is the phenomenon of certain materials exhibiting zero [electrical resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance") and the expulsion of [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_fields "Magnetic fields") below a characteristic [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"). The **history of superconductivity** began with Dutch [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist")[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes "Heike Kamerlingh Onnes")'s discovery of superconductivity in [mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element) "Mercury (element)") in 1911. Since then, many other superconducting materials have been discovered and the theory of superconductivity has been developed. These subjects remain active areas of study in the field of [condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics "Condensed matter physics").

The study of superconductivity has a fascinating history, with several breakthroughs having dramatically accelerated publication and patenting activity in this field, as shown in the figure on the right and described in details below. Throughout its 100+ year history the number of non-patent publications per year about superconductivity has been a factor of 10 larger than the number of patent families, which is characteristic of a technology, that has not achieved a substantial commercial success (see [Technological applications of superconductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_applications_of_superconductivity "Technological applications of superconductivity")).

With the help of the [Van der Waals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Diderik_van_der_Waals "Johannes Diderik van der Waals")' [equation of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_equation "Van der Waals equation"), the critical-point parameters of gases could be accurately predicted from thermodynamic measurements made at much higher temperatures. [Heike Kamerlingh Onnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes "Heike Kamerlingh Onnes") was influenced by the work of Van der Waals.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-3)

In 1908, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes became the first to make [liquid helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_helium "Liquid helium") and this led directly to his 1911 discovery of superconductivity.

Exploring ultra-cold phenomena (to 1908)
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_superconductivity&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Exploring ultra-cold phenomena (to 1908)")]

[James Dewar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dewar "James Dewar") initiated research into electrical resistance at low temperatures. Dewar and [John Ambrose Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ambrose_Fleming "John Ambrose Fleming") predicted that at [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero "Absolute zero"), pure metals would become perfect electromagnetic conductors (though, later, Dewar altered his opinion on the disappearance of resistance, believing that there would always be some resistance). [Walther Hermann Nernst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Nernst "Walther Nernst") developed the [third law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_law_of_thermodynamics "Third law of thermodynamics") and stated that absolute zero was unattainable. [Carl von Linde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Linde "Carl von Linde") and [William Hampson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hampson "William Hampson"), both commercial researchers, nearly at the same time filed for patents on the [Joule–Thomson effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule%E2%80%93Thomson_effect "Joule–Thomson effect") for the [liquefaction of gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefaction_of_gases "Liquefaction of gases"). Linde's patent was the climax of 20 years of systematic investigation of established facts, using a regenerative counterflow method. Hampson's designs was also of a regenerative method. The combined process became known as the [Hampson–Linde liquefaction process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampson%E2%80%93Linde_liquefaction_process "Hampson–Linde liquefaction process").

Onnes purchased a Linde machine for his research. On March 21, 1900, [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla "Nikola Tesla") was granted a patent for the means for increasing the intensity of electrical [oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation "Oscillation") by lowering the temperature, which was caused by lowered resistance.[_[further explanation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] Within this patent it describes the increased intensity and duration of electric oscillations of a [low temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics "Cryogenics")[resonating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonator "Resonator") circuit. It is believed that Tesla had intended that Linde's machine would be used to attain the cooling agents.

A milestone was achieved on July 10, 1908, when Heike Kamerlingh Onnes at [Leiden University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_University "Leiden University") in the Netherlands produced, for the first time, [liquified helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_helium "Liquid helium"), which has a boiling point of 4.2 K (−269°C) at atmospheric pressure.

Sudden and fundamental disappearance
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_superconductivity&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Sudden and fundamental disappearance")]

Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and Jacob Clay reinvestigated Dewar's earlier experiments on the reduction of resistance at low temperatures. Onnes began the investigations with [platinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum "Platinum") and [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold"), replacing these later with [mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element) "Mercury (element)") (a more readily refinable material). Onnes's research into the resistivity of solid mercury at cryogenic temperatures was accomplished by using liquid helium as a refrigerant. On April 8, 1911, 16:00 hours Onnes noted "Kwik nagenoeg nul", which translates as "[Resistance of] mercury almost zero."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-4) At the temperature of 4.19 K, he observed that the resistivity abruptly disappeared (the measuring device Onnes was using did not indicate any resistance). Onnes disclosed his research in 1911, in a paper titled "_On the Sudden Rate at Which the Resistance of Mercury Disappears._" Onnes stated in that paper that the "specific resistance" became thousands of times less in amount relative to the best conductor at ordinary temperature. Onnes later reversed the process and found that at 4.2 K, the resistance returned to the material. The next year, Onnes published more articles about the phenomenon. Initially, Onnes called the phenomenon "_supraconductivity_" (1913) and, only later, adopted the term "_superconductivity._" For his research, he was awarded the [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") in 1913.

Onnes conducted an experiment, in 1912, on the usability of superconductivity. Onnes introduced an electric current into a superconductive ring and removed the battery that generated it. Upon measuring the electric current, Onnes found that its intensity did not diminish with the time.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-5) The current persisted due to the superconductive state of the conductive medium.

In subsequent decades, superconductivity was found in several other materials; In 1913, [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead "Lead") at 7 K, in 1930's [niobium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium "Niobium") at 10 K, and in 1941 [niobium nitride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium_nitride "Niobium nitride") at 16 K.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Enigmas and solutions (1933–1979)
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_superconductivity&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Enigmas and solutions (1933–1979)")]

The next important step in understanding superconductivity occurred in 1933, when [Walther Meissner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Meissner "Walther Meissner") and [Robert Ochsenfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ochsenfeld "Robert Ochsenfeld") discovered that superconductors expelled applied magnetic fields, a phenomenon that has come to be known as the [Meissner effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meissner_effect "Meissner effect"). In 1935, brothers [Fritz London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_London "Fritz London") and [Heinz London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_London "Heinz London") showed that the Meissner effect was a consequence of the minimization of the electromagnetic [free energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_free_energy "Thermodynamic free energy") carried by superconducting current.

In 1937, [Lev Shubnikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Shubnikov "Lev Shubnikov") discovered a new type of superconductors (later called [type-II superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-II_superconductor "Type-II superconductor")), that presented a mixed phase between ordinary and superconductive properties.

In 1950, the phenomenological [Ginzburg–Landau theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginzburg%E2%80%93Landau_theory "Ginzburg–Landau theory") of superconductivity was devised by [Lev Landau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Landau "Lev Landau") and [Vitaly Ginzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitaly_Ginzburg "Vitaly Ginzburg"). The Ginzburg–Landau theory, which combined Landau's theory of second-order [phase transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition "Phase transition") with a [Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation")-like wave equation, had great success in explaining the macroscopic properties of superconductors. In particular, [Alexei Abrikosov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Alexeyevich_Abrikosov "Alexei Alexeyevich Abrikosov") showed that Ginzburg–Landau theory predicts the division of superconductors into the two categories now referred to as [type I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-I_superconductor "Type-I superconductor") and [type II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-II_superconductor "Type-II superconductor") superconductivity. Abrikosov and Ginzburg were awarded the 2003 [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") for their work (Landau having died in 1968). Also in 1950, [Emanuel Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emanuel_Maxwell&action=edit&redlink=1 "Emanuel Maxwell (page does not exist)") and, almost simultaneously, C.A.Reynolds _et al._ found that the critical temperature of a superconductor depends on the [isotopic mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope") of the constituent [element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element"). This important discovery pointed to the electron-phonon interaction as the microscopic mechanism responsible for superconductivity.

On the experimental side, collaborations of [Bernd T. Matthias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_T._Matthias "Bernd T. Matthias") in the 1950s with [John Kenneth Hulm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kenneth_Hulm "John Kenneth Hulm") and [Theodore H. Geballe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_H._Geballe "Theodore H. Geballe"), led to the discovery of hundreds of low temperature superconductors using a technique based on the Meissner effect. Due to his experience, he came up with [Matthias' rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_rules "Matthias rules") in 1954, a set of empirical guidelines on how to find these types of superconductors.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-:1-6)

The complete microscopic theory of superconductivity was finally proposed in 1957 by [John Bardeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen "John Bardeen"), [Leon N. Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Cooper "Leon Cooper"), and [Robert Schrieffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robert_Schrieffer "John Robert Schrieffer"). This [BCS theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCS_theory "BCS theory") explained the superconducting current as a superfluid of [Cooper pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair "Cooper pair"), pairs of electrons interacting through the exchange of [phonons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonons "Phonons"). For this work, the authors were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972. The BCS theory was set on a firmer footing in 1958, when [Nikolay Bogolyubov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Bogolyubov "Nikolay Bogolyubov") showed that the BCS wavefunction, which had originally been derived from a variational argument, could be obtained using a canonical transformation of the electronic [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics) "Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)"). In 1959, [Lev Gor'kov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Gor%27kov "Lev Gor'kov") showed that the BCS theory reduced to the Ginzburg-Landau theory close to the critical temperature. Gor'kov was the first to derive the superconducting phase evolution equation ![Image 5: {\displaystyle 2eV=\hbar {\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial t}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8cde28b5caf5d2dc13ab1bf243dc0daa031eee9b).

### Little–Parks effect

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_superconductivity&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Little–Parks effect")]

The [Little–Parks effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%E2%80%93Parks_effect "Little–Parks effect") was discovered in 1962 in experiments with empty and thin-walled [superconducting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting "Superconducting") cylinders subjected to a parallel [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"). The [electrical resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance") of such cylinders shows a periodic [oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation "Oscillation") with the magnetic flux through the cylinder, the period being _[h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck\_constant "Planck constant")_/2 _[e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary\_charge "Elementary charge")_= 2.07×10−15 V·s. The explanation provided by William Little and Ronald Parks is that the resistance oscillation reflects a more fundamental phenomenon, i.e. periodic oscillation of the superconducting critical temperature (_T_ c). This is the temperature at which the sample becomes superconducting. The Little-Parks effect is a result of collective quantum behavior of superconducting electrons. It reflects the general fact that it is the [fluxoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxoid "Fluxoid") rather than the flux which is quantized in superconductors. The Little-Parks effect demonstrates that the [vector potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_potential "Vector potential") couples to an observable physical quantity, namely the superconducting critical temperature.

Commercial activity
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_superconductivity&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Commercial activity")]

Soon after discovering superconductivity in 1911, Kamerlingh Onnes attempted to make an electromagnet with superconducting windings but found that relatively low magnetic fields destroyed superconductivity in the materials he investigated. Much later, in 1955, George Yntema succeeded in constructing a small 0.7-tesla iron-core electromagnet with superconducting niobium wire windings.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-7) Then, in 1961, [J. E. Kunzler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eugene_Kunzler "John Eugene Kunzler"), E. Buehler, F. S. L. Hsu, and J. H. Wernick made the startling discovery that at 4.2 kelvins, a compound consisting of three parts niobium and one part tin was capable of supporting a current density of more than 100,000 amperes per square centimeter in a magnetic field of 8.8 teslas.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-8) Despite being brittle and difficult to fabricate, niobium-tin has since proved extremely useful in supermagnets generating magnetic fields as high as 20 teslas. In 1962, Ted Berlincourt and Richard Hake discovered that less brittle alloys of niobium and titanium are suitable for applications up to 10 teslas.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-10) Promptly thereafter, commercial production of niobium-titanium supermagnet wire commenced at [Westinghouse Electric Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation "Westinghouse Electric Corporation") and at [Wah Chang Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wah_Chang_Corporation "Wah Chang Corporation").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Although niobium-titanium boasts less-impressive superconducting properties than those of niobium-tin, niobium-titanium has, nevertheless, become the most widely used “workhorse” supermagnet material, in large measure a consequence of its very high ductility and ease of fabrication. However, both niobium-tin and niobium-titanium find wide application in MRI medical imagers, bending and focusing magnets for enormous high-energy particle accelerators, and a host of other applications. Conectus, a European consortium for superconductivity, estimated that in 2014, global economic activity, for which superconductivity was indispensable, amounted to about five billion euros, with MRI systems accounting for about 80% of that total.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In 1962, [Brian Josephson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_David_Josephson "Brian David Josephson") made the important theoretical prediction that a supercurrent can flow between two pieces of superconductor separated by a thin layer of insulator. This phenomenon, now called the [Josephson effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effect "Josephson effect"), is exploited by superconducting devices such as [SQUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQUID "SQUID"). It is used in the most accurate available measurements of the [magnetic flux quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux_quantum "Magnetic flux quantum")_h_/2 _e_, and thus (coupled with the [quantum Hall resistivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Hall_effect "Quantum Hall effect")) for the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant")_h_. Josephson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work in 1973.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In 1973 Nb

3 Ge found to have _T_ c of 23 K, which remained the highest ambient-pressure _T_ c until the discovery of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors in 1986 (see below).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Unconventional superconductivity.

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_superconductivity&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Unconventional superconductivity.")]

### First unconventional superconductors

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_superconductivity&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: First unconventional superconductors")]

In 1979, two new classes of superconductors where discovered that could not be explained by BCS theory: [heavy fermion superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_fermion_superconductor "Heavy fermion superconductor") and [organic superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_superconductor "Organic superconductor").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-11)

The first [heavy fermion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_fermion "Heavy fermion") superconductor, CeCu 2 Si 2, was discovered by [Frank Steglich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Steglich "Frank Steglich").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-Steglich1979-12) Since then over 30 heavy fermion superconductors were found (in materials based on Ce, U), with a critical temperature up to 2.3 K (in CeCoIn 5).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-Petrovic2001-13)

[Klaus Bechgaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Bechgaard "Klaus Bechgaard") and [Denis Jérome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_J%C3%A9rome "Denis Jérome") synthesized the first organic superconductor (TMTSF)2 PF 6 (the corresponding material class was named after him later) with a transition temperature of _T_ C = 0.9 K, at an external pressure of 11 kbar.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-14)

### High-temperature superconductors

Superconductor timeline

In 1986, [J.Georg Bednorz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Georg_Bednorz "Johannes Georg Bednorz") and [K.Alex Mueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Alexander_M%C3%BCller "Karl Alexander Müller") discovered superconductivity in a [lanthanum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanthanum "Lanthanum")-based cuprate [perovskite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite "Perovskite") material, which had a transition temperature of 35 K (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1987) and was the first of the [high-temperature superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductor "High-temperature superconductor"). It was shortly found (by [Ching-Wu Chu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ching-Wu_Chu "Ching-Wu Chu")) that replacing the lanthanum with [yttrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium "Yttrium"), i.e. making [YBCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YBCO "YBCO"), raised the critical temperature to 92 K, which was important because [liquid nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen "Liquid nitrogen") could then be used as a refrigerant (at atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of nitrogen is 77 K). This is important commercially because liquid nitrogen can be produced cheaply on-site with no raw materials, and is not prone to some of the problems (solid air plugs, etc.) of helium in piping. Many other cuprate superconductors have since been discovered, and the theory of superconductivity in these materials is one of the major outstanding challenges of theoretical [condensed-matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed-matter_physics "Condensed-matter physics").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In March 2001, superconductivity of [magnesium diboride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_diboride "Magnesium diboride") (MgB

2) was found with _T_ c = 39 K.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In 2008, the [oxypnictide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxypnictide "Oxypnictide") or [iron-based superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron-based_superconductor "Iron-based superconductor") were discovered, which led to a flurry of work in the hope that studying them would provide a theory of the cuprate superconductors.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In 2013, room-temperature superconductivity was attained in YBCO for picoseconds, using short pulses of infrared laser light to deform the material's crystal structure.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-15)

In 2017 it was suggested that undiscovered superhard materials (e.g. critically doped beta-titanium Au) might be a candidate for a new superconductor with Tc, substantially higher than HgBaCuO (138 K), possibly up to 233 K, which would be higher even than H 2 S. A lot of research suggests that additionally nickel could replace copper in some perovskites, offering another route to room temperature. Li+ doped materials can also be used, i.e. the spinel battery material LiTi 2 O x and the lattice pressure can increase Tc to over 13.8 K. Also LiHx has been theorized to metallise at a substantially lower pressure than H and could be a candidate for a Type 1 superconductor.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#cite_note-19)
