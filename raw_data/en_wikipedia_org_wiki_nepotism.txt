disability Social privilege Christian male white Social stigma Speciesism Stereotype The talk v t e Nepotism is the act of granting an advantage , privilege, or position to relatives in an occupation or field. These fields can include business, politics, academia, entertainment, sports, religion or health care . In concept it is similar to cronyism .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The term originated with the assignment of nephews, sons, or other relatives to important positions by Catholic popes and bishops.

[ 3 ] It has often been witnessed in autocracies , whereby traditional aristocracies usually contested amongst themselves in order to obtain leverage, status, etc.

Nepotism has been criticized since ancient history by philosophers including Aristotle , Valluvar , and Confucius , condemning it as both evil and unwise.

[ 4 ] Origins [ edit ] Main article: Cardinal-nephew The term comes from Italian word nepotismo , [ 5 ] [ 6 ] which is based on Latin root nepos meaning nephew.

[ 7 ] Since the Middle Ages and until the late 17th century, some Catholic popes and bishops – who had taken vows of celibacy and, therefore, usually had no legitimate offspring of their own – gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to sons.

[ 8 ] They would also do the same with children who were the illegitimate result of broken celibacy vows, and who were claimed to be "nephews" instead of sons.

[ 9 ] Several popes elevated nephews and other relatives to the cardinalate . Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal "dynasty".

[ 10 ] For instance, Pope Callixtus III , head of the Borgia family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming Pope Alexander VI .

[ 11 ] Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become Pope Paul III .

[ 12 ] Paul III also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two illegitimate grandsons, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally limited when Pope Innocent XII issued the bull Romanum decet Pontificem , in 1692.

[ 8 ] The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.

[ 13 ] Mention in ancient literature [ edit ] In the second book of the Kural literature , which forms a manual for governments and corporations, Valluvar suggests about nepotism and favouritism thus: If you choose an unfit person for your job just because you love and you like him, he will lead you to endless follies.

[ 14 ] According to him, nepotism is both evil and unwise.

[ 4 ] Types [ edit ] Political [ edit ] Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The British English expression " Bob's your uncle " is thought to have originated when Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury , promoted his nephew, Arthur Balfour , to the esteemed post of Chief Secretary for Ireland , which was widely seen as an act of nepotism.

[ 15 ] Economic [ edit ] Inheritance has been viewed by some as a form of nepotism.

[ 16 ] Organizational [ edit ] Nepotism in organizations leads to monopolization of power because when members involved in institutional decision-making are related, decisions made within institutions risk favoring a group of closely connected people.

[ 17 ] Nepotism can also occur within organizations, when a person is employed due to their familial ties.

[ 18 ] It is generally seen as unethical, both on the part of the employer and employee.

[ 19 ] One of the consequences of nepotism in an organization is the creation of a limitation in the organization's network of contacts, reducing the opportunities for negotiation with other social circles, which can lead to a reduction in the success and duration of organizations in the long term.

[ 20 ] In employment [ edit ] Nepotism at work can mean increased opportunity at a job, attaining a job or being paid more than other similarly situated people.

[ 21 ] Arguments are made both for and against employment granted due to a family connection, which is most common in small, family run businesses . On one hand, nepotism can provide stability and continuity. Critics cite studies that demonstrate decreased morale and commitment from non-related employees, [ 22 ] and a generally negative attitude towards superior positions filled through nepotism. An article from Forbes magazine stated "there is no ladder to climb when the top rung is reserved for people with a certain name." [ 23 ] Employing intimate people favors perpetuating the ideas or goals of those who employ them, knowing that the people around them will face up to them. However, it can lead to a lack of competent staff or a reduction in productivity because even if the employees are not the best options for their functions, they will be protected by those who employ them.

[ 24 ] Some businesses forbid nepotism as an ethical matter, considering it too troublesome and disruptive. Most Companies' Codes of Conduct include severe disciplinary sanction for Conflicts of Interest . However, in Nepotistic practices, these are rarely observed or implemented.

[ citation needed ] In entertainment [ edit ] Outside of national politics, accusations of "nepotism" are made in instances of prima facie favoritism to relatives.

Peaches Geldof 's role as magazine editor in an MTV reality show – produced by a company owned by her father Bob Geldof [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Tori Spelling being cast on the TV series Beverly Hills, 90210 as a result of her father Aaron Spelling 's involvement with the show.

[ 27 ] Hollywood's Coppola family includes many distinguished filmmakers and actors. The careers of Sofia Coppola , Nicolas Cage , and Jason Schwartzman have been attributed to aid by director Francis Ford Coppola . He cast his daughter Sofia in The Godfather Part III .

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] Cage changed his last name to distance himself from such charges.

[ 30 ] Ben Platt 's role as high schooler Evan Hansen in the 2021 film adaptation of the musical Dear Evan Hansen as a result of his winning the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for originating the role on Broadway in 2016, as well as the involvement of his father, Marc Platt , as one of the film's producers. The latter was never involved on the producing team of the stage version. The casting sparked controversy due to Ben Platt being ten years older than his character at the time of filming, resulting in critics and viewers deeming him too old to reprise his role.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] He would go on to be nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards , including Worst Actor , for his performance.

[ 33 ] New York magazine’s December 2022 cover (calling 2022 'The Year of the Nepo Baby ') featured notable celebrities ( Maude Apatow , Lily-Rose Depp , Maya Hawke , Dakota Johnson , Ben Platt, Jack Quaid , Zoë Kravitz , and John David Washington ) whose career successes have been achieved through nepotism.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] In sports [ edit ] Thanasis Antetokounmpo has been labeled the beneficiary of nepotism due to his brother being Giannis Antetokounmpo , even though his play is deemed by some to not be good enough for him to occupy a roster spot on the Milwaukee Bucks .

[ 37 ] The Los Angeles Lakers encountered allegations of nepotism when they selected Bronny James , the son of LeBron James , in the 2024 NBA draft . Although other NBA prospects exemplified greater promise, experts questioned Bronny’s NBA readiness due to his lackluster performance during his only NCAA season. Reports revealed that LeBron’s agent, Rich Paul , actively discouraged other teams from drafting Bronny, even going so far as to suggest that he might play overseas if selected.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] In academia [ edit ] See also: Legacy preferences Nepotism is in academia where it is common for professors to have their partners, and sometimes children, hired by the same faculty in which they work.

[ 45 ] In the second half of the 20th century, in the United States at least, this was far less frequent as universities typically held very strict anti-nepotism policies.

[ 46 ] Countries with high levels of corruption and higher education systems with low competition between universities are generally having higher levels of corruption in academia.

[ 47 ] Italy has been noted for having particularly high levels of nepotism in its academic system, when compared to other developed nations.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] Nepotism is often praised for favoring female employment in academia.

[ 50 ] Selected examples by country [ edit ] Vladimir Putin 's childhood friend Arkady Rotenberg is one of the richest people in Russia.

[ 51 ] Argentina [ edit ] In Argentina , nepotism is a common practice. Although there have been various attempts at reducing it, [ 52 ] it is difficult in a country where state jobs are used as a token of gratitude or party favoritism.

Former president Mauricio Macri has been investigated for nepotism after allegedly extending a tax amnesty to his family.

[ 53 ] Nonetheless, in 2018, the government of Mauricio Macri set a limit on nepotism through Decree 93/2018 [ 54 ] establishing that "appointments of people could no longer be made, under any modality, throughout the National Public Sector, who have some kinship link both in straight line as well as in a collateral line up to the second degree, with the President and Vice President of the Nation, Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, Ministers and other officials with the rank and hierarchy of Minister. The spouse and the Cohabitant Union are included. " The Kirchnerist movement has been openly accused that it believes in nepotism, treating meritocracy as a pejorative concept.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] The government's ministries and secretariats are reportedly plagued with friends, family and supporters of the current party leaders, many of whom have been criticized for being incompetent at their jobs.

[ 57 ] On December 10, 2023, the libertarian president Javier Milei takes office – who campaigned criticizing the political "caste", an entelechy built to denigrate traditional political parties and among whose characteristics is that of appointing friends and family to public positions on a discretionary basis – and in one of his first measures he modifies the Mauricio Macri's Decree 93/2018 to be able to grant his sister, Karina Milei , the position of General Secretary of the Presidency.

[ 58 ] Less than two months later, Francisco Adorni, the brother of the government spokesperson Manuel Adorni , took a position as an advisor in the Ministry of Defense.

[ 59 ] Australia [ edit ] Shortly after his appointment as the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney in 2001, Peter Jensen was accused, in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview, of nepotism after nominating his brother Phillip Jensen as Dean of Sydney and appointing his wife Christine Jensen to an official position in the Sydney diocese.

[ 60 ] Anna Bligh , who won the 2009 Queensland State election, has been accused of nepotism by giving her husband Greg Withers a position as the Office of Climate Change head.

[ 61 ] Football Federation Australia was led by Frank Lowy from its inception in 2004 until his term limit exit in 2015. His son, Steven Lowy , who had little direct involvement in high level sports governance was nominated as his replacement by Frank, and was elected unopposed by a board strongly loyal to Frank. Steven's introduction exacerbated existing governance issues, with factional opposition led by City Football Group causing FIFA intervention to be threatened. Eventually governance reforms were forced through despite opposition from the Lowy family, and it ended with Steven Lowy resigning from the role. Lowy had also been accused of nepotism regarding his sons in his corporate dealings as founder of Westfield Group .

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Azerbaijan [ edit ] Aliyev family in 2018 On 21 February 2017, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev created the position of Vice President of Azerbaijan , then appointed his wife Mehriban Aliyeva to the position.

[ 64 ] Since 1993, the presidency of Azerbaijan has always been in the hands of a member of the Aliyev family: in 1993, Heydar Aliyev was elected president of Azerbaijan, and after his death in a United States hospital in 2003, his son Ilham Aliyev became president and has been since then. His regime has been accused for a lack of democratic freedoms and press freedom.

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] Belgium [ edit ] Over the past decade, criticism has been growing over the creation of political dynasties in Belgium. This phenomenon has been explained by the fact that prominent party members control the ranking of candidates on party lists for elections and a candidate's place on a list determines who is elected. Another justification for the phenomenon is the importance of name recognition for collecting votes.

[ 67 ] Claims of nepotism have been made against Bruno Tobback , the son of senator and former minister Louis Tobback , a member of the Flemish socialists, became the Belgian federal government's minister for the pensions and environment at 35 in 2005.

[ 68 ] Alexander De Croo , the son of former speaker of the Belgian parliament Herman De Croo, ran for the leadership of his father's party Open VLD at age 33.

[ 69 ] Finally there is the example of Maya Detiège , the daughter of former mayor of the city of Antwerp Leona Detiège, who herself is the daughter of the former mayor of Antwerp Frans Detiège.

[ 67 ] Among other examples are former minister Freya Van Den Bossche and senator Jean-Jacques De Gucht , being the daughter and son of respectively former minister Luc Vandenbossche and former minister Karel De Gucht .

Brazil [ edit ] In Brazil, nepotism heavily affects the integrity of public institutions, including audit bodies responsible for overseeing executive decisions. Studies indicate that around 30% of audit judges are directly related to other politicians, creating a network of familial ties that can lead to conflicts of interest and reduce the effectiveness of independent oversight (Transparency International, 2023).

[ 70 ] This high rate of nepotism often results in biased audit outcomes, eroding public trust and obstructing fair governance. The presence of such familial networks within regulatory bodies not only compromises transparency but also perpetuates inefficiency and corruption, limiting reform efforts across Brazil’s political landscape (Instituto Não Aceito Corrupção, 2022).

[ 71 ] Cambodia [ edit ] Prime Minister Hun Sen and senior members of Parliament are known for their hand in getting family members into government positions. In the 2013 Cambodian parliamentary elections , at least eight candidates were sons of high-ranking Cambodian People's Party officials.

[ 72 ] All sons of the ruling party lost but were eventually appointed into high-ranking government positions.

China [ edit ] See also: Princelings For the past 3,000 years, nepotism has been common in China's clan and extended family-based culture.

Confucius wrote about the importance of balancing "filial piety with merit". The clan -based feudal system collapsed during Confucius' lifetime, yet nepotism has continued through the modern age.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] France [ edit ] In October 2009, Jean Sarkozy , the second son of the President of the French Republic Nicolas Sarkozy , was poised to become the director of the major EPAD [ fr ] authority despite lacking any higher education degree and professional experience.

[ 75 ] In 2008 he was voted regional councillor of Neuilly-sur-Seine , the town of which his father had previously been mayor.

[ 76 ] In September 2009, rap -producer Pierre Sarkozy, the first son of then-President Nicolas Sarkozy, asked SCPP [ fr ] for a financial contribution of around €10000 towards an €80000 artistic project. Because he was not a SCPP member, the request was automatically rejected. Pierre Sarkozy then went to the Élysée which led to an Élysée aide contacting the SCPP, and SCPP president Marc Guez assuring the issue would soon be favorably resolved.

[ 77 ] [ 78 ] According to Abeille Music [ fr ] president and SCPP member Yves Riesel, however, this would not happen as SCPP's financial help has been restricted to members only for months.

[ 79 ] Greece [ edit ] In Greece it is common practice for family members of current or former party leaders to be party members and get appointed as ministers when the party is in government.

[ 80 ] In addition, there have been three prime ministers from the Papandreou family , [ 81 ] two from the Mitsotakis family (one currently serving), [ 82 ] two from the Karamanlis family (a third one was serving as minister of transportation until February 2023, quitting his position following the worst rail disaster in the history of the country).

India [ edit ] Research conducted found that in India, family CEOs are generally paid more than professional CEOs, especially in high-performing, eponymous firms. Additionally, family CEOs in these firms exhibit greater pay-performance sensitivity, benefiting more from strong performance while remaining insulated from poor outcomes. These findings indicate that CEO compensation can be used by controlling families in emerging markets as a tool to extract private benefits, often at the expense of minority shareholders.

[ 83 ] Nepotism in Indian politics [ edit ] Main article: Nepotism in Indian politics Since the 1980s, Indian politics has become dynastic, possibly due to the absence of elected party organization, independent civil society associations that mobilize support for a party, and centralized financing of elections.

[ 84 ] One example of dynastic politics has been the Nehru–Gandhi family which produced three Indian prime ministers. Family members have also led the Congress Party for most of the period since 1978 when Indira Gandhi floated the then Congress(I) faction of the party.

[ 85 ] The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party also features several senior leaders who are dynasts.

[ 86 ] Dynastic politics is prevalent also in a number of political parties with regional presence such as Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (JKNC), Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (JKPDP), All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), Janata Dal (Secular) (JD(s)), Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), National People's Party (NPP), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), Samajwadi Party (SP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SKD), Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) (SS(UBT)), Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP).

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] Judiciary [ edit ] Many judges and advocates of the high courts and the Supreme Court of India are alleged to be appointed by exercising casteism, nepotism, [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] and favoritism, primarily due to the Supreme Court and the high court appointment process called Collegium [ 92 ] which recommends to the President, in a legally binding manner, the names of judges to be appointed or promoted to the higher judiciary. The various judicial services exams are also infamous for these practices.

[ 93 ] Indian film industry [ edit ] See also: Lists of Indian film clans The Kapoor family , [ 94 ] one of the most prolific generational families involved in Indian cinema, have been known for bringing their children into the industry with their endorsements and influence.

[ 95 ] In June 2020, a fresh debate on nepotism followed soon after the suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput , [ 96 ] which fans believe was in reaction to efforts by Bollywood insiders to boycott him.

[ 97 ] Filmmaker Karan Johar , who Rajput had worked with in the Netflix film Drive (2019), was quickly accused of nepotism by actress Kangana Ranaut , with Rajput's fans calling for a boycott of Johar and his studio, Dharma Productions , as well as of actor Salman Khan and his brothers , who were accused of bullying outsiders in the past.

[ 98 ] [ 99 ] Actors and actresses Alia Bhatt , Varun Dhawan , Janhvi Kapoor , Ishaan Khatter , Ananya Pandey , Athiya Shetty , Tiger Shroff , Arjun Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan , all of whom hail from film families, were also widely criticized.

[ 100 ] Indonesia [ edit ] Suharto , Indonesia's second president, is involved in nepotism, alongside corruption and collusion (together, they are known as the KKN in Indonesian : korupsi, kolusi, dan nepotisme ). Companies belonging to Suharto's children, particularly Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana ("Tutut"), Hutomo Mandala Putra ("Tommy"), and Bambang Trihatmodjo, were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the toll-expressway company Jasamarga (monopolized by Tutut), the national car project Timor (monopolized by Bambang and Tommy), and the cinema market (monopolized by 21 Cineplex , which is owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono). The family is said to control about 36,000 km 2 (14,000 sq mi) of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000 m 2 (1,100,000 sq ft) of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor . Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish "strategic partnerships" with the former Indonesian president's family companies.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] Mauritius [ edit ] Main article: Corruption in Mauritius Nepotism is common in Mauritian politics , with many relatives and friends of high-ranking politicians being appointed high-ranking positions and associated companies being granted government contracts.

Since the first democratic elections in 1948 , the field of politics in Mauritius has been marked by a handful of families who have controlled the four major political parties which exist to this day. They are often referred to as the "modern dynasties" of Mauritian politics such as the Duval, Bérenger, Curé, Uteem, Mohamed, Boolell, Ramgoolam and Jugnauth families. The Boolell family's involvement in politics started with Satcam Boolell in 1955, paving the way for his son Arvin Boolell , nephews Satish Boolell, Anil Gayan, and Sanjay Bhuckory, and son-in-law Sushil Kushiram to enter politics. The Duval dynasty started with ex- Lord mayor and minister Gaetan Duval, followed by his sons Xavier and Richard as well as grandson Adrien. Lall Jugnauth was the first of his clan to enter politics in the 1950s and was followed by his cousins Aneerood and Ashock as well as nephew Pravind. Abdool Razack Mohamed, who migrated from India in the 1930s, became Lord Mayor and minister; his son Yousuf and grandson Shakeel were also elected and served as ministers.

[ 103 ] Roshi Bhadain , who was a minister of the MSM government, is the nephew of former Labour Party minister Vasant Bunwaree .

[ 104 ] Roshi Bhadain and Akilesh Deerpalsing (Bhadain's advisor and campaign manager, who is also the son of former minister Kishore Deerpalsing ), were investigated by ICAC in 2019 for suspicious recruitment practices when he was a minister.

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] In March 2020, Harry Ganoo, the retired brother of Minister Alan Ganoo , was nominated as the new president du Civil Service College Mauritius a few months after the November 2019 General Elections.

[ 108 ] Malaysia [ edit ] The appointment of Nurul Izzah Anwar as a senior economic and finance advisor by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim resulted in accusations of nepotism.

[ 109 ] The action was widely criticized by intellectuals, NGOs and even parties member to the Pakatan Harapan coalition, who claimed it contravened principles of merit and fairness.

[ 110 ] Malta [ edit ] See also: Corruption in Malta Due to its small native population, Malta has an entrenched culture of nepotism which became more evident since the country gained independence from the British Empire in 1964.

[ 111 ] In a Eurobarometer survey published in 2023, 55% of Maltese businesses reported that nepotism and patronage were the primary problems they faced in their operations. Furthermore, 70% of Maltese businesses have also stated that close links between businessmen and politicians lead to corruption.

[ 112 ] These rates were higher compared to those of other EU member states, of which only 37% (nepotism and patronage) and 35% (corruption) felt that such issues were problematic.

[ 112 ] Romania [ edit ] Romanian Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu 's family members "dominated" the country for decades.
