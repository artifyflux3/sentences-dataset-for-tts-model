[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Purple capitalism or feminist capitalism is a term used to describe, from a critical perspective, the incorporation of some principles of the feminist movement into capitalism and the market economy .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Critiques are based, on the one hand, on the argument that the integration of women into the labor market has not led to a paradigm shift in the socio-economic model towards a more horizontal and egalitarian one, where wage gaps persist, [ 8 ] and care work has not been evenly distributed, remaining predominantly shouldered by women.

[ 9 ] On the other hand, there is also scrutiny regarding how feminism is instrumentalized to sell products (such as music or clothing), losing its political significance and becoming merely a trend that does not question the production conditions of these products and excludes the majority of the world's population.
