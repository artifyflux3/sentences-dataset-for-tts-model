Due to his extensive work in medicine, Hussam received the title of jarrah ( جراح ), meaning "surgeon" in the Arabic language.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Although his exact date of birth is unknown, Hussam was primarily active during the 12th century; he established a Sufi -focused zawiya known as the Zawiya Jarrahiyya in Jerusalem .

[ 5 ] Hussam was buried on the grounds of the school, which is today located in the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah , for which he serves as the namesake.

[ 6 ] In 1202, a tomb was built on his burial site and subsequently became a destination for Muslim mystics and visitors.
