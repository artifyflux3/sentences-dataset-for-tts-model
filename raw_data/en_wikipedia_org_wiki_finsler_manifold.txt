{\displaystyle L(\gamma )=\int _{a}^{b}F\left(\gamma (t),{\dot {\gamma }}(t)\right)\,\mathrm {d} t.} Finsler manifolds are more general than Riemannian manifolds since the tangent norms need not be induced by inner products .

Every Finsler manifold becomes an intrinsic quasimetric space when the distance between two points is defined as the infimum length of the curves that join them.

Élie Cartan ( 1933 ) named Finsler manifolds after Paul Finsler , who studied this geometry in his dissertation ( Finsler 1918 ).

Definition [ edit ] A Finsler manifold is a differentiable manifold M together with a Finsler metric , which is a continuous nonnegative function F : T M → [0, +∞) defined on the tangent bundle so that for each point x of M , F ( v + w ) ≤ F ( v ) + F ( w ) for every two vectors v , w tangent to M at x ( subadditivity ).

F (λ v ) = λ F ( v ) for all λ ≥ 0 (but not necessarily for λ < 0) ( positive homogeneity ).

F ( v ) > 0 unless v = 0 ( positive definiteness ).

In other words, F ( x , −) is an asymmetric norm on each tangent space T x M . The Finsler metric F is also required to be smooth , more precisely: F is smooth on the complement of the zero section of T M .

The subadditivity axiom may then be replaced by the following strong convexity condition : For each tangent vector v ≠ 0 , the Hessian matrix of F 2 at v is positive definite .

Here the Hessian of F 2 at v is the symmetric bilinear form g v ( X , Y ) := 1 2 ∂ ∂ 2 ∂ ∂ s ∂ ∂ t [ F ( v + s X + t Y ) 2 ] | s = t = 0 , {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{v}(X,Y):={\frac {1}{2}}\left.{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial s\partial t}}\left[F(v+sX+tY)^{2}\right]\right|_{s=t=0},} also known as the fundamental tensor of F at v . Strong convexity of F implies the subadditivity with a strict inequality if u ⁄ F ( u ) ≠ v ⁄ F ( v ) . If F is strongly convex, then it is a Minkowski norm on each tangent space.

A Finsler metric is reversible if, in addition, F (− v ) = F ( v ) for all tangent vectors v .

A reversible Finsler metric defines a norm (in the usual sense) on each tangent space.

Examples [ edit ] Smooth submanifolds (including open subsets) of a normed vector space of finite dimension are Finsler manifolds if the norm of the vector space is smooth outside the origin.

Riemannian manifolds (but not pseudo-Riemannian manifolds ) are special cases of Finsler manifolds.

Randers manifolds [ edit ] Let ( M , a ) {\displaystyle (M,a)} be a Riemannian manifold and b a differential one-form on M with ‖ ‖ b ‖ ‖ a := a i j b i b j < 1 , {\displaystyle \|b\|_{a}:={\sqrt {a^{ij}b_{i}b_{j}}}<1,} where ( a i j ) {\displaystyle \left(a^{ij}\right)} is the inverse matrix of ( a i j ) {\displaystyle (a_{ij})} and the Einstein notation is used. Then F ( x , v ) := a i j ( x ) v i v j + b i ( x ) v i {\displaystyle F(x,v):={\sqrt {a_{ij}(x)v^{i}v^{j}}}+b_{i}(x)v^{i}} defines a Randers metric on M and ( M , F ) {\displaystyle (M,F)} is a Randers manifold , a special case of a non-reversible Finsler manifold.

[ 1 ] Smooth quasimetric spaces [ edit ] Let ( M , d ) be a quasimetric so that M is also a differentiable manifold and d is compatible with the differential structure of M in the following sense: Around any point z on M there exists a smooth chart ( U , φ) of M and a constant C ≥ 1 such that for every x , y ∈ U 1 C ‖ ‖ ϕ ϕ ( y ) − − ϕ ϕ ( x ) ‖ ‖ ≤ ≤ d ( x , y ) ≤ ≤ C ‖ ‖ ϕ ϕ ( y ) − − ϕ ϕ ( x ) ‖ ‖ .

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{C}}\|\phi (y)-\phi (x)\|\leq d(x,y)\leq C\|\phi (y)-\phi (x)\|.} The function d : M × M → [0, ∞] is smooth in some punctured neighborhood of the diagonal.

Then one can define a Finsler function F : TM →[0, ∞] by F ( x , v ) := lim t → → 0 + d ( γ γ ( 0 ) , γ γ ( t ) ) t , {\displaystyle F(x,v):=\lim _{t\to 0+}{\frac {d(\gamma (0),\gamma (t))}{t}},} where γ is any curve in M with γ (0) = x and γ' (0) = v. The Finsler function F obtained in this way restricts to an asymmetric (typically non-Minkowski) norm on each tangent space of M . The induced intrinsic metric d L : M × M → [0, ∞] of the original quasimetric can be recovered from d L ( x , y ) := inf { ∫ ∫ 0 1 F ( γ γ ( t ) , γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) ) d t | γ γ ∈ ∈ C 1 ( [ 0 , 1 ] , M ) , γ γ ( 0 ) = x , γ γ ( 1 ) = y } , {\displaystyle d_{L}(x,y):=\inf \left\{\ \left.\int _{0}^{1}F\left(\gamma (t),{\dot {\gamma }}(t)\right)\,dt\ \right|\ \gamma \in C^{1}([0,1],M)\ ,\ \gamma (0)=x\ ,\ \gamma (1)=y\ \right\},} and in fact any Finsler function F : T M → [0, ∞) defines an intrinsic quasimetric d L on M by this formula.

Geodesics [ edit ] Due to the homogeneity of F the length L [ γ γ ] := ∫ ∫ a b F ( γ γ ( t ) , γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) ) d t {\displaystyle L[\gamma ]:=\int _{a}^{b}F\left(\gamma (t),{\dot {\gamma }}(t)\right)\,dt} of a differentiable curve γ : [ a , b ] → M in M is invariant under positively oriented reparametrizations . A constant speed curve γ is a geodesic of a Finsler manifold if its short enough segments γ | [ c , d ] are length-minimizing in M from γ ( c ) to γ ( d ). Equivalently, γ is a geodesic if it is stationary for the energy functional E [ γ γ ] := 1 2 ∫ ∫ a b F 2 ( γ γ ( t ) , γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) ) d t {\displaystyle E[\gamma ]:={\frac {1}{2}}\int _{a}^{b}F^{2}\left(\gamma (t),{\dot {\gamma }}(t)\right)\,dt} in the sense that its functional derivative vanishes among differentiable curves γ : [ a , b ] → M with fixed endpoints γ ( a ) = x and γ ( b ) = y .

Canonical spray structure on a Finsler manifold [ edit ] The Euler–Lagrange equation for the energy functional E [ γ ] reads in the local coordinates ( x 1 , ..., x n , v 1 , ..., v n ) of T M as g i k ( γ γ ( t ) , γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) ) γ γ ¨ ¨ i ( t ) + ( ∂ ∂ g i k ∂ ∂ x j ( γ γ ( t ) , γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) ) − − 1 2 ∂ ∂ g i j ∂ ∂ x k ( γ γ ( t ) , γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) ) ) γ γ ˙ ˙ i ( t ) γ γ ˙ ˙ j ( t ) = 0 , {\displaystyle g_{ik}{\Big (}\gamma (t),{\dot {\gamma }}(t){\Big )}{\ddot {\gamma }}^{i}(t)+\left({\frac {\partial g_{ik}}{\partial x^{j}}}{\Big (}\gamma (t),{\dot {\gamma }}(t){\Big )}-{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^{k}}}{\Big (}\gamma (t),{\dot {\gamma }}(t){\Big )}\right){\dot {\gamma }}^{i}(t){\dot {\gamma }}^{j}(t)=0,} where k = 1, ..., n and g ij is the coordinate representation of the fundamental tensor, defined as g i j ( x , v ) := g v ( ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x i | x , ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x j | x ) .

{\displaystyle g_{ij}(x,v):=g_{v}\left(\left.{\frac {\partial }{\partial x^{i}}}\right|_{x},\left.{\frac {\partial }{\partial x^{j}}}\right|_{x}\right).} Assuming the strong convexity of F 2 ( x , v ) with respect to v ∈ T x M , the matrix g ij ( x , v ) is invertible and its inverse is denoted by g ij ( x , v ). Then γ : [ a , b ] → M is a geodesic of ( M , F ) if and only if its tangent curve γ' : [ a , b ] → T M ∖{0} is an integral curve of the smooth vector field H on T M ∖{0} locally defined by H | ( x , v ) := v i ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x i | ( x , v ) − − 2 G i ( x , v ) ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ v i | ( x , v ) , {\displaystyle \left.H\right|_{(x,v)}:=\left.v^{i}{\frac {\partial }{\partial x^{i}}}\right|_{(x,v)}\!\!-\left.2G^{i}(x,v){\frac {\partial }{\partial v^{i}}}\right|_{(x,v)},} where the local spray coefficients G i are given by G i ( x , v ) := 1 4 g i j ( x , v ) ( 2 ∂ ∂ g j k ∂ ∂ x ℓ ℓ ( x , v ) − − ∂ ∂ g k ℓ ℓ ∂ ∂ x j ( x , v ) ) v k v ℓ ℓ .

{\displaystyle G^{i}(x,v):={\frac {1}{4}}g^{ij}(x,v)\left(2{\frac {\partial g_{jk}}{\partial x^{\ell }}}(x,v)-{\frac {\partial g_{k\ell }}{\partial x^{j}}}(x,v)\right)v^{k}v^{\ell }.} The vector field H on T M ∖{0} satisfies JH = V and [ V , H ] = H , where J and V are the canonical endomorphism and the canonical vector field on T M ∖{0}. Hence, by definition, H is a spray on M . The spray H defines a nonlinear connection on the fibre bundle T M ∖{0} → M through the vertical projection v : T ( T M ∖ ∖ { 0 } ) → → T ( T M ∖ ∖ { 0 } ) ; v := 1 2 ( I + L H J ) .

{\displaystyle v:T(\mathrm {T} M\setminus \{0\})\to T(\mathrm {T} M\setminus \{0\});\quad v:={\frac {1}{2}}{\big (}I+{\mathcal {L}}_{H}J{\big )}.} In analogy with the Riemannian case, there is a version D γ γ ˙ ˙ D γ γ ˙ ˙ X ( t ) + R γ γ ˙ ˙ ( γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) , X ( t ) ) = 0 {\displaystyle D_{\dot {\gamma }}D_{\dot {\gamma }}X(t)+R_{\dot {\gamma }}\left({\dot {\gamma }}(t),X(t)\right)=0} of the Jacobi equation for a general spray structure ( M , H ) in terms of the Ehresmann curvature and nonlinear covariant derivative .

Uniqueness and minimizing properties of geodesics [ edit ] By Hopf–Rinow theorem there always exist length minimizing curves (at least in small enough neighborhoods) on ( M , F ). Length minimizing curves can always be positively reparametrized to be geodesics, and any geodesic must satisfy the Euler–Lagrange equation for E [ γ ]. Assuming the strong convexity of F 2 there exists a unique maximal geodesic γ with γ (0) = x and γ' (0) = v for any ( x , v ) ∈ T M ∖{0} by the uniqueness of integral curves .

If F 2 is strongly convex, geodesics γ : [0, b ] → M are length-minimizing among nearby curves until the first point γ ( s ) conjugate to γ (0) along γ , and for t > s there always exist shorter curves from γ (0) to γ ( t ) near γ , as in the Riemannian case.
