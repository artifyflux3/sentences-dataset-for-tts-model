[ 1 ] He was part of a colonizing party and a mission of four Franciscans sent under a 1611 patent letter from the Regent Marie de Médicis , and was also accompanied by Father Yves D'Evreux .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Biography [ edit ] The colonial enterprise to found " France Équinoxiale " was led by Daniel de la Tousche , sieur de la Ravardière, and François de Razilly .

[ 3 ] The outpost would later become the city of São Luís do Maranhão .

[ 3 ] The French arrived in the island in August 1612.

[ 4 ] One of the objectives of the mission was to establish trade in brazilwood and tobacco .

[ 4 ] Tupinambás "Louis Henri" (left) and "Louis de St. Iehan" (right) at the court of Louis XIII, in Claude d'Abbeville Histoire de la mission , 1614 The fathers worked on the island of Maragnan in the mouth of the Amazon, where the French Fort Saint Louis was founded as a Roman Catholic mission in 1612-15.

[ 3 ] The two fathers Claude d'Abbeville and Yves D'Evreux learned the Tupinambá language and wrote about their experience.

[ 2 ] The Catholic colonial endeavours of the early 17th century followed the earlier Protestant attempts at establishing a colony in South America, especially the short-lived France Antarctique , and marked the recent domination of the Catholic faith over Protestantism in France.

[ 3 ] The Tupinambá were in alliance with the French, with the objective of resisting Portuguese encroachments.

[ 3 ] The mission organized the dispatch of Tupinambá Indians from Maragnan to the court of Louis XIII in France, where they created a sensation.

[ 3 ] Père Claude d'Abbeville commented enthusiastically on the visit of the Indians in Paris with the words: "Who would have thought that Paris, used to the strange and the exotic, would go so wild over these Indians?".

[ 3 ] The Indians – only three out of a total six had survived the travel by that time – were baptized in the Church of the Capuchins.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] When France and Spain (including Portugal in the Iberian Union ) became allied through the marriage of Louis XIII with Anne of Austria in 1615, support for the colony was discontinued and the colonists abandoned.

[ 4 ] The Portuguese soon managed to expel the French from the colony.

[ 3 ] The book by Claude d'Abbeville was removed from circulation, and similar work by Yves D'Evreux and Francois Huby was destroyed.
