Find sources: "Valet" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( October 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A 17th-century valet de chambre A valet or varlet is a male servant who serves as personal attendant to his employer. In the Middle Ages and Ancien Régime , valet de chambre was a role for junior courtiers and specialists such as artists in a royal court , but the term "valet" by itself most often refers to a normal servant responsible for the clothes and personal belongings of an employer, and making minor arrangements. In the United States, the term most often refers to a parking valet , and the role is often confused with a butler .

Word origins [ edit ] In English, valet as "personal man-servant" is recorded since 1567, though use of the term in the French-speaking English medieval court is older, and the variant form varlet is cited from 1456 ( OED ). Both are French importations of valet or varlet (the "t" being silent in modern French), Old French variants of vaslet "man's servant", originally "squire, young man", assumed to be from Gallo-Romance Vulgar Latin * vassellittus "young nobleman, squire, page", diminutive of Medieval Latin vassallus , from vassus "servant", possibly cognate to an Old Celtic root wasso- "young man, squire" (source of Welsh gwas "youth, servant", Breton goaz "servant, vassal, man", Irish foss "servant"). See yeoman , possibly derived from yonge man , a related term.

The modern use is usually short for the valet de chambre (French for "room valet", in modern terms the bedroom, though not originally so), described in the following section.

Since the 16th century, the word has traditionally been pronounced as rhyming with pallet , though an alternative pronunciation, rhyming with array and allay , as in French, is now common, particularly in the United States.

[ 1 ] The Oxford English Dictionary lists both pronunciations.

( February 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A valet or "gentleman's gentleman" is a gentleman's male servant ; the closest female equivalent is a lady's maid . The valet performs personal services such as maintaining his employer's clothes, running his bath and perhaps (especially in the past) shaving his employer.

In a great house , the master of the house had his own valet, and in the very grandest great houses, other adult members of the employing family (e.g. master's sons) would also have their own valets.

At a court, even minor princes and high officials may be assigned one, but in a smaller household the butler – the majordomo in charge of the household staff – might have to double as his employer's valet. In a bachelor's household the valet might perform light housekeeping duties as well.

Valets learned the skills for their role in various ways. Some began as footmen , learning some relevant skills as part of that job, and picking up others when deputising for their master's valet, or by performing valeting tasks for his sons before they had a valet of their own, or for male guests who did not travel with a valet. Others started out as soldier-servants to army officers ( batmen ) or stewards to naval officers.

Traditionally, a valet did much more than merely lay out clothes and take care of personal items. He was also responsible for making travel arrangements, dealing with any bills and handling all money matters concerning his master or his master's household.

Alexandre Bontemps , the most senior of the thirty-six valets to Louis XIV of France , was a powerful figure, who ran the Château de Versailles . In courts , valet de chambre was a position of some status, often given to artists, musicians, poets and others, who generally spent most of their time on their specialized work. The role was also, at least during the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance , a common first step or training period in a nobleman's career at court.

Valets, like butlers and most specialized domestic staff, have become relatively rare. A more common, though still infrequent, arrangement is the general servant performing combined roles.

A notable 20th century domestic valet was Sydney Johnson who served as personal valet to the Duke of Windsor and later to the businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed .

[ 2 ] Another notable person is Walt Nauta , a former military valet, who worked at the White House and later at Mar-a-Lago as Donald Trump 's personal valet. On July 6, 2023, he pleaded not guilty for allegedly moving boxes of classified materials at Mar-a-Lago.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Famous fictional valets [ edit ] Carving of "Bazin", the valet to Aramis , of The Three Musketeers , was a studious person who later became a lay brother. ( Thomas Nicholls carves him brushing his master's clothes whilst studying theology .)

Varlet [ edit ] While in French this word remained restricted to the feudal use for a (knight's) squire , in modern English it came to be used for the various other male servants originally called va(r)let other than the gentleman's gentleman, when in livery usually called lackey , such as the valet de pied ('foot varlet', compare footman ). In archaic English, varlet also could mean an unprincipled man; a rogue .
