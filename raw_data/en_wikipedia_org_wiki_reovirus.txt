[ 1 ] Viruses in this family are distinguished by the absence of a turreted protein on the inner capsid to produce a smooth surface.

[ 2 ] Taxonomy [ edit ] The family contains the following genera: [ 1 ] Cardoreovirus Crabreovirus Mimoreovirus Orbivirus Phytoreovirus Rotavirus Seadornavirus Characteristics [ edit ] Like other members of the Reovirales order, viruses of the Sedoreoviridae family are made of naked, icosahedral capsids containing 10-12 segments of linear double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The Baltimore System of viral classification categorizes Reovirales in Group III.

Importance [ edit ] Viruses classified in the Sedoreoviridae family infect a wide range of plants and animals, including some that can infect humans. There is not only the potential of a few of these viruses to cause human disease, but also to reduce the supply of crops and livestock.

Viruses [ edit ] Intact double-shelled Rotavirus particles Genus Cardoreovirus [ edit ] Eriocheir sinensis reovirus was isolated out of a Chinese mitten crab ( Eriocheir sinensis ). No currently known associated disease.

[ 3 ] Genus Mimoreovirus [ edit ] Microsomonas pusilla reovirus was isolated from the marine protist Micromonas pusilla .

[ 4 ] Genus Orbivirus [ edit ] Some Orbivirus infect livestock with high rates of morbidity and mortality.

[ 5 ] Includes: Bluetongue virus , African horse sickness virus, Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, among others.

Genus Phytoreovirus [ edit ] Known phytoreoviruses are plant pathogens causing dwarfism and the formation of tumors.

[ 6 ] Included: Rice dwarf virus , Rice gall dwarf virus , and Wound tumor virus .

Genus Rotavirus [ edit ] Rotavirus A-E cause infantile gastroenteritis in humans and farm animals.

[ 7 ] Genus Seadornavirus [ edit ] Many known Seadornaviruses cause encephalitis in humans.
Included: Banna virus , Kadipiro virus , and Liao ning virus .
