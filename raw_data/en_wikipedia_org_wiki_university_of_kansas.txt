13001038 The University of Kansas ( KU ) is a public research university with its main campus in Lawrence, Kansas , United States.

[ 13 ] Two branch campuses are in the Kansas City metropolitan area on the Kansas side: the university's medical school and hospital in Kansas City, Kansas and the Edwards Campus in Overland Park . There are also educational and research sites in Garden City , Hays , Leavenworth , Parsons , and Topeka , an agricultural education center in rural north Douglas County , and branches of the medical school in Salina and Wichita . The university is a member of the Association of American Universities and classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 14 ] Founded March 21, 1865, the university was opened in 1866 under a charter granted by the Kansas State Legislature in 1864 [ 15 ] and legislation passed in 1863 under the state constitution , which was adopted two years after the 1861 admission of the former Kansas Territory as the 34th state into the Union.

[ 16 ] As of fall 2022 [update] , 23,872 students were enrolled at the Lawrence and Edwards campuses with an additional 2,836 students enrolled at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) for a total enrollment of 26,708 students across the three campuses.

[ 17 ] Overall, the university (including KUMC) employed 3,196 faculty members (faculty, faculty administrators, librarians, and unclassified academic staff) in fall 2022 [update] .

[ 18 ] Kansas's athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I sports as the Jayhawks, as members of the Big 12 Conference . They field 16 varsity sports, as well as club-level sports for ice hockey, rugby, men's volleyball, soccer, basketball, rock climbing, triathlon, cross country, track, swim, pickleball, table tennis, and water skiing.

History [ edit ] Main article: History of the University of Kansas On February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor Thomas Carney signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence.

[ 19 ] The law was conditioned upon a gift from Lawrence of a $15,000 endowment fund and a site for the university, in or near the town, of not less than forty acres (16 hectares) of land.

[ 20 ] If Lawrence failed to meet these conditions, Emporia instead of Lawrence would get the university.

The site selected for the university was a hill known as Hogback Ridge (later known as Mount Oread ), which was privately donated by Charles L. Robinson , the Republican governor of the state of Kansas from 1861 to 1863, and one of the original settlers of Lawrence, Kansas. Robinson and his wife Sara bestowed the 40-acre (16 ha) site to the State of Kansas in exchange for land elsewhere.

[ 20 ] The philanthropist Amos Adams Lawrence donated $10,000 of the necessary endowment fund, and the citizens of Lawrence raised the remaining money themselves via private donations.

[ 20 ] On November 2, 1863, Governor Carney announced Lawrence had met the conditions to get into the state university, and the following year the university was officially organized.

[ 15 ] The school's Board of Regents held its first meeting in March 1865, which is the event that KU dates its founding from.

[ 2 ] [ 21 ] Work on the first college building began later that year.

[ 15 ] The school opened for classes on September 12, 1866, and the first class graduated in 1873.

[ 15 ] According to William L. Burdick, the first degree awarded by the university was a Doctor of Divinity , bestowed upon noted abolitionist preacher Richard Cordley .

[ 22 ] During the early development of the University of Kansas, Chancellors Joshua Lippincott , Francis H. Snow , and Frank Strong , along with the Kansas Board of Regents, worked to establish the university as not only a center for higher education but also a representative agency of the state. Snow, who served from 1890 to 1901, emphasized scientific research and public engagement, while Strong, beginning in 1902, advanced the university’s role in public service. This vision aligned with the sentiments expressed by Professor M. S. Ward, who stated in 1891 that "Students should find in the University preparation for all the various pursuits and callings of society. The ultimate aim of our own State University ought to be [promoting] the highest Christian culture, an ample professional training, [which] will make our civilization the highest possible on earth." [ 23 ] In an effort to appeal to the predominantly Christian population of Kansas, many of who in the early history of the university were critical of state money being used to fund a secular institution, Chancellor Lippincott sought to reassure the public that the University of Kansas maintained strong Christian values. In response to a concerned parent questioning the university’s mission, Lippincott wrote, "The University is a Christian institution founded by a Christian state. We have daily prayers conducted for the most part by members of the Faculty of whom nearly all are Christian and several ministers of the Gospel." [ 24 ] Although the university was a secular institution, religion remained a central cultural force among students. In an 1880 community letter, an anonymous student reflected on the broader moral and spiritual purpose of education at KU, writing, "We are all seeking the truth, we are all earnest in our effort to correctly solve the great problem of a worthy and useful existence—we all recognize the wonderful features of a Christian age and a Christian country and we all hope to be true men and women [of the country] and almost all acknowledge that in accomplishing this we need an inspiration which is not of this earth nor fashioned after this world." [ 24 ] Chancellor Lippincott emphasized the importance of individual development in higher education, distinguishing universities from more rigid collegiate institutions in other parts of the country. In a lecture to students, James Marvin , the third Chancellor of the University stated, "Higher education should aid students to realize all their potentialities, but only in a university are all individualities respected. Colleges that require all students [to] follow the same course have a factory air about them. Students go through the same milling process and come out machines, but God did not intend man to be a machine, and the University of Kansas should be about His work." [ 25 ] Beginning in 1880, the University began to field intercollegiate athletics programs, starting with baseball. The University would introduce football in 1890, men's basketball in 1898, a women's club basketball team in 1902, and various other varsity athletics programs throughout the 20th century.

During World War I, the University of Kansas became a key training ground for military personnel, and courses were added for male students to reflect this. Military drills and coursework in military science were made mandatory for male students, and in 1918, KU established a unit of the Students' Army Training Corps (SATC) to provide academic and military instruction. Faculty contributed to war-related research, while female students supported Red Cross efforts. Chancellor Frank Strong emphasized KU’s role in preparing students for both military service and national responsibility.

[ 26 ] Strong was a vocal opponent of the United States entering a foreign war, and helped found the Kansas Branch of the League to Enforce Peace in 1915, which was a collection of activists who were opposed to American involvement in foreign conflicts. Strong advocated for patriotism during his later years as Chancellor, stating at the University Assembly in 1915 that "it is America's destiny to preserve Western Civilization, which seems to be destroying itself abroad. While the youth of Europe are on its battlefields, the youth of America must seek higher education to enable them to carry on the material for the leadership of the world. America and its universities, with the University of Kansas having a big place among them, must become the center of the greatest intellectual life that the next generation should know." In April 1917, after Congress declared a state of war, Strong sent a letter to Congress stating that the University "has always been loyal to country and to the flag, and always will be." [ 27 ] During World War II, Kansas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program , which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

Starting in 1867, a baseball team made up of KU students represented the University of Kansas in games played at the Kansas State Fair against local teams from around the state of Kansas.

[ 61 ] The school's sports teams, wearing crimson and blue, are called the Kansas Jayhawks . They participate in the NCAA 's Division I and in the Big 12 Conference . The University of Kansas has won thirteen National Championships all-time: six in men's basketball (two Helms Foundation championships and four NCAA championships, most recently in 2022), three in men's indoor track and field, three in men's outdoor track and field, one in men's cross country and one in women's outdoor track and field. The home course for KU Cross Country is Rim Rock Farm. Their most recent championship came in 2022, the men's basketball team won the 2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament .

David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium Kansas football dates from 1890 and is one of the oldest continuous programs in the nation. They have played in the Orange Bowl three times: 1948, 1969, and 2008, as well as nine other bowl games. They are currently coached by Lance Leipold , who was hired in May 2021.

[ 62 ] From its inception in 1890 to 1929, the program saw consistent success, winning several conference titles in four different conferences. After joining the Big 6 Conference (which would eventually become the Big 8) in 1929, Kansas began to struggle in the win-loss column. With the formation of the Big 8 conference in 1960, Kansas became a consistent winner again and fielded legendary coaches like Pepper Rodgers, Don Fambrough, Bud Moore, and Glen Mason. In 2008, under the leadership of Mark Mangino , the #7 Jayhawks emerged victorious in their first BCS bowl game, the FedEx Orange Bowl , with a 24–21 victory over the #3 Virginia Tech Hokies . This capstone victory marked the end of the most successful season in school history, in which the Jayhawks went 12–1 (.923). The team plays at David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium , which recently underwent an $85 million renovation to add an indoor practice facility with a 120-yard field, an outdoor practice facility with two full fields and three partial fields, new locker rooms, a new weight training facility, new residencies for players, new offices, new turf, new seats, and a state-of-the-art video board.

The team has won six national titles, including four NCAA tournament championships in 1952 , 1988 , 2008 , and 2022 . The basketball program is currently the winningest program in college basketball history with an overall record of 2,355–877 up to their Final Four appearance in the 2021–22 season. The team plays at Allen Fieldhouse . Perhaps its best-recognized player was Wilt Chamberlain , who played in the 1950s, later becoming an NBA star and Harlem Globetrotter .

Kansas has counted among its coaches James Naismith (the inventor of basketball), Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Phog Allen ("the Father of basketball coaching" and a Kansas alumnus himself), Dick Harp, Ted Owens, Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Roy Williams , and Basketball Hall of Fame inductee and former NBA Champion Detroit Pistons coach Larry Brown . Currently, Kansas is coached by Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Bill Self . In addition, legendary University of Kentucky coach and Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Adolph Rupp played for KU's 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams, and NCAA Hall of Fame inductee and University of North Carolina Coach Dean Smith played for KU's 1952 NCAA Championship team. Both Rupp and Smith played under Phog Allen. Allen also coached Hall of Fame coaches Dutch Lonborg and Ralph Miller. Allen founded the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), which started what is now the NCAA Tournament. The Tournament began in 1939 under the NABC and the next year was handed off to the newly formed NCAA.

[ 64 ] Kansas fielded its first women's soccer team in 1995. The women's soccer team launched in 1980 as a club sport, but was promoted to varsity play in the NCAA in 1995, when Lori Walker was hired as the head coach. Since 1995 they've appeared in the NCAA tournament ten times, and have won the Big 12 championship three times. They compete at Rock Chalk Park, a 2,500 seat stadium built in 2014. In cooperation with Kansas Athletics, FIFA is using Rock Chalk Park as a training facility and team base camp for the 2026 World Cup , with one of the host sites being nearby Kansas City.

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] Notable non-varsity sports include rugby, men's hockey, and men's soccer. The rugby team owns its private facility and tours internationally every two years. The men's hockey team plays at AdventHealth Sports Park in Overland Park, Kansas. They also practice in Topeka and Lawrence. They compete in the American Collegiate Hockey Association .

[ 67 ] Men's soccer competes in the South Conference of the Upper Midwest Collegiate Soccer League. They play on an artificial turf field next to student dorms next to Allen Fieldhouse.

Debate teams [ edit ] The University of Kansas has had more teams compete in the National Debate Tournament than any other university.

[ 68 ] Kansas has won the tournament six times (1954, 1970, 1976, 1983, 2009, and 2018) [ 69 ] and has qualified to the Final Four 22 times.

[ 68 ] Kansas trails only Northwestern (15) and Harvard (7) for most tournaments won and is tied with Dartmouth (6). Kansas also won the Copeland Award in 1981–82, 2017–18, and 2024–2025.

Media [ edit ] The university's newspaper is the University Daily Kansan , which placed first in the Intercollegiate Writing Competition of the prestigious William Randolph Hearst Writing Foundation competition. In the winter of 2008, a group of students created KUpedia, a wiki about all things KU. They received student funding for operations in 2008–09. The KU Department of English publishes the Coal City Review , an annual literary journal of prose, poetry, reviews, and illustrations. The Review typically features the work of many writers, but periodically spotlights one author, as in the case of 2006 Nelson Poetry Book Award-winner Voyeur Poems by Matthew Porubsky.

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] The University Daily Kansan operates outside of the university's William Allen White School of Journalism [ 72 ] and reaches at least 30,000 daily readers through its print and online publications.

[ 73 ] The university houses the following public broadcasting stations: KJHK , a student-run campus radio station, KUJH-LP, an independent station that primarily broadcasts public affairs programs, and KANU , the NPR -affiliated radio station. Kansas Public Radio station KANU was one of the nation's first public radio stations. KJHK, the campus radio has roots back to 1952 and is completely run by students.

Center for Community Health and Development [ edit ] Further information: Community Tool Box The university's Center for Community Health and Development (formerly KU Work Group [ 74 ] ) was designated as a World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Community Health and Development in 2004.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] It is affiliated with the Department of Applied Behavioral Science and the Schiefelbusch Institute for Life Span Studies at the university, and supports community health and development through a variety of means, including its free online resource, the Community Tool Box .

[ 74 ] [ 77 ] Foundations [ edit ] University of Kansas Memorial Corporation [ edit ] The first union was built on campus in 1926 as a campus community center.

[ 78 ] The unions are still the "living rooms" of campus and include three locations – the Kansas Union and Burge Union at the Lawrence Campus and Jayhawk Central at the Edwards Campus. The KU Memorial Unions Corporation manages the KU Bookstore (with seven locations). The KU Bookstore is the official bookstore of KU. The corporation also includes KU Dining Services, with more than 20 campus locations, including The Market (inside the Kansas Union) and The Underground (located in Wescoe Hall). The KU Bookstore and KU Dining Services are not-for-profit, [ 79 ] with proceeds supporting student programs, such as Student Union Activities.
