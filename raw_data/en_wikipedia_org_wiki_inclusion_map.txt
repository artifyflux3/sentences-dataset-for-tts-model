{\displaystyle A.} In mathematics , if A {\displaystyle A} is a subset of B , {\displaystyle B,} then the inclusion map is the function ι ι {\displaystyle \iota } that sends each element x {\displaystyle x} of A {\displaystyle A} to x , {\displaystyle x,} treated as an element of B : {\displaystyle B:} ι ι : A → → B , ι ι ( x ) = x .

{\displaystyle \iota :A\rightarrow B,\qquad \iota (x)=x.} An inclusion map may also be referred to as an inclusion function , an insertion , [ 1 ] or a canonical injection .

A "hooked arrow" ( U+ 21AA ↪ RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH HOOK ) [ 2 ] is sometimes used in place of the function arrow above to denote an inclusion map; thus: ι ι : A ↪ ↪ B .

{\displaystyle \iota :A\hookrightarrow B.} (However, some authors use this hooked arrow for any embedding .) This and other analogous injective functions [ 3 ] from substructures are sometimes called natural injections .

Given any morphism f {\displaystyle f} between objects X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} , if there is an inclusion map ι ι : A → → X {\displaystyle \iota :A\to X} into the domain X {\displaystyle X} , then one can form the restriction f ∘ ∘ ι ι {\displaystyle f\circ \iota } of f .

{\displaystyle f.} In many instances, one can also construct a canonical inclusion into the codomain R → → Y {\displaystyle R\to Y} known as the range of f .

{\displaystyle f.} Applications of inclusion maps [ edit ] Inclusion maps tend to be homomorphisms of algebraic structures ; thus, such inclusion maps are embeddings .  More precisely, given a substructure closed under some operations, the inclusion map will be an embedding for tautological reasons. For example, for some binary operation ⋆ ⋆ , {\displaystyle \star ,} to require that ι ι ( x ⋆ ⋆ y ) = ι ι ( x ) ⋆ ⋆ ι ι ( y ) {\displaystyle \iota (x\star y)=\iota (x)\star \iota (y)} is simply to say that ⋆ ⋆ {\displaystyle \star } is consistently computed in the sub-structure and the large structure. The case of a unary operation is similar; but one should also look at nullary operations, which pick out a constant element. Here the point is that closure means such constants must already be given in the substructure.

Inclusion maps are seen in algebraic topology where if A {\displaystyle A} is a strong deformation retract of X , {\displaystyle X,} the inclusion map yields an isomorphism between all homotopy groups (that is, it is a homotopy equivalence ).

Inclusion maps in geometry come in different kinds: for example embeddings of submanifolds .

Contravariant objects (which is to say, objects that have pullbacks ; these are called covariant in an older and unrelated terminology) such as differential forms restrict to submanifolds, giving a mapping in the other direction . Another example, more sophisticated, is that of affine schemes , for which the inclusions Spec ⁡ ⁡ ( R / I ) → → Spec ⁡ ⁡ ( R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} \left(R/I\right)\to \operatorname {Spec} (R)} and Spec ⁡ ⁡ ( R / I 2 ) → → Spec ⁡ ⁡ ( R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} \left(R/I^{2}\right)\to \operatorname {Spec} (R)} may be different morphisms , where R {\displaystyle R} is a commutative ring and I {\displaystyle I} is an ideal of R .

Note that "insertion" is a function S → U and "inclusion" a relation S ⊂ U ; every inclusion relation gives rise to an insertion function.
