Number of independent parameters of a system In many scientific fields, the degrees of freedom of a system is the number of parameters of the system that may vary independently. For example, a point in the plane has two degrees of freedom for translation : its two coordinates ; a non-infinitesimal object on the plane might have additional degrees of freedoms related to its orientation .

In mathematics , this notion is formalized as the dimension of a manifold or an algebraic variety . When degrees of freedom is used instead of dimension , this usually means that the manifold or variety that models the system is only implicitly defined.
See: Degrees of freedom (mechanics) , number of independent motions that are allowed to the body or, in case of a mechanism made of several bodies, number of possible independent relative motions between the pieces of the mechanism Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry) , a term used in explaining dependence on parameters, or the dimensions of a phase space Degrees of freedom (statistics) , the number of values in the final calculation of a statistic that are free to vary Degrees of freedom problem , the problem of controlling motor movement given abundant degrees of freedom See also [ edit ] Look up degrees of freedom in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
