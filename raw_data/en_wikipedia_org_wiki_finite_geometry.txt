Finite affine plane of order 2, containing 4 "points" and 6 "lines". Lines of the same color are "parallel". The centre of the figure is not a "point" of this affine plane, hence the two green "lines" don't "intersect".

A **finite geometry** is any [geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") system that has only a [finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set") number of [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)"). The familiar [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") is not finite, because a Euclidean line contains infinitely many points. A geometry based on the graphics displayed on a computer screen, where the [pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel "Pixel") are considered to be the points, would be a finite geometry. While there are many systems that could be called finite geometries, attention is mostly paid to the finite [projective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space") and [affine spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") because of their regularity and simplicity. Other significant types of finite geometry are finite [Möbius or inversive planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_plane "Möbius plane") and [Laguerre planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguerre_plane "Laguerre plane"), which are examples of a general type called [Benz planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benz_plane "Benz plane"), and their higher-dimensional analogs such as higher finite [inversive geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversive_geometry "Inversive geometry").

Finite geometries may be constructed via [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), starting from [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over a [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field"); the affine and [projective planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane") so constructed are called [Galois geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_geometry "Galois geometry"). Finite geometries can also be defined purely axiomatically. Most common finite geometries are Galois geometries, since any finite [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space") of dimension three or greater is [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") to a projective space over a finite field (that is, the projectivization of a vector space over a finite field). However, dimension two has affine and projective planes that are not isomorphic to Galois geometries, namely the [non-Desarguesian planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Desarguesian_plane "Non-Desarguesian plane"). Similar results hold for other kinds of finite geometries.

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Hesse_configuration.svg/250px-Hesse_configuration.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hesse_configuration.svg)

Finite affine plane of order 3, containing 9 points and 12 lines.

The following remarks apply only to finite _planes_. There are two main kinds of finite plane geometry: [affine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry") and [projective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"). In an [affine plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane_(incidence_geometry) "Affine plane (incidence geometry)"), the normal sense of [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)") lines applies. In a [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"), by contrast, any two lines intersect at a unique point, so parallel lines do not exist. Both finite affine plane geometry and finite projective plane geometry may be described by fairly simple [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom").

### Finite affine planes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite_geometry&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Finite affine planes")]

An affine plane geometry is a nonempty set _X_ (whose elements are called "points"), along with a nonempty collection _L_ of subsets of _X_ (whose elements are called "lines"), such that:

1.   For every two distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains both points.
2.   [Playfair's axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom "Playfair's axiom"): Given a line ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \ell }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f066e981e530bacc07efc6a10fa82deee985929e) and a point ![Image 4: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36) not on ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \ell }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f066e981e530bacc07efc6a10fa82deee985929e), there exists exactly one line ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \ell '}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e4ca3ab4273b8b72330f39cf858c6755d9dbf28) containing ![Image 7: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36) such that ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \ell \cap \ell '=\varnothing .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/960298a639ad3f93e23d5d3254faec0e468df75d)
3.   There exists a set of four points, no three of which belong to the same line.

The last axiom ensures that the geometry is not _trivial_ (either [empty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set "Empty set") or too simple to be of interest, such as a single line with an arbitrary number of points on it), while the first two specify the nature of the geometry.

The simplest affine plane contains only four points; it is called the _affine plane of order_ 2. (The order of an affine plane is the number of points on any line, see below.) Since no three are collinear, any pair of points determines a unique line, and so this plane contains six lines. It corresponds to a tetrahedron where non-intersecting edges are considered "parallel", or a square where not only opposite sides, but also diagonals are considered "parallel".

The affine plane of order 3 is known as the [Hesse configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesse_configuration "Hesse configuration").

More generally, a finite affine plane of order _n_ has _n_ 2 points and _n_ 2 + _n_ lines; each line contains _n_ points, and each point is on _n_ + 1 lines.

### Finite projective planes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite_geometry&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Finite projective planes")]

A projective plane geometry is a nonempty set _X_ (whose elements are called "points"), along with a nonempty collection _L_ of subsets of _X_ (whose elements are called "lines"), such that:

1.   For every two distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains both points.
2.   The intersection of any two distinct lines contains exactly one point.
3.   There exists a set of four points, no three of which belong to the same line.

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Fano_plane_Hasse_diagram.svg/250px-Fano_plane_Hasse_diagram.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fano_plane_Hasse_diagram.svg)

Duality in the [Fano plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane "Fano plane"): Each point corresponds to a line and vice versa.

An examination of the first two axioms shows that they are nearly identical, except that the roles of points and lines have been interchanged. This suggests the principle of [duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(mathematics)#Dimension-reversing_dualities "Duality (mathematics)") for projective plane geometries, meaning that any true statement valid in all these geometries remains true if we exchange points for lines and lines for points. The smallest geometry satisfying all three axioms contains seven points. In this simplest of the projective planes, there are also seven lines; each point is on three lines, and each line contains three points.

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Fano_plane.svg/250px-Fano_plane.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fano_plane.svg)

The [Fano plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane "Fano plane")

This particular projective plane is sometimes called the **[Fano plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane "Fano plane")**. If any of the lines is removed from the plane, along with the points on that line, the resulting geometry is the affine plane of order 2. The Fano plane is called **the**_projective plane of order_ 2 because it is unique (up to isomorphism). In general, the projective plane of order _n_ has _n_ 2+_n_+1 points and the same number of lines; each line contains _n_+1 points, and each point is on _n_+1 lines.

A permutation of the Fano plane's seven points that carries [collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(geometry) "Incidence (geometry)") points (points on the same line) to collinear points is called a [collineation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collineation "Collineation") of the plane. The full [collineation group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collineation_group "Collineation group") is of order 168 and is isomorphic to the group [PSL(2,7)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSL(2,7) "PSL(2,7)") ≈ PSL(3,2), which in this special case is also isomorphic to the [general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group")GL(3,2) ≈ PGL(3,2).

A finite plane of **order**_n_ is one such that each line has _n_ points (for an affine plane), or such that each line has _n_ + 1 points (for a projective plane). One major open question in finite geometry is:

_Is the order of a finite plane always a prime power?_
This is conjectured to be true.

Affine and projective planes of order _n_ exist whenever _n_ is a [prime power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_power "Prime power") (a [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number") raised to a [positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_number "Positive number")[integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer")[exponent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponent "Exponent")), by using affine and projective planes over the finite field with _n_ = _p_ _k_ elements. Planes not derived from finite fields also exist (e.g. for ![Image 11: {\displaystyle n=9}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b1029ce8384fde9f4da54009c5a79f17a9758085)), but all known examples have order a prime power.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry#cite_note-1)

The best general result to date is the [Bruck–Ryser theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruck%E2%80%93Ryser_theorem "Bruck–Ryser theorem") of 1949, which states:

If _n_ is a [positive integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_integer "Positive integer") of the form 4 _k_ + 1 or 4 _k_ + 2 and _n_ is not equal to the sum of two integer [squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(algebra) "Square (algebra)"), then _n_ does not occur as the order of a finite plane.
The smallest integer that is not a prime power and not covered by the Bruck–Ryser theorem is 10; 10 is of the form 4 _k_ + 2, but it is equal to the sum of squares 1 2 + 3 2. The non-existence of a finite plane of order 10 was proven in a [computer-assisted proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_proof "Computer-assisted proof") that finished in 1989 – see ([Lam 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry#CITEREFLam1991)) for details.

The next smallest number to consider is 12, for which neither a positive nor a negative result has been proved.

Individual examples can be found in the work of [Thomas Penyngton Kirkman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Penyngton_Kirkman "Thomas Penyngton Kirkman") (1847) and the systematic development of finite projective geometry given by [von Staudt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Georg_Christian_von_Staudt "Karl Georg Christian von Staudt") (1856).

The first axiomatic treatment of finite projective geometry was developed by the [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians "Italians") mathematician [Gino Fano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gino_Fano "Gino Fano"). In his work[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry#cite_note-2) on proving the independence of the set of axioms for [projective _n_-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space") that he developed,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry#cite_note-3) he considered a finite three dimensional space with 15 points, 35 lines and 15 planes (see diagram), in which each line had only three points on it.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry#cite_note-4)

In 1906 [Oswald Veblen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Veblen "Oswald Veblen") and W. H. Bussey described [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry") using [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates "Homogeneous coordinates") with entries from the [Galois field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_field "Galois field") GF(_q_). When _n_ + 1 coordinates are used, the _n_-dimensional finite geometry is denoted PG(_n, q_).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry#cite_note-5) It arises in [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry") and has an associated transformation [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)").

Finite spaces of 3 or more dimensions
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite_geometry&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Finite spaces of 3 or more dimensions")]

For some important differences between finite _plane_ geometry and the geometry of higher-dimensional finite spaces, see [axiomatic projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_projective_space "Axiomatic projective space"). For a discussion of higher-dimensional finite spaces in general, see, for instance, the works of [J.W.P. Hirschfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_William_Peter_Hirschfeld "James William Peter Hirschfeld"). The study of these higher-dimensional spaces (n ≥ 3) has many important applications in advanced mathematical theories.

### Axiomatic definition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite_geometry&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Axiomatic definition")]

A **projective space**_S_ can be defined axiomatically as a set _P_ (the set of points), together with a set _L_ of subsets of _P_ (the set of lines), satisfying these axioms:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry#cite_note-6)

*   Each two distinct points _p_ and _q_ are in exactly one line.
*   [Veblen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Veblen "Oswald Veblen")'s axiom:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry#cite_note-7) If _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ are distinct points and the lines through _ab_ and _cd_ meet, then so do the lines through _ac_ and _bd_.
*   Any line has at least 3 points on it.

The last axiom eliminates reducible cases that can be written as a disjoint union of projective spaces together with 2-point lines joining any two points in distinct projective spaces. More abstractly, it can be defined as an [incidence structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_structure "Incidence structure")(_P_, _L_, _I_) consisting of a set _P_ of points, a set _L_ of lines, and an [incidence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_relation "Incidence relation")_I_ stating which points lie on which lines.

Obtaining a _finite_ projective space requires one more axiom:

*   The set of points _P_ is a finite set.

In any finite projective space, each line contains the same number of points and the _order_ of the space is defined as one less than this common number.

A subspace of the projective space is a subset _X_, such that any line containing two points of _X_ is a subset of _X_ (that is, completely contained in _X_). The full space and the empty space are always subspaces.

The _geometric dimension_ of the space is said to be _n_ if that is the largest number for which there is a strictly ascending chain of subspaces of this form:

![Image 12: {\displaystyle \varnothing =X_{-1}\subset X_{0}\subset \cdots \subset X_{n}=P.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/83339c4f7dcd01f379aa7a9b0ec3d78a67934be1)

### Algebraic construction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite_geometry&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Algebraic construction")]

A standard algebraic construction of systems satisfies these axioms. For a [division ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_ring "Division ring")_D_ construct an (_n_ + 1)-dimensional vector space over _D_ (vector space dimension is the number of elements in a basis). Let _P_ be the 1-dimensional (single generator) subspaces and _L_ the 2-dimensional (two independent generators) subspaces (closed under vector addition) of this vector space. Incidence is containment. If _D_ is finite then it must be a [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field") GF(_q_), since by [Wedderburn's little theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedderburn%27s_little_theorem "Wedderburn's little theorem") all finite division rings are fields. In this case, this construction produces a finite projective space. Furthermore, if the geometric dimension of a projective space is at least three then there is a division ring from which the space can be constructed in this manner. Consequently, all finite projective spaces of geometric dimension at least three are defined over finite fields. A finite projective space defined over such a finite field has _q_ + 1 points on a line, so the two concepts of order coincide. Such a finite projective space is denoted by PG(_n_, _q_), where PG stands for projective geometry, _n_ is the geometric dimension of the geometry and _q_ is the size (order) of the finite field used to construct the geometry.

In general, the number of _k_-dimensional subspaces of PG(_n_, _q_) is given by the product:[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry#cite_note-8)

![Image 13: {\displaystyle {{n+1} \choose {k+1}}_{q}=\prod _{i=0}^{k}{\frac {q^{n+1-i}-1}{q^{i+1}-1}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b062b2bafd337917407e6ed097db5f5b1c6bcff1)
which is a [Gaussian binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_binomial_coefficient "Gaussian binomial coefficient"), a _q_ analogue of a [binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient "Binomial coefficient").

### Classification of finite projective spaces by geometric dimension

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite_geometry&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Classification of finite projective spaces by geometric dimension")]

*   Dimension 0 (no lines): The space is a single point and is so degenerate that it is usually ignored.
*   Dimension 1 (exactly one line): All points lie on the unique line, called a _projective line_.
*   Dimension 2: There are at least 2 lines, and any two lines meet. A projective space for _n_ = 2 is a [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"). These are much harder to classify, as not all of them are isomorphic with a PG(_d_, _q_). The [Desarguesian planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desarguesian_plane "Desarguesian plane") (those that are isomorphic with a PG(2, _q_)) satisfy [Desargues's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues%27s_theorem "Desargues's theorem") and are projective planes over finite fields, but there are many [non-Desarguesian planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Desarguesian_plane "Non-Desarguesian plane").
*   Dimension at least 3: Two non-intersecting lines exist. The [Veblen–Young theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen%E2%80%93Young_theorem "Veblen–Young theorem") states in the finite case that every projective space of geometric dimension _n_ ≥ 3 is isomorphic with a PG(_n_, _q_), the _n_-dimensional projective space over some finite field GF(_q_).

### The smallest projective three-space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite_geometry&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: The smallest projective three-space")]

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Fano3space.png/250px-Fano3space.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fano3space.png)

PG(3,2) but not all the lines are drawn

The smallest 3-dimensional projective space is over the field [GF(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GF(2) "GF(2)") and is denoted by [PG(3,2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2) "PG(3,2)"). It has 15 points, 35 lines, and 15 planes. Each plane contains 7 points and 7 lines. Each line contains 3 points. As geometries, these planes are [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") to the [Fano plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane "Fano plane").

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/150614-PG-3-2-schoolgirls-arrangement.png/250px-150614-PG-3-2-schoolgirls-arrangement.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:150614-PG-3-2-schoolgirls-arrangement.png)

Square model of Fano 3-space

Every point is contained in 7 lines. Every pair of distinct points are contained in exactly one line and every pair of distinct planes intersects in exactly one line.

In 1892, [Gino Fano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gino_Fano "Gino Fano") was the first to consider such a finite geometry.

#### Kirkman's schoolgirl problem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite_geometry&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Kirkman's schoolgirl problem")]

PG(3,2) arises as the background for a solution of [Kirkman's schoolgirl problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkman%27s_schoolgirl_problem "Kirkman's schoolgirl problem"), which states: "Fifteen schoolgirls walk each day in five groups of three. Arrange the girls’ walk for a week so that in that time, each pair of girls walks together in a group just once." There are 35 different combinations for the girls to walk together. There are also 7 days of the week, and 3 girls in each group. Two of the seven non-isomorphic solutions to this problem can be stated in terms of structures in the Fano 3-space, PG(3,2), known as _packings_. A [spread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_(projective_geometry) "Spread (projective geometry)") of a projective space is a [partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(set_theory) "Partition (set theory)") of its points into disjoint lines, and a packing is a partition of the lines into disjoint spreads. In PG(3,2), a spread would be a partition of the 15 points into 5 disjoint lines (with 3 points on each line), thus corresponding to the arrangement of schoolgirls on a particular day. A packing of PG(3,2) consists of seven disjoint spreads and so corresponds to a full week of arrangements.
