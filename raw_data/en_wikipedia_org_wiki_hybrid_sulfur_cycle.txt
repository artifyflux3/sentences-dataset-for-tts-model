Based on sulfur oxidation and reduction , it is classified as a hybrid thermochemical cycle because it uses an electrochemical (instead of a thermochemical) reaction for one of the two steps. The remaining thermochemical step is shared with the sulfur-iodine cycle .

The Hybrid sulphur cycle (HyS)was initially proposed and developed by Westinghouse Electric Corp. in the 1970s, [ 1 ] so it is also known as the "Westinghouse" cycle. Current development efforts in the United States are being led by the Savannah River National Laboratory .

Process description [ edit ] The two reactions in the HyS cycle are as follows: [ 2 ] H 2 SO 4 (aq) → H 2 O (g) + SO 2 (g) + ½ O 2 (g) (thermochemical, T > 800 °C) SO 2 (aq) + 2 H 2 O (l) → H 2 SO 4 (aq) + H 2 (g) (electrochemical, T = 80-120 °C) Net reaction: H 2 O (l) → H 2 (g) + ½ O 2 (g) Sulfur dioxide acts to depolarize the anode of the electrolyzer . This results in a significant decrease in the reversible cell potential (and, therefore, the electric power requirement) for reaction (2). The standard cell potential for reaction (2) is -0.158 V at 298.15 K, compared to -1.229 V for the electrolysis of water (with oxygen evolution as the anodic reaction).
