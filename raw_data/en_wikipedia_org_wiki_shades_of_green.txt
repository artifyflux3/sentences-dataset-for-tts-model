Celadon originates as a term for a class of Chinese ceramics , copied by Korea and Japan. However, the name, which is European, may originate from the character Celadon in L'Astrée , a French pastoral novel of 1627, who wore a light green color.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Celadon glazes were very common, with the green color being reliably produced from about the tenth century onwards; this was appreciated in Asia for resembling jade , the most prestigious material of all. The glaze color comes from iron oxide 's transformation from ferric to ferrous iron (Fe 2 O 3 → FeO) during the firing process, [ 64 ] but is affected by a wide range of other factors and chemicals, making the precise color very difficult to control. As well as green, a wide range of browns, yellows, greys and sometimes blues all count as "celadon".

[ 86 ] The first recorded use of rifle green as a color name in English was in 1858.

[ 87 ] Rifle green is so named from the distinctive color of the uniform of rifle regiments (a form of light infantry ) of a number of European armies, and is still used as such by rifle regiments in many Commonwealth armies, such as the Rifles and Royal Gurkha Rifles of the British Army and the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada .

John Fitzgerald Kennedy , escorted by a Bermuda Militia Artillery officer in Royal Artillery blue No. 1 dress, inspects green-uniformed riflemen of the Bermuda Rifles in 1961 Rifle green was originally adopted by rifle regiments in the 18th century, including the famous 95th Rifles of the Napoleonic Wars . As the traditional role of riflemen was that of marksmen and skirmishers who attacked behind the cover of trees, a dark green uniform was adopted as an early form of camouflage , as opposed to the colorful uniforms worn by other soldiers of the period. The vegetable based dyes used during the 18th and early 19th centuries were not fast , frequently fading after exposure to the elements to lighter shades of green or even brown. While this had advantages in terms of reduced visibility on active service, it did not make for a smart appearance on the peace-time parade ground. Accordingly, the color of the rifleman's uniform was progressively darkened until it approached black. After 1890 the development of chemical dyes permitted the adoption of the stable shade of rifle green now worn. In the U.S. armed forces, the green beret may be worn only by soldiers awarded the Special Forces Tab, signifying they have been qualified as special forces soldiers. The special forces beret is officially designated "beret, man's, wool, rifle green, army shade 297". Previously, rifle green uniforms had been issued to Hiram Berdan 's elite 1st and 2nd United States Sharpshooters during the American Civil War .

Rifle green was the official uniform colour of the Canadian Forces (CF) after unification; it was thereafter generally referred to as "CF green". After the introduction of the distinctive environmental uniform (DEU), rifle green remained as the uniform colour of the winter land environment DEU; a short-lived tan uniform was worn in summer. After the demise of the tans, the rifle green DEU was worn year-round. Rifle green was also the colour of the uniform worn by the Northern Irish Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) until 2001 where the RUC was renamed the PSNI and while the uniform color remained the same, terminology changed to "bottle green".

[ 88 ] Rifle green is 19–0419 TPX in the Pantone palette, or hex code #444C38 in the sRGB color space, as shown above. Despite being referred to as bottle green in some contexts, Pantone rifle green is a distinct shade from RAL 6007 Bottle green .
