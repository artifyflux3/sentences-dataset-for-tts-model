Find sources: "Woo circles" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( May 2024 ) Two of infinitely many Woo circles (green) all have the center on the Schoch line (cyan) In geometry , the Woo circles , introduced by Peter Y. Woo,  are a set of infinitely many Archimedean circles .

Construction [ edit ] Form an arbelos with the two inner semicircles tangent at point C . Let m denote any nonnegative real number . Draw two circles, with radii m times the radii of the smaller two arbelos semicircles, centered on the arbelos ground line, also tangent to each other at point C and with radius m times the radius of the corresponding small arbelos arc. Any circle centered on the Schoch line and externally tangent to the circles is a Woo circle.
