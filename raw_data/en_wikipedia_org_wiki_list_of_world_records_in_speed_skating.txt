However, the race had a so-called 'quartet-start' (four riders on the track at the same time as opposed to the usual two), making it ineligible to be counted as a world record under Article 221(2)(i) of the rules of the International Skating Union . Several skaters have recorded 3000m split times below 3:37.28 during a 5000m race, including Sven Kramer as early as November 17, 2007 , but split times do not count as world records either.

** The average speed for the team pursuit race was calculated using a distance of 3098,88 meters for the men's race.

[ 14 ] The skaters only utilize the inner lane and the lap distance is accordingly less than the 400 meters of a regular lap skated with one inner curve and one outer curve. For comparison, the fastest known 400m lap was skated by Jenning de Boo on 25 January 2025 in Salt Lake City during a 1000-meter, with a lap time of 23.92 seconds and an average speed of 60.20 km/h (37.41 mph).

[ 14 ] The skaters only utilize the inner lane and the lap distance is accordingly less than the 400 meters of a regular lap skated with one inner curve and one outer curve. For comparison, the fastest known 400m lap was skated by Zhang Hong during a 500m race in Salt Lake City on 20 November 2015, with a lap time of 25.93 seconds and an average speed of 55.51 km/h (34.49 mph).

[ 15 ] *** unofficial world best (not recognized as a world record by ISU) Mixed [ edit ] Event Name Country Time Date Place Average speed Meeting Ref Mixed Gender Relay Sun Chuanyi Jin Wenjing China 2:54.90 28 January 2024 Salt Lake City 2023–24 World Cup [ 29 ] Sea-level world bests [ edit ] Salt Lake City and Calgary, where most of the current world records were set (see above), are at comparatively high altitudes (greater than 1 km above sea level). Performance is better at these high altitudes because the lower oxygen levels are compensated by the reduced air resistance.

[ 30 ] Skating statisticians therefore record separate lists of "sea-level world bests" for speed skating records that are set at (or close to) sea level, from which results in Salt Lake City and Calgary are excluded.
