[ 1 ] It was first produced by a number of Neo-Attic workshops at Athens , [ 2 ] which began to specialize in it, producing works for purchase by Roman connoisseurs, and was taken up in Rome, probably by Greek artisans.

The Neo-Attic mode, a reaction against the baroque extravagances of Hellenistic art, [ 3 ] was an early manifestation of Neoclassicism , which demonstrates how self-conscious the later Hellenistic art world had become. Neo-Attic style emphasises grace and charm, serenity and animation, [ 4 ] correctness of taste in adapting a reduced canon of prototypical figures and forms, in crisp and refined execution.

This style designation was introduced by the German classical archaeologist and art historian Friedrich Hauser (1859-1917), in Die Neuattischen Reliefs (Stuttgart: Verlag von Konrad Wittwer, 1889). The corpus that Hauser called "Neo-Attic" consists of bas-reliefs molded on decorative vessels and plaques, employing a figural and drapery style that looked for its canon of "classic" models to late fifth and early fourth-century Athens and Attica.

^ Gisela Richter praised the serenity and animation of a neo-Attic marble vase, ca. first century BC-first century AD, purchased for the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Richter, "A Neo-Attic Marble Vase" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 19 .1 (January 1924:10-13), calling the phase "a period of good taste rather than creative ability" (p. 11).
