 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

ESA research program investigating the effects of space environment on biological material

Experiment BIOPAN-5 part of the Foton-M2 mission

**BIOPAN** is a multi-user research program by the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") (ESA) designed to investigate the effect of the space environment on biological material.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOPAN#cite_note-Kayser-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOPAN#cite_note-Experimental_methods-2) The experiments in BIOPAN are exposed to [solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolation "Insolation") and [cosmic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray"), the space vacuum and weightlessness, or a selection thereof. Optionally, the experiment temperature can be stabilized. BIOPAN hosts [astrobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology "Astrobiology"), [radiobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology "Radiobiology") and materials science experiments.

The BIOPAN facility is installed on the external surface of Russian [Foton descent capsules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foton_(space_programs) "Foton (space programs)") protruding from the thermal blanket that envelops the satellite.

Design and features
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BIOPAN&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Design and features")]

The BIOPAN program started in the early nineties with an ESA contract for the a joint development by [Kayser-Threde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayser-Threde "Kayser-Threde") and [Kayser Italia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kayser_Italia&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kayser Italia (page does not exist)"). It was based on the heritage of a low-tech Russian exposure container called KNA (_Kontejner Nauchnoj Apparatury_). The BIOPAN facilities are installed on the external surface of [Foton descent capsules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foton_(space_programs) "Foton (space programs)"). It has a motor-driven hinged lid, which opens 180° in Earth orbit to expose the experiment samples to the harsh space environment. For [re-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry "Atmospheric entry"), the closed facility is protected with an [Ablative heat shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablative_heat_shield#Ablative "Ablative heat shield").

The BIOPAN facilities are equipped with thermometers, [UV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") sensors, a [radiometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometer "Radiometer"), a pressure sensor and an active radiation [dosimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimeter "Dosimeter"). Data acquired by the sensors is stored by BIOPAN throughout each mission and can be accessed after flight.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOPAN#cite_note-Kayser-1) The possibility of overheating during atmospheric re-entry was acknowledged early during the development, therefore, a quite massive heat shield was designed for it. While the total weight of BIOPAN is close to 27 kg, including the experiments, the heat shield is responsible for 12 kg of that figure.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOPAN#cite_note-Horneck-3)

The BIOPAN electronics consists of the following units: signal acquisition board, microcontroller board with its flight software, memory board and [EGSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telespazio_VEGA_Deutschland "Telespazio VEGA Deutschland").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOPAN#cite_note-Kayser-1)
