Play ⓘ Downmajor scale on C in 15 equal temperament.

Play ⓘ Major chord (parsimonious trichord [ 2 ] ) on C in 15 equal temperament: all notes within 18 cents of just intonation (rather than 14 for 12 equal temperament).

Play 15-et ⓘ , Play just ⓘ , or Play 12-et ⓘ In music, 15 equal temperament , called 15-TET, 15- EDO , or 15-ET, is a tempered scale derived by dividing the octave into 15 equal steps (equal frequency ratios). Each step represents a frequency ratio of 15 √ 2 (=2 (1/15) ), or 80 cents ( Play ⓘ ).  Because 15 factors into 3 times 5, it can be seen as being made up of three scales of 5 equal divisions of the octave, each of which resembles the Slendro scale in Indonesian gamelan . 15 equal temperament is not a meantone system.

History and use [ edit ] Guitars have been constructed for 15-ET tuning.  The American musician Wendy Carlos used 15-ET as one of two scales in the track Afterlife from the album Tales of Heaven and Hell .

[ 3 ] Easley Blackwood, Jr.

has written and recorded a suite for 15-ET guitar.

[ 4 ] Blackwood believes that 15 equal temperament, "is likely to bring about a considerable enrichment of both classical and popular repertoire in a variety of styles".

[ 5 ] Notation [ edit ] Easley Blackwood, Jr.

's notation of 15-EDO creates this chromatic scale: B ♯ /C, C ♯ /D ♭ , D, D ♯ , E ♭ , E, E ♯ /F, F ♯ /G ♭ , G, G ♯ , A ♭ , A, A ♯ , B ♭ , B, B ♯ /C Ups and Downs Notation uses up and down arrows, written as a caret and a lower-case "v", usually in a sans-serif font. One arrow equals one edostep. In note names, the arrows come first, to facilitate chord naming. This yields this chromatic scale: B/C, ^C/^D ♭ , vC ♯ /vD, D, ^D/^E ♭ , vD ♯ /vE, E/F, ^F/^G ♭ , vF ♯ /vG, G, ^G/^A ♭ , vG ♯ /vA, A, ^A/^B ♭ , vA ♯ /vB, B/C Chords are spelled differently. C–E ♭ –G is technically a C minor chord, but in fact it sounds like a sus2 chord C–D–G. The usual minor chord with 6/5 is the up minor chord. It's spelled as C–^E ♭ –G and named as C^m. Compare with ^Cm (^C–^E ♭ –^G).

Likewise the usual major chord with 5/4 is actually a down major chord. It's spelled as C–vE–G and named as Cv.

Porcupine Notation significantly changes chord spellings (e.g. the major triad is now C–E♯–G♯). In addition, enharmonic equivalences from 12-EDO are no longer valid. It yields the following chromatic scale: C, C ♯ /D ♭ , D, D ♯ /E ♭ , E, E ♯ /F ♭ , F, F ♯ /G ♭ , G, G ♯ , A ♭ , A, A ♯ /B ♭ , B, B ♯ , C One possible decatonic notation uses the digits 0-9. Each of the 3 circles of 5 fifths is notated either by the odd numbers, the even numbers, or with accidentals.

1, 1 ♯ /2 ♭ , 2, 3, 3 ♯ /4 ♭ , 4, 5, 5 ♯ /6 ♭ , 6, 7, 7 ♯ /8 ♭ , 8, 9, 9 ♯ /0 ♭ , 0, 1 In this article, unless specified otherwise, Blackwood's notation will be used.

The perfect fifth is more out of tune than in 12-ET , 19-ET , or 22-ET , and the major third in 15-ET is the same as the major third in 12-ET, but the other intervals matched are more in tune (except for the septimal tritones ).  15-ET is the smallest tuning that matches the 11th harmonic at all and still has a usable perfect fifth, but its match to intervals utilizing the 11th harmonic is poorer than 22-ET , which also has more in-tune fifths and major thirds.

Although it contains a perfect fifth as well as major and minor thirds, the remainder of the harmonic and melodic language of 15-ET is quite different from 12-ET, and thus 15-ET could be described as xenharmonic .  Unlike 12-ET and 19-ET, 15-ET matches the 11:8 and 16:11 ratios.  15-ET also has a neutral second and septimal whole tone . To construct a major third in 15-ET, one must stack two intervals of different sizes, whereas one can divide both the minor third and perfect fourth into two equal intervals.

Further subdivisions [ edit ] 45 equal temperament [ edit ] 45 equal temperament, which has a step size of 26.67 cents, is a threefold subdivision of 15 equal temperament. It has a perfect fifth of 693.33 cents, which is quite flat, but is still more accurate than the 720-cent fifth of 15-ET. Its best major third is 373.33 cents, which is slightly more accurate than the 400-cent one.

45-ET is an important example of a flattone temperament. Thus, it tempers out the syntonic comma like meantone temperaments do, but has a different mapping for intervals involving the seventh harmonic. Ordinarily, in meantone temperaments the 7:4 ratio is equated with the augmented sixth, whereas in 45-ET, this interval is instead equated with the diminished seventh, due to the smaller size of the chroma . This makes pieces involving chromatic alterations sound quite different.

45-ET is practically equivalent to an extended 2/5-comma meantone. Although it is harmonically less accurate than meantone temperaments like 31-ET or 19-ET , having a flatter fifth than both, it is still more accurate than 12-ET.

[ 6 ] 105 equal temperament [ edit ] 105 equal temperament (a sevenfold division of 15-ET) gives a meantone temperament with a fifth of 697.14 cents. It has a chromatic semitone equal to 80 cents, one step of 15-ET.

[ 7 ] 270 equal temperament [ edit ] 270 equal temperament does not see as much practical use as it is an extremely fine equal division with a step size of 4.44 cents, eighteen of which make up one step of 15-ET. Nonetheless, it is of academic interest due to being exceptionally accurate for an equal temperament of its size, particularly in the 15 odd limit.
