Davie, Michael Smith and Benjamin D. Hall Headquarters Lake Union Steam Plant Building, 1201 Eastlake Avenue East, Seattle , Washington, USA Key people Stephanie Feldt Products Pharmaceuticals Owner Bristol-Myers Squibb Website Archived website ZymoGenetics, Inc was one of the oldest biotechnology / pharmaceutical companies in the USA, [ 1 ] based in Seattle , Washington . The company was involved in the development of therapeutic proteins . Located on Lake Union , the address of the ZymoGenetics headquarters was 1201 Eastlake Avenue East.

[ 2 ] It was closed in 2019 after its acquisition by Bristol Myers Squibb.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The company was founded in 1981 [ 5 ] by Professors Earl W. Davie and Benjamin D. Hall of the University of Washington and 1993 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry Michael Smith of the University of British Columbia .

[ 2 ] Initially named Zymos , [ 6 ] the company was forced to change its name to ZymoGenetics under threat of trademark infringement from the similarly named semiconductor company ZyMOS .

[ 7 ] Soon after its founding, ZymoGenetics began working on recombinant proteins with Danish company Novo Nordisk , and was acquired by that company in 1988.

[ 8 ] It was spun off as a public company in 2000.

[ 1 ] Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired the company in 2010 for $885 million.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] ZymoGenetics' headquarters occupied the landmark Lake Union Steam Plant building beginning in the mid-1990s.

[ 11 ] This structure was built from 1914 to 1921 by Seattle City Light , the municipal electric utility .

[ 12 ] At the time, the building was in poor condition with many broken windows; Bruce Carter, the chief executive at the time, described it as "the mother of all fixer-uppers".

[ 13 ] In December 2016, ZymoGenetics announced that they would not renew the lease to the Steam Plant building, due to expire in 2019; [ 14 ] the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center later moved into it.

[ 15 ] At the time, ZymoGenetics did not plan on closing its Bothell manufacturing site; [ 14 ] however, it was sold to Seattle Genetics in August 2017.

[ 16 ] ZymoGenetics closed completely in 2019.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Corporate governance [ edit ] In late 2013, the company's president , Stephen W. Zaruby, left and took up the president and chief executive officer roles at Aurinia Pharmaceuticals.
