Linguistic entailments are entailments which arise in natural language . If a sentence A entails a sentence B , sentence A cannot be true without B being true as well.

[ 1 ] For instance, the English sentence "Pat is a fluffy cat" entails the sentence "Pat is a cat" since one cannot be a fluffy cat without being a cat. On the other hand, this sentence does not entail "Pat chases mice" since it is possible (if unlikely) for a cat to not chase mice.

Entailments arise from the semantics of linguistic expressions.

[ 2 ] Entailment contrasts with the pragmatic notion of implicature . While implicatures are fallible inferences, entailments are enforced by lexical meanings plus the laws of logic.

[ 3 ] Entailments also differ from presuppositions , whose truth is taken for granted. The classic example of a presupposition is the existence presupposition which arises from definite descriptions . For example, the sentence "The king of France is bald" presupposes that there is a king of France. Unlike an entailment, presuppositions survive when the sentence is negated. The negation test can be used to determine the difference between entailment and presupposition.

[ 4 ] For instance, "The king of France is not bald" likewise presupposes that there is a king of France.
