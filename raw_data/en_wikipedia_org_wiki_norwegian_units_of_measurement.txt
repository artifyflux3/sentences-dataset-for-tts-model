The 60-Norwegian-feet-long Kvalsund ship (18.8 m; 61.8 ft) was built ca. 700 AD and differs from the Danish boats less than it does from the Oseberg , Gokstad and Tune ships which all date from ca. 800 AD. Thwarts are typically spaced about 3 Norwegian feet (0.94 m; 3.1 ft) apart.

[ 1 ] In 1541, an alen in Denmark and Norway was defined by law to be the Sjælland alen . Subsequently, the alen was defined by law as 2 Rhine feet from 1683. From 1824, the basic unit was defined as a fot being derived from astronomy as the length of a one-second pendulum times 12/38 at a latitude of 45°. The metric system was introduced in Norway in 1875 , with Norway being one of the original signatories of the meter convention .

Another old land-mile, 11.824 km. The unit survives to this day, but in a metric 10 km adaptation rast –lit. "rest", the old name of the mil . A suitable distance between rests when walking.
