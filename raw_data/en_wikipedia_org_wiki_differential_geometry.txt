A triangle immersed in a saddle-shape plane (a [hyperbolic paraboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_paraboloid "Hyperbolic paraboloid")), as well as two diverging [ultraparallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#Non-intersecting_/_parallel_lines "Hyperbolic geometry")

**Differential geometry** is a [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") discipline that studies the [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") of smooth shapes and smooth spaces, otherwise known as [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold"). It uses the techniques of [single variable calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"), [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus "Vector calculus"), [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") and [multilinear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_algebra "Multilinear algebra"). The field has its origins in the study of [spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry") as far back as [antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"). It also relates to [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), the [geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy "Geodesy") of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), and later the study of [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry") by [Lobachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Lobachevsky "Nikolai Lobachevsky"). The simplest examples of smooth spaces are the [plane and space curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_curves "Differential geometry of curves") and [surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces "Differential geometry of surfaces") in the three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), and the study of these shapes formed the basis for development of modern differential geometry during the 18th and 19th centuries.

Since the late 19th century, differential geometry has grown into a field concerned more generally with geometric structures on [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"). A geometric structure is one which defines some notion of size, distance, shape, volume, or other rigidifying structure. For example, in [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry") distances and angles are specified, in [symplectic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry "Symplectic geometry") volumes may be computed, in [conformal geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_geometry "Conformal geometry") only angles are specified, and in [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory_(mathematics) "Gauge theory (mathematics)") certain [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field "Tensor field") are given over the space. Differential geometry is closely related to, and is sometimes taken to include, [differential topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology "Differential topology"), which concerns itself with properties of differentiable manifolds that do not rely on any additional geometric structure (see that article for more discussion on the distinction between the two subjects). Differential geometry is also related to the geometric aspects of the theory of [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation"), otherwise known as [geometric analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_analysis "Geometric analysis").

Differential geometry finds applications throughout mathematics and the [natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science"). Most prominently the language of differential geometry was used by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") in his [theory of general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_general_relativity "Theory of general relativity"), and subsequently by [physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicists "Physicists") in the development of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") and the [standard model of particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_model_of_particle_physics "Standard model of particle physics"). Outside of physics, differential geometry finds applications in [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory "Control theory"), [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics") and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision"), and recently in [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning").

History and development
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History and development")]

The history and development of differential geometry as a subject begins at least as far back as [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"). It is intimately linked to the development of geometry more generally, of the notion of space and shape, and of [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"), especially the study of [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"). In this section we focus primarily on the history of the application of [infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") methods to geometry, and later to the ideas of [tangent spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space"), and eventually the development of the modern formalism of the subject in terms of [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") and [tensor fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field "Tensor field").

### Classical antiquity until the Renaissance (300 BC– 1600 AD)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Classical antiquity until the Renaissance (300 BC – 1600 AD)")]

The study of differential geometry, or at least the study of the geometry of smooth shapes, can be traced back at least to [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"). In particular, much was known about the geometry of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), a [spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry"), in the time of the [ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") mathematicians. Famously, [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes "Eratosthenes") calculated the [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference "Circumference") of the Earth around 200 BC, and around 150 AD [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") in his _[Geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography\_(Ptolemy) "Geography (Ptolemy)")_ introduced the [stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection "Stereographic projection") for the purposes of mapping the shape of the Earth.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-struik1-1) Implicitly throughout this time principles that form the foundation of differential geometry and calculus were used in [geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy "Geodesy"), although in a much simplified form. Namely, as far back as [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s _[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_ it was understood that a straight line could be defined by its property of providing the shortest distance between two points, and applying this same principle to the surface of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") leads to the conclusion that [great circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circles "Great circles"), which are only locally similar to straight lines in a flat plane, provide the shortest path between two points on the Earth's surface. Indeed, the measurements of distance along such [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") paths by Eratosthenes and others can be considered a rudimentary measure of [arclength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arclength "Arclength") of curves, a concept which did not see a rigorous definition in terms of calculus until the 1600s.

Around this time there were only minimal overt applications of the theory of [infinitesimals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") to the study of geometry, a precursor to the modern calculus-based study of the subject. In [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s _[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_ the notion of [tangency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangency "Tangency") of a line to a circle is discussed, and [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") applied the [method of exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion "Method of exhaustion") to compute the areas of smooth shapes such as the [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), and the volumes of smooth three-dimensional solids such as the sphere, cones, and cylinders.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-struik1-1)

There was little development in the theory of differential geometry between antiquity and the beginning of the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance"). Before the development of calculus by [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz "Leibniz"), the most significant development in the understanding of differential geometry came from [Gerardus Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator "Gerardus Mercator")'s development of the [Mercator projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection "Mercator projection") as a way of mapping the Earth. Mercator had an understanding of the advantages and pitfalls of his map design, and in particular was aware of the [conformal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map_projection "Conformal map projection") nature of his projection, as well as the difference between _praga_, the lines of shortest distance on the Earth, and the _directio_, the straight line paths on his map. Mercator noted that the praga were _oblique curvatur_ in this projection.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-struik1-1) This fact reflects the lack of a [metric-preserving map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry") of the Earth's surface onto a flat plane, a consequence of the later [Theorema Egregium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_Egregium "Theorema Egregium") of [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss "Gauss").

### After calculus (1600–1800)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: After calculus (1600–1800)")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Osculating_circle.svg/250px-Osculating_circle.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Osculating_circle.svg)

An osculating circle of plane curve

The first systematic or rigorous treatment of geometry using the theory of infinitesimals and notions from [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") began around the 1600s when calculus was first developed by [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz") and [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"). At this time, the recent work of [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") introducing [analytic coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry") to geometry allowed geometric shapes of increasing complexity to be described rigorously. In particular around this time [Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat "Pierre de Fermat"), Newton, and Leibniz began the study of [plane curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_curve "Plane curve") and the investigation of concepts such as points of [inflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_point "Inflection point") and circles of [osculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osculating_circle "Osculating circle"), which aid in the measurement of [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature"). Indeed, already in his [first paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Methodus_pro_Maximis_et_Minimis "Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis") on the foundations of calculus, Leibniz notes that the infinitesimal condition ![Image 3: {\displaystyle d^{2}y=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f01fe3065b9d665931235d76de8ecc22fcf9134a) indicates the existence of an inflection point. Shortly after this time the [Bernoulli brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_family "Bernoulli family"), [Jacob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli "Jacob Bernoulli") and [Johann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli "Johann Bernoulli") made important early contributions to the use of infinitesimals to study geometry. In lectures by Johann Bernoulli at the time, later collated by [L'Hopital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_de_l%27H%C3%B4pital "Guillaume de l'Hôpital") into [the first textbook on differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyse_des_Infiniment_Petits_pour_l%27Intelligence_des_Lignes_Courbes "Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes"), the tangents to plane curves of various types are computed using the condition ![Image 4: {\displaystyle dy=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aec85b67aad01d539d93dd82f24829d7afe9463c), and similarly points of inflection are calculated.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-struik1-1) At this same time the [orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality "Orthogonality") between the osculating circles of a plane curve and the tangent directions is realised, and the first analytical formula for the radius of an osculating circle, essentially the first analytical formula for the notion of [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature"), is written down.

In the wake of the development of analytic geometry and plane curves, [Alexis Clairaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Clairaut "Alexis Clairaut") began the study of [space curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve "Space curve") at just the age of 16.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-2)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-struik1-1) In his book Clairaut introduced the notion of tangent and [subtangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtangent "Subtangent") directions to space curves in relation to the directions which lie along a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface "Surface") on which the space curve lies. Thus Clairaut demonstrated an implicit understanding of the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") of a surface and studied this idea using calculus for the first time. Importantly Clairaut introduced the terminology of _curvature_ and _double curvature_, essentially the notion of [principal curvatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_curvature "Principal curvature") later studied by Gauss and others.

Around this same time, [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler"), originally a student of Johann Bernoulli, provided many significant contributions not just to the development of geometry, but to mathematics more broadly.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-3) In regards to differential geometry, Euler studied the notion of a [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") on a surface deriving the first analytical [geodesic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_equation "Geodesic equation"), and later introduced the first set of intrinsic coordinate systems on a surface, beginning the theory of _intrinsic geometry_ upon which modern geometric ideas are based.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-struik1-1) Around this time Euler's study of mechanics in the _[Mechanica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanica "Mechanica")_ lead to the realization that a mass traveling along a surface not under the effect of any force would traverse a geodesic path, an early precursor to the important foundational ideas of Einstein's [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), and also to the [Euler–Lagrange equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equations "Euler–Lagrange equations") and the first theory of the [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations "Calculus of variations"), which underpins in modern differential geometry many techniques in [symplectic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry "Symplectic geometry") and [geometric analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_analysis "Geometric analysis"). This theory was used by [Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange "Lagrange"), a co-developer of the calculus of variations, to derive the first differential equation describing a [minimal surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface "Minimal surface") in terms of the Euler–Lagrange equation. In 1760 Euler proved a theorem expressing the curvature of a space curve on a surface in terms of the principal curvatures, known as [Euler's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_theorem_(differential_geometry) "Euler's theorem (differential geometry)").

Later in the 1700s, the new French school led by [Gaspard Monge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_Monge "Gaspard Monge") began to make contributions to differential geometry. Monge made important contributions to the theory of plane curves, surfaces, and studied [surfaces of revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfaces_of_revolution "Surfaces of revolution") and [envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(mathematics) "Envelope (mathematics)") of plane curves and space curves. Several students of Monge made contributions to this same theory, and for example [Charles Dupin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dupin "Charles Dupin") provided a new interpretation of Euler's theorem in terms of the principle curvatures, which is the modern form of the equation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-struik1-1)

### Intrinsic geometry and non-Euclidean geometry (1800–1900)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Intrinsic geometry and non-Euclidean geometry (1800–1900)")]

The field of differential geometry became an area of study considered in its own right, distinct from the more broad idea of analytic geometry, in the 1800s, primarily through the foundational work of [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") and [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann"), and also in the important contributions of [Nikolai Lobachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Lobachevsky "Nikolai Lobachevsky") on [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry") and [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry") and throughout the same period the development of [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry").

Dubbed the single most important work in the history of differential geometry,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-spivak2-4) in 1827 Gauss produced the _Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas_ detailing the general theory of curved surfaces.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-Gauss-5)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-spivak2-4)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-struik2-6) In this work and his subsequent papers and unpublished notes on the theory of surfaces, Gauss has been dubbed the inventor of non-Euclidean geometry and the inventor of intrinsic differential geometry.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-struik2-6) In his fundamental paper Gauss introduced the [Gauss map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_map "Gauss map"), [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature"), [first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_fundamental_form "First fundamental form") and [second fundamental forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_fundamental_form "Second fundamental form"), proved the [Theorema Egregium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_Egregium "Theorema Egregium") showing the intrinsic nature of the Gaussian curvature, and studied geodesics, computing the area of a [geodesic triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_triangle "Geodesic triangle") in various non-Euclidean geometries on surfaces.

At this time Gauss was already of the opinion that the standard paradigm of [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") should be discarded, and was in possession of private manuscripts on non-Euclidean geometry which informed his study of geodesic triangles.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-struik2-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-7) Around this same time [János Bolyai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai "János Bolyai") and Lobachevsky independently discovered [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry") and thus demonstrated the existence of consistent geometries outside Euclid's paradigm. Concrete models of hyperbolic geometry were produced by [Eugenio Beltrami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Beltrami "Eugenio Beltrami") later in the 1860s, and [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein") coined the term non-Euclidean geometry in 1871, and through the [Erlangen program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program "Erlangen program") put Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries on the same footing.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-8) Implicitly, the [spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry") of the Earth that had been studied since antiquity was a non-Euclidean geometry, an [elliptic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry").

The development of intrinsic differential geometry in the language of Gauss was spurred on by his student, [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann") in his [Habilitationsschrift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitationsschrift "Habilitationsschrift"), _On the hypotheses which lie at the foundation of geometry_.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-9) In this work Riemann introduced the notion of a [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") and the [Riemannian curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_curvature_tensor "Riemannian curvature tensor") for the first time, and began the systematic study of differential geometry in higher dimensions. This intrinsic point of view in terms of the Riemannian metric, denoted by ![Image 5: {\displaystyle ds^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dcbeadecfd3d657628269afa2f6a1d20b0bf1cce) by Riemann, was the development of an idea of Gauss's about the linear element ![Image 6: {\displaystyle ds}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f0fb36e4308227d3e4a1f809c2571ec02527100) of a surface. At this time Riemann began to introduce the systematic use of [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") and [multilinear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_algebra "Multilinear algebra") into the subject, making great use of the theory of [quadratic forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form "Quadratic form") in his investigation of metrics and curvature. At this time Riemann did not yet develop the modern notion of a manifold, as even the notion of a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") had not been encountered, but he did propose that it might be possible to investigate or measure the properties of the metric of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") through the analysis of masses within spacetime, linking with the earlier observation of Euler that masses under the effect of no forces would travel along geodesics on surfaces, and predicting Einstein's fundamental observation of the [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle") a full 60 years before it appeared in the scientific literature.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-struik2-6)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-spivak2-4)

In the wake of Riemann's new description, the focus of techniques used to study differential geometry shifted from the ad hoc and extrinsic methods of the study of curves and surfaces to a more systematic approach in terms of [tensor calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus "Tensor calculus") and Klein's Erlangen program, and progress increased in the field. The notion of groups of transformations was developed by [Sophus Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophus_Lie "Sophus Lie") and [Jean Gaston Darboux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Gaston_Darboux "Jean Gaston Darboux"), leading to important results in the theory of [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_groups "Lie groups") and [symplectic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry "Symplectic geometry"). The notion of differential calculus on curved spaces was studied by [Elwin Christoffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwin_Christoffel "Elwin Christoffel"), who introduced the [Christoffel symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols "Christoffel symbols") which describe the [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative") in 1868, and by others including [Eugenio Beltrami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Beltrami "Eugenio Beltrami") who studied many analytic questions on manifolds.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-10) In 1899 [Luigi Bianchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Bianchi "Luigi Bianchi") produced his _Lectures on differential geometry_ which studied differential geometry from Riemann's perspective, and a year later [Tullio Levi-Civita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Levi-Civita "Tullio Levi-Civita") and [Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorio_Ricci-Curbastro "Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro") produced their textbook systematically developing the theory of [absolute differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_differential_calculus "Absolute differential calculus") and [tensor calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus "Tensor calculus").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-11)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-spivak2-4) It was in this language that differential geometry was used by Einstein in the development of general relativity and [pseudo-Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_geometry "Pseudo-Riemannian geometry").

### Modern differential geometry (1900–2000)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Modern differential geometry (1900–2000)")]

The subject of modern differential geometry emerged from the early 1900s in response to the foundational contributions of many mathematicians, including importantly [the work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_Situs_(paper) "Analysis Situs (paper)") of [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") on the foundations of [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-dieudonne-12) At the start of the 1900s there was a major movement within mathematics to formalise the foundational aspects of the subject to avoid crises of rigour and accuracy, known as [Hilbert's program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program "Hilbert's program"). As part of this broader movement, the notion of a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") was distilled in by [Felix Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Hausdorff "Felix Hausdorff") in 1914, and by 1942 there were many different notions of manifold of a combinatorial and differential-geometric nature.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-dieudonne-12)

Interest in the subject was also focused by the emergence of Einstein's theory of general relativity and the importance of the Einstein Field equations. Einstein's theory popularised the tensor calculus of Ricci and Levi-Civita and introduced the notation ![Image 7: {\displaystyle g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77) for a Riemannian metric, and ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \Gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4cfde86a3f7ec967af9955d0988592f0693d2b19) for the Christoffel symbols, both coming from _G_ in _Gravitation_. [Élie Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan") helped reformulate the foundations of the differential geometry of smooth manifolds in terms of [exterior calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_calculus "Exterior calculus") and the theory of [moving frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_frames "Moving frames"), leading in the world of physics to [Einstein–Cartan theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Cartan_theory "Einstein–Cartan theory").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-fre-13)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-spivak2-4)

Following this early development, many mathematicians contributed to the development of the modern theory, including [Jean-Louis Koszul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Koszul "Jean-Louis Koszul") who introduced [connections on vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(vector_bundle) "Connection (vector bundle)"), [Shiing-Shen Chern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern "Shiing-Shen Chern") who introduced [characteristic classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_class "Characteristic class") to the subject and began the study of [complex manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold"), [Sir William Vallance Douglas Hodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._V._D._Hodge "W. V. D. Hodge") and [Georges de Rham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_de_Rham "Georges de Rham") who expanded understanding of [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_forms "Differential forms"), [Charles Ehresmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ehresmann "Charles Ehresmann") who introduced the theory of fibre bundles and [Ehresmann connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehresmann_connection "Ehresmann connection"), and others.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-fre-13)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-spivak2-4) Of particular importance was [Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl") who made important contributions to the foundations of general relativity, introduced the [Weyl tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_tensor "Weyl tensor") providing insight into [conformal geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_geometry "Conformal geometry"), and first defined the notion of a [gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_(mathematics) "Gauge (mathematics)") leading to the development of [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory") in physics and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory_(mathematics) "Gauge theory (mathematics)").

In the middle and late 20th century differential geometry as a subject expanded in scope and developed links to other areas of mathematics and physics. The development of [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory") and [Yang–Mills theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory "Yang–Mills theory") in physics brought bundles and connections into focus, leading to developments in [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory_(mathematics) "Gauge theory (mathematics)"). Many analytical results were investigated including the proof of the [Atiyah–Singer index theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiyah%E2%80%93Singer_index_theorem "Atiyah–Singer index theorem"). The development of [complex geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_geometry "Complex geometry") was spurred on by parallel results in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), and results in the geometry and global analysis of complex manifolds were proven by [Shing-Tung Yau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau "Shing-Tung Yau") and others. In the latter half of the 20th century new analytic techniques were developed in regards to curvature flows such as the [Ricci flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_flow "Ricci flow"), which culminated in [Grigori Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman "Grigori Perelman")'s proof of the [Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Poincaré conjecture"). During this same period primarily due to the influence of [Michael Atiyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atiyah "Michael Atiyah"), new links between [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") and differential geometry were formed. Techniques from the study of the [Yang–Mills equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_equations "Yang–Mills equations") and [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory") were used by mathematicians to develop new invariants of smooth manifolds. Physicists such as [Edward Witten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Witten "Edward Witten"), the only physicist to be awarded a [Fields medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_medal "Fields medal"), made new impacts in mathematics by using [topological quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_field_theory "Topological quantum field theory") and [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory") to make predictions and provide frameworks for new rigorous mathematics, which has resulted for example in the conjectural [mirror symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_symmetry_(string_theory) "Mirror symmetry (string theory)") and the [Seiberg–Witten invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiberg%E2%80%93Witten_invariant "Seiberg–Witten invariant").

### Riemannian geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Riemannian geometry")]

Riemannian geometry studies [Riemannian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold"), [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold") with a _Riemannian metric_. This is a concept of distance expressed by means of a [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function")[positive definite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_definite_bilinear_form "Positive definite bilinear form")[symmetric bilinear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_bilinear_form "Symmetric bilinear form") defined on the tangent space at each point. Riemannian geometry generalizes [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") to spaces that are not necessarily flat, though they still resemble Euclidean space at each point infinitesimally, i.e. in the [first order of approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_order_of_approximation "First order of approximation"). Various concepts based on length, such as the [arc length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length "Arc length") of curves, [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area") of plane regions, and [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") of solids all possess natural analogues in Riemannian geometry. The notion of a [directional derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_derivative "Directional derivative") of a function from [multivariable calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus "Multivariable calculus") is extended to the notion of a [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative") of a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor"). Many concepts of analysis and differential equations have been generalized to the setting of Riemannian manifolds.

A distance-preserving [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") between Riemannian manifolds is called an [isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry"). This notion can also be defined _locally_, i.e. for small neighborhoods of points. Any two regular curves are locally isometric. However, the [Theorema Egregium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_Egregium "Theorema Egregium") of Carl Friedrich Gauss showed that for surfaces, the existence of a local isometry imposes that the [Gaussian curvatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature") at the corresponding points must be the same. In higher dimensions, the [Riemann curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor "Riemann curvature tensor") is an important pointwise invariant associated with a Riemannian manifold that measures how close it is to being flat. An important class of Riemannian manifolds is the [Riemannian symmetric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_symmetric_space "Riemannian symmetric space"), whose curvature is not necessarily constant. These are the closest analogues to the "ordinary" plane and space considered in Euclidean and [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry").

### Pseudo-Riemannian geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Pseudo-Riemannian geometry")]

[Pseudo-Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold") generalizes Riemannian geometry to the case in which the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") need not be [positive-definite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_bilinear_form "Definite bilinear form"). A special case of this is a [Lorentzian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian_manifold "Lorentzian manifold"), which is the mathematical basis of Einstein's [general relativity theory of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity").

Finsler geometry has _Finsler manifolds_ as the main object of study. This is a differential manifold with a _Finsler metric_, that is, a [Banach norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_norm "Banach norm") defined on each tangent space. Riemannian manifolds are special cases of the more general Finsler manifolds. A Finsler structure on a manifold ![Image 9: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) is a function ![Image 10: {\displaystyle F:\mathrm {T} M\to [0,\infty )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/891389aa89aa7b6e4c3ad2b0a3988e78ee787080) such that:

### Symplectic geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Symplectic geometry")]

[Symplectic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry "Symplectic geometry") is the study of [symplectic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold"). An **almost symplectic manifold** is a differentiable manifold equipped with a smoothly varying [non-degenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-degenerate "Non-degenerate")[skew-symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew-symmetric_matrix "Skew-symmetric matrix")[bilinear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_form "Bilinear form") on each tangent space, i.e., a nondegenerate 2-[form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form")_ω_, called the _symplectic form_. A symplectic manifold is an almost symplectic manifold for which the symplectic form _ω_ is closed: d _ω_ = 0.

A diffeomorphism between two symplectic manifolds which preserves the symplectic form is called a [symplectomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectomorphism "Symplectomorphism"). Non-degenerate skew-symmetric bilinear forms can only exist on even-dimensional vector spaces, so symplectic manifolds necessarily have even dimension. In dimension 2, a symplectic manifold is just a surface endowed with an area form and a symplectomorphism is an area-preserving diffeomorphism. The [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space "Phase space") of a mechanical system is a symplectic manifold and they made an implicit appearance already in the work of [Joseph Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Lagrange "Joseph Louis Lagrange") on [analytical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_mechanics "Analytical mechanics") and later in [Carl Gustav Jacobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacobi "Carl Gustav Jacobi")'s and [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton")'s [formulations of classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics").

By contrast with Riemannian geometry, where the [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature") provides a local invariant of Riemannian manifolds, [Darboux's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux%27s_theorem "Darboux's theorem") states that all symplectic manifolds are locally isomorphic. The only invariants of a symplectic manifold are global in nature and topological aspects play a prominent role in symplectic geometry. The first result in symplectic topology is probably the [Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9%E2%80%93Birkhoff_theorem "Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem"), conjectured by [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") and then proved by [G.D. Birkhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.D._Birkhoff "G.D. Birkhoff") in 1912. It claims that if an area preserving map of an [annulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mathematics) "Annulus (mathematics)") twists each boundary component in opposite directions, then the map has at least two fixed points.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-14)

[Contact geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_geometry "Contact geometry") deals with certain manifolds of odd dimension. It is close to symplectic geometry and like the latter, it originated in questions of classical mechanics. A _contact structure_ on a (2 _n_ + 1)-dimensional manifold _M_ is given by a smooth hyperplane field _H_ in the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle") that is as far as possible from being associated with the level sets of a differentiable function on _M_ (the technical term is "completely nonintegrable tangent hyperplane distribution"). Near each point _p_, a hyperplane distribution is determined by a nowhere vanishing [1-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form")![Image 18: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3), which is unique up to multiplication by a nowhere vanishing function:

![Image 19: {\displaystyle H_{p}=\ker \alpha _{p}\subset T_{p}M.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ccb331c20d96424b23909681b67f7df0c0f3732)
A local 1-form on _M_ is a _contact form_ if the restriction of its [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative") to _H_ is a non-degenerate two-form and thus induces a symplectic structure on _H_ _p_ at each point. If the distribution _H_ can be defined by a global one-form ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3) then this form is contact if and only if the top-dimensional form

![Image 21: {\displaystyle \alpha \wedge (d\alpha )^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/baa14d26d0b8f92739361626b27e1ecf55d1abfa)
is a [volume form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_form "Volume form") on _M_, i.e. does not vanish anywhere. A contact analogue of the Darboux theorem holds: all contact structures on an odd-dimensional manifold are locally isomorphic and can be brought to a certain local normal form by a suitable choice of the coordinate system.

### Complex and Kähler geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Complex and Kähler geometry")]

_Complex differential geometry_ is the study of [complex manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifolds "Complex manifolds"). An [almost complex manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_complex_manifold "Almost complex manifold") is a _real_ manifold ![Image 22: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd), endowed with a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") of type (1, 1), i.e. a [vector bundle endomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle") (called an _[almost complex structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost\_complex\_structure "Almost complex structure")_)

![Image 23: {\displaystyle J:TM\rightarrow TM}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5cf6a2e36448c0cf0b07478df0ad18942d13b66c), such that ![Image 24: {\displaystyle J^{2}=-1.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/186b1d1e675149711052985eead9692980efd8af)
It follows from this definition that an almost complex manifold is even-dimensional.

An almost complex manifold is called _complex_ if ![Image 25: {\displaystyle N_{J}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9afb80d5b99e54da4b62e70ed5af7a7941c27ee1), where ![Image 26: {\displaystyle N_{J}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9d972b42cc71fd31bd2f0e9526844ead9b9f0d8) is a tensor of type (2, 1) related to ![Image 27: {\displaystyle J}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/359e4f407b49910e02c27c2f52e87a36cd74c053), called the [Nijenhuis tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nijenhuis_tensor "Nijenhuis tensor") (or sometimes the _torsion_). An almost complex manifold is complex if and only if it admits a [holomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function "Holomorphic function")[coordinate atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology) "Atlas (topology)"). An _[almost Hermitian structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian\_manifold "Hermitian manifold")_ is given by an almost complex structure _J_, along with a [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric")_g_, satisfying the compatibility condition

![Image 28: {\displaystyle g(JX,JY)=g(X,Y).\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/08bfa67b4180bb4ff5bd283b840dfd6baf0203ea)
An almost Hermitian structure defines naturally a [differential two-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form")

![Image 29: {\displaystyle \omega _{J,g}(X,Y):=g(JX,Y).\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e61d17bffac35410e65d1bee655eaa743fac07f7)
The following two conditions are equivalent:

1.   ![Image 30: {\displaystyle N_{J}=0{\mbox{ and }}d\omega =0\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/363b0cf5bc37f99239a4d4148b7efef5389c99e3)
2.   ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \nabla J=0\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0e488bfae1b002702f428478dd1e1987240e2f37)

where ![Image 32: {\displaystyle \nabla }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a3d0e93b78c50237f9ea83d027e4ebbdaef354b2) is the [Levi-Civita connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_connection "Levi-Civita connection") of ![Image 33: {\displaystyle g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77). In this case, ![Image 34: {\displaystyle (J,g)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3c254d160bf244c5e8f17dfe4f0289d29cd7df98) is called a _[Kähler structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler\_manifold "Kähler manifold")_, and a _Kähler manifold_ is a manifold endowed with a Kähler structure. In particular, a Kähler manifold is both a complex and a [symplectic manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold"). A large class of Kähler manifolds (the class of [Hodge manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_manifold "Hodge manifold")) is given by all the smooth [complex projective varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry").

[CR geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR_structure "CR structure") is the study of the intrinsic geometry of boundaries of domains in [complex manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold").

[Conformal geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_geometry "Conformal geometry") is the study of the set of angle-preserving (conformal) transformations on a space.

### Differential topology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Differential topology")]

[Differential topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology "Differential topology") is the study of global geometric invariants without a metric or symplectic form.

Differential topology starts from the natural operations such as [Lie derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_derivative "Lie derivative") of natural [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle") and [de Rham differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative") of [forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form"). Beside [Lie algebroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebroid "Lie algebroid"), also [Courant algebroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant_algebroid "Courant algebroid") start playing a more important role.

A [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") is a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") in the category of smooth manifolds. Beside the algebraic properties this enjoys also differential geometric properties. The most obvious construction is that of a Lie algebra which is the tangent space at the unit endowed with the Lie bracket between left-invariant [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field"). Beside the structure theory there is also the wide field of [representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_a_Lie_group "Representation of a Lie group").

[Geometric analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_analysis "Geometric analysis") is a mathematical discipline where tools from differential equations, especially elliptic partial differential equations are used to establish new results in differential geometry and differential topology.

Gauge theory is the study of connections on vector bundles and principal bundles, and arises out of problems in [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics") and physical [gauge theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory") which underpin the [standard model of particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_model_of_particle_physics "Standard model of particle physics"). Gauge theory is concerned with the study of differential equations for connections on bundles, and the resulting geometric [moduli spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moduli_space "Moduli space") of solutions to these equations as well as the invariants that may be derived from them. These equations often arise as the [Euler–Lagrange equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equations "Euler–Lagrange equations") describing the equations of motion of certain physical systems in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), and so their study is of considerable interest in physics.

Bundles and connections
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Bundles and connections")]

The apparatus of [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle"), [principal bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_bundle "Principal bundle"), and [connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics) "Connection (mathematics)") on bundles plays an extraordinarily important role in modern differential geometry. A smooth manifold always carries a natural vector bundle, the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle"). Loosely speaking, this structure by itself is sufficient only for developing analysis on the manifold, while doing geometry requires, in addition, some way to relate the tangent spaces at different points, i.e. a notion of [parallel transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_transport "Parallel transport"). An important example is provided by [affine connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection "Affine connection"). For a surface in **R**3, tangent planes at different points can be identified using a natural path-wise parallelism induced by the ambient Euclidean space, which has a well-known standard definition of metric and parallelism. In [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry"), the [Levi-Civita connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_connection "Levi-Civita connection") serves a similar purpose. More generally, differential geometers consider spaces with a vector bundle and an arbitrary affine connection which is not defined in terms of a metric. In physics, the manifold may be [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") and the bundles and connections are related to various physical fields.

Intrinsic versus extrinsic
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differential_geometry&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Intrinsic versus extrinsic")]

From the beginning and through the middle of the 19th century, differential geometry was studied from the _extrinsic_ point of view: curves and surfaces were considered as lying in a Euclidean space of higher dimension (for example a surface in an [ambient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_space "Ambient space") of three dimensions). The simplest results are those in the differential geometry of curves and differential geometry of surfaces. Starting with the work of [Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann"), the _intrinsic_ point of view was developed, in which one cannot speak of moving "outside" the geometric object because it is considered to be given in a free-standing way. The fundamental result here is Gauss's [theorema egregium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_egregium "Theorema egregium"), to the effect that [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature") is an intrinsic invariant.

The intrinsic point of view is more flexible. For example, it is useful in relativity where space-time cannot naturally be taken as extrinsic. However, there is a price to pay in technical complexity: the intrinsic definitions of curvature and [connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics) "Connection (mathematics)") become much less visually intuitive.

These two points of view can be reconciled, i.e. the extrinsic geometry can be considered as a structure additional to the intrinsic one. (See the [Nash embedding theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_embedding_theorem "Nash embedding theorem").) In the formalism of [geometric calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_calculus "Geometric calculus") both extrinsic and intrinsic geometry of a manifold can be characterized by a single [bivector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector "Bivector")-valued one-form called the [shape operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_operator "Shape operator").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-15)

Below are some examples of how differential geometry is applied to other fields of science and mathematics.

*   In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), differential geometry has many applications, including: 
    *   Differential geometry is the language in which [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_theory_of_relativity "General theory of relativity") is expressed. According to the theory, the universe is a smooth manifold equipped with a pseudo-Riemannian metric, which describes the curvature of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"). Understanding this curvature is essential for the positioning of [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellites "Satellites") into orbit around the Earth. Differential geometry is also indispensable in the study of [gravitational lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lensing "Gravitational lensing") and [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_holes "Black holes").
    *   [Differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_forms "Differential forms") are used in the study of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism").
    *   Differential geometry has applications to both [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") and [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics"). Symplectic manifolds in particular can be used to study [Hamiltonian systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_system "Hamiltonian system").
    *   Riemannian geometry and contact geometry have been used to construct the formalism of [geometrothermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrothermodynamics "Geometrothermodynamics") which has found applications in classical equilibrium [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics").

*   In [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") and [biophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics "Biophysics") when modelling cell membrane structure under varying pressure.
*   In [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), differential geometry has applications to the field of [econometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics "Econometrics").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-16)
*   [Geometric modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_modeling "Geometric modeling") (including [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics")) and [computer-aided geometric design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_geometric_design "Computer-aided geometric design") draw on ideas from differential geometry.
*   In [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), differential geometry can be applied to solve problems in [digital signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing "Digital signal processing").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-17)
*   In [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory "Control theory"), differential geometry can be used to analyze nonlinear controllers, particularly [geometric control](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geometric_control&action=edit&redlink=1 "Geometric control (page does not exist)")[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-18)
*   In [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability"), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), and [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory"), one can interpret various structures as Riemannian manifolds, which yields the field of [information geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_geometry "Information geometry"), particularly via the [Fisher information metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric "Fisher information metric").
*   In [structural geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_geology "Structural geology"), differential geometry is used to analyze and describe geologic structures.
*   In [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision"), differential geometry is used to analyze shapes.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-19)
*   In [image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing "Image processing"), differential geometry is used to process and analyse data on non-flat surfaces.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-20)
*   [Grigori Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman "Grigori Perelman")'s proof of the [Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Poincaré conjecture") using the techniques of [Ricci flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_flow "Ricci flow") demonstrated the power of the differential-geometric approach to questions in [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and it highlighted the important role played by its analytic methods.
*   In [wireless communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless "Wireless"), [Grassmannian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian "Grassmannian") are used for [beamforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming "Beamforming") techniques in [multiple antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO "MIMO") systems.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-21)
*   In [geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy "Geodesy"), for calculating distances and angles on the mean sea level surface of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), modelled by an ellipsoid of revolution.
*   In [neuroimaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging "Neuroimaging") and [brain-computer interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-computer_interface "Brain-computer interface"), symmetric positive definite manifolds are used to model functional, structural, or electrophysiological connectivity matrices.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry#cite_note-22)
