↓ Grandilingulata qianxiensis Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: incertae sedis Genus: † Grandilingulata Chen et al, 2023 Species: † G. qianxiensis Binomial name † Grandilingulata qianxiensis Chen et al, 2023 Grandilingulata is a Calymmian organism, found in the Gaoyuzhuang Formation of China. It has been tentatively placed inside Eukaryota due to its complexity and size, alongside other fossils from the formation.

[ 1 ] Description [ edit ] Grandilingulata is a tongue-shaped fossil with gently curved sides, growing up to 30 cm in length and 8 cm in width.

[ 2 ] As it dates from the earliest Mesoproterozoic, its exact classification is unknown beyond a probable eukaryotic affinity. It is known from twelve specimens, two from the uppermost section and ten from the middle section of the Gaoyuzhuang Formation.

Etymology [ edit ] The genus name Grandilingulata means "large tongue", referring both to its tongue-like shape and its large size for organisms of the time period. The specific name qianxiensis refers to the location of a newly discovered fossiliferous location in Qianxi County, Hebei .
