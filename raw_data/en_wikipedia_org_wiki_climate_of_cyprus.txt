Snow is possible only in the Troodos Mountains in the central part of the island. Rain occurs mainly in winter, with summer being generally dry.

Temperatures [ edit ] Cyprus has one of the warmest climates and warmest winters in the Mediterranean part of the European Union . The average annual temperature on the coast is around 26 °C (79 °F) during the day and 17 °C (63 °F) at night. Generally, the warm season lasts about eight months. It begins in April, with average temperatures of 23–25 °C (73–77 °F) during the day and 13–15 °C (55–59 °F) at night, and ends in November, with average temperatures of 24–25 °C (75–77 °F) during the day and 14–17 °C (57–63 °F) at night. In the remaining four months of the year, the temperatures tend to remain mild, while sometimes exceeding 21 °C (70 °F) during the day. In Limassol , in the period January–February, the average maximum temperature is 18–20 °C (64–68 °F) during the day and 11–13 °C (52–55 °F) at night. 
In other coastal locations in Cyprus, the temperature is generally 16–18 °C (61–64 °F) during the day and 9–11 °C (48–52 °F) at night. 
In March and December in Limassol the average is 22–23 °C (72–73 °F) during the day and 12–14 °C (54–57 °F) at night; other coastal locations in Cyprus are generally 17–21 °C (63–70 °F) during the day and 8–11 °C (46–52 °F) at night.

The middle of summer (July and August) is usually hot, with an average maximum coastal temperature of around 37 °C (99 °F) during the day and around 28 °C (82 °F) at night. 
In the centre of the island (the highlands) the average temperature exceeds 37 °C (99 °F)). 
In June and September on the coast the average maximum temperature is usually around 30–32 °C (86–90 °F) during the day and around 19–21 °C (66–70 °F) at night. 
While large temperature fluctuations are rare on the coast, the centre of Cyprus has more variations – typically cool winters and hotter summers.

( December 2023 ) The average annual temperature of the sea around Cyprus is 21–22 °C (70–72 °F), from 17 °C (63 °F) in February to 27–28 °C (81–82 °F) in August (depending on the location). In the seven months from May to November the average sea temperature exceeds 20 °C (68 °F).

[ 4 ] This is about double that of cities in the northern half of Europe; for comparison, London has 1,461 hours.

[ 5 ] However, in winter there can be more than four times more sunshine; for comparison, London has 37 hours [ 5 ] while coastal locations in Cyprus have around 180 hours of sunshine in December (that is, as much as in May in London).

They receive the heaviest annual rainfall, which may be as much as 1,000 millimeters (39.4 in). Sharp frost also occurs in the higher districts, which are usually blanketed with snow during the first months of the year. Precipitation increases from 450 millimeters (17.7 in) up the south-western windward slopes to nearly 1,100 millimeters (43.3 in) at the top of the Troodos massif. The narrow ridge of the Kyrenia range, stretching 160 km (99 mi) from west to east along the extreme north of the island produces a relatively small increase in rainfall of around 550 millimeters (21.7 in) along its ridge at an elevation of 1,000 meters (3,281 ft). Plains along the northern coast and in the Karpass Peninsula area average 400 to 450 millimeters (15.7 to 17.7 in) of annual rainfall. The least rainfall occurs in the Mesaoria, with 300 to 400 millimeters (11.8 to 15.7 in) a year. Variability in annual rainfall is characteristic for the island, however, and droughts are frequent and sometimes severe. Statistical analysis of rainfall in Cyprus reveals a decreasing trend of rainfall amounts in the last 30 years.

Rainfall in the warmer months contributes little or nothing to water resources and agriculture. Autumn and winter rainfall, on which agriculture and water supply generally depend, is somewhat variable from year to year.

Other information [ edit ] Sandstorm in the Levant , October 19, 2002 The Mediterranean climate, warm and rather dry, with rainfall mainly between November and March, favors agriculture. In general, the island experiences mild wet winters and dry hot summers. Variations in temperature and rainfall are governed by altitude and, to a lesser extent, distance from the coast. Hot, dry summers from mid-May to mid-September and rainy, rather changeable winters from November to mid-March are separated by short autumn and spring seasons.

In summer the island is mainly under the influence of a shallow trough of low pressure extending from the great continental depression centred over Western Asia . It is a season of high temperatures with almost cloudless skies.

In winter Cyprus is near the track of fairly frequent small depressions which cross the Mediterranean Sea from west to east between the continental anticyclone of Eurasia and the generally low pressure belt of North Africa . These depressions give periods of disturbed weather usually lasting for a day or so and produce most of the annual precipitation, the average rainfall from December to February being about 60% of the average annual total precipitation for the island as a whole, which is 500 millimeters (19.7 in).

Humidity [ edit ] Relative humidity of the air is on average between 60% and 80% in winter and between 40% and 60% in summer with even lower values over inland areas around midday. Fog is infrequent and visibility is generally very good.

Sunshine is abundant during the whole year and particularly from April to September when the average duration of bright sunshine exceeds 12 hours per day.

Winds [ edit ] Winds are generally light to moderate and variable in direction. Strong winds may occur sometimes, but gales are infrequent over Cyprus and are mainly confined to exposed coastal areas as well as areas at high elevation.
