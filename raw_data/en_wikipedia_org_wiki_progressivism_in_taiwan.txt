There are several progressive political parties in Taiwan , but most are associated with the Pan-Green Coalition led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).

Progressive parties in Taiwan [ edit ] The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is a centre-left social liberal and progressive party in Taiwan. It grew out of the Tangwai movement formed in the 1970s to oppose the ruling Kuomintang . As of the 2020 legislative elections, the DPP holds a majority of 61 legislative seats.

The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) was historically a left-wing progressive party characterised primarily by its Taiwanese nationalism and derives its membership from both the Kuomintang 's former moderate and Taiwan-oriented fringe and DPP supporters disgruntled by the party's moderation on the question of Taiwanese sovereignty . Its progressive character was questionable, although it is part of the DPP's pro- Taiwan independence Pan-Green alliance . The TSU lost all of its seats in the 2016 elections.

The New Power Party (NPP) is a progressive party which aims to rewrite the Constitution of Republic of China and to carry out Taiwanization.

[ 1 ] The NPP won three seats in the 2020 legislative election, but lost all the seats in 2024.

The modern liberal parties in Taiwan are mostly associated with Taiwanese nationalism , as well as liberal positions on social issues, such as support for LGBT rights and abolishing the death penalty .  However, progressivism and social liberalism in Taiwan have not easily extended to extensive labor rights, or more liberal support for immigrant rights.
