Three asterisks used as a dinkus in the James Huneker novel Painted Veils . In this case, it is being used to accentuate the end of a particularly racy chapter, priming the reader for the change in tone.

In typography , a dinkus is a typographic symbol which often consists of three spaced asterisks or bullets in a horizontal row, i.e.

∗ ∗ ∗ or • • • . The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical "break" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection , and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c.

1850 .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism , ⁂ , though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.

[ 3 ] Etymology [ edit ] The word was coined by an artist on the Australian periodical, The Bulletin , in the 1920s and is derived from the word dinky .

[ 4 ] Usage [ edit ] The dinkus is used for various purposes, but many of them are related to an intentional break in the flow of the text.

Subsection break [ edit ] A dinkus can be used to accentuate a break between subsections of a single overarching section.

[ 5 ] When an author chooses to use a dinkus to divide a larger section, [ 6 ] [ 7 ] the intent is to maintain an overall sense of continuity within the overall chapter or section while changing elements of the setting or timeline.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] For instance, when the writer is introducing a flashback or other jarring scene change, a dinkus can help denote the change in setting within the overall theme of the chapter; in that case, it can be preferable to the initiation of a new chapter.

[ 10 ] This technique is used especially in literary fiction .

[ 8 ] [ 10 ] Intentionally omitted information [ edit ] See also: Ellipsis Many applications of the dinkus, including those that were common historically, have indicated intentional omission of information.

[ 1 ] In these cases, the dinkus is used to inform the reader that the information has been omitted.

[ 2 ] It can also be used to mean " untitled " or that the author or title was withheld. This is evident, for example, in some editions of Album for the Young by composer Robert Schumann ( № 21, 26, and 30).

[ 11 ] A dinkus can also be used in any context as a simple means of abbreviation of any text.

[ 9 ] The dinkus is also used specifically in this capacity within the sphere of lawmaking , particularly for city ordinances . When used in legal text, the dinkus indicates an abbreviation within amendments to code while not implying the repeal of the omitted sections.

[ 12 ] Ornamentation [ edit ] Newspapers, magazines, and other works can use dinkuses as simple ornamentation of typography, for solely aesthetic reasons.

[ 13 ] When a dinkus is used primarily for aesthetic purposes, it often takes the form of a fleuron , e.g.

❧ , or sometimes a dingbat .

[ 14 ] While fleurons, dingbats, and dinkuses are usually distinct, their uses can overlap.

Poetic symbolism [ edit ] In some cases, the use of a dinkus has been employed in poetry in order to convey non-verbal meaning. This is exemplified in the poem Thresholes by Lara Mimosa Montes, in which the poet makes frequent use of a circular dinkus, ○ , as a form of "punctuation at the level of the full text, rather than the phrase or the sentence" throughout the course of the work.

[ 15 ] Variations [ edit ] Many variations of dinkuses are composed partially or entirely of asterisks, although other symbols can be used to achieve the same goals. Some examples include a series of dots, [ 16 ] [ 17 ] fleurons , [ 17 ] asterisms , or small drawings.

[ 4 ] Esperanto Braille punctuation commonly uses a series of colons, ⠒ ⠒ ⠒ , as a dinkus.

Gallery [ edit ] Uses of dinkuses in literary works A Polish translation of a French work depicting the use of a series of dots as a dinkus. The dinkus is used to separate the translator's notes from the text.

A combination of a fleuron and line-shaped dinkus in the same Polish work.

Mrs. Henry Wood 's 19th-century novel exemplifying a line-shaped dinkus with a central diamond used as a chapter break.

Photograph of a German novel, Infinite Adventures , which uses an infinity symbol in triplicate as a dinkus.

Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland , in a print of indeterminate age, features dinkuses in the form of asterisks used to form a field of stars.

Ulysses by James Joyce uses an asterism as a dinkus in earlier prints, while newer editions replace it with three horizontal asterisks.

Other uses of the term "dinkus" [ edit ] See also: Śmigus-dyngus Among older Hungarian Americans and Polish Americans , dinkus is an archaic term for Easter Monday .

[ 18 ] In Australian English , particularly in the news media , the word "dinkus" refers to a small photograph of the author of a news article.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Outside of Australia, this is often referred to as a headshot .
