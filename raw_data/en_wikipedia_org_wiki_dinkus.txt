Three asterisks used as a dinkus in the [James Huneker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Huneker "James Huneker") novel _Painted Veils_. In this case, it is being used to accentuate the end of a particularly racy chapter, priming the reader for the change in tone.

In [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography"), a **dinkus** is a typographic symbol which often consists of three spaced [asterisks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk "Asterisk") or [bullets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography) "Bullet (typography)") in a horizontal row, i.e. ∗∗∗ or •••. The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical "break" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a [subsection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsection_(typography) "Subsection (typography)"), and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears [centrally aligned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Centered "Typographic alignment") on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Grammar_Book-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Shady_Punctuation-2) Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(typography) "Asterism (typography)"), ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-D13-3)

The word was coined by an artist on the Australian periodical, [_The Bulletin_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bulletin_(Australian_periodical) "The Bulletin (Australian periodical)"), in the 1920s and is derived from the word _[dinky](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dinky "wiktionary:dinky")_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Macquarie-4)

The dinkus is used for various purposes, but many of them are related to an intentional break in the flow of the text.

A dinkus can be used to accentuate a break between [subsections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsection_(typography) "Subsection (typography)") of a single overarching section.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-5) When an author chooses to use a dinkus to divide a larger section,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-7) the intent is to maintain an overall sense of continuity within the overall chapter or section while changing elements of the setting or timeline.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Aus_Editing-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Orthotypographie-9) For instance, when the writer is introducing a flashback or other jarring scene change, a dinkus can help denote the change in setting within the overall theme of the chapter; in that case, it can be preferable to the initiation of a new chapter.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-SPR-10) This technique is used especially in [literary fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_fiction "Literary fiction").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Aus_Editing-8)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-SPR-10)

### Intentionally omitted information

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dinkus&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Intentionally omitted information")]

Many applications of the dinkus, including those that were common historically, have indicated intentional omission of information.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Grammar_Book-1) In these cases, the dinkus is used to inform the reader that the information has been omitted.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Shady_Punctuation-2) It can also be used to mean "[untitled](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/untitled "wikt:untitled")" or that the author or title was withheld. This is evident, for example, in some editions of _[Album for the Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album\_for\_the\_Young "Album for the Young")_ by composer [Robert Schumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schumann "Robert Schumann") ([№](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%84%96 "№") 21, 26, and 30).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-11)

A dinkus can also be used in any context as a simple means of abbreviation of any text.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Orthotypographie-9) The dinkus is also used specifically in this capacity within the sphere of [lawmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawmaking "Lawmaking"), particularly for [city ordinances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_ordinance "City ordinance"). When used in legal text, the dinkus indicates an abbreviation within amendments to code while not implying the [repeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeal "Repeal") of the omitted sections.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-12)

Newspapers, magazines, and other works can use dinkuses as simple ornamentation of typography, for solely aesthetic reasons.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-13) When a dinkus is used primarily for aesthetic purposes, it often takes the form of a [fleuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_(typography) "Fleuron (typography)"), e.g. ❧, or sometimes a [dingbat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbat "Dingbat").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-14) While fleurons, dingbats, and dinkuses are usually distinct, their uses can overlap.

In some cases, the use of a dinkus has been employed in poetry in order to convey non-verbal meaning. This is exemplified in the poem _Thresholes_ by Lara Mimosa Montes, in which the poet makes frequent use of a circular dinkus,  ○ , as a form of "punctuation at the level of the full text, rather than the phrase or the sentence" throughout the course of the work.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-NYT_Ornamental-15)

Many variations of dinkuses are composed partially or entirely of asterisks, although other symbols can be used to achieve the same goals. Some examples include a series of dots,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Crystal-17)[fleurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_(typography) "Fleuron (typography)"),[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Crystal-17)[asterisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(typography) "Asterism (typography)"), or small drawings.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus#cite_note-Macquarie-4)[Esperanto Braille punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_Braille#Punctuation "Esperanto Braille") commonly uses a series of colons, ⠒⠒⠒, as a dinkus.
