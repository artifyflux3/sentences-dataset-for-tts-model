Overview of the geographical position and 3D cave cross-section The Velebit mountains of Croatia have several deep caves with some of the world's largest subterranean vertical drops.

The "Lukina jama" cave is 1431 m deep (2013), the deepest cave in Croatia and 17th deepest cave in the world and the deepest cave in southeast Europe .

[ 1 ] At its foot, there are ponds and streams including one of the largest known colonies of subterranean leeches ( Erpobdella mestrovi ), which has been ascertained to represent a new species, genus and also family.

[ 1 ] Other species discovered in the system, include the air-breathing land snails Zospeum tholussum .

[ 2 ] Like Lukina jama, Slovačka jama, Velebita and Meduza are also located at the " Hajdučki i Rožanski kukovi " special reserve, a dedicated part of the Sjeverni Velebit national park .

Other notable caves include the "Slovačka jama" ( Slovak pit ), (1,320 m deep), "Velebita" (1026 m deep with underground free fall vertical drop of 513 metres ) and  "Meduza" (679 m deep).

The vertical shaft "Patkov Gušt", named after a deceased Croatian speleologist [ 3 ] is 553 meters deep and the second deepest pitch in the world as of 2007 [update] .
