1990–1993 Lam, Simon S.

Lam was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame (2023) by the Internet Society for “inventing secure sockets in 1991 and implementing the first secure sockets layer, named SNP, in 1993.” [ 40 ] In 1990, he conceived the idea of a new security sublayer in the Internet protocol stack. This way, application programmers do not need to know much about implementation details for security. Also, the upper interface of the sublayer would enable implementation changes in the future. Lam's idea of a sublayer which offers a “secure sockets interface” to applications was novel and a radical departure from contemporary security research for Internet applications (e.g., MIT's Kerberos, 1988–1992). SNP was created for Internet applications in general. Subsequent secure sockets layers, SSL and TLS , developed years later for commercial browsers, followed the same architecture and key ideas of SNP. Today, TLS 1.3 is used not only for all e-commerce applications (banking, shopping, etc.) on WWW, but also for email, and many other Internet applications.

Almost immediately after the 1965 meeting, Donald Davies conceived of the details of a store-and-forward packet switching system ; Roberts, Dr. Lawrence G. (May 1995).

"The ARPANET & Computer Networks" . Archived from the original on 2016-03-24 . Retrieved 2016-04-13 .

Then in June 1966, Davies wrote a second internal paper, "Proposal for a Digital Communication Network" In which he coined the word packet,- a small sub part of the message the user wants to send, and also introduced the concept of an "Interface computer" to sit between the user equipment and the packet network.

^ Donald Davies (2001), "A Historical Study of the Beginnings of Packet Switching" , Computer Journal, British Computer Society , 44 (3): 152– 162, doi : 10.1093/comjnl/44.3.152 [ dead link ] ^ Roberts, Dr. Lawrence G. (November 1978).

In nearly all respects, Davies' original proposal, developed in late 1965, was similar to the actual networks being built today.
