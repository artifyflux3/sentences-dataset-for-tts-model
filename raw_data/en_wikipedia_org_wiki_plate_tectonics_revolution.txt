The event was a paradigm shift and scientific revolution.

[ 1 ] By 1967 most scientists in geology accepted the theory of plate tectonics.

[ 2 ] The root of this was Alfred Wegener 's 1912 publication of his theory of continental drift , which was a controversy in the field through the 1950s.

[ 2 ] At that point scientists introduced new evidence in a new way, replacing the idea of continental drift with instead a theory of plate tectonics.

[ 2 ] The acceptance of this theory brought scientific and cultural change which commentators called the "Plate Tectonics Revolution".

[ 2 ] Response [ edit ] In 1975 a paper said that "plate tectonics" gained general acceptance in its field in 1968 and called that acceptance a revolution.

[ 3 ] One scientist said that the Plate Tectonics Revolution brought excitement among scientists in the field in the 1960s.

[ 4 ] Publications in generations after the event reflected on how the Plate Tectonics Revolution was an early example of data science .

[ 5 ] One commentator claimed that the plate tectonics theory became popular and established a revolution in culture even before scientists could confirm some of the claims for which evidence was lacking.

[ 6 ] There are claims that science in Russia was a significant contribution to the Plate Tectonics Revolution, but Western bias against Russia has blocked recognition of their contributions.
