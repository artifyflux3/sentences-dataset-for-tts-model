[ 1 ] [ nb 1 ] History [ edit ] See also: English Short Title Catalogue (15th–18th centuries) and Early American Imprints (1639–1819) In 1640 in Cambridge , Massachusetts, Stephen Daye produced the first book printed in British North America, the Bay Psalm Book .

[ 4 ] New England became the first early hub. Philadelphia also became significant, with William Bradford setting up the first paper mill and Benjamin Franklin opening his own press. By the mid-19th century, New York City became the industry's center, marked by the rise of large publishing houses like Harper , Wiley , Putnam , and Scribner , who benefited from copyright laws and new distribution methods. Initially, they heavily relied on pirated British works until international copyright laws were established in 1891.

[ 5 ] The mid-19th century also saw innovations like paperback "dime novels" making literature more accessible.

[ 6 ] The American Library Association formed in 1876, and the Bibliographical Society of America in 1904. The post-World War I era was a boom for American publishing with new writers and publishers like Simon & Schuster and Random House emerging. The Great Depression caused a setback, but the industry recovered post-war. Since the 1960s, there's been a trend of mergers and consolidation, accelerating with the rise of online retailers and ebooks, though New York City remains a major global publishing center, home to the "Big Five" publishers (including HarperCollins , Penguin Random House , and Simon & Schuster ) and major educational publishers like Macmillan Learning , McGraw-Hill , Scholastic , and Wiley ,  alongside numerous independent publishers.

[ 7 ] Starting with Cornell University Press in 1869 and Johns Hopkins University Press in 1878, many universities set up publishing houses to publish scholarly books and journals of this sort produced by their faculty and graduate students. In the 21st century, however, financial pressures. have been reducing their output.
