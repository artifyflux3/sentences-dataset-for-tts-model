Controversies [ edit ] The October 2020 article suggesting that amulets may prevent COVID-19 [ 1 ] has been met with skepticism [ 2 ] even among the listed coauthors.

[ 3 ] As of November 2020, the article was under "temporary removal".

[ 1 ] It was later withdrawn at the request of the authors.

[ 4 ] The editor in-chief, Damià Barceló, was implicated in a €70,000 per year scheme to publish articles under the affiliation of King Saud University , Saudi Arabia.

[ 5 ] Such schemes are employed to boost a university's rankings and are considered unethical by academics.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Abstracting and indexing [ edit ] The journal is abstracted and indexed in: BIOSIS [ 8 ] CAB Abstracts [ 8 ] Chemical Abstracts Core [ 8 ] Ei Compendex [ 9 ] Food Science and Technology Abstracts [ 8 ] MEDLINE [ 8 ] Scopus [ 8 ] According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal has a 2023 impact factor of 8.2.

[ 10 ] As of October 2024 [update] , the journal's indexation in the Science Citation Index Expanded is "on hold" and pending re-evaluation, with Web of Science citing the concerns on "the quality of the content published in this journal" as a reason for the suspension.
