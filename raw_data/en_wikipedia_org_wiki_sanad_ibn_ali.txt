A later convert to Islam , Sanad's father was a learned astronomer who lived and worked in Baghdad .

[ 2 ] Biography [ edit ] Sanad ibn Ali was either an Iraqi Jewish [ 3 ] or a Sindhi from Mansura , capital of Arab Sind .

[ 4 ] He is known to have translated and modified the Zij al-Sindhind . The Zij al-Sindhind was the first astronomical table ever introduced in the Muslim World . As a mathematician Sanad ibn ʿAlī was a colleague of al-Khwarizmi and worked closely with Yaqūb ibn Tāriq together they calculated the diameter of the Earth and other astronomical bodies. He also wrote a commentary on Kitāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala and helped prove the works of al-Khwarizmi . The decimal point notation to the Arabic numerals was introduced by Sanad ibn Ali.

According to Ibn Abi Usaibia : the Banū Mūsā brothers out of sheer professional jealousy kept him away from Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil at his new capital Samarra and had caused Sanad ibn ʿAlī to be sent away to Baghdad . Both Ja'far Muhammad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir and Ahmad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir delegated the work of digging a great canal instead to Al-Farghani and thus ignoring Sanad ibn ʿAlī, the better engineer.

Al-Farghani committed a great error, making the beginning of the canal deeper than the rest and water never reached the new garrison of Al-Ja'fariya . News of this greatly angered al-Mutawakkil and the two Banū Mūsā brothers were saved from severe punishment only by the gracious willingness of Sanad ibn ʿAlī, to vouch the corrections of Al-Farghani 's calculations thus risking his own welfare and possibly his life.
