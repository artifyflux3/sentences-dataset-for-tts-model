Rennes ( French pronunciation: [ʁɛn] ⓘ ; Breton : Roazhon [ˈrwɑːõn] ; Gallo : Resnn ; Latin : Condate Redonum ) is a city in the east of Brittany in Northwestern France at the confluence of the rivers Ille and Vilaine . Rennes is the prefecture of the Brittany region and Ille-et-Vilaine department . In 2021, its urban area had a population of 371,464 inhabitants, while the larger metropolitan area had a population of 771,320.

[ 3 ] The inhabitants of Rennes are called Rennais (masculine) and Rennaises (feminine) in French .

Rennes's history goes back more than 2,000 years to a time when it was a small Gallic village named Condate. Together with Vannes and Nantes , it was one of the major cities of the ancient Duchy of Brittany . From the early sixteenth century until the French Revolution , Rennes was a parliamentary, administrative and garrison city of the historic province of Brittany in the Kingdom of France , as evidenced by its 17th-century Parliament's Palace . Rennes played an important role in the Stamped Paper Revolt ( Revolt of the papier timbré ) in 1675. After the destructive fire of 1720, the medieval wooden center of the city was partially rebuilt in stone. Remaining mostly rural until the Second World War , Rennes underwent significant development in the twentieth century.

Since the 1950s, Rennes has grown in importance through rural flight and modern industrial development, partly in the automotive sector. The city developed extensive building plans to accommodate upwards of 200,000 inhabitants. During the 1980s, Rennes became one of the main centres in telecommunications and high-tech industry. It is now a significant digital innovation centre in France. In 2002, Rennes became the smallest city in the world to have a Metro line.

Labeled a city of art and history, it has preserved an important medieval and classical heritage within its historic center, with over 90 buildings protected as historic monuments.

[ 4 ] Home to more than 66,000 students in 2016, it is also the eighth-largest university campus of France.

[ 5 ] In 2018, L'Express named Rennes as "the most liveable city in France".

A member of the Socialist Party , she replaced retiring Socialist incumbent Daniel Delaveau , in office from 2008 to 2014.

Among previous well-known mayors are: Jean Janvier (1859–1923), from 1908 to 1923; Edgar Le Bastard (1836–1891), from 1880 to 1891; Toussaint-François Rallier du Baty (1665–1734) from 1695 to 1734.

The mairie ( city hall ) is right in the centre of Rennes.

National representation [ edit ] The French Prison Service operates the Centre pénitentiaire de Rennes , the largest women's prison in France.

[ 10 ] Geography [ edit ] Green Belt between Rennes and L'Hermitage The ancient centre of the town is built on a hill, with the north side being more elevated than the south side. It is at the confluence of two rivers: the Ille and the Vilaine .

Rennes is located on the European atlantic arc , 50 km from the English Channel (near Saint-Malo , Dinard , and Mont Saint-Michel ).

Rennes has the distinction of having a significant Green Belt around its ring road. This Green Belt is a protected area between the city proper (rather dense) and the rest of its urban area (rather rural).

Climate [ edit ] Rennes features an oceanic climate . Precipitation in Rennes is considerably less abundant than in the western parts of Brittany, reaching only half of the levels of, e.g., the city of Quimper , which makes rainfall in Rennes comparable to the levels of large parts of western Germany. Sunshine hours range between 1,700 and 1,850 annually, which is about the amount of sunshine received by the city of Lausanne .

Source: EHESS [ 13 ] and INSEE [ 14 ] Sights [ edit ] Historic centre [ edit ] The historic centre is located on the former plan of the ramparts. There is a difference between the northern city centre and the southern city centre due to the 1720 fire, which destroyed most of the timber-framed houses in the northern part of the city. The rebuilding was done in stone, on a grid plan. The poorer southern part was not rebuilt.

Due to the presence of the parlement de Bretagne , many " hôtels particuliers " were built in the northern part, the richer half of Rennes in the 18th century. Most of the city's monuments historiques can be found there.

Colourful traditional half-timbered houses are situated primarily along the roads of Saint-Sauveur, Saint-Georges, de Saint-Malo, Saint-Guillaume, des Dames, du Chapitre, Vasselot, Saint-Michel, de la Psallette and around the plazas of Champ-Jacquet, des Lices, Saint-Anne and Rallier-du-Baty.

The Parlement de Bretagne and city hall area [ edit ] The Parlement de Bretagne (Administrative and judicial centre of Brittany, Breton : Breujoù Breizh ) is the most famous 17th century building in Rennes. It was rebuilt after a terrible fire in 1994 that may have been caused by a flare fired by a protester during a demonstration. It houses the Rennes Court of Appeal . The surrounding plaza is built in the classical style.
