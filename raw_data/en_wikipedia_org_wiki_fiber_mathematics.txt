{\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)=\{x\mathrel {:} f(x)=y\}.} Properties and applications [ edit ] In elementary set theory [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are the domain and image of f {\displaystyle f} , respectively, then the fibers of f {\displaystyle f} are the sets in { f − − 1 ( y ) : y ∈ ∈ Y } = { { x ∈ ∈ X : f ( x ) = y } : y ∈ ∈ Y } {\displaystyle \left\{f^{-1}(y)\mathrel {:} y\in Y\right\}\quad =\quad \left\{\left\{x\in X\mathrel {:} f(x)=y\right\}\mathrel {:} y\in Y\right\}} which is a partition of the domain set X {\displaystyle X} .  Note that y {\displaystyle y} must be restricted to the image set Y {\displaystyle Y} of f {\displaystyle f} , since otherwise f − − 1 ( y ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)} would be the empty set which is not allowed in a partition.  The fiber containing an element x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} is the set f − − 1 ( f ( x ) ) .

{\displaystyle f^{-1}(f(x)).} For example, let f {\displaystyle f} be the function from R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} to R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } that sends point ( a , b ) {\displaystyle (a,b)} to a + b {\displaystyle a+b} . The fiber of 5 under f {\displaystyle f} are all the points on the straight line with equation a + b = 5 {\displaystyle a+b=5} .  The fibers of f {\displaystyle f} are that line and all the straight lines parallel to it, which form a partition of the plane R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} .

More generally, if f {\displaystyle f} is a linear map from some linear vector space X {\displaystyle X} to some other linear space Y {\displaystyle Y} , the fibers of f {\displaystyle f} are affine subspaces of X {\displaystyle X} , which are all the translated copies of the null space of f {\displaystyle f} .

If f {\displaystyle f} is a real -valued function of several real variables , the fibers of the function are the level sets of f {\displaystyle f} .  If f {\displaystyle f} is also a continuous function and y ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle y\in \mathbb {R} } is in the image of f , {\displaystyle f,} the level set f − − 1 ( y ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)} will typically be a curve in 2D , a surface in 3D , and, more generally, a hypersurface in the domain of f .

{\displaystyle f.} The fibers of f {\displaystyle f} are the equivalence classes of the equivalence relation ≡ ≡ f {\displaystyle \equiv _{f}} defined on the domain X {\displaystyle X} such that x ′ ≡ ≡ f x ″ {\displaystyle x'\equiv _{f}x''} if and only if f ( x ′ ) = f ( x ″ ) {\displaystyle f(x')=f(x'')} .

In topology [ edit ] In point set topology , one generally considers functions from topological spaces to topological spaces.

If f {\displaystyle f} is a continuous function and if Y {\displaystyle Y} (or more generally, the image set f ( X ) {\displaystyle f(X)} ) is a T 1 space then every fiber is a closed subset of X .

{\displaystyle X.} In particular, if f {\displaystyle f} is a local homeomorphism from X {\displaystyle X} to Y {\displaystyle Y} , each fiber of f {\displaystyle f} is a discrete subspace of X {\displaystyle X} .

A function between topological spaces is called monotone if every fiber is a connected subspace of its domain. A function f : R → → R {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {R} } is monotone in this topological sense if and only if it is non-increasing or non-decreasing , which is the usual meaning of " monotone function " in real analysis .

A function between topological spaces is (sometimes) called a proper map if every fiber is a compact subspace of its domain. However, many authors use other non-equivalent competing definitions of "proper map" so it is advisable to always check how a particular author defines this term. A continuous closed surjective function whose fibers are all compact is called a perfect map .

A fiber bundle is a function f {\displaystyle f} between topological spaces X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} whose fibers have certain special properties related to the topology of those spaces.

In algebraic geometry [ edit ] In algebraic geometry , if f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} is a morphism of schemes , the fiber of a point p {\displaystyle p} in Y {\displaystyle Y} is the fiber product of schemes X × × Y Spec ⁡ ⁡ k ( p ) {\displaystyle X\times _{Y}\operatorname {Spec} k(p)} where k ( p ) {\displaystyle k(p)} is the residue field at p .
