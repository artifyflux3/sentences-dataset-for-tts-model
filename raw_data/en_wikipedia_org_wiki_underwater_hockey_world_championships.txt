The event is conducted on behalf of the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) by an affiliated national federation.

History [ edit ] The championship was first held in 1980 in Vancouver, British Columbia , Canada after the intended initial championship scheduled for 1979 was beset by difficulties and ultimately postponed, due to the invitation of a team from South Africa and the problems associated with apartheid .

[ citation needed ] Subsequently, a world championship has been held every two years in locations around the world up until 2006. 2006 saw many CMAS-affiliated national federations as well as the majority of the CMAS Underwater Hockey Commission members in dispute with CMAS over policy and governance matters concerning underwater hockey. Out of the divide the World Aquachallenge Association (WAA) - an alternative governing body - was born.

[ 1 ] In 2007 CMAS intended to incorporate the Underwater Hockey World Championship into its inaugural World Games event in Bari , Italy , an ambitious event intended to showcase all of the underwater disciplines ( Underwater Rugby , Finswimming etc) governed by them in one place. As far as underwater hockey goes this event was poorly attended, in part due to it being 'out of synch' with many affiliated federations' training calendars and budgets. The following year - the 'normal' world championship year - the WAA organised their 'rival' 1st World Championship event in Durban , South Africa . This is now held by many to have been the official 2008 World Championship despite it being poorly attended too, in part this time because CMAS organised a major underwater hockey 'zone' event to be held in Istanbul , Turkey on exactly the same dates meaning a majority of European federations were forced to choose which championship their representative teams attended.

[ citation needed ] The WAA was short-lived and since 2008 CMAS has once again administered all the world championship events in various age/gender divisions with the most recent having been held in Quebec City , Canada in 2018. World championships in the different age categories are now scheduled for every second year.

[ 2 ] Following the 2023 resumption of the tournament following the COVID-19 pandemic , the world championships moved to being held every four years and teams would gain qualification via the new Intercontinental Championships .
