(see also Outline of category theory .) Notes on foundations : In many expositions (e.g., Vistoli), the set-theoretic issues are ignored; this means, for instance, that one does not distinguish between small and large categories and that one can arbitrarily form a localization of a category.

[ 1 ] Like those expositions, this glossary also generally ignores the set-theoretic issues, except when they are relevant (e.g., the discussion on accessibility.) Especially for higher categories, the concepts from algebraic topology are also used in the category theory. For that see also glossary of algebraic topology .

The notations and the conventions used throughout the article are: [ n ] = {0, 1, 2, …, n }, which is viewed as a category (by writing i → → j ⇔ ⇔ i ≤ ≤ j {\displaystyle i\to j\Leftrightarrow i\leq j} .) Cat , the category of (small) categories , where the objects are categories (which are small with respect to some universe) and the morphisms functors .

Fct ( C , D ), the functor category : the category of functors from a category C to a category D .

Set , the category of (small) sets.

s Set , the category of simplicial sets .

"weak" instead of "strict" is given the default status; e.g., " n -category" means "weak n -category", not the strict one, by default.

By an ∞-category , we mean a quasi-category , the most popular model, unless other models are being discussed.

The number zero 0 is a natural number.

2.  A (2, 1)-category is a 2-category in which every 2-morphism is invertible.

A [ edit ] abelian A category is abelian if it has a zero object, it has all pullbacks and pushouts, and all monomorphisms and epimorphisms are normal.

accessible 1.  Given a cardinal number κ, an object X in a category is κ-accessible (or κ-compact or κ-presentable) if Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( X , − − ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (X,-)} commutes with κ-filtered colimits.

2.  Given a regular cardinal κ, a category is κ-accessible if it has κ-filtered colimits and there exists a small set S of κ-compact objects that generates the category under colimits, meaning every object can be written as a colimit of diagrams of objects in S .

additive A category is additive if it is preadditive (to be precise, has some pre-additive structure) and admits all finite coproducts . Although "preadditive" is an additional structure, one can show "additive" is a property of a category; i.e., one can ask whether a given category is additive or not.

[ 2 ] adjunction An adjunction (also called an adjoint pair) is a pair of functors F : C → D , G : D → C such that there is a "natural" bijection Hom D ⁡ ⁡ ( F ( X ) , Y ) ≃ ≃ Hom C ⁡ ⁡ ( X , G ( Y ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} _{D}(F(X),Y)\simeq \operatorname {Hom} _{C}(X,G(Y))} ; F is said to be left adjoint to G and G to right adjoint to F . Here, "natural" means there is a natural isomorphism Hom D ⁡ ⁡ ( F ( − − ) , − − ) ≃ ≃ Hom C ⁡ ⁡ ( − − , G ( − − ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} _{D}(F(-),-)\simeq \operatorname {Hom} _{C}(-,G(-))} of bifunctors (which are contravariant in the first variable.) algebra for a monad Given a monad T in a category X , an algebra for T or a T -algebra is an object in X with a monoid action of T ("algebra" is misleading and " T -object" is perhaps a better term.) For example, given a group G that determines a monad T in Set in the standard way, a T -algebra is a set with an action of G .

amnestic A functor is amnestic if it has the property: if k is an isomorphism and F ( k ) is an identity, then k is an identity.

calculus of fractions calculus of fractions .

cartesian closed A category is cartesian closed if it has a terminal object and that any two objects have a product and exponential.

cartesian morphism 1.  Given a functor π: C → D (e.g., a prestack over schemes), a morphism f : x → y in C is π-cartesian if, for each object z in C , each morphism g : z → y in C and each morphism v : π( z ) → π( x ) in D such that π( g ) = π( f ) ∘ v , there exists a unique morphism u : z → x such that π( u ) = v and g = f ∘ u .

2.  Given a functor π: C → D (e.g., a prestack over rings), a morphism f : x → y in C is π-coCartesian if, for each object z in C , each morphism g : x → z in C and each morphism v : π( y ) → π( z ) in D such that π( g ) = v ∘ π( f ), there exists a unique morphism u : y → z such that π( u ) = v and g = u ∘ f . (In short, f is the dual of a π-cartesian morphism.) Cartesian square A commutative diagram that is isomorphic to the diagram given as a fiber product.

categorical logic Categorical logic is an approach to mathematical logic that uses category theory.

categorical probability categorical probability categorification categorification is a process of replacing sets and set-theoretic concepts with categories and category-theoretic concepts in some nontrivial way to capture categoric flavors. Decategorification is the reverse of categorification.

The theory of categories originated ... with the need to guide complicated calculations involving passage to the limit in the study of the qualitative leap from spaces to homotopical/homological objects. ... But category theory does not rest content with mere classification in the spirit of Wolffian metaphysics (although a few of its practitioners may do so); rather it is the mutability of mathematically precise structures (by morphisms) which is the essential content of category theory.

William Lawvere, [ 3 ] category A category consists of the following data A class of objects, For each pair of objects X , Y , a set Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (X,Y)} , whose elements are called morphisms from X to Y , For each triple of objects X , Y , Z , a map (called composition) ∘ ∘ : Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( Y , Z ) × × Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Y ) → → Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Z ) , ( g , f ) ↦ ↦ g ∘ ∘ f {\displaystyle \circ :\operatorname {Hom} (Y,Z)\times \operatorname {Hom} (X,Y)\to \operatorname {Hom} (X,Z),\,(g,f)\mapsto g\circ f} , For each object X , an identity morphism id X ∈ ∈ Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( X , X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{X}\in \operatorname {Hom} (X,X)} subject to the conditions: for any morphisms f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} , g : Y → → Z {\displaystyle g:Y\to Z} and h : Z → → W {\displaystyle h:Z\to W} , ( h ∘ ∘ g ) ∘ ∘ f = h ∘ ∘ ( g ∘ ∘ f ) {\displaystyle (h\circ g)\circ f=h\circ (g\circ f)} and id Y ∘ ∘ f = f ∘ ∘ id X = f {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{Y}\circ f=f\circ \operatorname {id} _{X}=f} .

For example, a partially ordered set can be viewed as a category: the objects are the elements of the set and for each pair of objects x , y , there is a unique morphism x → → y {\displaystyle x\to y} if and only if x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} ; the associativity of composition means transitivity.

category of 1.  The category of (small) categories , denoted by Cat , is a category where the objects are all the categories which are small with respect to some fixed universe and the morphisms are all the functors .

2.

Category of modules , Category of topological spaces , Category of groups , Category of metric spaces , etc.

classifying space The classifying space of a category C is the geometric realization of the nerve of C .

co- Often used synonymous with op-; for example, a colimit refers to an op-limit in the sense that it is a limit in the opposite category. But there might be a distinction; for example, an op-fibration is not the same thing as a cofibration .

codensity monad Codensity monad .

coend The coend of a functor F : C op × × C → → X {\displaystyle F:C^{\text{op}}\times C\to X} is the dual of the end of F and is denoted by ∫ ∫ c ∈ ∈ C F ( c , c ) {\displaystyle \int ^{c\in C}F(c,c)} .

For example, if R is a ring, M a right R -module and N a left R -module, then the tensor product of M and N is M ⊗ ⊗ R N = ∫ ∫ R M ⊗ ⊗ Z N {\displaystyle M\otimes _{R}N=\int ^{R}M\otimes _{\mathbb {Z} }N} where R is viewed as a category with one object whose morphisms are the elements of R .

colored operad Another term for multicategory , a generalized category where a morphism can have several domains. The notion of "colored operad" is more primitive than that of operad: in fact, an operad can be defined as a colored operad with a single object.

comma Given functors f : C → → B , g : D → → B {\displaystyle f:C\to B,g:D\to B} , the comma category ( f ↓ ↓ g ) {\displaystyle (f\downarrow g)} is a category where (1) the objects are morphisms f ( c ) → → g ( d ) {\displaystyle f(c)\to g(d)} and (2) a morphism from α α : f ( c ) → → g ( d ) {\displaystyle \alpha :f(c)\to g(d)} to β β : f ( c ′ ) → → g ( d ′ ) {\displaystyle \beta :f(c')\to g(d')} consists of c → → c ′ {\displaystyle c\to c'} and d → → d ′ {\displaystyle d\to d'} such that f ( c ) → → f ( c ′ ) → → β β g ( d ′ ) {\displaystyle f(c)\to f(c'){\overset {\beta }{\to }}g(d')} is f ( c ) → → α α g ( d ) → → g ( d ′ ) .

{\displaystyle f(c){\overset {\alpha }{\to }}g(d)\to g(d').} For example, if f is the identity functor and g is the constant functor with a value b , then it is the slice category of B over an object b .

comonad A comonad in a category X is a comonoid in the monoidal category of endofunctors of X .

compact Probably synonymous with #accessible .

complete A category is complete if all small limits exist.

composition 1.  A composition of morphisms in a category is part of the datum defining the category.

2.  If f : C → → D , g : D → → E {\displaystyle f:C\to D,\,g:D\to E} are functors, then the composition g ∘ ∘ f {\displaystyle g\circ f} or g f {\displaystyle gf} is the functor defined by: for an object x and a morphism u in C , ( g ∘ ∘ f ) ( x ) = g ( f ( x ) ) , ( g ∘ ∘ f ) ( u ) = g ( f ( u ) ) {\displaystyle (g\circ f)(x)=g(f(x)),\,(g\circ f)(u)=g(f(u))} .

3.  Natural transformations are composed pointwise: if φ φ : f → → g , ψ ψ : g → → h {\displaystyle \varphi :f\to g,\,\psi :g\to h} are natural transformations, then ψ ψ ∘ ∘ φ φ {\displaystyle \psi \circ \varphi } is the natural transformation given by ( ψ ψ ∘ ∘ φ φ ) x = ψ ψ x ∘ ∘ φ φ x {\displaystyle (\psi \circ \varphi )_{x}=\psi _{x}\circ \varphi _{x}} .

concrete A concrete category C is a category such that there is a faithful functor from C to Set ; e.g., Vec , Grp and Top .

cone A cone is a way to express the universal property of a colimit (or dually a limit). One can show [ 4 ] that the colimit lim → → {\displaystyle \varinjlim } is the left adjoint to the diagonal functor Δ Δ : C → → Fct ⁡ ⁡ ( I , C ) {\displaystyle \Delta :C\to \operatorname {Fct} (I,C)} , which sends an object X to the constant functor with value X ; that is, for any X and any functor f : I → → C {\displaystyle f:I\to C} , Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( lim → → ⁡ ⁡ f , X ) ≃ ≃ Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( f , Δ Δ X ) , {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (\varinjlim f,X)\simeq \operatorname {Hom} (f,\Delta _{X}),} provided the colimit in question exists. The right-hand side is then the set of cones with vertex X .

[ 5 ] connected A category is connected if, for each pair of objects x , y , there exists a finite sequence of objects z i such that z 0 = x , z n = y {\displaystyle z_{0}=x,z_{n}=y} and either Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( z i , z i + 1 ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (z_{i},z_{i+1})} or Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( z i + 1 , z i ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (z_{i+1},z_{i})} is nonempty for any i .

conservative functor A conservative functor is a functor that reflects isomorphisms. Many forgetful functors are conservative, but the forgetful functor from Top to Set is not conservative.

constant A functor is constant if it maps every object in a category to the same object A and every morphism to the identity on A . Put in another way, a functor f : C → → D {\displaystyle f:C\to D} is constant if it factors as: C → → { A } → → i D {\displaystyle C\to \{A\}{\overset {i}{\to }}D} for some object A in D , where i is the inclusion of the discrete category { A }.

contravariant functor A contravariant functor F from a category C to a category D is a (covariant) functor from C op to D . It is sometimes also called a presheaf especially when D is Set or the variants. For example, for each set S , let P ( S ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}(S)} be the power set of S and for each function f : S → → T {\displaystyle f:S\to T} , define P ( f ) : P ( T ) → → P ( S ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}(f):{\mathfrak {P}}(T)\to {\mathfrak {P}}(S)} by sending a subset A of T to the pre-image f − − 1 ( A ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}(A)} . With this, P : S e t → → S e t {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}:\mathbf {Set} \to \mathbf {Set} } is a contravariant functor.

coproduct The coproduct of a family of objects X i in a category C indexed by a set I is the inductive limit lim → → {\displaystyle \varinjlim } of the functor I → → C , i ↦ ↦ X i {\displaystyle I\to C,\,i\mapsto X_{i}} , where I is viewed as a discrete category. It is the dual of the product of the family. For example, a coproduct in Grp is a free product .

D [ edit ] Day convolution Given a group or monoid M , the Day convolution is the tensor product in F c t ( M , S e t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Fct} (M,\mathbf {Set} )} .

[ 6 ] Dendroidal Dendroidal set .

density theorem The density theorem states that every presheaf (a set-valued contravariant functor) is a colimit of representable presheaves. Yoneda's lemma embeds a category C into the category of presheaves on C . The density theorem then says the image is "dense", so to say. The name "density" is because of the analogy with the Jacobson density theorem (or other variants) in abstract algebra.

diagonal functor 1.  Given categories I , C , the diagonal functor is the functor Δ Δ : C → → F c t ( I , C ) , A ↦ ↦ Δ Δ A {\displaystyle \Delta :C\to \mathbf {Fct} (I,C),\,A\mapsto \Delta _{A}} that sends each object A to the constant functor with value A and each morphism f : A → → B {\displaystyle f:A\to B} to the natural transformation Δ Δ f , i : Δ Δ A ( i ) = A → → Δ Δ B ( i ) = B {\displaystyle \Delta _{f,i}:\Delta _{A}(i)=A\to \Delta _{B}(i)=B} that is f at each i .

diagram 1.  Given a category C , a diagram in C is a functor f : I → → C {\displaystyle f:I\to C} from a category I . For example, if I = N {\displaystyle I=\mathbb {N} } with no morphisms other than  the identities, a diagram simply amounts to a sequence of objects. For a general I , typically there is a morphism between the images of objects in I under f (whence the term diagram).

2.

simplicial diagram , a diagram from the opposite Δ Δ op {\displaystyle \Delta ^{\textrm {op}}} of the simplex category.

diagrammatic set A diagrammatic set is an alternative to a simplicial set or a cubical set.

differential graded category A differential graded category is a category whose Hom sets are equipped with structures of differential graded modules . In particular, if the category has only one object, it is the same as a differential graded module.

direct limit A direct limit is the colimit of a direct system .

discrete A category is discrete if each morphism is an identity morphism (of some object). For example, a set can be viewed as a discrete category.

distributor Another term for "profunctor".

double double category .

Dwyer–Kan equivalence A Dwyer–Kan equivalence is a generalization of an equivalence of categories to the simplicial context.

end The end of a functor F : C op × × C → → X {\displaystyle F:C^{\text{op}}\times C\to X} is the limit ∫ ∫ c ∈ ∈ C F ( c , c ) = lim ← ← ⁡ ⁡ ( F # # : C # # → → X ) {\displaystyle \int _{c\in C}F(c,c)=\varprojlim (F^{\#}:C^{\#}\to X)} where C # # {\displaystyle C^{\#}} is the category (called the subdivision category of C ) whose objects are symbols c # # , u # # {\displaystyle c^{\#},u^{\#}} for all objects c and all morphisms u in C and whose morphisms are b # # → → u # # {\displaystyle b^{\#}\to u^{\#}} and u # # → → c # # {\displaystyle u^{\#}\to c^{\#}} if u : b → → c {\displaystyle u:b\to c} and where F # # {\displaystyle F^{\#}} is induced by F so that c # # {\displaystyle c^{\#}} would go to F ( c , c ) {\displaystyle F(c,c)} and u # # , u : b → → c {\displaystyle u^{\#},u:b\to c} would go to F ( b , c ) {\displaystyle F(b,c)} . For example, for functors F , G : C → → X {\displaystyle F,G:C\to X} , ∫ ∫ c ∈ ∈ C Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( F ( c ) , G ( c ) ) {\displaystyle \int _{c\in C}\operatorname {Hom} (F(c),G(c))} is the set of natural transformations from F to G . For more examples, see this mathoverflow thread . The dual of an end is a coend.

endofunctor A functor between the same category.

enriched category Given a monoidal category ( C , ⊗, 1), a category enriched over C is, informally, a category whose Hom sets are in C . More precisely, a category D enriched over C is a data consisting of A class of objects, For each pair of objects X , Y in D , an object Map D ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Map} _{D}(X,Y)} in C , called the mapping object from X to Y , For each triple of objects X , Y , Z in D , a morphism in C , ∘ ∘ : Map D ⁡ ⁡ ( Y , Z ) ⊗ ⊗ Map D ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Y ) → → Map D ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Z ) {\displaystyle \circ :\operatorname {Map} _{D}(Y,Z)\otimes \operatorname {Map} _{D}(X,Y)\to \operatorname {Map} _{D}(X,Z)} , called the composition, For each object X in D , a morphism 1 X : 1 → → Map D ⁡ ⁡ ( X , X ) {\displaystyle 1_{X}:1\to \operatorname {Map} _{D}(X,X)} in C , called the unit morphism of X subject to the conditions that (roughly) the compositions are associative and the unit morphisms act as the multiplicative identity.

For example, a category enriched over sets is an ordinary category.

epimorphism A morphism f is an epimorphism if g = h {\displaystyle g=h} whenever g ∘ ∘ f = h ∘ ∘ f {\displaystyle g\circ f=h\circ f} . In other words, f is the dual of a monomorphism.

{\displaystyle \mathbf {Fct} (C,D)\to D,\,\,F\mapsto F(A).} For example, the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms give an instance when the functor is an equivalence.

exact 1.  An exact sequence is typically a sequence (from arbitrary negative integers to arbitrary positive integers) of maps ⋯ ⋯ → → E 1 → → f 1 E 2 → → f 2 E 3 → → ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle \cdots \to E_{1}{\overset {f_{1}}{\to }}E_{2}{\overset {f_{2}}{\to }}E_{3}\to \cdots } such that the image of f i {\displaystyle f_{i}} is the kernel of f i + 1 {\displaystyle f_{i+1}} . The notion can be generalized in various ways.

fundamental groupoid The fundamental groupoid Π Π 1 X {\displaystyle \Pi _{1}X} of a Kan complex X is the category where an object is a 0-simplex (vertex) Δ Δ 0 → → X {\displaystyle \Delta ^{0}\to X} , a morphism is a homotopy class of a 1-simplex (path) Δ Δ 1 → → X {\displaystyle \Delta ^{1}\to X} and a composition is determined by the Kan property.

fibered category A functor π: C → D is said to exhibit C as a category fibered over D if, for each morphism g : x → π( y ) in D , there exists a π-cartesian morphism f : x' → y in C such that π( f ) = g . If D is the category of affine schemes (say of finite type over some field), then π is more commonly called a prestack .

Note : π is often a forgetful functor and in fact the Grothendieck construction implies that every fibered category can be taken to be that form (up to equivalences in a suitable sense).

fiber product Given a category C and a set I , the fiber product over an object S of a family of objects X i in C indexed by I is the product of the family in the slice category C / S {\displaystyle C_{/S}} of C over S (provided there are X i → → S {\displaystyle X_{i}\to S} ). The fiber product of two objects X and Y over an object S is denoted by X × × S Y {\displaystyle X\times _{S}Y} and is also called a Cartesian square .

For example, P : S e t → → S e t , S ↦ ↦ P ( S ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}:\mathbf {Set} \to \mathbf {Set} ,\,S\mapsto {\mathfrak {P}}(S)} , where P ( S ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}(S)} is the power set of S is a functor if we define: for each function f : S → → T {\displaystyle f:S\to T} , P ( f ) : P ( S ) → → P ( T ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}(f):{\mathfrak {P}}(S)\to {\mathfrak {P}}(T)} by P ( f ) ( A ) = f ( A ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}(f)(A)=f(A)} .

∞-category [T]he theory of ∞-categories is a semantic interpretation of the formal language of category theory. This means that one can systematically make sense of any statement formulated in the language of category theory in the setting of ∞-categories.

Denis-Charles Cisinski , [ 11 ] An ∞-category is obtained from a category by replacing the class/set of objects and morphisms by the spaces of objects and morphisms. Precisely, an ∞-category C is a simplicial set satisfying the following condition: for each 0 < i < n , every map of simplicial sets f : Λ Λ i n → → C {\displaystyle f:\Lambda _{i}^{n}\to C} extends to an n -simplex f : Δ Δ n → → C {\displaystyle f:\Delta ^{n}\to C} where Δ n is the standard n -simplex and Λ Λ i n {\displaystyle \Lambda _{i}^{n}} is obtained from Δ n by removing the i -th face and the interior (see Kan fibration#Definitions ). For example, the nerve of a category satisfies the condition and thus can be considered as an ∞-category.

{\displaystyle X\mapsto \varprojlim _{i}\operatorname {Hom} (X,f(i)).} 3.  The colimit (or inductive limit ) lim → → i ∈ ∈ I ⁡ ⁡ f ( i ) {\displaystyle \varinjlim _{i\in I}f(i)} is the dual of a limit; i.e., given a functor f : I → → C {\displaystyle f:I\to C} , it satisfies: for any X , Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( lim → → ⁡ ⁡ f ( i ) , X ) = lim ← ← ⁡ ⁡ Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( f ( i ) , X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (\varinjlim f(i),X)=\varprojlim \operatorname {Hom} (f(i),X)} . Explicitly, to give lim → → ⁡ ⁡ f ( i ) → → X {\displaystyle \varinjlim f(i)\to X} is to give a family of morphisms f ( i ) → → X {\displaystyle f(i)\to X} such that for any i → → j {\displaystyle i\to j} , f ( i ) → → X {\displaystyle f(i)\to X} is f ( i ) → → f ( j ) → → X {\displaystyle f(i)\to f(j)\to X} . Perhaps the simplest example of a colimit is a coequalizer . For another example, take f to be the identity functor on C and suppose L = lim → → X ∈ ∈ C ⁡ ⁡ f ( X ) {\displaystyle L=\varinjlim _{X\in C}f(X)} exists; then the identity morphism on L corresponds to a compatible family of morphisms α α X : X → → L {\displaystyle \alpha _{X}:X\to L} such that α α L {\displaystyle \alpha _{L}} is the identity. If f : X → → L {\displaystyle f:X\to L} is any morphism, then f = α α L ∘ ∘ f = α α X {\displaystyle f=\alpha _{L}\circ f=\alpha _{X}} ; i.e., L is a final object of C .

modular modular category monad A monad in a category X is a monoid object in the monoidal category of endofunctors of X with the monoidal structure given by composition. For example, given a group G , define an endofunctor T on Set by T ( X ) = G × × X {\displaystyle T(X)=G\times X} . Then define the multiplication μ on T as the natural transformation μ μ : T ∘ ∘ T → → T {\displaystyle \mu :T\circ T\to T} given by μ μ X : G × × ( G × × X ) → → G × × X , ( g , ( h , x ) ) ↦ ↦ ( g h , x ) {\displaystyle \mu _{X}:G\times (G\times X)\to G\times X,\,\,(g,(h,x))\mapsto (gh,x)} and also define the identity map η in the analogous fashion. Then ( T , μ , η ) constitutes a monad in Set . More substantially, an adjunction between functors F : X ⇄ ⇄ A : G {\displaystyle F:X\rightleftarrows A:G} determines a monad in X ; namely, one takes T = G ∘ ∘ F {\displaystyle T=G\circ F} , the identity map η on T to be a unit of the adjunction and also defines μ using the adjunction.

monadic 1.  An adjunction is said to be monadic if it comes from the monad that it determines by means of the Eilenberg–Moore category (the category of algebras for the monad).

2.  A functor is said to be monadic if it is a constituent of a monadic adjunction.

[ 14 ] N [ edit ] n -category [T]he issue of comparing definitions of weak n -category is a slippery one, as it is hard to say what it even means for two such definitions to be equivalent. [...] It is widely held that the structure formed by weak n -categories and the functors, transformations, ... between them should be a weak ( n + 1)-category; and if this is the case then the question is whether your weak ( n + 1)-category of weak n- categories is equivalent to mine—but whose definition of weak ( n + 1)-category are we using here... ?

Tom Leinster, A survey of definitions of n -category 1.  A strict n -category is defined inductively: a strict 0-category is a set and a strict n -category is a category whose Hom sets are strict ( n -1)-categories. Precisely, a strict n -category is a category enriched over strict ( n -1)-categories. For example, a strict 1-category is an ordinary category.

2.  The notion of a weak n -category is obtained from the strict one by weakening the conditions like associativity of composition to hold only up to coherent isomorphisms in the weak sense.

3.  One can define an ∞-category as a kind of a colim of n -categories. Conversely, if one has the notion of a (weak) ∞-category (say a quasi-category ) in the beginning, then a weak n -category can be defined as a type of a truncated ∞-category.

natural 1.  A natural transformation is, roughly, a map between functors. Precisely, given a pair of functors F , G from a category C to category D , a natural transformation φ from F to G is a set of morphisms in D { ϕ ϕ x : F ( x ) → → G ( x ) ∣ ∣ x ∈ ∈ Ob ⁡ ⁡ ( C ) } {\displaystyle \{\phi _{x}:F(x)\to G(x)\mid x\in \operatorname {Ob} (C)\}} satisfying the condition: for each morphism f : x → y in C , ϕ ϕ y ∘ ∘ F ( f ) = G ( f ) ∘ ∘ ϕ ϕ x {\displaystyle \phi _{y}\circ F(f)=G(f)\circ \phi _{x}} . For example, writing G L n ( R ) {\displaystyle GL_{n}(R)} for the group of invertible n -by- n matrices with coefficients in a commutative ring R , we can view G L n {\displaystyle GL_{n}} as a functor from the category CRing of commutative rings to the category Grp of groups. Similarly, R ↦ ↦ R ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle R\mapsto R^{*}} is a functor from CRing to Grp . Then the determinant det is a natural transformation from G L n {\displaystyle GL_{n}} to - * .

2.  A natural isomorphism is a natural transformation that is an isomorphism (i.e., admits the inverse).

nerve 1.  The nerve functor N is the functor from Cat to s Set given by N ( C ) n = Hom C a t ⁡ ⁡ ( [ n ] , C ) {\displaystyle N(C)_{n}=\operatorname {Hom} _{\mathbf {Cat} }([n],C)} . For example, if φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is a functor in N ( C ) 2 {\displaystyle N(C)_{2}} (called a 2-simplex), let x i = φ φ ( i ) , 0 ≤ ≤ i ≤ ≤ 2 {\displaystyle x_{i}=\varphi (i),\,0\leq i\leq 2} . Then φ φ ( 0 → → 1 ) {\displaystyle \varphi (0\to 1)} is a morphism f : x 0 → → x 1 {\displaystyle f:x_{0}\to x_{1}} in C and also φ φ ( 1 → → 2 ) = g : x 1 → → x 2 {\displaystyle \varphi (1\to 2)=g:x_{1}\to x_{2}} for some g in C . Since 0 → → 2 {\displaystyle 0\to 2} is 0 → → 1 {\displaystyle 0\to 1} followed by 1 → → 2 {\displaystyle 1\to 2} and since φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is a functor, φ φ ( 0 → → 2 ) = g ∘ ∘ f {\displaystyle \varphi (0\to 2)=g\circ f} . In other words, φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } encodes f , g and their compositions.

2.  The homotopy coherent nerve of a simplicially enriched category is a generalization. For a 2-category, it is called the Duskin nerve of it.

O [ edit ] object 1.  An object is part of a data defining a category.

2.  An [adjective] object in a category C is a contravariant functor (or presheaf) from some fixed category corresponding to the "adjective" to C . For example, a simplicial object in C is a contravariant functor from the simplicial category to C and a Γ-object is a pointed contravariant functor from Γ (roughly the pointed category of pointed finite sets) to C provided C is pointed.

op-fibration A functor π: C → D is an op-fibration if, for each object x in C and each morphism g : π( x ) → y in D , there is at least one π-coCartesian morphism f : x → y' in C such that π( f ) = g . In other words, π is the dual of a Grothendieck fibration .

stable An ∞-category is stable if (1) it has a zero object, (2) every morphism in it admits a fiber and a cofiber and (3) a triangle in it is a fiber sequence if and only if it is a cofiber sequence.

strict 1.  A morphism f in a category admitting finite limits and finite colimits is strict if the natural morphism Coim ⁡ ⁡ ( f ) → → Im ⁡ ⁡ ( f ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Coim} (f)\to \operatorname {Im} (f)} is an isomorphism.

2.  A strict epimorphism f is an eqimorphism such that for each pair of morphisms g , h {\displaystyle g,h} such that f ∘ ∘ g = f ∘ ∘ h {\displaystyle f\circ g=f\circ h} , we have f {\displaystyle f} is the coequalizer of g , h {\displaystyle g,h} .

3.  A strict monomorphism is a morphism such that it is a strict epimorphism in the opposite category.

strict n -category A strict 0-category is a set and for any integer n > 0, a strict n -category is a category enriched over strict ( n -1)-categories. For example, a strict 1-category is an ordinary category.

Note : the term " n -category" typically refers to " weak n -category "; not strict one.

strictification A strictification is a process of replacing equalities holding weakly (i.e., up to coherent isomorphisms) by actual equalities.

subcanonical A topology on a category is subcanonical if every representable contravariant functor on C is a sheaf with respect to that topology.

[ 18 ] Generally speaking, some flat topology may fail to be subcanonical; but flat topologies appearing in practice tend to be subcanonical.

subcategory A category A is a subcategory of a category B if there is an inclusion functor from A to B .

subobject Given an object A in a category, a subobject of A is an equivalence class of monomorphisms to A ; two monomorphisms f , g are considered equivalent if f factors through g and g factors through f .

subquotient 1.  A subquotient is a quotient of a subobject.

2.

subobject classifier .

subterminal object A subterminal object is an object X such that every object has at most one morphism into X .

symmetric monoidal category A symmetric monoidal category is a monoidal category (i.e., a category with ⊗) that has maximally symmetric braiding.

symmetric sequence A symmetric sequence is a sequence of objects with actions of symmetric groups . It is categorically equivalent to a (combinatorial) species .

syntactic category syntactic category T [ edit ] t-structure A t-structure is an additional structure on a triangulated category (more generally stable ∞-category ) that axiomatizes the notions of complexes whose cohomology concentrated in non-negative degrees or non-positive degrees.

Tannakian duality The Tannakian duality states that, in an appropriate setup, to give a morphism f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} is to give a pullback functor f ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle f^{*}} along it. In other words, the Hom set Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (X,Y)} can be identified with the functor category Fct ⁡ ⁡ ( D ( Y ) , D ( X ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Fct} (D(Y),D(X))} , perhaps in the derived sense , where D ( X ) {\displaystyle D(X)} is the category associated to X (e.g., the derived category).

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] tensor category Usually synonymous with monoidal category (though some authors distinguish between the two concepts.) tensor triangulated category A tensor triangulated category is a category that carries the structure of a symmetric monoidal category and that of a triangulated category in a compatible way.

tensor product Given a monoidal category B , the tensor product of functors F : C op → → B {\displaystyle F:C^{\text{op}}\to B} and G : C → → B {\displaystyle G:C\to B} is the coend: F ⊗ ⊗ C G = ∫ ∫ c ∈ ∈ C F ( c ) ⊗ ⊗ G ( c ) .

{\displaystyle F\otimes _{C}G=\int ^{c\in C}F(c)\otimes G(c).} terminal 1.  An object A is terminal (also called final) if there is exactly one morphism from each object to A ; e.g., singletons in Set . It is the dual of an initial object .

2.  An object A in an ∞-category C is terminal if Map C ⁡ ⁡ ( B , A ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Map} _{C}(B,A)} is contractible for every object B in C . See Quasi-category#Final objects and final maps .

Theta category Joyal's theta category is an alternative to the simplex category, that can be also used to defined an ∞-category.

thick subcategory A full subcategory of an abelian category is thick if it is closed under extensions.

thin A thin category is a category where there is at most one morphism between any pair of objects.

tiny A tiny object . For now, see https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/tiny+object topological topos A topological topos , a possible substitute for the category of topological spaces. See https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/04/on_a_topological_topos.html transfinite A transfinite composition is a composition involving infinitely many morphisms.

triangulated category A triangulated category is a category where one can talk about distinguished triangles, generalization of exact sequences. An abelian category is a prototypical example of a triangulated category. A derived category is a triangulated category that is not necessary an abelian category.

U [ edit ] universal 1.  Given a functor f : C → → D {\displaystyle f:C\to D} and an object X in D , a universal morphism from X to f is an initial object in the comma category ( X ↓ ↓ f ) {\displaystyle (X\downarrow f)} . (Its dual is also called a universal morphism.) For example, take f to be the forgetful functor V e c k → → S e t {\displaystyle \mathbf {Vec} _{k}\to \mathbf {Set} } and X a set. An initial object of ( X ↓ ↓ f ) {\displaystyle (X\downarrow f)} is a function j : X → → f ( V X ) {\displaystyle j:X\to f(V_{X})} . That it is initial means that if k : X → → f ( W ) {\displaystyle k:X\to f(W)} is another morphism, then there is a unique morphism from j to k , which consists of a linear map V X → → W {\displaystyle V_{X}\to W} that extends k via j ; that is to say, V X {\displaystyle V_{X}} is the free vector space generated by X .

2.  Stated more explicitly, given f as above, a morphism X → → f ( u X ) {\displaystyle X\to f(u_{X})} in D is universal if and only if the natural map Hom C ⁡ ⁡ ( u X , c ) → → Hom D ⁡ ⁡ ( X , f ( c ) ) , α α ↦ ↦ ( X → → f ( u x ) → → f ( α α ) f ( c ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} _{C}(u_{X},c)\to \operatorname {Hom} _{D}(X,f(c)),\,\alpha \mapsto (X\to f(u_{x}){\overset {f(\alpha )}{\to }}f(c))} is bijective. In particular, if Hom C ⁡ ⁡ ( u X , − − ) ≃ ≃ Hom D ⁡ ⁡ ( X , f ( − − ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} _{C}(u_{X},-)\simeq \operatorname {Hom} _{D}(X,f(-))} , then taking c to be u X one gets a universal morphism by sending the identity morphism. In other words, having a universal morphism is equivalent to the representability of the functor Hom D ⁡ ⁡ ( X , f ( − − ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} _{D}(X,f(-))} .

V [ edit ] Verdier localization Verdier localization W [ edit ] Waldhausen category A Waldhausen category is, roughly, a category with families of cofibrations and weak equivalences.

wellpowered A category is wellpowered if for each object there is only a set of pairwise non-isomorphic subobjects .

Y [ edit ] Yoneda 1.

Yoneda’s Lemma asserts ... in more evocative terms, a mathematical object X is best thought of in the context of a category surrounding it, and is determined by the network of relations it enjoys with all the objects of that category. Moreover, to understand X it might be more germane to deal directly with the functor representing it. This is reminiscent of Wittgenstein’s ’language game’; i.e., that the meaning of a word is—in essence—determined by, in fact is nothing more than, its relations to all the utterances in a language.

Barry Mazur , Thinking about Grothendieck The Yoneda lemma says: for each set-valued contravariant functor F on C and an object X in C , there is a natural bijection F ( X ) ≃ ≃ Nat ⁡ ⁡ ( Hom C ⁡ ⁡ ( − − , X ) , F ) {\displaystyle F(X)\simeq \operatorname {Nat} (\operatorname {Hom} _{C}(-,X),F)} where Nat means the set of natural transformations. In particular, the functor y : C → → F c t ( C op , S e t ) , X ↦ ↦ Hom C ⁡ ⁡ ( − − , X ) {\displaystyle y:C\to \mathbf {Fct} (C^{\text{op}},\mathbf {Set} ),\,X\mapsto \operatorname {Hom} _{C}(-,X)} is fully faithful and is called the Yoneda embedding.

[ 21 ] 2.  If F : C → → D {\displaystyle F:C\to D} is a functor and y is the Yoneda embedding of C , then the Yoneda extension of F is the left Kan extension of F along y .

3.

2-Yoneda lemma is an extension of the Yoneda lemma to 2-categories.

Z [ edit ] zero A zero object is an object that is both initial and terminal, such as a trivial group in Grp .

Notes [ edit ] ^ If one believes in the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals , then there can be a rigorous theory where statements and constructions have references to Grothendieck universes .
