In [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics"), **compactification** means changing a theory with respect to one of its [space-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime")[dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension"). Instead of having a theory with this dimension being infinite, one changes the theory so that this dimension has a finite length, and may also be [periodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function "Periodic function").

Compactification plays an important part in [thermal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_quantum_field_theory "Thermal quantum field theory") where one compactifies time, in [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory") where one compactifies the [extra dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Extra_dimensions "String theory") of the theory, and in two- or one-dimensional [solid state physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_physics "Solid-state physics"), where one considers a system which is limited in one of the three usual spatial dimensions.

At the limit where the size of the compact dimension goes to zero, no fields depend on this extra dimension, and the theory is [dimensionally reduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_reduction "Dimensional reduction").

The space _M_ × _C_ is compactified over the compact C and after Kaluza–Klein decomposition, we have an [effective field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_theory "Effective field theory") over M.

In string theory, compactification is a generalization of [Kaluza–Klein theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory "Kaluza–Klein theory").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactification_(physics)#cite_note-1) It tries to reconcile the gap between the conception of our universe based on its four observable dimensions with the ten, eleven, or twenty-six dimensions which theoretical equations lead us to suppose the universe is made with.

For this purpose it is assumed the [extra dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Extra_dimensions "String theory") are "wrapped" up on themselves, or "curled" up on [Calabi–Yau spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold "Calabi–Yau manifold"), or on [orbifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbifold "Orbifold"). Models in which the compact directions support [fluxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux "Flux") are known as _flux compactifications_. The [coupling constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_constant "Coupling constant") of [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"), which determines the probability of strings splitting and reconnecting, can be described by a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)") called a [dilaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilaton "Dilaton"). This in turn can be described as the size of an extra (eleventh) dimension which is compact. In this way, the ten-dimensional [type IIA string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Dualities "String theory") can be described as the compactification of [M-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory "M-theory") in eleven dimensions. Furthermore, [different versions of string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Dualities "String theory") are related by different compactifications in a procedure known as [T-duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-duality "T-duality").

The formulation of more precise versions of the meaning of compactification in this context has been promoted by discoveries such as the mysterious duality.

Flux compactification

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compactification_(physics)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Flux compactification")]

A **flux compactification** is a particular way to deal with additional dimensions required by string theory.

It assumes that the shape of the internal [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") is a Calabi–Yau manifold or [generalized Calabi–Yau manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_complex_structure "Generalized complex structure") which is equipped with non-zero values of fluxes, i.e. [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form"), that generalize the concept of an [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field") (see [p-form electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-form_electrodynamics "P-form electrodynamics")).

The hypothetical concept of the [anthropic landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory_landscape "String theory landscape") in string theory follows from a large number of possibilities in which the integers that characterize the fluxes can be chosen without violating rules of string theory. The flux compactifications can be described as [F-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-theory "F-theory") vacua or [type IIB string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_string_theory "Type II string theory") vacua with or without [D-branes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-brane "D-brane").
