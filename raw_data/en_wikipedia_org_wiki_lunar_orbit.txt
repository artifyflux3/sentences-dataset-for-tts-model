[Orion capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_capsule "Orion capsule") of [Artemis 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_1 "Artemis 1") above the Moon in December 2022.

In [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") and [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight"), a **lunar orbit** (also known as a **selenocentric orbit**) is an [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") by an object around Earth's [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"). In general these orbits are not circular. When farthest from the Moon (at [apoapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoapsis "Apoapsis")) a spacecraft is said to be at **apolune**, **apocynthion**, or **aposelene**. When closest to the Moon (at [periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapsis "Periapsis")) it is said to be at **perilune**, **pericynthion**, or **periselene**. These derive from names or epithets of the [moon goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_goddess "Moon goddess").

**Lunar orbit insertion** (**LOI**) is an [orbit insertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_insertion "Orbit insertion") maneuver used to achieve lunar orbit.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-1)

**Low lunar orbit** (**LLO**) is an orbit below 100 km (62 mi) altitude. These have a period of about 2 hours.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-nasa20061106-2) They are of particular interest in the [exploration of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_the_Moon "Exploration of the Moon"), but suffer from gravitational [perturbations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy) "Perturbation (astronomy)") that make most unstable, and leave only a few orbital [trajectories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory") possible for indefinite _[frozen orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen\_orbit "Frozen orbit")_. These would be useful for long-term stays in LLO.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-nasa20061106-2)

Perturbation effects and low orbits
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lunar_orbit&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Perturbation effects and low orbits")]

Most lunar low orbits below 100 km (62 mi) are unstable.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-nasa20061106-2)

[Lunar Module _Eagle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Module_Eagle "Lunar Module Eagle") in lunar orbit during [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11"), July 1969

Gravitational anomalies slightly distorting the orbits of some Lunar Orbiters led to the discovery of [mass concentrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_concentration_(astronomy) "Mass concentration (astronomy)") (dubbed **mascons**) beneath the lunar surface caused by large impacting bodies at some remote time in the past.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-nasa20061106-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-3) These anomalies are large enough to cause a lunar orbit to change significantly over the course of several days. They can cause a plumb bob to hang about a third of a degree off vertical, pointing toward the mascon, and increase the force of gravity by one-half percent.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-nasa20061106-2) The [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11") first manned landing mission employed the first attempt to correct for the perturbation effect (the frozen orbits were not known at that time). The parking orbit was "circularized" at 66 by 54 nautical miles (122 by 100 km; 76 by 62 mi), which was expected to become the nominal circular 60 nautical miles (110 km; 69 mi) when the LM made its return [rendezvous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous "Space rendezvous") with the CSM. But the effect was overestimated by a factor of two; at rendezvous, the orbit was calculated to be 63.2 by 56.8 nautical miles (117.0 by 105.2 km; 72.7 by 65.4 mi). [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-Apollo_11_Mission_Report-4)

Study of the mascons' effect on lunar spacecraft led to the discovery in 2001 of [frozen orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_orbit "Frozen orbit") occurring at four [orbital inclinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination "Orbital inclination"): 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86°, in which a spacecraft can stay in a low orbit indefinitely.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-nasa20061106-2) The [Apollo 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_15 "Apollo 15") subsatellite [PFS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFS-1 "PFS-1") and the [Apollo 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_16 "Apollo 16") subsatellite [PFS-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFS-2 "PFS-2"), both small satellites released from the Apollo [Service Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Command/Service_Module#Service_Module_(SM) "Apollo Command/Service Module"), contributed to this discovery. PFS-1 ended up in a long-lasting orbit, at 28° [inclination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination "Orbital inclination"), and successfully completed its mission after one and a half years. PFS-2 was placed in a particularly unstable orbital inclination of 11°, and lasted only 35 days in orbit before crashing into the lunar surface.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-nasa20061106-2)

For lunar orbits with altitudes in the 500 to 20,000 km (310 to 12,430 mi) range, the gravity of Earth leads to orbit [perturbations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy) "Perturbation (astronomy)"). At altitudes higher than that perturbed two-body [astrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodynamics "Astrodynamics") models are insufficient and [three-body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem "Three-body problem") models are required.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-ely-2005-5)

Although the Moon's [Hill sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere "Hill sphere") extends to a radius of 60,000 km (37,000 mi),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-6) the gravity of Earth intervenes enough to make lunar orbits unstable at a distance of 690 km (430 mi).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-Phys.org_2006_k599-7)

The [Lagrange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point "Lagrange point") of the Earth-Moon system can provide stable orbits in the lunar vicinity, such as [halo orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit "Halo orbit") and [distant retrograde orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_retrograde_orbit "Distant retrograde orbit").

Some halo orbits remain over particular regions of the lunar surface. These can be used by lunar [relay satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_satellite "Relay satellite") to communicate with surface stations on the [far side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon "Far side of the Moon"). The first to do this was the 2019 [Queqiao relay satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queqiao_relay_satellite "Queqiao relay satellite"). It was placed around Earth-Moon L2 at roughly 65,000 km (40,000 mi) from the Moon.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-8)

Since 2022 ([CAPSTONE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPSTONE "CAPSTONE")) [near-rectilinear halo orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-rectilinear_halo_orbit "Near-rectilinear halo orbit"), using as well a Lagrange point, have been used and are planned to be employed by the [Lunar Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Gateway "Lunar Gateway").

Overview of NRHOs around the Moon

There are three main ways to get to lunar orbit from Earth: direct transfer, [low thrust transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_thrust_relative_orbital_transfer "Low thrust relative orbital transfer") and [low-energy transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-energy_transfer "Low-energy transfer"). These take 3–4 days, [_[word missing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup "Wikipedia:Cleanup")_] months or 2.5–4 months respectively.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-The_Aerospace_Corporation_2023_j509-9)

History of missions to lunar orbit

First image of Earth from around another [astronomical object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") (the Moon), and first picture of both Earth and the Moon from space, by [Lunar Orbiter 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_1 "Lunar Orbiter 1") (not to be confused with the later [Earthrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise "Earthrise") image). [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-Smith-11)

The [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") sent the first spacecraft to the vicinity of the Moon (or any extraterrestrial object), the robotic vehicle [Luna 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_1 "Luna 1"), on January 4, 1959.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-mark-12) It passed within 6,000 kilometres (3,200 nmi; 3,700 mi) of the Moon's surface, but did not achieve lunar orbit.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-mark-12)[Luna 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_3 "Luna 3"), launched on October 4, 1959, was the first robotic spacecraft to complete a [circumlunar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumlunar_trajectory "Circumlunar trajectory")[free return trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_return_trajectory "Free return trajectory"), still not a lunar orbit, but a figure-8 trajectory which swung around the [far side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon "Far side of the Moon") and returned to Earth. This craft provided the first pictures of the far side of the Lunar surface.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-mark-12)

[Luna 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_10 "Luna 10") became the first spacecraft to actually orbit the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") and any extraterrestrial body in April 1966.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-beyers-13) It studied [micrometeoroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometeoroid "Micrometeoroid") flux, and lunar environment until May 30, 1966.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-beyers-13) A follow-on mission, [Luna 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_11 "Luna 11"), was launched on August 24, 1966, and studied lunar gravitational anomalies, radiation and solar wind measurements.

The first United States spacecraft to orbit the Moon was [Lunar Orbiter 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_1 "Lunar Orbiter 1") on August 14, 1966.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-orbiter-14) The first orbit was an [elliptical orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_orbit "Elliptical orbit"), with an [apolune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolune "Apolune") of 1,008 nautical miles (1,867 km; 1,160 mi) and a [perilune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perilune "Perilune") of 102.1 nautical miles (189.1 km; 117.5 mi).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-15) Then the orbit was circularized at around 170 nautical miles (310 km; 200 mi) to obtain suitable imagery. Five such spacecraft were launched over a period of thirteen months, all of which successfully mapped the Moon, primarily for the purpose of finding suitable [Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program") landing sites.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-orbiter-14)

### Crewed and later orbiters

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lunar_orbit&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Crewed and later orbiters")]

The [Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program")'s [Command/Service Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Command/Service_Module "Apollo Command/Service Module") (CSM) remained in a lunar parking orbit while the [Lunar Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module "Apollo Lunar Module") (LM) landed. The combined CSM/LM would first enter an elliptical orbit, nominally 170 by 60 nautical miles (310 by 110 km; 196 by 69 mi), which was then changed to a circular parking orbit of about 60 nautical miles (110 km; 69 mi). Orbital periods vary according to the sum of [apoapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoapsis "Apoapsis") and [periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapsis "Periapsis"), and for the CSM were about two hours. The LM began its landing sequence with a Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI) burn to lower their [periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapsis "Periapsis") to about 50,000 feet (15 km; 8.2 nmi), chosen to avoid hitting [lunar mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_on_the_Moon "List of mountains on the Moon") reaching heights of 20,000 feet (6.1 km; 3.3 nmi). After the second landing mission, the procedure was changed on [Apollo 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_14 "Apollo 14") to save more of the LM fuel for its powered descent, by using the CSM's fuel to perform the DOI burn, and later raising its [periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapsis "Periapsis") back to a circular orbit after the LM had made its landing.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit#cite_note-a11fj-16)
