In complex analysis , a branch of mathematics , Morera's theorem , named after Giacinto Morera , gives a criterion for proving that a function is holomorphic .

Morera's theorem states that a continuous , complex -valued function f defined on an open set D in the complex plane that satisfies ∮ ∮ γ γ f ( z ) d z = 0 {\displaystyle \oint _{\gamma }f(z)\,dz=0} for every closed piecewise C 1 curve γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } in D must be holomorphic on D .

The assumption of Morera's theorem is equivalent to f having an antiderivative on D .

The converse of the theorem is not true in general. A holomorphic function need not possess an antiderivative on its domain, unless one imposes additional assumptions. The converse does hold e.g. if the domain is simply connected ; this is Cauchy's integral theorem , stating that the line integral of a holomorphic function along a closed curve is zero.

The standard counterexample is the function f ( z ) = 1/ z , which is holomorphic on C − {0}.  On any simply connected neighborhood U in C − {0}, 1/ z has an antiderivative defined by L ( z ) = ln( r ) + iθ , where z = re iθ . Because of the ambiguity of θ up to the addition of any integer multiple of 2 π , any continuous choice of θ on U will suffice to define an antiderivative of 1/ z on U .  (It is the fact that θ cannot be defined continuously on a simple closed curve containing the origin in its interior that is the root of why 1/ z has no antiderivative on its entire domain C − {0}.) And because the derivative of an additive constant is 0, any constant may be added to the antiderivative and the result will still be an antiderivative of 1/ z .

In a certain sense, the 1/ z counterexample is universal: For every analytic function that has no antiderivative on its domain, the reason for this is that 1/ z itself does not have an antiderivative on C − {0}.

Proof [ edit ] The integrals along two paths from a to b are equal, since their difference is the integral along a closed loop.

There is a relatively elementary proof of the theorem.  One constructs an anti-derivative for f explicitly.

Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that D is connected . Fix a point z 0 in D , and for any z ∈ ∈ D {\displaystyle z\in D} , let γ γ : [ 0 , 1 ] → → D {\displaystyle \gamma :[0,1]\to D} be a piecewise C 1 curve such that γ γ ( 0 ) = z 0 {\displaystyle \gamma (0)=z_{0}} and γ γ ( 1 ) = z {\displaystyle \gamma (1)=z} . Then define the function F to be F ( z ) = ∫ ∫ γ γ f ( ζ ζ ) d ζ ζ .

{\displaystyle F(z)=\int _{\gamma }f(\zeta )\,d\zeta .} To see that the function is well-defined, suppose τ τ : [ 0 , 1 ] → → D {\displaystyle \tau :[0,1]\to D} is another piecewise C 1 curve such that τ τ ( 0 ) = z 0 {\displaystyle \tau (0)=z_{0}} and τ τ ( 1 ) = z {\displaystyle \tau (1)=z} . The curve γ γ τ τ − − 1 {\displaystyle \gamma \tau ^{-1}} (i.e. the curve combining γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } with τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } in reverse) is a closed piecewise C 1 curve in D . Then, ∫ ∫ γ γ f ( ζ ζ ) d ζ ζ + ∫ ∫ τ τ − − 1 f ( ζ ζ ) d ζ ζ = ∮ ∮ γ γ τ τ − − 1 f ( ζ ζ ) d ζ ζ = 0.

{\displaystyle \int _{\gamma }f(\zeta )\,d\zeta +\int _{\tau ^{-1}}f(\zeta )\,d\zeta =\oint _{\gamma \tau ^{-1}}f(\zeta )\,d\zeta =0.} And it follows that ∫ ∫ γ γ f ( ζ ζ ) d ζ ζ = ∫ ∫ τ τ f ( ζ ζ ) d ζ ζ .

{\displaystyle \int _{\gamma }f(\zeta )\,d\zeta =\int _{\tau }f(\zeta )\,d\zeta .} Then using the continuity of f to estimate difference quotients, we get that F ′( z ) = f ( z ).  Had we chosen a different z 0 in D , F would change by a constant: namely, the result of integrating f along any piecewise regular curve between the new z 0 and the old, and this does not change the derivative.

Since f is the derivative of the holomorphic function F , it is holomorphic. The fact that derivatives of holomorphic functions are holomorphic can be proved by using the fact that holomorphic functions are analytic , i.e. can be represented by a convergent power series , and the fact that power series may be differentiated term by term.  This completes the proof.

Applications [ edit ] Morera's theorem is a standard tool in complex analysis .  It is used in almost any argument that involves a non-algebraic construction of a holomorphic function.

Uniform limits [ edit ] For example, suppose that f 1 , f 2 , ... is a sequence of holomorphic functions, converging uniformly to a continuous function f on an open disc.  By Cauchy's theorem , we know that ∮ ∮ C f n ( z ) d z = 0 {\displaystyle \oint _{C}f_{n}(z)\,dz=0} for every n , along any closed curve C in the disc.  Then the uniform convergence implies that ∮ ∮ C f ( z ) d z = ∮ ∮ C lim n → → ∞ ∞ f n ( z ) d z = lim n → → ∞ ∞ ∮ ∮ C f n ( z ) d z = 0 {\displaystyle \oint _{C}f(z)\,dz=\oint _{C}\lim _{n\to \infty }f_{n}(z)\,dz=\lim _{n\to \infty }\oint _{C}f_{n}(z)\,dz=0} for every closed curve C , and therefore by Morera's theorem f must be holomorphic.  This fact can be used to show that, for any open set Ω ⊆ C , the set A (Ω) of all bounded , analytic functions u : Ω → C is a Banach space with respect to the supremum norm .

Infinite sums and integrals [ edit ] Morera's theorem can also be used in conjunction with Fubini's theorem and the Weierstrass M-test to show the analyticity of functions defined by sums or integrals, such as the Riemann zeta function ζ ζ ( s ) = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 n s {\displaystyle \zeta (s)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n^{s}}}} or the Gamma function Γ Γ ( α α ) = ∫ ∫ 0 ∞ ∞ x α α − − 1 e − − x d x .

{\displaystyle \Gamma (\alpha )=\int _{0}^{\infty }x^{\alpha -1}e^{-x}\,dx.} Specifically one shows that ∮ ∮ C Γ Γ ( α α ) d α α = 0 {\displaystyle \oint _{C}\Gamma (\alpha )\,d\alpha =0} for a suitable closed curve C , by writing ∮ ∮ C Γ Γ ( α α ) d α α = ∮ ∮ C ∫ ∫ 0 ∞ ∞ x α α − − 1 e − − x d x d α α {\displaystyle \oint _{C}\Gamma (\alpha )\,d\alpha =\oint _{C}\int _{0}^{\infty }x^{\alpha -1}e^{-x}\,dx\,d\alpha } and then using Fubini's theorem to justify changing the order of integration, getting ∫ ∫ 0 ∞ ∞ ∮ ∮ C x α α − − 1 e − − x d α α d x = ∫ ∫ 0 ∞ ∞ e − − x ∮ ∮ C x α α − − 1 d α α d x .

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }\oint _{C}x^{\alpha -1}e^{-x}\,d\alpha \,dx=\int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-x}\oint _{C}x^{\alpha -1}\,d\alpha \,dx.} Then one uses the analyticity of α ↦ x α −1 to conclude that ∮ ∮ C x α α − − 1 d α α = 0 , {\displaystyle \oint _{C}x^{\alpha -1}\,d\alpha =0,} and hence the double integral above is 0.  Similarly, in the case of the zeta function, the M-test justifies interchanging the integral along the closed curve and the sum.

Weakening of hypotheses [ edit ] The hypotheses of Morera's theorem can be weakened considerably.  In particular, it suffices for the integral ∮ ∮ ∂ ∂ T f ( z ) d z {\displaystyle \oint _{\partial T}f(z)\,dz} to be zero for every closed (solid) triangle T contained in the region D . This in fact characterizes holomorphy, i.e.

f is holomorphic on D if and only if the above conditions hold. It also implies the following generalisation of the aforementioned fact about uniform limits of holomorphic functions: if f 1 , f 2 , ... is a sequence of holomorphic functions defined on an open set Ω ⊆ C that converges to a function f uniformly on compact subsets of Ω, then f is holomorphic.
