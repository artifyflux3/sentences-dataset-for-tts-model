Stokes (2023) [ 1 ] President, University of New Mexico President and CEO John C. Mester [ 1 ] Website URA The Universities Research Association ( URA ) is a non-profit association of more than 90 research universities , primarily but not exclusively in the United States. It has members also in Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1965 at the behest of the President's Science Advisory Committee and the National Academy of Sciences to build and operate Fermilab , a National Accelerator Laboratory .

History [ edit ] The President's Science Advisory Committee and a sister group of the United States Atomic Energy Commission joined forces in 1962 to "assess the future needs in high-energy accelerator physics." [ 2 ] The panel's recommendations, issued in 1963, included the need to immediately commence design and construction on 200 GeV proton accelerators . An additional recommendation called for a new administrative construct.

[ 2 ] On January 17, 1965, the National Academy of Sciences addressed the last recommendation by sponsoring a meeting of presidents from 25 research universities to discuss the management of the accelerator facility that would later become the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). The meeting eventually resulted in the decision to form the Universities Research Association, with 34 original members, to build and manage the new accelerator facility. URA filed its articles of incorporation on June 21, 1965. J. C. Warner, president of the Carnegie Institute of Technology , served as URA's first president.

Projects [ edit ] URA has helped develop the Tevatron at Fermilab. Its early activities are related to the Superconducting Supercollider , the Pierre Auger Observatory , the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF), and the associated Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), and involvement in the Honeywell International-led National Technology and Engineering Solutions at Sandia (NTESS) that manages and operates Sandia National Laboratories . Current major projects of the association include supporting Fermilab through a partnership with the University of Chicago and coordinating U.S. support of the Pierre Auger Cosmic Observatory.
