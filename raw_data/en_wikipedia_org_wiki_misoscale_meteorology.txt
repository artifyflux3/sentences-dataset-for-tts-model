[ 1 ] This scale was proposed by Ted Fujita , the founder of the Fujita scale , to classify phenomenon of the order of the rotation within a thunderstorm , the scale of the funnel cloud or a tornado , and the size of the swath of destruction of a microburst .

[ 2 ] It is a subdivision of the microscale .
