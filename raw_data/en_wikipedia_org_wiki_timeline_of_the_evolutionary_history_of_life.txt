Dates in this article are consensus estimates based on scientific evidence , mainly fossils .

In biology , evolution is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of biological organization , from kingdoms to species , and individual organisms and molecules , such as DNA and proteins . The similarities between all present day organisms imply a common ancestor from which all known species, living and extinct , have diverged. More than 99 percent of all species that ever lived (over five billion) [ 1 ] are estimated to be extinct .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, [ 4 ] with about 1.2 million or 14% documented, the rest not yet described .

[ 5 ] However, a 2016 report estimates an additional 1 trillion microbial species, with only 0.001% described.

[ 6 ] There has been controversy between more traditional views of steadily increasing biodiversity , and a newer view of cycles of annihilation and diversification, so that certain past times, such as the Cambrian explosion , experienced maximums of diversity followed by sharp winnowing.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Extinction [ edit ] Main article: Extinction event Visual representation of the history of life on Earth as a spiral Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. At long irregular intervals, Earth's biosphere suffers a catastrophic die-off, a mass extinction , [ 9 ] often comprising an accumulation of smaller extinction events over a relatively brief period.

[ 10 ] The first known mass extinction was the Great Oxidation Event 2.4 billion years ago, which killed most of the planet's obligate anaerobes . Researchers have identified five other major extinction events in Earth's history, with estimated losses below: [ 11 ] End Ordovician : 440 million years ago, 86% of all species lost, including most [ 12 ] graptolites Late Devonian : 375 million years ago, 75% of species lost, including most trilobites End Permian , The Great Dying: 251 million years ago, 96% of species lost, including tabulate corals , and most trees and synapsids End Triassic : 200 million years ago, 80% of species lost, including all conodonts End Cretaceous : 66 million years ago, 76% of species lost, including all ammonites , mosasaurs , plesiosaurs , pterosaurs , and nonavian dinosaurs Smaller extinction events have occurred in the periods between, with some dividing geologic time periods and epochs. The Holocene extinction event is currently under way.

[ 13 ] Factors in mass extinctions include continental drift , changes in atmospheric and marine chemistry , volcanism and other aspects of mountain formation , changes in glaciation , changes in sea level , and impact events .

[ 10 ] Detailed timeline [ edit ] In this timeline, Ma (for megaannum ) means "million years ago," ka (for kiloannum ) means "thousand years ago," and ya means "years ago." Hadean Eon [ edit ] Moon Main article: Hadean 4540 Ma – 4031 Ma Date Event 4540 Ma Planet Earth forms from the accretion disc revolving around the young Sun , perhaps preceded by formation of organic compounds necessary for life in the surrounding protoplanetary disk of cosmic dust .

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] 4510 Ma According to the giant-impact hypothesis , the Moon originated when Earth and the hypothesized planet Theia collided, sending into orbit myriad moonlets which eventually coalesced into our single Moon.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] The Moon's gravitational pull stabilised Earth's fluctuating axis of rotation , setting up regular climatic conditions favoring abiogenesis .

[ 18 ] 4404 Ma Evidence of the first liquid water on Earth which were found in the oldest known zircon crystals.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] 4100–3800 Ma Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB): extended barrage by meteoroids impacting the inner planets. Thermal flux from widespread hydrothermal activity during the LHB may have aided abiogenesis and life's early diversification.

[ 26 ] Possible remains of biotic life were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia .

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] 4000 Ma Formation of a greenstone belt of the Acasta Gneiss of the Slave craton in northwest Canada - the oldest known rock belt.

[ 29 ] 3900–2500 Ma Cells resembling prokaryotes appear.

[ 30 ] These first organisms are believed to have been chemoautotrophs , using carbon dioxide as a carbon source and oxidizing inorganic materials to extract energy.

3800 Ma Formation of a greenstone belt of the Isua complex in western Greenland , whose isotope frequencies suggest the presence of life.

[ 29 ] The earliest evidence for life on Earth includes: 3.8 billion-year-old biogenic hematite in a banded iron formation of the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt in Canada; [ 31 ] graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in western Greenland; [ 32 ] and microbial mat fossils in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia .

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] 3800–3500 Ma Last universal common ancestor (LUCA): [ 35 ] [ 36 ] split between bacteria and archaea .

[ 37 ] Bacteria develop primitive photosynthesis , which at first did not produce oxygen .

[ 38 ] These organisms exploit a proton gradient to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a mechanism used by virtually all subsequent organisms.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] 3000 Ma Photosynthesizing cyanobacteria using water as a reducing agent and producing oxygen as a waste product.

[ 42 ] Free oxygen initially oxidizes dissolved iron in the oceans, creating iron ore . Oxygen concentration in the atmosphere slowly rises, poisoning many bacteria and eventually triggering the Great Oxygenation Event .

2800 Ma Oldest evidence for microbial life on land in the form of organic matter-rich paleosols , ephemeral ponds and alluvial sequences, some bearing microfossils .

[ 43 ] Proterozoic Eon [ edit ] Detail of the eukaryote endomembrane system and its components Blepharisma japonicum , a free-living ciliated protozoan Dickinsonia costata , an iconic Ediacaran organism , displays the characteristic quilted appearance of Ediacaran enigmata.

[ 50 ] By 1200 Ma Meiosis and sexual reproduction in single-celled eukaryotes, possibly even in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes [ 51 ] or in the RNA world .

[ 52 ] Sexual reproduction may have increased the rate of evolution.

[ 53 ] By 1000 Ma First non-marine eukaryotes move onto land. They were photosynthetic and multicellular, indicating that plants evolved much earlier than originally thought.

[ 54 ] 750 Ma Beginning of animal evolution .

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] 720–630 Ma Possible global glaciation [ 57 ] [ 58 ] which increased the atmospheric oxygen and decreased carbon dioxide , and was either caused by land plant evolution [ 59 ] or resulted in it.

[ 60 ] Opinion is divided on whether it increased or decreased biodiversity or the rate of evolution.

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] 600 Ma Accumulation of atmospheric oxygen allows the formation of an ozone layer .

[ 64 ] Previous land-based life would probably have required other chemicals to attenuate ultraviolet radiation.

[ 90 ] 251.9–251.4 Ma The Permian–Triassic extinction event eliminates over 90-95% of marine species. Terrestrial organisms were not as seriously affected as the marine biota. This "clearing of the slate" may have led to an ensuing diversification, but life on land took 30 million years to completely recover.

Because the Moon helps stabilize the tilt of the Earth's rotation, it prevents the Earth from wobbling between climatic extremes. Without the Moon, seasonal shifts would likely outpace even the most adaptable forms of life.

The oldest fossils of footprints ever found on land hint that animals may have beaten plants out of the primordial seas. Lobster-sized, centipede-like animals made the prints wading out of the ocean and scuttling over sand dunes about 530 million years ago. Previous fossils indicated that animals didn't take this step until 40 million years later.

Viruses of nearly all the major classes of organisms - animals, plants, fungi and bacteria / archaea - probably evolved with their hosts in the seas, given that most of the evolution of life on this planet has occurred there. This means that viruses also probably emerged from the waters with their different hosts, during the successive waves of colonisation of the terrestrial environment.

National Geographic . Archived from the original on February 23, 2021 . Retrieved 2022-06-22 .

The model shows that modern bees started diversifying at a breakneck pace about 114 million years ago, right around the time that eudicots—the plant group that comprises 75 percent of flowering plants—started branching out. The results, which confirm some earlier genetic studies, strengthen the case that flowering plants and pollinating bees have coevolved from the very beginning.
