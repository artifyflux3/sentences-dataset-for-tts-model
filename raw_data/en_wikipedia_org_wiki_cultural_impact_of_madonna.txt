[ 168 ] Public persona [ edit ] Lucy O'Brien (sic) "it has often been asked, who is the 'real' Madonna?", with many using the phrase " Who's That Girl "?

[ 169 ] Madonna's public persona was scrutinized during the height of career and retrospectively. In 2006, Swedish author Maria Wikse said that "most of her critics" recognize her ever-changing persona and it influenced the way she was "read".

[ 170 ] In American Icons (2006), professor Diane Pecknold held that her persona also contributed to the rise of the Madonna studies .

[ 30 ] In 1991, author Graham Cray from Third Way opined that she has "skilfully developed a persona" complementing her as a "complex persona and phenomenon" that requires a "detailed analysis".

[ 171 ] She was described as a woman constantly searching for a "new self", [ 172 ] and self-actualization .

[ 173 ] In her Madonna biography, Lucy O'Brien was critical in this aspect, saying: "I have always found her work clear and autobiographical, but her personality complex and disarmingly changeable".

[ 169 ] Dick Weissman considered her the "Queen of role reversal ", but also noting that "complex analyses of her persona" are "difficult".

[ 174 ] In Popular Music: The Key Concepts (2002), lumps Madonna within general aspects of music star's changing personas (that may change across time).

[ 176 ] For both her image changes and personas, author Jasmina Tešanović was overall positive, saying in 2013, "would you expect a magician to be sincere once he performs his tricks in order to marvel you? [...] I would call Madonna as one of the most honest performers in pop culture. She always showed us the dirty laundry in the pop business".

[ 177 ] As a result, Madonna's reputation might varied to public opinion, playing both for and against her. Long considered calculated with her image, Chris Smith said in 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music (2007) that it helped her reach a status of "near-legendary cultural phenomenon".

[ 180 ] It also left a mark in her industry, although Karla Starr from Seattle Weekly said in 2008, that "the fact she is seen as the first female artist with complete control over her image [...] is now so ingrained that we forget how significant it really is".

[ 181 ] At the same time, her hyperactivity and open personality also played both for and against her, with Roger Blackwell and Tina Stephan agreeing that her "personally usually overshadows her musical product".

[ 202 ] Her wide range impact in the sector was defined by L. Fuller in Sport, Rhetoric, and Gender: Historical Perspectives and Media Representations (2006): Perhaps the most pronounced example of a celebrity whose active body has been marketed and consumed in diverse and ambiguous ways is singer/actress Madonna, not an "athlete" per se.

[ 326 ] In Music in American Life: A-C (2013), scholar Jacqueline Edmondson studied different female artists and said about Madonna that she "deserves special attention", labeling her "legacy" as "important to understanding issues surrounding gender and the music industry in the twenty-first century".

[ 327 ] A number of international music critics, authors, and publications, addressed how Madonna played a major role in establishing the contemporary global pop music stage, [ 328 ] emphasizing the fact she made her debut during a male-dominant and rock-defining era, and how female singers would go on to later dominate different areas. Deborah Wilker, pop music writer for Sun Sentinel commented in 1996, that Madonna expanded the role of woman in pop further that others.

[ 329 ] In 2017, British music journalist David Hepworth said that "most of biggest of pop music" are woman and Madonna "is the person who proved that this was possible, who opened up a new world for them to grow into".

[ 330 ] In 2014, Spaniard music journalist Diego A. Manrique described the dominance of female singers on record charts as the "Madonna era".

[ 331 ] Gillian Branstetter from The Daily Dot , who also dedicated a lengthy article to her influence, said: "The vast majority of the top artists in the world were men" when Madonna debuted.

[ 287 ] In Popular Texts in English (2001), authors referred to her as an "atypical female phenomenon in the world of pop", [ 332 ] while German media Deutsche Welle would later call her as "the first woman to dominate the male world of pop".

[ 333 ] Washington Post ' s Richard Harrington said in 1990, that Madonna heralded "the arrival of female mega-stars".

[ 334 ] Her impact was further attested in the way future generations of female popular singers were subsequently scrutinized. On this, a Vice contributor said that "reviews of her work have served as a roadmap for scrutinizing women at each stage in their music career".

[ 335 ] Similarly, scholars in Ageing, Popular Culture and Contemporary Feminism (2014) agreed that her figure is "widely considered to have defined the discursive space for examining female popular music".

[ 53 ] Eric Thompson from City Pages also commented in 2011, that her influence is "felt in the way modern female musicians are viewed, regarded and accepted".

[ 336 ] In 2013, Dutch scholars in Celebrity Studies noted how female artists were "very often measured against the yardstick that Madonna has become".

[ 12 ] Linda Lister classifies three categories of "deification of modern female pop stars" in 2001, including prima donnas known for their vocal abilities, and Madonnas, for their innovation.

[ 328 ] However, Madonna attained significant criticisms amid the rock scene in the 1980s, remarked by authors such as Jennifer Egan whom she retrospectively included herself in 2002 among that perception.

[ 240 ] [ 337 ] Noting also the criticism, Paglia said "our minds were formed by rock music ".

[ 271 ] As early as 1985, The Canberra Times would referred her impact saying she "nearly reversed the typical pattern of rock idol analysis", [ 338 ] while the Encyclopedia of American Social History (1993) describes her as "the antithesis of the women found in early rock and roll".

[ 339 ] According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, she became an emblem of women in rock ; [ 17 ] scholar Landon Palmer, recalls that she was frequently described as a "rock star" by media and official institutions, saying that Madonna served as an example of how the label exceeded the distinctions of genre.

[ 340 ] Musicability [ edit ] See also: Madonna and contemporary arts While no virtuous, Madonna has ventured to play some instruments, including Ukulele in the Rebel Heart Tour and plays regularly the Guitar.

During the height of her career, her role as a musician was said to be placed second compared to both her image and impact. However, her artistry would proven found also impact.

Ambivalences [ edit ] Ambivalences between musical and cultural impact was noted by Michael Campbell in Popular Music in America (2012), detailing in his view that "neither [Michael] Jackson nor Madonna has been a musical innovator" and "their most influential and innovative contributions have come in other areas".

[ 341 ] According to music critic Robert Christgau in Grown Up All Wrong (2000), Madonna was "honored less as an artist than as a cultural force".

[ 342 ] A scholar also noted how in the "field of musicology , serious discussion of Madonna has been even rarer than in the popular press".

[ 238 ] In Representing Gender in Cultures (2004), authors also explained that she has been "consistently denied a status of a 'real' musician".

[ 343 ] One of the focal critical views is a general agreement that her own "artistic talents" are considered to be "limited" by critics.

[ 120 ] Other critics have also complained that the content of her songs are "empty".

[ 344 ] To musicologist Ketih E. Clifton at Central Michigan University , Madonna as a composer, arranger and singer, is anything but "one-dimensional" artist.

[ 238 ] In 1990, critic Stephen Holden commented for The New York Times that her "abilities as a singer and songwriter were developed" after she became famous.

[ 345 ] Vocals [ edit ] Madonna's vocals would define perceptions of her.

Madonna's vocals would define her career, mostly generally marked by a mixed-to-negative perceptions; as noted author Lucy O'Brien in Madonna: Like an Icon (2007): "Over the years many have criticized Madonna's vocal ability, saying she is a weak singer".

[ 346 ] In Popular Music and the Politics of Hope (2019), authors similarly stated that "she is routinely dismissed by scholars, critics, and fellow artists alike as someone who 'can't sing'".

[ 337 ] Despite criticism, other were symphatetic and appreciated her evolution. Musicologist Clifton recognizes her vocal "metamorphosis" saying is a "under-theorized aspect of her career".

[ 238 ] He notes how her voice evolved and shifted, identifying five "vocal styles" or "vocal tropes", but also saying it was "difficult to establish a single prevailing vocal style".

[ 238 ] Similarly, Dutch linguist Theo van Leeuwen cited her as perhaps "the first singer who used quite different voices for different songs".

[ 347 ] In Popular Music and the Politics of Hope (2019), authors said that her voice has "certainly changed since the 1980s, showing the signs of age, vocal coaching, and rigorous vocal exercises".

[ 337 ] O'Brien cited a guitarist as saying that she is an enough "strong interpreted [that] doesn't over-embellish things".

[ 346 ] Through Madonna's case, some have broader remarked the nature of vocals in pop music stage and connections to social aspects to the point, in 1986, Dr. Karl Podhoretz from University of Dallas called her a "revolutionary voice who has altered the very meaning of sound in our time", [ 348 ] while in 2013, Rolling Stone referred Madonna as "the most important female voice in the history of modern music".

[ 349 ] Critical commentaries include Financial Times ' s art critic Ludovic Hunter-Tilney, who commented in 2008 that her critics "do not understand" that pop singers "do not require the vocal technique of Maria Callas " and "an instinct to connect with the public's fantasies are more important".

[ 185 ] Scholars in The SAGE Handbook of Popular Music (2014), similarly commented that for pop singers in the style of Madonna, "brilliant singing ability is not of utmost important" compared to performers of Soul and R&B music, "whose considerable vocal skill" are a crucial aspect for them.

[ 350 ] While sociologist Stanley Aronowitz labeled her more a performance artist , he says that she deploys pop music with her singing as a vehicle "for something else going on" and this is a plus or surplus that elicits "the excitement about Madonna".

[ 351 ] Songwriting [ edit ] One of Rolling Stone ' s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time , aspects of Madonna's songwriting influenced artists such as Diplo and Kylie Minogue .

Aside criticisms, Madonna also found success and impact as a songwriter. Named one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time by Rolling Stone , she once held records such as the songwriter with most number-one songs on the Billboard Hot 100 , [ 352 ] and was also recognized by the Guinness World Records as the "most successful female songwriter in Britain".

[ 353 ] Spin ' s Barry Walters called her a "great songwriter" in 1995.

[ 354 ] Writer Andrew Morton called her a "musical poet in motion", [ 355 ] and biographer Carol Gnojewski a "prolific writer".

[ 356 ] Musicologist Susan McClary noted that she writes or co-writes most of her own material.

[ 252 ] In 1998, The Straits Times called Mariah Carey as "the only singer in the pop diva league besides Madonna who writes and produces her own material".

[ 357 ] While American Songwriter commented her image as a pop star led some people assume "she didn't write her own songs", [ 358 ] Maria Muller from W said that Madonna "normalized the idea that pop stars could and should write their own songs".

[ 359 ] She was reportedly to influence other singer-songwriters.

[ 224 ] For instance, Australian music editor Marc Andrews noted how Kylie Minogue was influenced in part by Madonna to start writing her own songs.

[ 360 ] In 2015, producer Diplo said Madonna "showed me a whole other level of dedication and old school work ethic when it comes to writing".

[ 361 ] Production and involving process [ edit ] See also: Maverick (company) Musical positivity scores by album and most common scales in Madonna's songs according to Spotify (1983—2018) A number of scholars noted criticisms about how Madonna has worked with various producers—especially men—in her career, assuming they were the solely responsible for her creative output.

[ 362 ] [ 363 ] In 1995, critic Gina Arnold commented for Metro Silicon Valley , that she certainly hires "well-producers" but applauded Madonna's consistency and personal injection, further considering her as the most "consistent than any of other artist of the last decade" with a vision of "incredibly broad".

[ 36 ] During an interview with Peter Robinson in 2005, producer Stuart Price told: "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her... She has her vision and knows how to get it".

[ 364 ] Billboard magazine made similar remarks.

[ 365 ] Producer Guy Sigsworth similarly states, Madonna is not one of the artists that hire a producer and expect them to do all the work. She instead, is very "intimately involved in the whole creative process as a collaborator and producer" and is a side "ignorated by people so fixated on her image".

[ 169 ] Madonna would also impact the career of some producers, mostly from then-underground scene, including William Orbit , Mirwais Ahmadzaï and Price, as Billboard commented she "plucked" them from "electronic music obscurity".

[ 365 ] According to the Guinness World Records , Madonna is the most remixed act.

[ 216 ] Influence on other entertainers [ edit ] Madonna inspired rock frontmen Liam Gallagher ( Oasis ) and Chester Bennington ( Linkin Park ) to become musicians.

[ 366 ] [ 367 ] Madonna's as a source of inspiration or influence on other entertainers became an articulated aspect of her impact. Some devoted articles discussing it, including The Spokesman-Review in 1989 among dance-music performers.

[ 320 ] In 2018, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation dedicated a listicle of Canadian artists influenced by Madonna, [ 368 ] while in early 2000s, British media scholar David Gauntlett discussed her influence on other female performers denoting "four key" themes, calling many of them as Madonna's "musical daughters" in the "very direct sense" they grew up listening to and admiring her.

[ 323 ] Spaniard music journalist Diego A. Manrique similarly called various high-profile female artists as her "heirs".

[ 331 ] Discussing her 20-years plus career, in 2003, BBC's Ian Youngs said "her influence on others has come as much from her image as her music". In addition, he called Madonna the "pop queen mother".

[ 369 ] Commentators particularly noted how her career and works influenced generation of female pop stars, including MacLeod who said she influenced "many girls" in popular music.

[ 120 ] Noting constant citations from diverse artists, scholars in Ageing, Popular Culture and Contemporary Feminism (2014), said that "judging by the citations she receives from almost every female pop star", she remains "the single biggest female influence on the nature and style of pop music over the course of the late twentieth century".
