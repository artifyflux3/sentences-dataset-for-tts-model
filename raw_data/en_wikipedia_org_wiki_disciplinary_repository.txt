[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Disciplinary repositories can accept work from scholars from any institution. A disciplinary repository shares the roles of collecting, disseminating, and archiving work with other repositories, but is focused on a particular subject area. These collections can include academic and research papers .

Disciplinary repositories can acquire their content in many ways. Many rely on author or organization submissions, such as SSRN . Others such as CiteSeerX crawl the web for scholar and researcher websites and download publicly available academic papers from those sites.

AgEcon , established in 1995, [ 3 ] grew as a result of active involvement of academia and societies.

A disciplinary repository generally covers one broad based discipline, with contributors from many different institutions supported by a variety of funders; the repositories themselves are likely to be funded from one or more sources within the subject community.

[ 4 ] Deposit of material in a disciplinary repository is sometimes mandated by research funders .

Disciplinary repositories can also act as stores of data related to a particular subject, allowing documents along with data associated with that work to be stored in the repository.

What was believed to be the first public Workshop on Disciplinary Repositories [ 5 ] was held on June 16 and 17, 2011, at the ACM Joint Conference on Digital Libraries in Ottawa , Ontario, Canada.

Importance [ edit ] Beyond the core functions of collecting, disseminating, and archiving scholarly works, disciplinary repositories offer significant benefits to the overall academic ecosystem. Here is a closer look at their contributions: Increased accessibility : Many research articles are published in pay-walled journals, hindering access for new researchers. Disciplinary repositories make these publications more readily available at no cost, fostering wider dissemination of knowledge.

Enhanced discoverability : By categorizing scholarly works by subject area, disciplinary repositories enable researchers to locate relevant studies quickly and efficiently. This targeted organization streamlines the research process.

Improved credibility : Several disciplinary repositories implement a pre-print quality control process. This initial vetting enhances the overall credibility of the hosted research materials.

Preservation : Disciplinary repositories serve as digital archives, safeguarding valuable research from loss or degradation.

Scholarly impact measurement : Citation data associated with publications within disciplinary repositories can be used to evaluate research impact and the contribution of individual studies to a particular field.

In conclusion, disciplinary repositories play a vital role in promoting research, scholarship, and knowledge development across academic disciplines.
