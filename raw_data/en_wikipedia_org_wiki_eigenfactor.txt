[ 1 ] Journals are rated according to the number of incoming citations, with citations from highly ranked journals weighted to make a larger contribution to the eigenfactor than those from poorly ranked journals.

[ 2 ] As a measure of importance, the Eigenfactor score scales with the total impact of a journal. All else equal, journals generating higher impact to the field have larger Eigenfactor scores. Citation metrics like eigenfactor or PageRank-based scores reduce the effect of self-referential groups.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Eigenfactor scores and Article Influence scores (AIS) are calculated by eigenfactor.org , where they can be freely viewed. The Eigenfactor score is intended to measure the importance of a journal to the scientific community, by considering the origin of the incoming citations, and is thought to reflect how frequently an average researcher would access content from that journal.

[ 2 ] However, the Eigenfactor score is influenced by the size of the journal, so that the score doubles when the journal doubles in size (measured as number of published articles per year).

[ 5 ] The Article Influence score measures the average influence of articles in the journal, and is therefore comparable to the traditional impact factor .

The Eigenfactor approach is thought to be more robust than the impact factor metric, [ 6 ] which purely counts incoming citations without considering the significance of those citations.

[ 7 ] While the Eigenfactor score is correlated with total citation count for medical journals, [ 8 ] these metrics provide significantly different information. For a given number of citations, citations from more significant journals will result in a higher Eigenfactor score.

[ 9 ] Eigenfactor is similar to Eigenvector centrality and PageRank .

Originally Eigenfactor scores were measures of a journal's importance; it has been extended to author-level .

[ 10 ] It can also be used in combination with the h -index to evaluate the work of individual scientists.
