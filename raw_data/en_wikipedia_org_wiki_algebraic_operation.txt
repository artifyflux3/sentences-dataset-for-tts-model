The radical sign √, denoting a square root , is equivalent to exponentiation to the power of ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ . The ± sign means the equation can be written with either a + or a – sign.

In mathematics , a basic algebraic operation is a mathematical operation similar to any one of the common operations of elementary algebra , which include addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , raising to a whole number power , and taking roots ( fractional power).

[ 1 ] The operations of elementary algebra may be performed on numbers , in which case they are often called arithmetic operations . They may also be performed, in a similar way, on variables , algebraic expressions , [ 2 ] and more generally, on elements of algebraic structures , such as groups and fields .

[ 3 ] An algebraic operation may also be defined more generally as a function from a Cartesian power of a given set to the same set.

[ 4 ] The term algebraic operation may also be used for operations that may be defined by compounding basic algebraic operations, such as the dot product . In calculus and mathematical analysis , algebraic operation is also used for the operations that may be defined by purely algebraic methods . For example, exponentiation with an integer or rational exponent is an algebraic operation, but not the general exponentiation with a real or complex exponent. Also, the derivative is an operation that is not algebraic.

Notation [ edit ] Multiplication symbols are usually omitted, and implied, when there is no operator between two variables or terms, or when a coefficient is used. For example, 3 × x 2 is written as 3 x 2 , and 2 × x × y is written as 2 xy .

[ 5 ] Sometimes, multiplication symbols are replaced with either a dot or center-dot, so that x × y is written as either x .

y or x · y .

Plain text , programming languages , and calculators also use a single asterisk to represent the multiplication symbol, [ 6 ] and it must be explicitly used; for example, 3 x is written as 3 * x .

Rather than using the ambiguous division sign (÷), [ a ] division is usually represented with a vinculum , a horizontal line, as in ⁠ 3 / x + 1 ⁠ . In plain text and programming languages, a slash (also called a solidus ) is used, e.g. 3 / ( x + 1).

Exponents are usually formatted using superscripts, as in x 2 . In plain text , the TeX mark-up language, and some programming languages such as MATLAB and Julia , the caret symbol, ^, represents exponents, so x 2 is written as x ^ 2.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] In programming languages such as Ada , [ 10 ] Fortran , [ 11 ] Perl , [ 12 ] Python [ 13 ] and Ruby , [ 14 ] a double asterisk is used, so x 2 is written as x ** 2.

The plus–minus sign , ±, is used as a shorthand notation for two expressions written as one, representing one expression with a plus sign, the other with a minus sign. For example, y = x ± 1 represents the two equations y = x + 1 and y = x − 1. Sometimes, it is used for denoting a positive-or-negative term such as ± x .

Arithmetic vs algebraic operations [ edit ] Algebraic operations work in the same way as arithmetic operations , as can be seen in the table below.

Properties of arithmetic and algebraic operations [ edit ] Property Arithmetic Example Algebra Example Comments ≡  means "equivalent to" ≢  means "not equivalent to" Commutativity 3 + 5 = 5 + 3 {\displaystyle 3+5=5+3} 3 × × 5 = 5 × × 3 {\displaystyle 3\times 5=5\times 3} a + b = b + a {\displaystyle a+b=b+a} a × × b = b × × a {\displaystyle a\times b=b\times a} Addition and multiplication are commutative and associative.

[ 15 ] Subtraction and division are not: e.g.

a − − b ≢ b − − a {\displaystyle a-b\not \equiv b-a} Associativity ( 3 + 5 ) + 7 = 3 + ( 5 + 7 ) {\displaystyle (3+5)+7=3+(5+7)} ( 3 × × 5 ) × × 7 = 3 × × ( 5 × × 7 ) {\displaystyle (3\times 5)\times 7=3\times (5\times 7)} ( a + b ) + c = a + ( b + c ) {\displaystyle (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)} ( a × × b ) × × c = a × × ( b × × c ) {\displaystyle (a\times b)\times c=a\times (b\times c)} See also [ edit ] Algebraic expression Algebraic function Elementary algebra Factoring a quadratic expression Order of operations Notes [ edit ] ^ In some countries, this symbol indicates subtraction or a wrong answer.

ISO 80000-2 advises that it not be used.
