In general an orthant in n -dimensions can be considered the intersection of n mutually orthogonal half-spaces . By independent selections of half-space signs, there are 2 n orthants in n -dimensional space.

More specifically, a closed orthant in R n is a subset defined by constraining each Cartesian coordinate to be nonnegative or nonpositive.  Such a subset is defined by a system of inequalities: ε 1 x 1 ≥ 0      ε 2 x 2 ≥ 0     · · ·     ε n x n ≥ 0, where each ε i is +1 or −1.

Similarly, an open orthant in R n is a subset defined by a system of strict inequalities ε 1 x 1 > 0      ε 2 x 2 > 0     · · ·     ε n x n > 0, where each ε i is +1 or −1.

By dimension: In one dimension, an orthant is a ray .

In two dimensions, an orthant is a quadrant .

In three dimensions, an orthant is an octant .

John Conway and Neil Sloane defined the term n - orthoplex from orthant complex as a regular polytope in n -dimensions with 2 n simplex facets , one per orthant.

[ 3 ] The nonnegative orthant is the generalization of the first quadrant to n -dimensions and is important in many constrained optimization problems.

See also [ edit ] Cross polytope (or orthoplex) – a family of regular polytopes in n -dimensions which can be constructed with one simplex facets in each orthant space.

Measure polytope (or hypercube) – a family of regular polytopes in n -dimensions which can be constructed with one vertex in each orthant space.

Orthotope – generalization of a rectangle in n -dimensions, with one vertex in each orthant.
