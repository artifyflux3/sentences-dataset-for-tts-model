For generating functions in mathematics, see Generating function .

In physics, and more specifically in Hamiltonian mechanics , a generating function is, loosely, a function whose partial derivatives generate the differential equations that determine a system's dynamics. Common examples are the partition function of statistical mechanics , the Hamiltonian, and the function which acts as a bridge between two sets of canonical variables when performing a canonical transformation .

In canonical transformations [ edit ] There are four basic generating functions, summarized by the following table: [ 1 ] Generating function Its derivatives F = F 1 ( q , Q , t ) {\displaystyle F=F_{1}(q,Q,t)} p = ∂ ∂ F 1 ∂ ∂ q {\displaystyle p=~~{\frac {\partial F_{1}}{\partial q}}\,\!} and P = − − ∂ ∂ F 1 ∂ ∂ Q {\displaystyle P=-{\frac {\partial F_{1}}{\partial Q}}\,\!} F = F 2 ( q , P , t ) = F 1 + Q P {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F&=F_{2}(q,P,t)\\&=F_{1}+QP\end{aligned}}} p = ∂ ∂ F 2 ∂ ∂ q {\displaystyle p=~~{\frac {\partial F_{2}}{\partial q}}\,\!} and Q = ∂ ∂ F 2 ∂ ∂ P {\displaystyle Q=~~{\frac {\partial F_{2}}{\partial P}}\,\!} F = F 3 ( p , Q , t ) = F 1 − − q p {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F&=F_{3}(p,Q,t)\\&=F_{1}-qp\end{aligned}}} q = − − ∂ ∂ F 3 ∂ ∂ p {\displaystyle q=-{\frac {\partial F_{3}}{\partial p}}\,\!} and P = − − ∂ ∂ F 3 ∂ ∂ Q {\displaystyle P=-{\frac {\partial F_{3}}{\partial Q}}\,\!} F = F 4 ( p , P , t ) = F 1 − − q p + Q P {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F&=F_{4}(p,P,t)\\&=F_{1}-qp+QP\end{aligned}}} q = − − ∂ ∂ F 4 ∂ ∂ p {\displaystyle q=-{\frac {\partial F_{4}}{\partial p}}\,\!} and Q = ∂ ∂ F 4 ∂ ∂ P {\displaystyle Q=~~{\frac {\partial F_{4}}{\partial P}}\,\!} Example [ edit ] Sometimes a given Hamiltonian can be turned into one that looks like the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, which is H = a P 2 + b Q 2 .

{\displaystyle H=aP^{2}+bQ^{2}.} For example, with the Hamiltonian H = 1 2 q 2 + p 2 q 4 2 , {\displaystyle H={\frac {1}{2q^{2}}}+{\frac {p^{2}q^{4}}{2}},} where p is the generalized momentum and q is the generalized coordinate , a good canonical transformation to choose would be P = p q 2 and Q = − − 1 q .

{\displaystyle P=pq^{2}{\text{ and }}Q={\frac {-1}{q}}.} 1 This turns the Hamiltonian into H = Q 2 2 + P 2 2 , {\displaystyle H={\frac {Q^{2}}{2}}+{\frac {P^{2}}{2}},} which is in the form of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian.

The generating function F for this transformation is of the third kind, F = F 3 ( p , Q ) .

{\displaystyle F=F_{3}(p,Q).} To find F explicitly, use the equation for its derivative from the table above, P = − − ∂ ∂ F 3 ∂ ∂ Q , {\displaystyle P=-{\frac {\partial F_{3}}{\partial Q}},} and substitute the expression for P from equation ( 1 ), expressed in terms of p and Q : p Q 2 = − − ∂ ∂ F 3 ∂ ∂ Q {\displaystyle {\frac {p}{Q^{2}}}=-{\frac {\partial F_{3}}{\partial Q}}} Integrating this with respect to Q results in an equation for the generating function of the transformation given by equation ( 1 ): F 3 ( p , Q ) = p Q {\displaystyle F_{3}(p,Q)={\frac {p}{Q}}} To confirm that this is the correct generating function, verify that it matches ( 1 ): q = − − ∂ ∂ F 3 ∂ ∂ p = − − 1 Q {\displaystyle q=-{\frac {\partial F_{3}}{\partial p}}={\frac {-1}{Q}}} See also [ edit ] Hamilton–Jacobi equation Poisson bracket References [ edit ] ^ Goldstein, Herbert; Poole, C.
