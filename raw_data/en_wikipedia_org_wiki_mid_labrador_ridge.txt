The ridge extended from the South Greenland triple junction in the southeast to the Davis Strait area in the northwest.

[ 1 ] Seafloor spreading along the Mid-Labrador Ridge discontinued about 40 million years ago when the mid-ocean ridge became essentially extinct.

[ 2 ] The Mid-Labrador Ridge is now mostly buried under sediment, exposed only as a northwesterly trend of seamounts in the southeastern part of the Labrador Basin.
