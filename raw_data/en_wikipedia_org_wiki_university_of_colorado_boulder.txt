Founded in 1876, five months before Colorado became a state , it is the flagship university of the University of Colorado system. CU Boulder is a member of the Association of American Universities , considered a Public Ivy [ 8 ] and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 9 ] The university consists of nine colleges and schools and offers over 150 academic programs, enrolling more than 35,000 students as of January 2022.

[ 10 ] In 2021, the university attracted the support of over $634 million for research and spent $536 million on research and development according to the National Science Foundation , ranking it 50th in the nation.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] It receives the most NASA astrophysics technology grants of all academic institutions and is the only university in the world that has sent instruments to all planets in the Solar System .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] The Colorado Buffaloes compete in 17 varsity sports and are members of the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference . The Buffaloes have won 28 national championships: 20 in skiing , seven total in men's and women's cross country , and one in football . The university has produced 10 Olympic medalists . Alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 12 Nobel Prize laureates [ 15 ] (of whom 5 were affiliated with the university when the prizes were awarded [ 16 ] [ 17 ] ), 10 Pulitzer Prize winners, 11 MacArthur Fellows , 1 Turing Award laureate, 20 astronauts and 2 associate justice of the United States Supreme Court .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] History [ edit ] On March 14, 1876, the Colorado territorial legislature passed an amendment to the state constitution that provided money for the establishment of the University of Colorado in Boulder, the Colorado School of Mines in Golden , and the Colorado Agricultural College in Fort Collins .

Two cities competed for the site of the University of Colorado: Boulder and Cañon City . The consolation prize for the losing city was to be the home to the new Colorado State Prison . Cañon City was at a disadvantage as it was already the home of the Colorado Territorial Prison (there are now six prisons in the Cañon City area).

The cornerstone of the building that became Old Main was laid on September 20, 1875. The doors of the university opened on September 5, 1877. At the time, there were few high schools in the state that could adequately prepare students for university work, so in addition to the university, a preparatory school was formed on campus. In the fall of 1877, the student body consisted of 15 students in the college proper and 50 students in the preparatory school. There were 38 men and 27 women, and their ages ranged from 12 to 23 years.

[ 22 ] During World War II , Colorado was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.

[ 23 ] CU hired its first female professor, Mary Rippon , in 1878.

[ 24 ] It hired its first African-American professor, Charles H. Nilon, in 1956, and its first African-American librarian, Mildred Nilon , in 1962.

[ 25 ] Its first African American female graduate, Lucile Berkeley Buchanan , received her degree in 1918.

[ 26 ] Campus [ edit ] The CU Boulder campus The main CU Boulder campus is located south of the Pearl Street Mall and east of Chautauqua Auditorium . It consists of academic and residential buildings as well as research facilities. The East Campus is about a quarter-mile from the main campus and is composed mainly of athletic fields and research buildings.
CU Boulder's campus has been ranked as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States by Travel + Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler .

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Architecture [ edit ] CU Boulder's distinctive architecture style, known as Tuscan Vernacular Revival, was designed by architect Charles Klauder .

[ 30 ] The oldest buildings, such as Old Main (1876) and Macky Auditorium (1923), were in the Collegiate Gothic style of many East Coast schools, and Klauder's initial plans for the university's new buildings (approved in 1919) were in the same style.

[ 30 ] A month or so after approval, however, Klauder updated his design by sketching in a new wrap of rough, textured sandstone walls with sloping, multi-leveled red-orange- tiled roofs and Indiana limestone trim.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] This formed the basis of a unified style, used in the design of fifteen other buildings between 1921 and 1939 and still followed on the campus to this day.

[ 30 ] The sandstone used in the construction of nearly all the buildings on campus was selected from a variety of Front Range mountain quarries.

Sewall Hall Residence halls [ edit ] Currently, freshmen and others attending the University of Colorado Boulder have an option of 24 on- and off-campus residence halls.

[ 32 ] Residence halls have 17 varieties of room types from singles to four-person rooms and others with apartment-style amenities.

[ 33 ] There are several communities of residence halls located throughout the campus, as well as in a separate area called Williams Village which is located approximately 1.5 miles off of the main campus. There is a free bus service that transports students to the main campus from Williams Village and vice versa. The university also offers Residential Academic Programs (RAPS) in many of its Residence Halls. RAPs provide students with in-dorm classes tailored to academic interests (international affairs, environmental studies, etc.).

Engineering Center Engineering Center [ edit ] The Engineering Center on the North-East side of campus houses the nation's largest geotechnical centrifuge as well as ion-implantation and microwave-propagation facilities, spectrometers , electron and other microscopes, and a structural analysis facility. In 2021, the Rustandy Building joined the Engineering Center to the Koelbel Building, in order to increase collaboration with the School of Business.

[ 34 ] Norlin Library [ edit ] Norlin Library Until 1903, the library collection was housed with the rest of the school in Old Main. The growing size of the library required a move, as the weight of the books was causing physical damage to the floor. The cornerstone for the first separate library building was laid in January 1903, and the building was opened in January 1904. When the new Norlin Library opened in 1940, the old library was turned over to the Theatre department and was converted into classrooms and a theatre.

Norlin Library was the last building to be designed by Klauder. There are two inscriptions on the western face of the building, overlooking the Norlin Quadrangle . Both were composed by President Norlin. The larger inscription reads "Who knows only his own generation remains always a child," based on a Cicero quotation, while the smaller inscription on the marble just over the door reads "Enter here the timeless fellowship of the human spirit." Macky Auditorium [ edit ] Macky Auditorium Macky Auditorium is a large building on the north edge of the University of Colorado campus, near 17th Street and University Avenue, which plays host to various talks, plays, and musical performances. Andrew J. Macky was a prominent businessman involved with the town of Boulder in the late 19th century. Macky served as the president, as well as a stockholder of the First National Bank, an institution founded by another early CU supporter, Lewis Cheney. Macky is credited with a number of landmarks throughout Boulder, where he was a carpenter and involved in politics.

The Auditorium opened its doors in 1923, thirteen years after construction started. Macky's adopted daughter, May, sued for a third of Macky's estate, a case that took thirteen years to settle. May was angered that her father left her no money in his will while leaving $300,000 to CU for the hall's construction. The university eventually won the case, and the majority of critical construction on the building resumed.

The building has a variety of architectural elements from various buildings around the globe that President James Baker , CU's president at the turn of the 20th century, admired. The design of the auditorium is primarily Neo-Gothic , with the primary materials being sandstone and red tile, like the rest of campus. The result is a unique building, with two large towers and sprawling ivy, that sets itself apart from the rest of the CU campus. Macky was refurbished in 1986, with improved seating, custom carpeting, modern plumbing, and an elevator. Currently, there is an electronic bell system in the towers of Macky which rings the hours during the day.

Macky is the home of two departments both in the College of Music, the Jazz Studies Department and the Choral Department, and it houses an art gallery that is open Wednesdays, and to patrons during performances. The hall houses almost all performances by the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra , the Artist Series, and the CU Opera. Macky is also the home of many lectures including part of the Conference on World Affairs held at CU each spring.

University Memorial Center [ edit ] Dalton Trumbo Fountain Court behind the UMC on July 13, 2006 In 1947, Colorado Governor Lee Knous issued a proclamation to create a memorial to Colorado's servicemen at the University of Colorado Boulder. A proposal to house this memorial in a student union building resulted in a remarkable fundraising effort. The University Memorial Center (UMC) opened its doors in October 1953 with President Robert Stearns presiding over the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The UMC quickly became the central landmark of the Boulder campus. A 1964 addition created a new bookstore, conference facilities, additional dining facilities, and offices to house the rapidly growing student activities and organizations. The expansion was financed through bonds granted by student fees.

The 1960s and '70s put the UMC at the center of student activism as students staged strikes, grape boycotts, love-ins, sit-ins, and walk-outs. The UMC Fountain Court (now the Dalton Trumbo Fountain Court) became a familiar sight to network television news watchers as the famous and notorious promoted their cause at CU Boulder. Entertainers as diverse as Ramsey Lewis and the Grateful Dead have performed in the Glenn Miller Ballroom. The UMC Connection, a student entertainment center in the basement, is a more informal gathering place, featuring pool tables and a small bowling alley. It also features Club 156, which hosts concerts from local and up-and-coming bands. In 1986, students passed another bond issue to remodel the food services area. The Alferd Packer Grill gets its name from Alferd Packer , a Colorado prospector accused of cannibalism.

Center for Community [ edit ] The Center for Community, also known as the C4C by students, follows the distinct architecture guidelines of Charles Klauder and is a 323,000-square-foot (30,000 m 2 ) facility [ 35 ] that is promised to be 20 percent to 25 percent more energy- and water-efficient compared to similar-sized buildings.

[ 36 ] The facility was completed in September 2010 at a cost of $84.4 million.

[ 37 ] The building is originally bond-financed through the CU treasurer and will be repaid through a combination of sources. A large portion of the debt, $47.4 million, will be repaid by Housing and Dining Services, through room and board fees. Fees from Permit and Parking Services will contribute as well. The center also relies on $18 million in donations, a goal which has not been achieved, but has become a top fundraising priority for the university.

[ 36 ] The Weather Tech Cafe The building houses offices of Student Services including Campus Card Services, Disability Services, and Career Services among others. These services have been relocated to the C4C from various locations around campus.

[ 36 ] For example, Career Services was previously housed in the basement of the Willard Dormitory. There is a 140,000-square-foot (13,000 m 2 ) underground parking structure that contains approximately 365 to 375 parking spaces.

[ 38 ] Student study areas are located on the upper floors and conference centers are open to campus and non-campus affiliates throughout the building. The dining services offered within the C4C include a CU on the run "grab-n-go", The Bakery, a late-night dining hub called the Weather Tech Café, open until 2 A.M., and finally a central dining facility. This dining facility seats 900 and offers students up to nine specialty dining choices including Persian, Asian, Latin, sushi, Italian, Kosher, a grill, salad bars, and desserts.

[ 39 ] Overall the Dining Center is projected to serve around one million meals per year.

[ 36 ] Recreation Center [ edit ] In 1973 the student recreation center was built on the CU Boulder's main campus, by the architect James Wallace.

[ 40 ] The funding to build the recreation center came entirely from student fees, which also funded the expansions in 1990 and 2014. The recreation center features strength and cardio space, basketball/volleyball courts, the only ice rink in Boulder proper, lap pool, dive well, fitness studios (cycling, rowing, etc.), climbing gym, turf gym, and an iconic [ clarification needed ] outdoor pool in the shape of the CU Boulder buffalo mascot. It is currently about 300,000 square feet (28,000 m 2 ) and operates on a $5 million annual budget. The center is co-managed by the division of student affairs and CUSG, CU Boulder's student government. It is located on the northern edge of campus next to Folsom Field . It is open seven days a week and on average 16 hours a day with most of its facilities available for use during those hours.

[ 41 ] Mary Rippon Theatre [ edit ] The view from the back of the Mary Rippon Theatre The Mary Rippon Theatre is an outdoor theater and the site of many cultural events, notably the Colorado Shakespeare Festival . The Theatre was named after Professor Mary Rippon , the first female instructor at the university and one of the first female university instructors in the United States. She taught English grammar, German, French and mathematics.

[ 42 ] Old Main Old Main [ edit ] Old Main is the oldest building on campus, and previously served as the Medical School for the University of Colorado system.

[ 43 ] Galleries [ edit ] Norlin Library features two art galleries, several dedicated art spaces, and artworks on display throughout the building. The CU Art Museum features works of modern and contemporary art, as well as historical artworks. The Museum's permanent collection includes over 5,000 works of art from numerous time periods and cultures. The UMC Art Gallery exhibits a variety of visual offerings ranging from student works created on campus to presentations of internationally recognized artists. Andrew J. Macky Gallery showcases the work of both local and national artists and is housed in the historic Macky Auditorium.

Museums [ edit ] University of Colorado Museum of Natural History has one of the most extensive natural history collections in the Rocky Mountain and Plains regions, representing the disciplines of anthropology, botany, entomology, paleontology, and zoology. It is located in the Henderson building, named after its first curator, Judge Junius Henderson , and hosts the Museum and Field Studies master's (MS) program. The CU Heritage Center [ 44 ] tells the stories of CU Boulder's past and present and is housed in Old Main, the first building constructed on campus. Seven galleries exhibit art and memorabilia associated with CU faculty and alumni. The Fiske Planetarium and Science Center features a 60 ft (18 m). planetarium dome and produces laser shows, live concerts, and an ongoing series of public programs. Fiske also offers a hands-on science museum with interactive exhibits and space-themed art.

Performing arts facilities [ edit ] The University of Colorado Boulder College of Music presents over 400 performances and educational events bringing together faculty, students, and guest artists each year through the Pendulum New Music Series. They present musical genres including classical, jazz, world music, and new music. The University of Colorado Boulder Department of Theatre & Dance is home to the Charlotte York Irey Dance Theatre, the University Theatre, and the Loft Theatre as well as Grusin Music Hall and the Chamber Music Hall in the College of Music . More than twenty productions are presented each year featuring student and faculty actors, dancers, choreographers, directors, and designers, as well as the work of professional guest artists. Student work is also showcased in the annual CU Boulder Fringe Festival, produced by OnStage, a student performing arts group.

Visual Arts Complex [ edit ] Visual Arts Complex A new visual arts complex that houses the Department of Art and Art History and the CU Art Museum officially opened in 2010. The facility houses art programming and studies. The building also contains a 200-seat auditorium as well as twenty-eight student exhibition spaces, and the Colorado Collection (an art collection of approximately 5,000 pieces).

The Hill [ edit ] The Hill , a college neighborhood in Boulder, lies directly west of the University of Colorado campus. The central street of the neighborhood is 13th Street, which features a variety of attractions including a concert venue and the Fox Theatre , and is near The Sink and several other points of interest.

While the college of Arts and Sciences is by far the largest, the university also consists of the college of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Program in Environmental Design, Education , Music , Law , and the Leeds School of Business , plus a new College of Media, Communication, and Information that debuted in 2014. Most, if not all, of these colleges and schools, also incorporate master- and doctorate-level degree programs. At the university, there are currently approximately 3,400 courses available in over 150 disciplines making up 85 majors ranging from Accounting to Women's Studies.

University of Colorado School of Law is the smallest and most selective of the colleges. The Wolf Law Building, the new home of the Law School, was dedicated on September 8, 2006, by United States Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer .

The Leeds School of Business has an enrollment of 3,300 students including undergraduates, master's candidates, and Ph.D. candidates. The undergraduate program ranks 39th in the country and the undergraduate entrepreneurship program ranks 14th in the nation. The MBA program ranks 26th among all public universities.

[ citation needed ] The faculty are ranked 38th in the nation according to the Academy of Management Journal .

[ citation needed ] CU Boulder adopted an honor code in 2000 following growing concerns about academic dishonesty on campus in the late 1990s.

[ 54 ] A copy of the code stating "On my honor, as a University of Colorado Boulder student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work" is engraved on a metal plate and posted in every classroom on campus.

Undergraduates who seek an academic challenge may participate in CU's Honors Program. Begun in 1931, the Honors Program currently consists of the top ten percent of incoming freshmen and participating undergraduates with a 3.3 GPA or greater (on a 4.0 scale). The program offers over 40 honors classes each semester taught by tenured or tenure-track professors and limited to class sizes of 17 [ 55 ] students. Honors students also have the opportunity to graduate with honors, high honors, and highest honors, by writing and defending a thesis during their senior year. The program extends into the residence halls through the Kittredge Honors Program. The Presidents Leadership Class is a program for top scholars at the University of Colorado Boulder. Scholars participate in a four-year leadership development program. The program provides opportunities to the top fifty students at CU from every major and discipline.

One option for students (mostly freshmen and sophomores) living on campus is to join a residential academic program (RAP). Each RAP focuses on a curricular theme and offers courses in the residence hall itself. The programs also include educational activities.
