It is a superstring theory in the sense that the worldsheet theory is supersymmetric . However, the spacetime spectrum is not supersymmetric and, in fact, does not contain any fermions at all. In dimensions greater than two, the ground state is a tachyon so the theory is unstable. These properties make it similar to the bosonic string and an unsuitable proposal for describing the world as we observe it, although a GSO projection does get rid of the tachyon and the even G-parity sector of the theory defines a stable string theory. The theory is used sometimes as a toy model for exploring concepts in string theory, notably closed string tachyon condensation . Some other recent interest has involved the two-dimensional Type 0 string which has a non-perturbatively stable matrix model description.

Like the Type II string , different GSO projections result in slightly different theories, Type 0A and Type 0B. The difference lies in which types of Ramond–Ramond fields lie in the massless spectrum.
