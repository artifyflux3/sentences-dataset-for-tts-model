Discovery date 6 January 2022 Designations MPC designation 2022 AE 1 Minor planet category NEO Apollo Orbital characteristics [ 2 ] Epoch 2022-Jan-21 ( JD 2459600.5) Uncertainty parameter 7 Observation arc 20 days Aphelion 2.27 AU (Q) Perihelion 0.667 AU (q) Semi-major axis 1.47 AU (a) Eccentricity 0.547 (e) Orbital period (sidereal) 1.78 years Mean anomaly 39 ° (M) Inclination 6.3° (i) Longitude of ascending node 102.2° (Ω) Time of perihelion 10 November 2021 Argument of perihelion 268.3° (ω) Earth MOID 0.00007 AU (10 thousand km) Jupiter MOID 3.2 AU (480 million km) Physical characteristics Mean diameter ~70 m (200 ft) [ 3 ] 54–120 meters Absolute magnitude (H) 23.49 [ 4 ] 2022 AE 1 is a Tunguska event -sized asteroid , classified as a near-Earth object of the Apollo group , approximately 70 meters (230 feet) in diameter.

[ 5 ] It was discovered by the Mount Lemmon Survey on 6 January 2022, when it was 0.09 AU (13 million km ) from Earth.

[ 1 ] On 9 January 2022 with an observation arc of 3 days, it was rated with a Torino scale of 1 for a virtual impactor on 4 July 2023 16:28 UTC .

[ 3 ] [ a ] Nominal approach is expected to occur 1 July 2023 01:13 ± 1 day.

[ 2 ] [ b ] With a Palermo scale rating of as high as –0.66 at the European Space Agency on 11 January 2022, [ 6 ] the odds of impact peaked at about 4.6 [ c ] times less than the background hazard level.

[ d ] NEODyS was the first risk-page to drop to Torino scale 0 on 12 January 2022 [ 7 ] followed by ESA on 13 January 2022, [ 6 ] but by January 14 both returned to Torino scale 1. On 14 January 2022 the waxing gibbous moon was as little as 3 degrees from the asteroid delaying observations of the asteroid from January 12–19.

[ 8 ] On 20 January 2022 with a 16-day observation arc, using JPL #11 the Sentry Risk Table dropped the asteroid to Torino scale 0 and then later that day JPL #12 resulted in it being removed from the risk table.

^ a b The JPL Small-Body Database close approach table lists a linearized uncertainty. Sentry computations explore alternate orbit solutions along the line of variations and account for orbit propagation nonlinearities.

^ 10 0.66 = 4.57. JPL's Sentry Risk Table , ESA's Risk List and NEODyS will all list slightly different odds of impact and Palermo scale values.

^ "Background risk" is defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact.
