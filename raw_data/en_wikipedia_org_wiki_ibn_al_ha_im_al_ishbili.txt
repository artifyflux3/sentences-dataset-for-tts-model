c.

1213 was a medieval Muslim astronomer and mathematician from Seville .

He is known to modern scholars for his al‐Zīj al‐kāmil fī al‐talim (1204/5), which was had a great influence on the development of Islamic astronomy and which has provided important information on astronomers from Al-Andalus , including the instrument maker and astrologer Al-Zarqali .

Life [ edit ] Ibn al‐Hāʾim originated from Seville in Al-Andalus . As a student, he learnt mathematics using the works of the scholars Al-Jayyani and Jabir ibn Aflah .

[ citation needed ] He probably worked in North Africa, at a time when the Almohad Caliphate ruled the region. Ibn al‐Hāʾim became proficient at mathematics and was familiar with the trigonometrical concepts introduced into al‐Andalus by the scholar Ibn Mu'adh al-Jayyani in the 11th century and developed during the next century by the astronomer and mathematician Jābir ibn Aflaḥ .

[ 1 ] al‐Zīj al‐kāmil fī al‐talim [ edit ] In 1204/5 Ibn al‐Hāʾim wrote al‐Zīj al‐kāmil fī al‐talim (" The Perfect Handbook on Mathematical Astronomy "), a treatise that consisted of an introduction and seven books.  A zīj in all but name, the information it contains does not include any numerical tables.

[ 1 ] It was considered exceptionally complete and accurate by Islamic medieval astronomers , and he had a great influence on the development of astronomy in the Maghreb .

[ 2 ] The work has provided modern historians with important information on earlier astronomers in al‐Andalus. It gives historical data on the life and works of the instrument maker and astrologer Al-Zarqali and the creation of the Tables of Toledo by astronomers in Toledo patronized by the qadi Said Al-Andalusi .

Ibn al‐Hāʾim further extended Al-Zarqali's theories on the oscillation of the obliquity of the ecliptic , presented spherical trigonometrical formulae, gives a longitude of the solar apogee of 85° 49′ and further confirmed the works of Al-Zarqali. The work also deals with the computation of the Moon's longitude and latitude, attempting to correct Ptolemy 's theory.
