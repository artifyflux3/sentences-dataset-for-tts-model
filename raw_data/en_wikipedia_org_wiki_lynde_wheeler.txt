He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut and was educated at Yale University , where he received a Ph.D. in physics in 1902, with a thesis on "The Reflection of Polarized Light from Mercury in Water."  He remained at Yale as a professor in the physics department until 1926, when he joined the Radio Division of the United States Naval Research Laboratory .  In 1936 he became chief of engineering in the information division of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  He retired from the FCC in 1946 and became a consultant for the private firm Pickard and Burns, Inc., in Needham, Massachusetts .

Wheeler was also a fellow of the Institute of Radio Engineers since 1928, and served as its president in 1943.  In addition to his research in optics, electricity, and radio, Wheeler published a biography of his mentor at Yale, mathematical physicist J. Willard Gibbs .  He died in Roanoke, Virginia .
