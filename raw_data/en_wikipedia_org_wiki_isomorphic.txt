The [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") of fifth [roots of unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_of_unity "Roots of unity") under multiplication is isomorphic to the group of rotations of the regular pentagon under composition.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), an **isomorphism** is a structure-preserving [mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics) "Map (mathematics)") or [morphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism "Morphism") between two [structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure "Mathematical structure") of the same type that can be reversed by an [inverse mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function"). Two mathematical structures are **isomorphic** if an isomorphism exists between them. The word is derived from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")[ἴσος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%B4%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%82 "wikt:ἴσος")_(isos)_'equal' and [μορφή](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%86%CE%AE "wikt:μορφή")_(morphe)_'form, shape'.

The interest in isomorphisms lies in the fact that two isomorphic objects have the same properties (excluding further information such as additional structure or names of objects). Thus isomorphic structures cannot be distinguished from the point of view of structure only, and may often be identified. In [mathematical jargon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_jargon "Mathematical jargon"), one says that two objects are the same [up to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to "Up to") an isomorphism. A common example where isomorphic structures cannot be identified is when the structures are substructures of a larger one. For example, all subspaces of dimension one of a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") are isomorphic and cannot be identified.

An [automorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism "Automorphism") is an isomorphism from a structure to itself. An isomorphism between two structures is a **canonical isomorphism** (a [canonical map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_map "Canonical map") that is an isomorphism) if there is only one isomorphism between the two structures (as is the case for solutions of a [universal property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_property "Universal property")), or if the isomorphism is much more natural (in some sense) than other isomorphisms. For example, for every [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number")p, all [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") with p elements are canonically isomorphic, with a unique isomorphism. The [isomorphism theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_theorems "Isomorphism theorems") provide canonical isomorphisms that are not unique.

The term _isomorphism_ is mainly used for [algebraic structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure "Algebraic structure") and [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(mathematics) "Category (mathematics)"). In the case of algebraic structures, mappings are called [homomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism "Homomorphism"), and a homomorphism is an isomorphism [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") it is [bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective "Bijective").

In various areas of mathematics, isomorphisms have received specialized names, depending on the type of structure under consideration. For example:

*   An [isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry") is an isomorphism of [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space").
*   A [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") is an isomorphism of [topological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space").
*   A [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") is an isomorphism of spaces equipped with a [differential structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_structure "Differential structure"), typically [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold").
*   A [symplectomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectomorphism "Symplectomorphism") is an isomorphism of [symplectic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold").
*   A [permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation "Permutation") is an automorphism of a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)").
*   In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), isomorphisms and automorphisms are often called [transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(function) "Transformation (function)"), for example [rigid transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_transformation "Rigid transformation"), [affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation"), [projective transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_transformation "Projective transformation").

[Category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory"), which can be viewed as a formalization of the concept of mapping between structures, provides a language that may be used to unify the approach to these different aspects of the basic idea.

### Logarithm and exponential

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isomorphism&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Logarithm and exponential")]

Let ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{+}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97dc5e850d079061c24290bac160c8d3b62ee139) be the [multiplicative group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group "Multiplicative group") of [positive real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_real_numbers "Positive real numbers"), and let ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) be the additive group of real numbers.

The [logarithm function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm_function "Logarithm function")![Image 5: {\displaystyle \log :\mathbb {R} ^{+}\to \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8dffef617958bbaa539fa183844ad1cacfaddf59) satisfies ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \log(xy)=\log x+\log y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/90f980db27daf87d25fe2db8e2b544073921cc05) for all ![Image 7: {\displaystyle x,y\in \mathbb {R} ^{+},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0745ca172382797ab2440077d3afdd617bf821f6) so it is a [group homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homomorphism "Group homomorphism"). The [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function "Exponential function")![Image 8: {\displaystyle \exp :\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {R} ^{+}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc8d9064ea0fb9ee61e51fa543537f9b4f6cdd39) satisfies ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \exp(x+y)=(\exp x)(\exp y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f4c15f3bb32525bdd4e99a3deb3b2cb33a9b950) for all ![Image 10: {\displaystyle x,y\in \mathbb {R} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/62b489ceaa39fa862e47e539193ade2453217380) so it too is a homomorphism.

The identities ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \log \exp x=x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7c797bda03ee72306125da548061676856363682) and ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \exp \log y=y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/beff286ac6c896818ac2bc1d0c8a9361c5a94644) show that ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \log }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/79e4debd0ab1c6ce342d0172a7643733305c37bc) and ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \exp }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4d1185b570f67b4221307626254f64f9e619e769) are [inverses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function") of each other. Since ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \log }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/79e4debd0ab1c6ce342d0172a7643733305c37bc) is a homomorphism that has an inverse that is also a homomorphism, ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \log }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/79e4debd0ab1c6ce342d0172a7643733305c37bc) is an [isomorphism of groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_isomorphism "Group isomorphism"), i.e., ![Image 17: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{+}\cong \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/95f7af8dacb7f224c19a1bd9933450c7b473d9cd) via the isomorphism ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \log x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/80d453de713a8c45f7bf99108752531ed7d6dd05).

The ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \log }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/79e4debd0ab1c6ce342d0172a7643733305c37bc) function is an isomorphism which translates multiplication of positive real numbers into addition of real numbers. This facility makes it possible to multiply real numbers using a [ruler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruler "Ruler") and a [table of logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_logarithms "Table of logarithms"), or using a [slide rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule "Slide rule") with a logarithmic scale.

Consider the group ![Image 20: {\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} _{6},+),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/717201d3009257041c7fb833f62c618ef788efb2) the integers from 0 to 5 with addition [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic "Modular arithmetic")6. Also consider the group ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \left(\mathbb {Z} _{2}\times \mathbb {Z} _{3},+\right),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16a6659fd97acfbf42ae76218b8dd1c50677da11) the ordered pairs where the _x_ coordinates can be 0 or 1, and the y coordinates can be 0, 1, or 2, where addition in the _x_-coordinate is modulo 2 and addition in the _y_-coordinate is modulo 3.

These structures are isomorphic under addition, under the following scheme: ![Image 22: {\displaystyle {\begin{alignedat}{4}(0,0)&\mapsto 0\\(1,1)&\mapsto 1\\(0,2)&\mapsto 2\\(1,0)&\mapsto 3\\(0,1)&\mapsto 4\\(1,2)&\mapsto 5\\\end{alignedat}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/902d46e151cb52c69957ee0fa4cbdaac59979efa) or in general ![Image 23: {\displaystyle (a,b)\mapsto (3a+4b)\mod 6.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe938c67d0a874afdb2e5dab1755adab712df2b4)

For example, ![Image 24: {\displaystyle (1,1)+(1,0)=(0,1),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/80b44911407669e928f1c67fc5cd864bf24b5de6) which translates in the other system as ![Image 25: {\displaystyle 1+3=4.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/94136030acf98cc212c60d755e392db44c5c2541)

Even though these two groups "look" different in that the sets contain different elements, they are indeed **isomorphic**: their structures are exactly the same. More generally, the [direct product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_product_of_groups "Direct product of groups") of two [cyclic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group "Cyclic group")![Image 26: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{m}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5474379674b9a5fd1b1336571cbeacbe81212d34) and ![Image 27: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b729c334a9863c47f0b7e3ad61342c2f0881bdb) is isomorphic to ![Image 28: {\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} _{mn},+)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/57e71169118c26d0b36d5d832f759d2405e665ea) if and only if _m_ and _n_ are [coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime "Coprime"), per the [Chinese remainder theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem "Chinese remainder theorem").

### Relation-preserving isomorphism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isomorphism&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Relation-preserving isomorphism")]

If one object consists of a set _X_ with a [binary relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation "Binary relation") R and the other object consists of a set _Y_ with a binary relation S then an isomorphism from _X_ to _Y_ is a bijective function ![Image 29: {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c) such that:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic#cite_note-1)![Image 30: {\displaystyle \operatorname {S} (f(u),f(v))\quad {\text{ if and only if }}\quad \operatorname {R} (u,v)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ec00dcd84a390ac745eda56007558aa66ab0dc1)

S is [reflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation "Reflexive relation"), [irreflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreflexive_relation "Irreflexive relation"), [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation "Symmetric relation"), [antisymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisymmetric_relation "Antisymmetric relation"), [asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_relation "Asymmetric relation"), [transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation "Transitive relation"), [total](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_relation "Connected relation"), [trichotomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_relation#Properties "Homogeneous relation"), a [partial order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_order "Partial order"), [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order "Total order"), [well-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order "Well-order"), [strict weak order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_weak_order "Strict weak order"), [total preorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_weak_order#Total_preorders "Strict weak order") (weak order), an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation"), or a relation with any other special properties, if and only if R is.

For example, R is an [ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory "Order theory") ≤ and S an ordering ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \sqsubseteq ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/36980b6e06ccb3a878c27f95a6bea594133e066d) then an isomorphism from _X_ to _Y_ is a bijective function ![Image 32: {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c) such that ![Image 33: {\displaystyle f(u)\sqsubseteq f(v)\quad {\text{ if and only if }}\quad u\leq v.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f6e4e0be373bdfcb7bc095253a9e74275ee972a) Such an isomorphism is called an _[order isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order\_isomorphism "Order isomorphism")_ or (less commonly) an _isotone isomorphism_.

If ![Image 34: {\displaystyle X=Y,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/83757ed7b7162654e88c32747556f2bf80fc57f0) then this is a relation-preserving [automorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism "Automorphism").

In [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"), isomorphisms are defined for all [algebraic structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure "Algebraic structure"). Some are more specifically studied; for example:

*   [Linear isomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_isomorphism "Linear isomorphism") between [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"); they are specified by [invertible matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrices "Invertible matrices").
*   [Group isomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_isomorphism "Group isomorphism") between [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)"); the classification of [isomorphism classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_class "Isomorphism class") of [finite groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_group "Finite group") is an open problem.
*   [Ring isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_isomorphism "Ring isomorphism") between [rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)").
*   Field isomorphisms are the same as ring isomorphism between [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"); their study, and more specifically the study of [field automorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_automorphism "Field automorphism") is an important part of [Galois theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory "Galois theory").

Just as the [automorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism "Automorphism") of an [algebraic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure "Algebraic structure") form a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)"), the isomorphisms between two algebras sharing a common structure form a [heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(mathematics) "Heap (mathematics)"). Letting a particular isomorphism identify the two structures turns this heap into a group.

In [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"), the [Laplace transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform "Laplace transform") is an isomorphism mapping hard [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equations "Differential equations") into easier [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") equations.

In [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"), an isomorphism between two graphs _G_ and _H_ is a [bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective "Bijective") map _f_ from the vertices of _G_ to the vertices of _H_ that preserves the "edge structure" in the sense that there is an edge from [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)")_u_ to vertex _v_ in _G_ if and only if there is an edge from ![Image 35: {\displaystyle f(u)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/32b282ccf3cf0f2b0b601e8629d61612d4951098) to ![Image 36: {\displaystyle f(v)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/92b2b785b7b6d9a22484d466da88d6328ed0b197) in _H_. See [graph isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism "Graph isomorphism").

In [order theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory "Order theory"), an isomorphism between two partially ordered sets _P_ and _Q_ is a [bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective "Bijective") map ![Image 37: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) from _P_ to _Q_ that preserves the order structure in the sense that for any elements ![Image 38: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) and ![Image 39: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) of _P_ we have ![Image 40: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) less than ![Image 41: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) in _P_ if and only if ![Image 42: {\displaystyle f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074) is less than ![Image 43: {\displaystyle f(y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aaa9215c6afa4892692ba05ae4c44f23600ea79d) in _Q_. As an example, the set {1,2,3,6} of whole numbers ordered by the _is-a-factor-of_ relation is isomorphic to the set {_O_, _A_, _B_, _AB_} of [blood types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system "ABO blood group system") ordered by the _can-donate-to_ relation. See [order isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_isomorphism "Order isomorphism").

In mathematical analysis, an isomorphism between two [Hilbert spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space") is a bijection preserving addition, scalar multiplication, and inner product.

In early theories of [logical atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_atomism "Logical atomism"), the formal relationship between facts and true propositions was theorized by [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") and [Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein "Ludwig Wittgenstein") to be isomorphic. An example of this line of thinking can be found in Russell's _[Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction\_to\_Mathematical\_Philosophy "Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy")_.

In [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics"), the [good regulator theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_regulator_theorem "Good regulator theorem") or Conant–Ashby theorem is stated as "Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system". Whether regulated or self-regulating, an isomorphism is required between the regulator and processing parts of the system.

Category theoretic view
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isomorphism&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Category theoretic view")]

In [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory"), given a [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(mathematics) "Category (mathematics)")_C_, an isomorphism is a morphism ![Image 44: {\displaystyle f:a\to b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5224bc5c18933c7ba94bf012e0f07c0f444b3f46) that has an inverse morphism ![Image 45: {\displaystyle g:b\to a,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/199fd0a26fbe3cf2449be01474d1465628c1cada) that is, ![Image 46: {\displaystyle fg=1_{b}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8dc6224e6e22e26369cff76f7e906579ed0056a2) and ![Image 47: {\displaystyle gf=1_{a}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2dff6dbaf6ad57ead7e92a5f0393988cfda730bf)

### Isomorphism vs. bijective morphism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isomorphism&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Isomorphism vs. bijective morphism")]

In a [concrete category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_category "Concrete category") (roughly, a category whose objects are sets (perhaps with extra structure) and whose morphisms are structure-preserving functions), such as the [category of topological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_topological_spaces "Category of topological spaces") or categories of algebraic objects (like the [category of groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_groups "Category of groups"), the [category of rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_rings "Category of rings"), and the [category of modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_modules "Category of modules")), an isomorphism must be bijective on the [underlying sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underlying_set "Underlying set"). In algebraic categories (specifically, categories of [varieties in the sense of universal algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(universal_algebra) "Variety (universal algebra)")), an isomorphism is the same as a homomorphism which is bijective on underlying sets. However, there are concrete categories in which bijective morphisms are not necessarily isomorphisms (such as the category of topological spaces).

Since a composition of isomorphisms is an isomorphism, the identity is an isomorphism, and the inverse of an isomorphism is an isomorphism, the relation that two mathematical objects are isomorphic is an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation"). An [equivalence class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") given by isomorphisms is commonly called an **isomorphism class**.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic#cite_note-2)

Examples of isomorphism classes are plentiful in mathematics.

*   Two sets are isomorphic if there is a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") between them. The isomorphism class of a finite set can be identified with the non-negative integer representing the number of elements it contains.
*   The isomorphism class of a [finite-dimensional vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-dimensional_vector_space "Finite-dimensional vector space") can be identified with the non-negative integer representing its dimension.
*   The [classification of finite simple groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple_groups "Classification of finite simple groups") enumerates the isomorphism classes of all [finite simple groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_simple_groups "Finite simple groups").
*   The [classification of closed surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)#Classification_of_closed_surfaces "Surface (topology)") enumerates the isomorphism classes of all connected [closed surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_surface "Closed surface").
*   [Ordinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number "Ordinal number") are essentially defined as isomorphism classes of well-ordered sets (though there are technical issues involved).
*   There are three isomorphism classes of the planar [subalgebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subalgebra "Subalgebra") of M(2,**R**), the 2 x 2 real matrices.

However, there are circumstances in which the isomorphism class of an object conceals vital information about it.

*   Given a [mathematical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure "Mathematical structure"), it is common that two [substructures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructure_(mathematics) "Substructure (mathematics)") belong to the same isomorphism class. However, the way they are included in the whole structure can not be studied if they are identified. For example, in a finite-dimensional vector space, all [subspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace") of the same dimension are isomorphic, but must be distinguished to consider their intersection, sum, etc.
*   In [homotopy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_theory "Homotopy theory"), the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") of a [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space")![Image 52: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) at a point ![Image 53: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36), though technically denoted ![Image 54: {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(X,p)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7d09ac1386cc00599b55d8fe4f273bda3c24a91e) to emphasize the dependence on the base point, is often written lazily as simply ![Image 55: {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(X)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c502a8f1054224532cb495be2f6b5e65f660c2aa) if ![Image 56: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is [path connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space#Path_connectedness "Connected space"). The reason for this is that the existence of a path between two points allows one to identify [loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(topology) "Loop (topology)") at one with loops at the other; however, unless ![Image 57: {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(X,p)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7d09ac1386cc00599b55d8fe4f273bda3c24a91e) is [abelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group "Abelian group") this isomorphism is non-unique. Furthermore, the classification of [covering spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space "Covering space") makes strict reference to particular [subgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup "Subgroup") of ![Image 58: {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(X,p)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7d09ac1386cc00599b55d8fe4f273bda3c24a91e), specifically distinguishing between isomorphic but [conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugacy_class "Conjugacy class") subgroups, and therefore amalgamating the elements of an isomorphism class into a single featureless object seriously decreases the level of detail provided by the theory.

Relation to equality
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isomorphism&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Relation to equality")]

Although there are cases where isomorphic objects can be considered equal, one must distinguish _[equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality\_(mathematics) "Equality (mathematics)")_ and _isomorphism_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic#cite_note-3) Equality is when two objects are the same, and therefore everything that is true about one object is true about the other. On the other hand, isomorphisms are related to some structure, and two isomorphic objects share only the properties that are related to this structure.

For example, the sets ![Image 59: {\displaystyle A=\left\{x\in \mathbb {Z} \mid x^{2}<2\right\}\quad {\text{ and }}\quad B=\{-1,0,1\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b250ba2c8cc24752de1dd746503ef1043d547d32) are _equal_; they are merely different representations—the first an [intensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensional_definition "Intensional definition") one (in [set builder notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_builder_notation "Set builder notation")), and the second [extensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_definition "Extensional definition") (by explicit enumeration)—of the same subset of the integers. By contrast, the sets ![Image 60: {\displaystyle \{A,B,C\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5e76678c579efebb6722408baaacae933f842747) and ![Image 61: {\displaystyle \{1,2,3\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/959905040c4110bae682eae9db986227c5506dcd) are not _equal_ since they do not have the same elements. They are isomorphic as sets, but there are many choices (in fact 6) of an isomorphism between them: one isomorphism is

![Image 62: {\displaystyle {\text{A}}\mapsto 1,{\text{B}}\mapsto 2,{\text{C}}\mapsto 3,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/806e902d5f601760eac4ab9fe0ce65852e6e0616)
while another is

![Image 63: {\displaystyle {\text{A}}\mapsto 3,{\text{B}}\mapsto 2,{\text{C}}\mapsto 1,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/769e836ca36673f617cbc90142dbf4236a7c5bc8)
and no one isomorphism is intrinsically better than any other.[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic#cite_note-4) On this view and in this sense, these two sets are not equal because one cannot consider them _identical_: one can choose an isomorphism between them, but that is a weaker claim than identity and valid only in the context of the chosen isomorphism.

Also, [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") and [even numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_number "Even number") are isomorphic as [ordered sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_set "Ordered set") and [abelian groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group "Abelian group") (for addition), but cannot be considered equal sets, since one is a [proper subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_subset "Proper subset") of the other.

On the other hand, when sets (or other [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object")) are defined only by their properties, without considering the nature of their elements, one often considers them to be equal. This is generally the case with solutions of [universal properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_properties "Universal properties").

For example, the [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") are formally defined as [equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") of pairs of integers, although nobody thinks of a rational number as a set (equivalence class). The universal property of the rational numbers is essentially that they form a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") that contains the integers and does not contain any proper subfield. Given two fields with these properties, there is a unique field isomorphism between them. This allows identifying these two fields, since every property of one of them can be transferred to the other through the isomorphism. The [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") that can be expressed as a quotient of integers form the smallest subfield of the reals. There is thus a unique isomorphism from this subfield of the reals to the rational numbers defined by equivalence classes.
