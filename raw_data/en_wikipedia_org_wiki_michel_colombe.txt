1430 – c.

1513 ) was a French sculptor whose work bridged the late Gothic and Renaissance styles.

Born in Bourges into a family of artisans, he was active in Tours . Colombe's surviving works all date from his old age. He created the gisant figures of the two deceased children of Charles VIII of France on their monument (1506) in Tours Cathedral . However, his most important surviving works were for the magnificent tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany , in Nantes Cathedral (1502–1507), and for the mausoleum of Philibert II of Savoy , at Notre-Dame de Brou, his masterwork.

The Francis II monument was designed by Jean Perréal ; it was disassembled and buried for safekeeping during the French Revolution .

[ 1 ] An Entombment at the Abbey of Solesmes (1494–1498) is attributed to him.  A bas-relief commissioned in 1508 by Georges d'Amboise for the Château de Gaillon is conserved in the Musée du Louvre . His brother Jean Colombe was an important miniature painter and illuminator who worked on the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry . His nephew Guillaume Regnault appears to have trained in his atelier.
