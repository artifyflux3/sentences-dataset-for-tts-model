Rock types native to a specific area All of " Devonian and younger", " Silurian ", and " Ordovician " are country rock. The igneous intrusion leads to a volcanic eruption .

In geology , country rock is the rock native to an area, in contrast to any intrusion of viscous geologic material, commonly magma , or perhaps rock salt (in salt domes ) or unconsolidated sediments .

[ 1 ] A dike (dark) intrudes into the country rock (light), Baranof Island , Alaska , United States Magma is typically less dense than the rock it intrudes, widening and filling existing cracks, sometimes melting the already-existing country rock.

[ 2 ] The term "country rock" is similar to, and in many cases interchangeable with, the terms basement and wall rocks .

Country rock can denote the widespread lithology of a region in relation to the rock which is being discussed or observed.

Geologic settings [ edit ] Settings in geology when the term country rock is used include: Igneous intrusions [ edit ] When describing a pluton or dike , the igneous rock can be described as intruding the surrounding country rock , the rock into which the pluton has intruded.

[ 3 ] When country rock is intruded by a dike, perpendicular to the bedding plane , it is called discordant intrusion, while a parallel intrusion by a sill indicates a sub-parallel or concordant intrusion .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 2 ] [ 6 ] Most intrusions into country rock are via magma . Usually, country rock is intruded by an igneous body of rock which formed when magma forced upward through fractures , or melted through overlying rock . Magma then cooled into solid rock, different from the surrounding country rock. Sometimes, a fragment of country rock will break off and become incorporated into the intrusion, and is called a xenolith , from Greek , ξένος , xenos , "strange,", and λίθος , lithos , the ancient Greek word for "stone." [ 7 ] The heat of the intrusions usually changes the country rock, often to contact metamorphic rock . Commonly, hornfels is produced, or skarn .

[ 7 ] Alluvial settings [ edit ] When describing recent alluvium , the material that has arrived through volcanic , glacial or fluvial action can be described as a veneer on the (older) country rock.
