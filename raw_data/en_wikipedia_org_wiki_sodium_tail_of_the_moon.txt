Brightness of the focused lunar tail’s spot The Moon has been shown to have a "tail" of sodium atoms too faint to be detected by the human eye . Hundreds of thousands of kilometers long, the feature was discovered in 1998 as a result of scientists from Boston University observing the Leonid meteor shower .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The Moon is constantly releasing atomic sodium as a fine dust from its surface due to photon -stimulated desorption , solar wind sputtering , and meteorite impacts .

[ 4 ] Solar radiation pressure accelerates the sodium atoms away from the Sun , forming an elongated tail toward the antisolar direction .

The continual impacts of small meteorites produce a constant "tail" from the Moon, but the Leonids intensified it, [ 5 ] thus making it more observable from Earth than usual.

[ 6 ] ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 discovered an abundance of sodium on the Moon in October 2023.
