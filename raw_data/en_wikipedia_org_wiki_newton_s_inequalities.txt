These inequalities are named after Isaac Newton who proved the theorem in 1707.

[ 1 ] Suppose a 1 , a 2 , ..., a n are non-negative real numbers and let e k {\displaystyle e_{k}} denote the k th elementary symmetric polynomial in a 1 , a 2 , ..., a n .  Then the elementary symmetric means , given by S k = e k ( n k ) , {\displaystyle S_{k}={\frac {e_{k}}{\binom {n}{k}}},} satisfy the inequality S k − − 1 S k + 1 ≤ ≤ S k 2 .

{\displaystyle S_{k-1}S_{k+1}\leq S_{k}^{2}.} Equality holds if and only if all the numbers a i are equal.

It can be seen that S 1 is the arithmetic mean , and S n is the n -th power of the geometric mean .
