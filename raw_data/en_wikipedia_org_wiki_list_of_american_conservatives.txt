[ 7 ] The recent movement is based in the Republican Party , though some Democrats were also important figures early in the movement's history.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] The following list is made up of prominent American conservatives from the public and private sectors.  The list also includes political parties, organizations and media outlets which have made a notable impact on conservatism in the United States. Entries on the list must have achieved notability after 1932, the beginning of the Fifth Party System .  Before 1932, terminology was different. Positions that are called conservative after 1932, were typically called "liberal" (i.e.

classical liberal ) before then. Likewise European liberals, such as Friedrich Hayek , were called conservatives when they came to America, which puzzled Hayek.

Conservatives have not liked what they see as the 'mushy' and 'confused' morals and the political, sexual and social mores of the American Nation of the last 50 years. They want clarity. They want guidelines based on Judeo-Christian values. They trust God. Most Conservatives believe any sexual activity outside of the marriage contract is wrong. They believe that abortion is equivalent to murder, and they oppose assisted suicide.

Conservatives had a fear of Communism shared by most Americans. During this time a popular anti-Communist culture emerged in America, evident in movies, television programs, community activities, and grassroots organizations. This popular anti-Communist culture generated patriotic rallies, parades, city resolutions, and an array of anti—Communist groups concerned about Communist influence in the schools, textbooks, churches, labor unions, industry, and universities.

For most conservatives, if there is a common culprit in explaining society's descent into moral chaos, then it is relativism – the notion that there are no absolute values or standards, merely different interpretations and perspectives.

"The Conservative Kerouac" .

The American Conservative .

My father and my mother and my sister and I have always voted Republican, always." This had nothing to do with party planks and everything to do with family identity, with holding onto something, no matter how arbitrary, in an otherwise disorienting world. We're Kerouacs and this is what we do ^ Kauffman, Bill (July 7, 2022).

"Who was the most right-wing member of the Beat Generation?" .

The Spectator .

The gentle Catholic-Buddhist Jack Kerouac, spontaneous-bop prosody prince of the Old Right, has the strongest claim. In 1952, shortly after finishing the novel that would be published five years later as On the Road, he argued for Robert Taft, "Mr. Republican," for president, while his pal Allen Ginsberg was puffing up Cold Warrior and son of a robber baron Averell Harriman.

"Kerouac, the Unexpected Right-Winger" .

Columbia Daily Spectator .

His New York Times obituary recalls a man who had "no use for the radical politics that came to preoccupy many of his friends and readers." "I'm not a beatnik. I'm a Catholic," he mused as he directed the interviewer to a picture of Pope Paul VI. "You know who painted that?" Kerouac asked. "Me." Perhaps we've misunderstood him all along.
