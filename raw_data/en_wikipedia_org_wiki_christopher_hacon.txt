[ 1 ] He is currently distinguished professor of mathematics at the University of Utah where he holds a Presidential Endowed Chair. His research interests include algebraic geometry .

Hacon was born in Manchester , but grew up in Italy where he studied at the Scuola Normale Superiore and received a degree in mathematics at the University of Pisa in 1992. He received his doctorate from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1998, under supervision of Robert Lazarsfeld .

Awards and honors [ edit ] In 2007, he was awarded a Clay Research Award for his work, joint with James McKernan , on "the birational geometry of algebraic varieties in dimension greater than three, in particular, for [an] inductive proof of the existence of flips." [ 2 ] In 2009, he was awarded the Cole Prize for outstanding contribution to algebra, along with McKernan.

[ 3 ] He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians 2010 in Hyderabad , on the topic of " Algebraic Geometry.

" [ 4 ] In 2011, he was awarded the Antonio Feltrinelli Prize in Mathematics, Mechanics and Applications by Italy's prestigious Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei .

[ 5 ] In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 6 ] In 2012, he became a Simons Investigator .

[ 7 ] In 2015, he won the American Mathematical Society Moore Prize.

[ 8 ] In 2017, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

[ 9 ] In 2017, he won the 2018 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics (with James McKernan ).

[ 10 ] In 2018, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences .

In 2019, he was elected to the Royal Society .
