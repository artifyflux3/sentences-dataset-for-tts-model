The Economist newspaper called it "an important book as well as a provocative one: the best statement to date of the pessimist's position on Islamic immigration in Europe." [ 4 ] Others were more blunt, accusing Caldwell of stoking what The Guardian referred to as a " culture of fear ".

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] In 2020, Caldwell published The Age of Entitlement , in which he argues that the civil rights movement has had significant unintended consequences: "Just half a decade into the civil rights revolution, America had something it had never had at the federal level, something the overwhelming majority of its citizens would never have approved: an explicit system of racial preference. Plainly the civil rights acts had wrought a change in the country's constitutional culture." [ 8 ] Caldwell writes that the Civil Rights Act 1964 was "not just a major new element in the Constitution ," but "a rival constitution, with which the original one was frequently incompatible." [ 9 ] It was reviewed in The New York Times , [ 10 ] The Wall Street Journal , and the Claremont Review of Books .

Richard Aldous wrote in The Wall Street Journal , "It's curious that a book subtitled 'America Since the Sixties' doesn't actually have much history in it", going on to say: "The reader turns the page expectantly, waiting to see what Mr. Caldwell has to say about President Trump . We will never know, at least not from reading this book, because Mr. Caldwell ends in 2015. ... That's a shame, because 'The Age of Entitlement' raises important questions not just about the future of the republic but about Western society more generally." [ 11 ] Personal life [ edit ] His wife, Zelda, is the daughter of journalist Robert Novak .

[ 12 ] His daughter, Lucy Caldwell, was the campaign manager for Joe Walsh 's presidential campaign challenging Donald Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020 .

[ 13 ] Caldwell is Catholic.
