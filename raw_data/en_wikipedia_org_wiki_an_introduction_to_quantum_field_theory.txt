Schroeder Language English Subject Quantum field theory Particle physics Publisher Addison-Wesley Publication date 1995 Publication place Massachusetts , United States ISBN 0-201-50397-2 An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory is a graduate textbook on quantum field theory and particle physics , written by Michael Peskin and Daniel V. Schroeder . Commonly known as Peskin and Schroeder for short, it was originally published by Addison-Wesley in 1995.

[ 1 ] Table of contents [ edit ] The book is divided into three portions. The first covers quantum electrodynamics using Feynman diagrams , the second the Wilsonian approach to renormalization , and the third non-Abelian gauge theories and the Standard Model .

[ 2 ] These parts are divided into chapters as follows: [ 1 ] Feynman Diagrams and Quantum Electrodynamics Invitation: Pair Production in e + e - Annihilation The Klein–Gordon Field The Dirac Field Interacting Fields and Feynman Diagrams Elementary Processes of Quantum Electrodynamics Radiative Corrections: Introduction Radiative Corrections: Some Formal Developments Final Project: Radiation of Gluon Jets Renormalization Invitation: Ultraviolet Cutoffs and Critical Fluctuations Functional Methods Systematics of Renormalization Renormalization and Symmetry The Renormalization Group [ a ] Critical Exponents and Scalar Field Theory [ a ] Final Project: Coleman–Weinberg Potential Non-Abelian Gauge Theories Invitation: The Parton Model of Hadron Structure Non-Abelian Gauge Invariance Quantization of Non-Abelian Gauge Theories Quantum Chromodynamics [ a ] Operator Products and Effective Vertices [ a ] Perturbation Theory Anomalies Gauge Theories with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Quantization of Spontaneously Broken Gauge Theories Final Project: Decays of the Higgs Boson Epilogue Quantum Field Theory at the Frontier Reception [ edit ] The textbook was well received when it was released and it has become a standard textbook in the field.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Emil Martinec praised how theory was developed in order to connect with experiments.

[ 7 ] Martinec said that before the book, his students needed to consult many different sources.

[ 7 ] Michelangelo Mangano writing for the CERN Courier indicated that the third chapter could be a book by itself and was previously not available in textbook form.

[ 2 ] Tom Banks praised Peskin and Schroeder's treatment of quantum electrodynamics (chapter 5) and Wilsonian renormalization.

[ 8 ] Banks only criticized that Feynman rules were derived twice in the book, and that it omitted topics in the non-perturbative treatment of quantum field theory like color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .

[ 8 ] Nima Arkani-Hamed considers the book by Peskin and Schroeder one of the two classics in the field, along with the 1964 Relativistic Quantum Mechanics by Sidney Drell and James Bjorken .
