Nunavut Northwest Territories Greenland Quebec Newfoundland and Labrador The Gulf of Boothia / ˈ b uː θ i ə / is a body of water in Nunavut , Canada. Administratively it is divided between the Kitikmeot Region on the west and the Qikiqtaaluk Region on the east. It merges north into Prince Regent Inlet , the two forming a single bay with different names for its parts. It is surrounded by, clockwise, Baffin Island , Fury and Hecla Strait , the Melville Peninsula , the Canadian mainland, and the Boothia Peninsula . The south end is Committee Bay , northwest of which are the Simpson Peninsula and Pelly Bay .

[ 1 ] On the west side of the gulf at 70°18′N 91°42′W ﻿ / ﻿ 70.300°N 91.700°W ﻿ / 70.300; -91.700 ﻿ ( Eden Bay ) [ 2 ] , north of Pelly Bay and Thom Bay , is Eden Bay, which should not be confused with a bay of the same name in the Qikiqtaaluk Region.

In 1822, it was seen by some of William Edward Parry 's men, who went on foot along the ice-choked Fury and Hecla Strait. In 1829, it was entered by John Ross , who was frozen in for four years and named it for his patron Sir Felix Booth . Its south end was explored by John Rae in 1846–1847, who reached it overland from the south.
