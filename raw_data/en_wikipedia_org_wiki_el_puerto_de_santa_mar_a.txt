As of 2016 [update] , the city has a population of c. 88,184, of which some 50,000 live in the urban center, and the remainder in the surrounding areas.

The town of El Puerto de Santa María is located 10 km (6 mi) northeast of Cádiz, across the bay of Cádiz .

Geography [ edit ] Housing is primarily located on the right (western) bank of the Guadalete , near its discharge into the Bay of Cádiz , in the Atlantic coast of the southwestern Iberian Peninsula . The municipality nears Jerez de la Frontera , Rota , Puerto Real , and Cádiz . Parts of the municipality belong to the Bahía de Cádiz Natural Park .

History [ edit ] The place on which El Puerto is built is identified as a probable location for the Portus Gaditanus [ es ] , a major shipping point for the exports of goods from the Baetica under Roman rule .

[ 4 ] Likewise, the Portus Gaditanus is in turn identified by some authors with the ancient Portus Menesthei .

[ 5 ] Both identifications are however not free of controversy.

[ 6 ] Whatever the case, the Portus Gaditanus was promoted by Lucius Cornelius Balbus Minor on a pre-existing pier in the hinterland of Gades at some point after the latter became a municipium civium Romanorum in the second half of the 1st century BCE in the wake of the supression of the old regime of Punic suffetes .

[ 7 ] From the 10th to the 12th centuries, under Islamic rule , the place hosted a small rural community ( alquería ) known as al-Qanatir , presumably in reference to some kind of old bridge over the Guadalete .

[ 8 ] The alqueria (which came to be renamed as Santa María del Puerto ) should have been occupied by Castile towards 1255–57 in the context of the preparations for Alfonso X's 1260 African crusade in Salé .

[ 9 ] The partitioning of the territory ensued from 1264 to 1268, and the place was populated by Christian settlers, primarily Basques, Cantabrians, and Castilians, as well as some Catalans.

[ 10 ] El Puerto soon passed to control of the newly-created Order of Saint Mary of Spain .

[ 11 ] On 16 December 1281, Alfonso X granted El Puerto a chartae populationis [ es ] , recognising it as realengo (' royal demesne ') and styling its name as Grand Puerto de Santa María .

[ 12 ] Throughout the late middle ages, El Puerto was one of the most importants towns of the Kingdom of Seville .

[ 13 ] The population should not have reached more than 2,000 people in 15th century.

[ 14 ] Christopher Columbus visited El Puerto in 1480 and received encouragement for his travel plans. He also met Juan de la Cosa , who would become his pilot during his first expedition to the Americas, which set sail from El Puerto de Santa María in 1492. Juan de la Cosa drew his world map (the first including the coast of New World) in El Puerto in 1500.

El Puerto was the residence of several wealthy cargadores , merchants who operated Spain's trade with the Americas.

In the nineteenth century the city became the General Headquarters for the French Army during the Peninsular War under the reign of Joseph Bonaparte (1801–1812).

[ 15 ] The town is steeped in history, museums and monuments. It is also within easy reach of the historical cities of Seville and Cádiz .

Economy [ edit ] The most important economic activity is tourism , mainly because of the beaches, as well as the bullfights held at the arena during the summer. The town also hosts large groups of motorcyclists during the Jerez Motorcycle Grand Prix . There is commercial development in the center and periphery, and a highly developed wine industry.
