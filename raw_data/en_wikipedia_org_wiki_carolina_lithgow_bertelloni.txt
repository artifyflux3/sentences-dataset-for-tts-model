She was elected a fellow of the American Geophysical Union in 2021.

Education and career [ edit ] Lithgow-Bertelloni has a B.Sc. from the University of Puerto Rico (1987) and earned her Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1994.

[ 1 ] Following her Ph.D., Lithgow-Bertelloni held positions at Universität Göttingen , Georgia Tech , Carnegie Institution of Washington before becoming an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in 1997, where she remained until 2011. She subsequently held multiple positions at University College London , Roma Tre University , and Carnegie Institute of Washington. In 2018, Lithgow-Bertelloni became the Louis B. and Martha B. Slichter Endowed Chair in Geosciences at the University of California, Los Angeles .

[ 1 ] Research [ edit ] The research done by Lithgow-Bertelloni combines planetary science and geophysics. She is particularly interested in how processes below the surface, e.g., in the mantle , drive processes occurring on Earth's surface. Her research includes investigations into the movement of tectonic plates , [ 2 ] particularly in the geological past.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] She has examined processes that contribute to variability in plate motion including mineralogy in the subsurface [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and chemical heterogeneity in the mantle.

[ 7 ] Her research has contributed to our understanding of the early history of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain [ 8 ] and the role of changes in viscosity in establishing a boundary in the mantle at one megameter below the Earth's surface.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Lithgow-Bertelloni has also described the movement of oceanic plates, potentially distinct from the movement of land masses, over geologic time.
