Find sources: "Dani Rodrik" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) His 1997 book Has Globalization Gone Too Far?

was called "one of the most important economics books of the decade" in Bloomberg Businessweek .

In his article, he focused on three tensions between the global market and social stability. Pointing out that the so-called "globalization" has a dilemma of promoting international equality while exposing fault lines between the nation states with the skills and capitals to succeed in global markets and those without that advantage, he sees the free market system as a threat to social stability and deeply domestic norms.

[ 10 ] In 2000, Rodrick coined the political trilemma of the world economy .

[ 11 ] Dani Rodrik is a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 1998. He also founded Economics for Inclusive Prosperity (EfIP) with Suresh Naidu , Gabriel Zucman, and 11 additional founding members in February 2019.
