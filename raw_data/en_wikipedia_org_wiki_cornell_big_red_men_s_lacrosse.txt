That year, he was also awarded the Turnbull Award given to the top collegiate attackman. His career was played in an era when freshmen were not eligible to play varsity sports. McEneaney was also an outstanding football player, playing wide receiver. He was named to the All-Ivy second team in 1976, when he led Cornell in receiving and was second in team scoring. He was voted the outstanding player in the 1977 NCAA Championship game and represented the United States in the 1978 World Lacrosse Championships .
