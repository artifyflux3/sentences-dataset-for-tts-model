Kauaʻi has an area of 562.3 square miles (1,456.4 km 2 ), making it the fourth-largest of the islands and the 21st-largest island in the United States .

[ 5 ] Kauaʻi is 73 miles (117 km) northwest of Oʻahu , across the Kauaʻi Channel . The island's 2020 population was 73,298.

[ 6 ] Styling itself the "Garden Isle", Kauaʻi is the site of Waimea Canyon State Park and Nā Pali Coast State Park . It forms the bulk of Kauaʻi County , which includes Niʻihau as well as the small nearby islands of Kaʻula and Lehua .

Etymology and language [ edit ] Hawaiian narrative derives the name's origin from the legend of Hawaiʻiloa , the Polynesian navigator credited with discovering the Hawaiian Islands. The story relates that he named the island after a favorite son; a possible translation of Kauaʻi is "place around the neck", describing how a father would carry his child. Another possible translation is "food season".

[ 7 ] Kauaʻi was known for its distinct dialect of the Hawaiian language , which still survives on Niʻihau. While the dominant dialect is based on that of Hawaiʻi island , which has no [t] sound, the Kauaʻi dialect had this sound. This happened because the Kauaʻi dialect had retained the old Polynesian /t/ sound, replaced in the "standard" Hawaiʻi dialect by [k] . This difference applies to all words with these sounds, so the Kauaian name for Kauaʻi was pronounced "Tauaʻi", and Kapaʻa was pronounced "Tapaʻa".

History [ edit ] Settlement [ edit ] It is uncertain when humans discovered the Hawaiian islands. Early archaeological studies suggested that Polynesian explorers from the Marquesas Islands or Society Islands may have arrived as early as 600 AD, [ 8 ] possibly with a second wave arriving from Tahiti around 1100 AD [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Later analyses suggest that the first settlers arrived around 900–1200 AD [ 11 ] Arrival of James Cook [ edit ] A statue of Captain James Cook commemorating his landing at Waimea, Kauaʻi, January 20, 1778 In January 1778, British navigator James Cook made the first recorded contact between any European and the indigenous people of the Hawaiian Islands when he arrived at Kauaʻi by accident while crossing the Pacific during his third voyage of exploration . The British immediately observed similarities in language and culture between the Kauaians and the parts of Polynesia with which they were already familiar, such as Tahiti . After some Kauaians were persuaded to board his ship, Cook later wrote: I never saw [indigenous people] so astonished at entering a ship. Their eyes were continually flying from object to object, the wildness of their looks and actions fully expressed their surprise and astonishment.

[ 12 ] : 312 Later, while investigating a location for the ships to anchor, a shore party was mobbed by a crowd, a shot was fired, and one Kauaian was killed. The next day, January 20, 1778, the two ships anchored in Waimea Bay on the southwest coast, where the expedition spent days obtaining fresh water and trading for fresh food. The local people especially valued iron: even small amounts, such as a single nail, could be traded for plentiful food supplies. Within two weeks, Cook left the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands to continue his original mission.

[ 12 ] : 311-315 [ 13 ] : 12-15 Cession to the Kingdom of Hawaii [ edit ] Kamehameha I, portrait by James Gay Sawkins , based on Louis Choris sketch At the time of Cook's visit, the Hawaiian islands comprised several kingdoms.

[ 13 ] : 30 By 1795, the king of Hawaii Island, Kamehameha I , had established the Kingdom of Hawaii , uniting most of the islands, but Kauaʻi remained independent. Kamehameha tried to conquer Kauaʻi in 1796, but stormy seas caused the attack from Oahu to be canceled and he was afterward distracted by events elsewhere. By 1803, Kauaʻi was ruled by Kaumualiʻi , who maintained his independence from the Kingdom of Hawaii. A second invasion of Kauaʻi from Oahu was planned but this too was canceled after an epidemic broke out among Kamehameha's forces. In 1810, a diplomatic agreement was reached whereby Kaumualiʻi agreed to be Kamehameha's vassal , [ 13 ] : 47-50 and to cede Kauaʻi to the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi upon his death by making Kamehameha's son his heir.

[ 14 ] : 155-156, 186 Schäffer affair [ edit ] Artist's impression of Russian Fort Elizabeth overlooking Waimea Bay, Kauaʻi Main article: Schaffer affair The Schäffer affair was a diplomatic episode instigated in 1815 by Georg Anton Schäffer , a German working with the Russian American Company . While at Kauaʻi in 1816, Schäffer involved Kaumualiʻi in "a treasonable design" whereby Kauaʻi would accept the protection of the Russian Empire in exchange for exclusive trading privileges. In 1817, a fort was built at Waimea and a Russian flag raised over it. But on Kamehameha's orders, and persuaded by other foreign traders, Kaumualiʻi abandoned his relationship with Schäffer and forced the Russians to leave Kauaʻi.

[ 13 ] : 57-58 Plantations [ edit ] From the 1830s till the mid-20th century, plantations of sugarcane were Kauaʻi's most important industry. In 1835, the first sugarcane plantation was founded on Kauaʻi, and for the next century the industry dominated Hawaiʻi's economy.

[ 15 ] Kauaʻi's last sugarcane plantation, the 118-year-old Gay & Robinson Plantation, stopped planting sugar in 2008.

[ 16 ] Old Sugar Mill of Koloa [ edit ] Main article: Old Sugar Mill of Koloa In 1835, Old Koloa Town opened a sugar mill.

[ 17 ] From 1906 to 1934 the office of County Clerk was held by John Mahiʻai Kāneakua , who had been active in attempts to restore Queen Liliuokalani to the throne after the U.S. takeover of Hawaiʻi in 1893.

[ 18 ] Valdemar Knudsen [ edit ] Valdemar Emil Knudsen was a Norwegian who arrived on Kauaʻi in 1857. Knudsen, or "Kanuka", originally managed Grove Farm in Koloa . He later sought a warmer land and purchased the leases to Mana and Kekaha , where he became a successful sugarcane plantation owner. He settled in Waiawa, between Mana and Kekaha, immediately across the channel from Niʻihau Island.

[ 19 ] His son, Eric Alfred Knudsen , was born in Waiawa.

Knudsen was appointed land administrator by King Kamehameha for an area covering 400 km 2 , and was given the title konohiki as well as a position as a noble under the king. Knudsen, who spoke fluent Hawaiian , later became an elected representative and an influential politician.

[ 20 ] Knudsen lends his name to the Knudsen Gap, a narrow pass between Hã’upu Ridge and the Kahili Ridge. Its primary function was as a sugar farm.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Hurricane Iniki [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Hurricane Iniki .

[ edit ] Hurricane Iniki at peak intensity south of Kauaʻi on September 11 Hurricane Iniki ( / iː ˈ n iː k iː / ee- NEE -kee ; Hawaiian: ʻiniki meaning "strong and piercing wind") was a hurricane that struck the island of Kauaʻi on September 11, 1992. It was the most powerful hurricane to strike Hawaiʻi in recorded history, and the only hurricane to directly affect the state during the 1992 Pacific hurricane season .

[ 23 ] Forming on September 5, 1992, it was the first hurricane to hit the state since Hurricane Iwa in the 1982 season , and the only known major hurricane to hit the state. Iniki dissipated on September 13, about halfway between Hawaii and Alaska.

Mark Zuckerberg [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Mark Zuckerberg § Hawaiian land ownership .

[ edit ] In 2014, Zuckerberg purchased 700 acres of land on the Hawaiian island of Kauaʻi . In January 2017, Zuckerberg filed eight " quiet title and partition " lawsuits against hundreds of native Hawaiians to claim small tracts of land that they owned within his acreage.

[ 24 ] Zuckerberg responded to criticisms in a Facebook post, stating that the lawsuits were a good faith effort to pay the partial owners of the land their "fair share".

[ 24 ] When he learned that Hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other 49 states, he dropped the lawsuits. Zuckerberg stated that he regretted not taking the time to understand the process and its history before moving ahead.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] Geography [ edit ] Aerial view of Kauaʻi Na Pali Coast State Park Kalalau Beach The five-million-year-old island, the oldest of the main islands (Niʻihau is older), was formed volcanically as the Pacific Plate passed over the Hawaii hotspot .

[ 27 ] It consists of an eroded shield volcano with a 9.3–12.4 mi (15.0–20.0 km) diameter summit caldera and two flanking calderas.

Rejuvenation of the volcano 0.6–1.40 million years ago left lava flows and cones over the eastern two-thirds of the island.

[ 28 ] Kauaʻi's highest peak is Kawaikini , at 5,243 ft (1,598 m).

[ 29 ] The second-highest is Mount Waiʻaleʻale , near the center of the island, 5,148 ft (1,569 m) above sea level. One of the wettest spots on earth, with an annual average rainfall of 460 in (38.3 ft; 11.7 m), is on the east side of Mount Waiʻaleʻale. The rain has eroded deep valleys in the central mountains, carving out canyons with many scenic waterfalls. On the west side of the island, Waimea town is at the mouth of the Waimea River , whose flow formed Waimea Canyon, one of the world's most scenic canyons, which is part of Waimea Canyon State Park . At three thousand ft (910 m) deep, Waimea Canyon is often called "The Grand Canyon of the Pacific".

Kokeo Point lies on the island's south side.

[ citation needed ] The Na Pali Coast is an isolated center for recreation, including kayaking along the beaches and hiking on the trail along the coastal cliffs.

[ 30 ] The headlands Kamala Point, Kawai Point, Kawelikoa Point, Kuahonu Point, Paoʻa Point, and Molehu Point are on the southeast of the island; Makaokahaʻi Point and Weli Point are in the south.

At the lower elevations, the annual precipitation varies from an average of about 50 in (130 cm) on the windward (northeastern) shore to less than 20 in (51 cm) on the (southwestern) leeward side of the island. The average temperature in Lihu'e , the county seat, ranges from 78 °F (26 °C) in February to 85 °F (29 °C) in August and September.

Kauaʻi's mountainous regions offer cooler temperatures in contrast to the warm coastal areas. At Kōkeʻe State Park , 3,200–4,200 ft (980–1,280 m) ASL , day temperatures vary from an average of 45 °F (7 °C) in January to 68 °F (20 °C) in July. In the winter, temperatures have been known to drop down to the 30s and 40s at the park, which holds an unofficial record low of 29 °F (−2 °C), recorded in February 1986 at Kanaloahuluhulu Meadow.

Precipitation in Kauaʻi's mountainous regions averages 50–100 in (1,300–2,500 mm) annually. About ten mi (16 km) southeast of Kōkeʻe state park, at an elevation of 5,075 ft (1,547 m), is the Mt. Waiʻaleʻale rain gauge.

[ 32 ] Mt. Waiʻaleʻale is often cited as the wettest spot on earth, although this has been disputed. Based on data for the period from 1931 through 1960, the average yearly precipitation was 460 in (11,700 mm) (U.S. Environmental Science Services Administration, 1968). Between 1949 and 2004, the average yearly precipitation at Mt. Waiʻaleʻale was 374 in (9,500 mm).

[ 33 ] Kauaʻi also holds a record in hourly precipitation. During a storm on January 24–25, 1956, a rain gauge at Kauaʻi's former Kilauea Sugar Plantation recorded a record twelve in (305 mm) of precipitation in just 60 minutes. The value for one hour is an underestimate, since the rain gauge overflowed, which may have resulted in an error by as much as 1 in (25 mm).

[ 34 ] An accurate measurement may have exceeded Holt, Missouri 's world-record rainfall of 12 in (300 mm) in 42 minutes on June 22, 1947.

[ 35 ] Time zone [ edit ] Hawaii Standard Time ( UTC−10:00 ) is observed on Kauaʻi year-round. When mainland states are on daylight saving time , for example, the time on Kauaʻi is three hours behind the West Coast of the United States and six hours behind the East Coast .

In 2007, 1,271,000 people visited. The two largest groups were from the continental United States (84% of all visitors) and Japan (3%).

[ 37 ] As of 2003, approximately 27,000 jobs existed on Kauaʻi. The largest sector was accommodation/food services (26%, 6,800 jobs), followed by government (15%) and retail (14.5%), with agriculture accounting for 2.9% (780 jobs) and educational services providing 0.7% (183 jobs).

[ 38 ] The visitors' industry accounted for one third of Kauaʻi's income.

[ 38 ] Employment is dominated by small businesses, with 87% of all non-farm businesses having fewer than 20 employees.

[ 38 ] As of 2003, Kauaʻi's poverty rate was 10.5%, compared to the mainland at 10.7%.

[ 38 ] As of 2014, the median home price was about $400,000.

Pacific Missile Range Facility northwest of Kekaha, Kauaʻi Land in Kauaʻi is very fertile; farmers raise many varieties of fruit and other crops.

Guava , coffee , sugarcane, mango , banana , papaya , avocado , star fruit , kava , noni and pineapple are all cultivated on the island, but most agricultural land is used for raising cattle.

[ 37 ] Kauaʻi is home to the U.S. Navy's "Barking Sands" Pacific Missile Range Facility , on the western shore.

MF and HF (" shortwave ") radio station WWVH , sister station to WWV and low frequency WWVB in Fort Collins, Colorado , is on the west coast of Kauaʻi, about 3 mi (5 km) south of Barking Sands. WWVH, WWV and WWVB are operated by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology , broadcasting standard time and frequency information to the public.

Energy [ edit ] Main article: Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative was formed in November 2002. KIUC operates as a not-for-profit organization that is owned by its members and governed by an elected board of directors. It serves 39,978 meters (electric accounts). Of those, it has 29,000 residential member-owners and 4,000 commercial member-owners. KIUC serves 550 square miles with 1,530 transmission and distribution lines. Its generating capacity is 259.2 megawatts.

[ 39 ] In 2023, KIUC reported that 57.8% of its electricity came from renewable energy sources. In 2023, the fuel mix by source was 42.1% fossil fuel, 24.7% utility solar, 13.4% customer solar, and 7.8% biomass.

[ 40 ] KIUC is headquartered in Līhuʻe .

[ 41 ] In the 1970s, Kauaʻi burned sugarcane waste to supply most [ 42 ] of its electricity.

[ 42 ] By 2008, transition of energy sources and growth in generating capacity had occurred, with most of Kauaʻi's electricity produced by imported liquid petroleum . In 2006 and 2007, the inputs cost $69.3 million and $83 million, respectively.

[ 43 ] By 2011, 92% of KIUC's power came from diesel.

[ 44 ] By 2017, KIUC's fuel mix was 56% fossil fuels , 9% hydroelectric , 12% biomass and 23% solar . KIUC integrated large-scale solar into its grid so that, during sunny daylight hours, 97% or more of its generation came from renewable sources. KIUC offers $1,000 rebates to residential customers who have solar water heating systems installed on their homes.

[ 45 ] In 2017, KIUC opened a Tesla Energy 13 MW / 52 MWh battery next to the 12 MW Kapaia solar plant [ 46 ] for 13.9¢/kWh.

[ 44 ] In December 2018, KIUC opened an AES Distributed Energy project for 20 MW solar with 20 MW / 100 MWh batteries priced at 11.1¢/kWh.

[ 47 ] Towns and communities [ edit ] Līhuʻe , on the island's southeastern coast, is the seat of Kauaʻi County and the island's second-largest town. Kapaʻa, on the "Coconut Coast" (site of an old coconut plantation) about 6 mi (9.7 km) north of Līhuʻe, has a population of over 10,000, or about 50% greater than Līhuʻe.

Princeville , on the island's north side, was once the capital of Kauaʻi.

Communities on Kauaʻi range in population from the roughly 10,000 people in Kapaʻa to tiny hamlets. Below are the larger or more notable of those from the northernmost end of Hawaii Route 560 to the western terminus of Hawaii Route 50 : [ citation needed ] Kauaʻi towns and villages by population Name population Hāʻena State Park 550 Wainiha 419 Hanalei 450 Princeville 2,158 Kalihi Wai 428 Kīlauea 3,014 Anahola 2,311 Kapaʻa 11,652 Wailua 2,359 Hanamāʻulu 4,994 Līhuʻe 8,004 Wailua Homesteads 5,863 Puhi 3,380 Poʻipū 1,299 Kōloa 2,231 Lāwaʻi 2,578 Kalāheo 4,996 ʻEleʻele 2,515 Hanapēpē 2,678 Kaumakani 749 Waimea 2,057 Kekaha 3,715 Pākalā 294 Keālia 103 Hanalei town with a view of Mt.
