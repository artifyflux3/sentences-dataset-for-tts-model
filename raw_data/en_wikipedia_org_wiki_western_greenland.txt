Find sources: "Kitaa" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Map of West Greenland Kitaa , originally Vestgrønland ("West Greenland"), is a former administrative division of Greenland . It was by far the most populated of the divisions, being home to almost 90% of the total population.

[ 1 ] The divisions were de facto replaced by statistical regions after Greenland received home rule in 1979.

It is bordered in the west by the Baffin Bay , Davis Strait , Labrador Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean . To the east lies Tunu .

All but three of the island territory's municipalities were located in West Greenland. These were (in geographical order, from south to north): Nanortalik Qaqortoq Narsaq Ivittuut Paamiut Nuuk Maniitsoq Sisimiut Kangaatsiaq Aasiaat Qasigiannguit Ilulissat Qeqertarsuaq Uummannaq Upernavik See also [ edit ] Subdivisions of the Nordic countries Administrative divisions of Greenland Isua Greenstone Belt (geology) References [ edit ] ^ "Kitaa - Grønlandsk betegnelse for Vestgrønland" .
