The 1698 **Savery Engine** – the world's first commercially important [steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine"): built by [Thomas Savery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Savery "Thomas Savery")

The **history of thermodynamics** is a fundamental strand in the [history of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_physics "History of physics"), the [history of chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chemistry "History of chemistry"), and the [history of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science "History of science") in general. Due to the relevance of [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") in much of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"), its history is finely woven with the developments of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), [magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism"), and [chemical kinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_kinetics "Chemical kinetics"), to more distant applied fields such as [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"), [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory"), and [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") ([physiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology "Physiology")), and to [technological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") developments such as the [steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine"), [internal combustion engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine "Internal combustion engine"), [cryogenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics "Cryogenics") and [electricity generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation "Electricity generation"). The development of thermodynamics both drove and was driven by [atomic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory "Atomic theory"). It also, albeit in a subtle manner, motivated new directions in [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"); see, for example, the [timeline of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_thermodynamics "Timeline of thermodynamics").

The ancients viewed heat as that related to fire. In 3000 BC, the [ancient Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") viewed heat as related to origin mythologies.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-Griffith-1) The [ancient Indian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Indian_philosophy "Ancient Indian philosophy") including _Vedic philosophy_ believed that [five classical elements (or pancha mahā bhūta)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element") are the basis of all cosmic creations.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-2) In the [Western philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy "Western philosophy") tradition, after much debate about the primal element among earlier [pre-Socratic philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy "Pre-Socratic philosophy"), [Empedocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empedocles "Empedocles") proposed a four-element theory, in which all substances derive from [earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(classical_element) "Earth (classical element)"), [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(classical_element) "Water (classical element)"), [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(classical_element) "Air (classical element)"), and [fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(classical_element) "Fire (classical element)"). The Empedoclean element of fire is perhaps the principal ancestor of later concepts such as [phlogiston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston "Phlogiston") and [caloric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory "Caloric theory"). Around 500 BC, the [Greek philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy "Greek philosophy")[Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus "Heraclitus") became famous as the "flux and fire" philosopher for his proverbial utterance: "All things are flowing." Heraclitus argued that the three [principal elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_elements "Classical elements") in nature were fire, earth, and water.

The 5th century BC Greek philosopher [Parmenides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides "Parmenides"), in his only known work, a poem conventionally titled _On Nature_, uses verbal reasoning to postulate that a void, essentially what is now known as a [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"), in nature could not occur. This view was supported by the arguments of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), but was criticized by [Leucippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucippus "Leucippus") and [Hero of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria"). From antiquity to the Middle Ages various arguments were put forward to prove or disapprove the existence of a vacuum and several attempts were made to construct a vacuum but all proved unsuccessful.

**Heating** a body, such as a segment of [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein")[alpha helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix "Alpha helix") (above), tends to cause its atoms to vibrate more, and the body itself to expand—or change [phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter) "Phase (matter)"), if heating is continued; an axiom of nature noted by [Herman Boerhaave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Boerhaave "Herman Boerhaave") in the 1700s.

[Atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism") is a central part of today's relationship between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Ancient thinkers such as [Leucippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucippus "Leucippus") and [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus"), and later the [Epicureans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureans "Epicureans"), by advancing atomism, laid the foundations for the later [atomic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory "Atomic theory")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]. Until experimental proof of [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms "Atoms") was later provided in the 20th century, the atomic theory was driven largely by philosophical considerations and scientific intuition.

The European scientists [Cornelius Drebbel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Drebbel "Cornelius Drebbel"), [Robert Fludd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fludd "Robert Fludd"), [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") and [Santorio Santorio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorio_Santorio "Santorio Santorio") in the 16th and 17th centuries were able to gauge the relative "[coldness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldness "Coldness")" or "[hotness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature")" of air, using a rudimentary air [thermometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer "Thermometer") (or [thermoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoscope "Thermoscope")). This may have been influenced by an earlier device which could expand and contract the air constructed by [Philo of Byzantium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byzantium "Philo of Byzantium") and [Hero of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria").

### "Heat is motion" (Francis Bacon)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: \"Heat is motion\" (Francis Bacon)")]

Francis Bacon

The idea that heat is a form of [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") is perhaps an ancient one and is certainly discussed by the English philosopher and scientist [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon "Francis Bacon") in 1620 in his _Novum Organum_. Bacon surmised: "Heat itself, its essence and quiddity is motion and nothing else."[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-3) "not ... of the whole, but of the small particles of the body."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-4)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes_%28cropped%292.jpg/250px-Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes_%28cropped%292.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes_(cropped)2.jpg)

René Descartes

In 1637, in a letter to the Dutch scientist [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens"), the French philosopher [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") wrote:[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-5)

> Lifting 100 lb one foot twice over is the same as lifting 200 lb one foot, or 100 lb two feet.

In 1686, the German philosopher [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz") wrote essentially the same thing: The same force ["work" in modern terms] is necessary to raise body A of 1 pound (libra) to a height of 4 yards (ulnae), as is necessary to raise body B of 4 pounds to a height of 1 yard.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-6)

In _[Principles of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles\_of\_Philosophy "Principles of Philosophy")_ (_Principia Philosophiae_) from 1644, Descartes defined "quantity of motion" (_[Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin\_language "Latin language"): quantitas motus_) as the product of size and speed,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-:03-7) and claimed that the total quantity of motion in the universe is conserved.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-:03-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-8)

> If x is twice the size of y, and is moving half as fast, then there's the same amount of motion in each.

> [God] created matter, along with its motion ... merely by letting things run their course, he preserves the same amount of motion ... as he put there in the beginning.

He claimed that merely by letting things run their course, God preserves the same amount of motion as He created, and that thus the total quantity of motion in the universe is conserved.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-:0-9)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Boyles_Law.svg/250px-Boyles_Law.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boyles_Law.svg)

Boyle's law

Irish physicist and chemist [Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle") in 1656, in coordination with English scientist [Robert Hooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke "Robert Hooke"), built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed the pressure-volume correlation: PV=constant. In that time, air was assumed to be a system of motionless particles, and not interpreted as a system of moving molecules. The concept of thermal motion came two centuries later. Therefore, Boyle's publication in 1660 speaks about a mechanical concept: the air spring.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-10) Later, after the invention of the thermometer, the property temperature could be quantified. This tool gave [Gay-Lussac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay-Lussac "Gay-Lussac") the opportunity to derive his law, which led shortly later to the [ideal gas law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law "Ideal gas law").

The relationship had been anticipated by the work of [Guillaume Amontons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Amontons "Guillaume Amontons") in 1702.

Denis Papin

[Denis Papin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Papin "Denis Papin"), an associate of Boyle's, built in 1679 a bone digester, which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated. Later designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding. By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and cylinder engine. He did not however follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, [Thomas Newcomen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomen_atmospheric_engine "Newcomen atmospheric engine") greatly improved upon engineer [Thomas Savery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Savery "Thomas Savery")'s earlier "fire engine" by incorporating a piston. This made it suitable for mechanical work in addition to pumping to heights beyond 30 feet, and is thus often considered the first true steam engine.

### Heat transfer (Halley and Newton)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Heat transfer (Halley and Newton)")]

Edmond Halley

The phenomenon of [heat conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_conduction "Heat conduction") is immediately grasped in everyday life. The fact that warm air rises and the importance of the phenomenon to meteorology was first realised by [Edmond Halley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley "Edmond Halley") in 1686.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-11)

In 1701, Sir [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") published his [law of cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling "Newton's law of cooling").

The theory of phlogiston arose in the 17th century, late in the period of alchemy. Its replacement by [caloric theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory "Caloric theory") in the 18th century is one of the historical markers of the transition from alchemy to chemistry. Phlogiston was a hypothetical substance that was presumed to be liberated from combustible substances during [burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion "Combustion"), and from metals during the process of [rusting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusting "Rusting").

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Ice-calorimeter.jpg/250px-Ice-calorimeter.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ice-calorimeter.jpg)

The world's first **ice-calorimeter**, used in the winter of 1782–83, by [Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier "Antoine Lavoisier") and [Pierre-Simon Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace "Pierre-Simon Laplace"), to determine the heat evolved in various [chemical changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_change "Chemical change"); calculations which were based on [Joseph Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Black "Joseph Black")'s prior discovery of [latent heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat "Latent heat"). These experiments mark the foundation of [thermochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermochemistry "Thermochemistry").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Limit to the "degree of cold"

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Limit to the \"degree of cold\"")]

In 1702 [Guillaume Amontons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Amontons "Guillaume Amontons") introduced the concept of [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero "Absolute zero") based on observations of [gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas").

### Kinetic theory (18th century)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Kinetic theory (18th century)")]

An early scientific reflection on the microscopic and kinetic nature of matter and heat is found in a work by [Mikhail Lomonosov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Lomonosov "Mikhail Lomonosov"), in which he wrote: "Movement should not be denied based on the fact it is not seen. ... leaves of trees move when rustled by a wind, despite it being unobservable from large distances. Just as in this case motion ... remains hidden in warm bodies due to the extremely small sizes of the moving particles."

During the same years, [Daniel Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli "Daniel Bernoulli") published his book _Hydrodynamics_ (1738), in which he derived an equation for the pressure of a gas considering the collisions of its atoms with the walls of a container. He proved that this pressure is two thirds the average kinetic energy of the gas in a unit volume.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Bernoulli's ideas, however, made little impact on the dominant caloric culture. Bernoulli made a connection with [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz")'s _[vis viva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis\_viva "Vis viva")_ principle, an early formulation of the principle of [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy"), and the two theories became intimately entwined throughout their history.

### Thermochemistry and steam engines

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Thermochemistry and steam engines")]

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Black_Joseph_%28cropped%29.jpg/250px-Black_Joseph_%28cropped%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_Joseph_(cropped).jpg)

Joseph Black

Bodies were capable of holding a certain amount of this fluid, leading to the term _heat capacity_, named and first investigated by [Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland "Scotland") chemist [Joseph Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Black "Joseph Black") in the 1750s.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-Laider-12)

In the mid- to late 19th century, heat became understood as a manifestation of a system's [internal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_energy "Internal energy"). Today heat is seen as the transfer of disordered thermal energy. Nevertheless, at least in English, the term _heat capacity_ survives. In some other languages, the term _thermal capacity_ is preferred, and it is also sometimes used in English.

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg/330px-Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg)

A [Watt steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_steam_engine "Watt steam engine"), the steam engine that propelled the Industrial Revolution in Britain and the world

Prior to 1698 and the invention of the [Savery engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Savery "Thomas Savery"), horses were used to power pulleys, attached to buckets, which lifted water out of flooded salt mines in England. In the years to follow, more variations of [steam engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine") were built, such as the [Newcomen engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomen_steam_engine "Newcomen steam engine"), and later the [Watt engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_steam_engine "Watt steam engine"). In time, these early engines would eventually be utilized in place of horses. Thus, each engine began to be associated with a certain amount of "horse power" depending upon how many horses it had replaced. The main problem with these first engines was that they were slow and clumsy, converting less than 2% of the input [fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel "Fuel") into useful work. In other words, large quantities of coal (or wood) had to be burned to yield only a small fraction of work output. Hence the need for a new science of engine [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics) "Dynamics (mechanics)") was born.

In the mid- to late 18th century, [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat") was thought to be a measurement of an invisible fluid, known as the _[caloric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric\_theory "Caloric theory")_. Like phlogiston, caloric was presumed to be the "substance" of heat that would flow from a hotter body to a cooler body, thus warming it. The utility and explanatory power of [kinetic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases "Kinetic theory of gases"), however, soon started to displace the caloric theory. Nevertheless, [William Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin "William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin"), for example, was still trying to explain [James Joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule "James Prescott Joule")'s observations within a caloric framework as late as 1850. The caloric theory was largely obsolete by the end of the 19th century.

Antoine Lavoisier

Joseph Black and [Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavoisier "Lavoisier") made important contributions in the precise measurement of heat changes using the calorimeter, a subject which became known as [thermochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermochemistry "Thermochemistry"). The development of the steam engine focused attention on calorimetry and the amount of heat produced from different types of [coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal "Coal"). The first quantitative research on the heat changes during chemical reactions was initiated by Lavoisier using an ice calorimeter following research by Joseph Black on the [latent heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat "Latent heat") of water.

### Thermal conduction and thermal radiation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Thermal conduction and thermal radiation")]

[Carl Wilhelm Scheele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele "Carl Wilhelm Scheele") distinguished heat transfer by [thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation "Thermal radiation") (radiant heat) from that by convection and conduction in 1777.

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Physicist_Pierre_Pr%C3%A9vost_%28cropped%29.jpg/150px-Physicist_Pierre_Pr%C3%A9vost_%28cropped%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Physicist_Pierre_Pr%C3%A9vost_(cropped).jpg)

Pierre Prévost

In the 17th century, it came to be believed that all materials had an identical conductivity and that differences in sensation arose from their different [heat capacities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity "Heat capacity"). Suggestions that this might not be the case came from the new science of [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity "Electricity") in which it was easily apparent that some materials were good electrical conductors while others were effective insulators. [Jan Ingen-Housz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Ingen-Housz "Jan Ingen-Housz") in 1785-9 made some of the earliest measurements, as did Benjamin Thompson during the same period.

In 1791, [Pierre Prévost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Pr%C3%A9vost_(physicist) "Pierre Prévost (physicist)") showed that all bodies radiate heat, no matter how hot or cold they are. In 1804, Sir [John Leslie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Leslie_(physicist) "John Leslie (physicist)") observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation "Black-body radiation").

### Heat and friction (Rumford)

Benjamin Thompson

In the 19th century, scientists abandoned the idea of a physical caloric. The first substantial experimental challenges to the caloric theory arose in a [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inquiry_Concerning_the_Source_of_the_Heat_Which_Is_Excited_by_Friction "An Inquiry Concerning the Source of the Heat Which Is Excited by Friction") by [Benjamin Thompson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Thompson "Benjamin Thompson") (Count Rumford) from 1798, in which he showed that boring [cast iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron "Cast iron")[cannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon "Cannon") produced great amounts of heat which he ascribed to [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction"). His work was among the first to undermine the caloric theory.

As a result of [his experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inquiry_Concerning_the_Source_of_the_Heat_Which_Is_Excited_by_Friction "An Inquiry Concerning the Source of the Heat Which Is Excited by Friction") in 1798, Thompson suggested that heat was a form of motion, though no attempt was made to reconcile theoretical and experimental approaches, and it is unlikely that he was thinking of the _vis viva_ principle.

Sadi Carnot (1796–1832): the "father" of thermodynamics

Although early steam engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. One such scientist was [Sadi Carnot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_L%C3%A9onard_Sadi_Carnot "Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot"), the "father of thermodynamics", who in 1824 published _[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflections\_on\_the\_Motive\_Power\_of\_Fire "Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire")_, a discourse on heat, power, and engine efficiency. Most cite this book as the starting point for thermodynamics as a modern science. (The name "thermodynamics", however, did not arrive until 1854, when the British mathematician and physicist [William Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin "William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin") (Lord Kelvin) coined the term _thermo-dynamics_ in his paper _On the Dynamical Theory of Heat_.)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-kelvin1854-13)

Carnot defined "motive power" to be the expression of the _useful effect_ that a motor is capable of producing. Herein, Carnot introduced us to the first modern day definition of "[work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_work "Mechanical work")": _weight lifted through a height_. The desire to understand, via formulation, this _useful effect_ in relation to "work" is at the core of all modern day thermodynamics.

Even though he was working with the caloric theory, Carnot in 1824 suggested that some of the caloric available for generating useful work is lost in any real process.

### Reflection, refraction, and polarisation of radiant heat

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Reflection, refraction, and polarisation of radiant heat")]

Though it had come to be suspected from Scheele's work, in 1831 [Macedonio Melloni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonio_Melloni "Macedonio Melloni") demonstrated that radiant heat could be [reflected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)"), [refracted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction") and [polarised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarisation_(waves) "Polarisation (waves)") in the same way as light.

### Kinetic theory (early 19th century)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Kinetic theory (early 19th century)")]

[John Herapath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herapath "John Herapath") independently formulated a kinetic theory in 1820, but mistakenly associated temperature with [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") rather than _vis viva_ or [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy"). His work ultimately failed [peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review "Peer review"), even from someone as well-disposed to the kinetic principle as [Humphry Davy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy "Humphry Davy"), and was neglected.

[John James Waterston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Waterston "John James Waterston") in 1843 provided a largely accurate account, again independently, but his work received the same reception, failing peer review.

Further progress in kinetic theory started only in the middle of the 19th century, with the works of [Rudolf Clausius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius "Rudolf Clausius"), [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell"), and [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann").

### Mechanical equivalent of heat

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Mechanical equivalent of heat")]

Quantitative studies by Joule from 1843 onwards provided soundly reproducible phenomena, and helped to place the subject of thermodynamics on a solid footing. In 1843, Joule experimentally found the [mechanical equivalent of heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equivalent_of_heat "Mechanical equivalent of heat"). In 1845, Joule reported his best-known experiment, involving the use of a falling weight to spin a paddle-wheel in a barrel of water, which allowed him to estimate a mechanical equivalent of heat of 819 ft·lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). This led to the theory of [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy") and explained why heat can do work.

### Absolute zero and the Kelvin scale

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Absolute zero and the Kelvin scale")]

The idea of absolute zero was generalised in 1848 by Lord Kelvin.

### Entropy and the second law of thermodynamics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Entropy and the second law of thermodynamics")]

In March 1851, while grappling to come to terms with the work of Joule, [Lord Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kelvin "Lord Kelvin") started to speculate that there was an inevitable loss of useful heat in all processes. The idea was framed even more dramatically by [Hermann von Helmholtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz "Hermann von Helmholtz") in 1854, giving birth to the spectre of the [heat death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe "Heat death of the universe").

In 1854, [William John Macquorn Rankine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_John_Macquorn_Rankine "William John Macquorn Rankine") started to make use of what he called _thermodynamic function_ in calculations. This has subsequently been shown to be identical to the concept of [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy") formulated by the famed mathematical physicist [Rudolf Clausius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius "Rudolf Clausius").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-14)

In 1865, Clausius coined the term "[entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy")" (_das Wärmegewicht_, symbolized _S_) to denote heat lost or turned into waste.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-16) ("_Wärmegewicht_" translates literally as "heat-weight"; the corresponding English term stems from the Greek _τρέπω_, "I turn".) Clausius used the concept to develop his classic statement of the [second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics "Second law of thermodynamics") the same year.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-17)

### Statistical thermodynamics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Statistical thermodynamics")]

#### Temperature is average kinetic energy of molecules

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Temperature is average kinetic energy of molecules")]

In his 1857 work _On the nature of the motion called heat_, Clausius for the first time clearly states that heat is the average kinetic energy of molecules.

#### Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution")]

Clausius' above statement interested the Scottish mathematician and physicist [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell"), who in 1859 derived the momentum distribution later named after him. The Austrian physicist [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann") subsequently generalized this distribution for the case of gases in external fields. In association with Clausius, in 1871, Maxwell formulated a new branch of thermodynamics called _[statistical thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical\_mechanics "Statistical mechanics")_, which functions to analyze large numbers of particles at [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium "Thermodynamic equilibrium"), i.e., systems where no changes are occurring, such that only their average properties as temperature _T_, pressure _P_, and volume _V_ become important.

Boltzmann is perhaps the most significant contributor to kinetic theory, as he introduced many of the fundamental concepts in the theory. Besides the [Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution "Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution") mentioned above, he also associated the kinetic energy of particles with their [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry) "Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)"). The [Boltzmann equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_equation "Boltzmann equation") for the distribution function of a gas in non-equilibrium states is still the most effective equation for studying transport phenomena in gases and metals. By introducing the concept of [thermodynamic probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") as the number of microstates corresponding to the current macrostate, he showed that its logarithm is proportional to entropy.

#### Definition of entropy

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: Definition of entropy")]

In 1875, the Austrian physicist [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann") formulated a precise connection between entropy _S_ and molecular motion:

![Image 16: {\displaystyle S=k\log W\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d661e04a6d06cb2fc836994be647a9f02cb3c9be)
being defined in terms of the number of possible states _W_ that such motion could occupy, where _k_ is the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant").

In 1876, chemical engineer [Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Gibbs "Willard Gibbs") published an obscure 300-page paper titled: _On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances_, wherein he formulated one grand equality, the [Gibbs free energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy "Gibbs free energy") equation, which suggested a measure of the amount of "useful work" attainable in reacting systems.

Gibbs also originated the concept we now know as [enthalpy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy "Enthalpy")_H_, calling it "a heat function for constant pressure".[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-18) The modern word _enthalpy_ would be coined many years later by [Heike Kamerlingh Onnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes "Heike Kamerlingh Onnes"),[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics#cite_note-19) who based it on the Greek word _enthalpein_ meaning _to warm_.

### Stefan–Boltzmann law

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=43 "Edit section: Stefan–Boltzmann law")]

[James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell")'s 1862 insight that both light and radiant heat were forms of [electromagnetic wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave "Electromagnetic wave") led to the start of the [quantitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property "Quantitative property") analysis of thermal radiation. In 1879, [Jožef Stefan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C5%BEef_Stefan "Jožef Stefan") observed that the total [radiant flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_flux "Radiant flux") from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature and stated the [Stefan–Boltzmann law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law "Stefan–Boltzmann law"). The law was derived theoretically by [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann") in 1884.

### Quantum thermodynamics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=45 "Edit section: Quantum thermodynamics")]

In 1900 [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck") found an accurate [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law "Planck's law") for the spectrum of black-body radiation. Fitting new data required the introduction of a new constant, known as the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant"), the fundamental constant of modern physics. Looking at the radiation as coming from a cavity oscillator in thermal equilibrium, the formula suggested that energy in a cavity occurs only in multiples of frequency times the constant. That is, it is quantized. This avoided a divergence to which the theory would lead without the quantization.

### Third law of thermodynamics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_thermodynamics&action=edit&section=46 "Edit section: Third law of thermodynamics")]

In 1906, [Walther Nernst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Nernst "Walther Nernst") stated the [third law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_law_of_thermodynamics "Third law of thermodynamics").

Building on the foundations above, [Lars Onsager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Onsager "Lars Onsager"), [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger"), [Ilya Prigogine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine "Ilya Prigogine") and others, brought these engine "concepts" into the thoroughfare of almost every modern-day branch of science.
