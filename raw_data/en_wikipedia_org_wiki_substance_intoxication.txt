[ 7 ] Contact high [ edit ] Main article: Contact high Contact high is a phenomenon that occurs in otherwise sober people who experience a drug-like effect just by coming into contact with someone who is under the influence of a psychoactive drug . In a similar way to the placebo effect , a contact high may be caused by classical conditioning as well as by the physical and social
setting.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] The term is often incorrectly used to describe the high obtained from passive inhalation of marijuana .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Slang terms [ edit ] Main articles: argot and Drug culture Slang terms include: getting high (generic), being stoned , cooked , or blazed (usually in reference to cannabis), [ 4 ] and many more specific slang terms for particular intoxicants.

Alcohol intoxication is graded in intensity from buzzed , to tipsy then drunk all the way up to hammered , plastered , smashed , wasted , destroyed , shitfaced and a number of other terms. The term rolling is a common word used to describe being under the influence of MDMA and for LSD the phrases frying or tripping have been used. "Tripping" is a term that is considered applicable to virtually all hallucinogens which includes psychedelics , dissociatives , deliriants and possibly certain types of hypnotics .
