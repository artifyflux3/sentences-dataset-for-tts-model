The dispute is about " 26 . A semi-modular lattice is atomic." .

Please help to ensure that disputed statements are reliably sourced .  See the relevant discussion on the talk page .

( May 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The concept of a lattice arises in order theory , a branch of mathematics. The Hasse diagram below depicts the inclusion relationships among some important subclasses of lattices.
