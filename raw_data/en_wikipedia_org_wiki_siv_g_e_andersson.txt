E. Andersson Born Siv Gun Elisabeth Andersson 1959 (age 65–66) Education Ph.D.

Alma mater Uppsala University Scientific career Fields Evolutionary biology Institutions Uppsala University , University of Cambridge Doctoral advisor Charles Kurland Website www .icm .uu .se /molecular-evolution /andersson-siv / Siv Gun Elisabeth Andersson (born 1959) is a Swedish evolutionary biologist , professor of molecular evolution at Uppsala University .

[ 1 ] She is member of both the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and of Engineering .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] She is also Head of basic research at the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation [ 4 ] and has been co-director of the Swedish national center for large-scale research Science for Life Laboratory between 2017 and 2021.

[ 5 ] Her research focuses on the evolution of bacteria , mainly on intracellular parasites.

Education and career [ edit ] Andersson grew up in Horndal , Dalarna . Her mother was home care assistant and her father was employed in the wood industry.

[ 6 ] She studied Biology at Uppsala University , since the programme was the only one that had a course about DNA . She defended her PhD in molecular biology in 1990, under the supervision of Charles Kurland .

[ 7 ] She applied for a postdoctoral stipend from EMBO to continue her research in the United States, but ended up obtaining a research position at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge .

[ 6 ] She became professor of molecular evolution in 2000, at the Uppsala University's Evolutionary Biology Center.

[ 6 ] She was elected at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2005.

[ 2 ] Andersson has been very active in developing the Swedish national center for large-scale research Science for Life Laboratory , especially its DNA sequencing and bioinformatics platforms. She served as Co-director for the center between 2017 and 2021.

[ 5 ] During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic , she contributed, together with Lars Engstrand and with the financial support of the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation , to establish the first large-scale testing facility in Sweden [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Research [ edit ] Andersson's research first focused around the role of codon usage in shaping bacterial genomes.

[ 10 ] After her postdoctoral fellowship, she contributed to sequence one of the first genome of an obligate intracellular parasite, Rickettsia prowazekii , the causative agent of epidemic typhus.

[ 11 ] In her later career, her research continued to explore bacteria and their relationships with their different hosts.

[ 12 ] In particular, she is interested in the genomic consequences of long-term associations of intracellular bacteria.

[ 13 ] She explored the evolution of Bartonella , [ 14 ] Wolbachia , [ 15 ] and Planctomycetota , [ 16 ] among others.

Andersson has published over 200 peer-reviewed articles, and has an h-index of 61, as of 2022.

[ 17 ] Notable awards and honors [ edit ] 2000 - Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences .

[ 3 ] 2002 - Letterstedtska prize for very significant investigation, among others for "an article in Nature (1998), which reports the whole genome sequence of the intracellular parasite Rickettsia prowazekii" .

[ 18 ] 2004 - Member of EMBO .

[ 19 ] 2005 - Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , number 1514, in the class Biological Sciences.

[ 20 ] 2005 - Göran Gustafsson Prize in molecular biology.

[ 21 ] 2005 - Grant for "excellent research" from the Swedish Research Council of SEK 44 millions (together with Hans Ellegren).

[ 22 ] 2009 - President of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (2009-2011).

[ 23 ] 2011 - Wallenberg Scholar .

[ 24 ] 2017 - Extension of Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation of SEK 75 millions (together with Gunnar von Heijne ).
