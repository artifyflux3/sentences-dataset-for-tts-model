It is situated in Franklin in Auckland in New Zealand's North Island , and is administered by Auckland Council .

[ 2 ] Geography and biodiversity [ edit ] View of Kauritutahi Island from Āwhitu Regional Park Āwhitu Regional Park is located approximately 33 kilometres (21 mi) north of Waiuku , on the Āwhitu Peninsula .

[ 3 ] The regional park is a mix of grassland, exotic conifer trees and wetlands, [ 4 ] and historically before being turned into farmland was predominantly wetland and coastal pōhutukawa forest.

[ 1 ] Offshore from the park is Kauritutahi Island, [ 5 ] and the park is home to several white sand beaches.

[ 3 ] The park's wetlands are home to bird species including the banded rail (moho-pererū), spotless crake (pūweto), Australasian bittern (matuku hūrepo) and New Zealand fernbird (kōtātā). The park is home to the largest population of fernbirds in the Manukau Harbour.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The Āwhitu Regional Park area has historically been settled and utilised by Tāmaki Māori peoples, including Waiohua tribes Ngāti Te Ata Waiohua , Ngāti Tamaoho and Te Ākitai Waiohua .

[ 1 ] Ngāti Te Ata historically settled in temporary settlements on the Āwhitu Peninsula, based seasonally in different locations depending on what resources were available.

[ 1 ] English immigrants John and Sarah Brook settled on the Āwhitu Peninsula in 1875, building a homestead for their family in 1878. The Brook family ran a sheep and cattle farm on the property, until it was sold in 1971 to become a regional park.

[ 4 ] The park was officially opened for public use in 1975.

[ 3 ] In 1985, a lake was created in the park, which became home to Eleocharis sphacelata , a native sedge species.

[ 4 ] Recreation [ edit ] Āwhitu Regional Park is home to the nine-hole Āwhitu Golf Club, [ 3 ] as well as Āwhitu Environmental Camp, a camp often used by school groups.

[ 1 ] In addition, the park is used for nature walks, horse riding, kayaking, and launching boats.
