Only linear motion is possible. In contrast to a revolute joint the axis is prevented from rotating (this can be accomplished by giving the axis a prismatic shape which is not visible here).

A prismatic joint is a one- degree-of-freedom kinematic pair [ 1 ] which constrains the motion of two bodies to sliding along a common axis, without rotation ; for this reason it is often called a slider (as in the slider-crank linkage ) or a sliding pair . They are often utilized in hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders .

[ 2 ] A prismatic joint can be formed with a polygonal cross-section to resist rotation. Examples of this include the dovetail joint and linear bearings .
