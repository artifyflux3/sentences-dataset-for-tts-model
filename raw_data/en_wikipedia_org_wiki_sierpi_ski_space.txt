In mathematics , the Sierpiński space is a finite topological space with two points, only one of which is closed .

[ 1 ] It is the smallest example of a topological space which is neither trivial nor discrete . It is named after Wacław Sierpiński .

The Sierpiński space has important relations to the theory of computation and semantics , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] because it is the classifying space for open sets in the Scott topology .

Definition and fundamental properties [ edit ] Explicitly, the Sierpiński space is a topological space S whose underlying point set is { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle \{0,1\}} and whose open sets are { ∅ ∅ , { 1 } , { 0 , 1 } } .

{\displaystyle \{\varnothing ,\{1\},\{0,1\}\}.} The closed sets are { ∅ ∅ , { 0 } , { 0 , 1 } } .

{\displaystyle \{\varnothing ,\{0\},\{0,1\}\}.} So the singleton set { 0 } {\displaystyle \{0\}} is closed and the set { 1 } {\displaystyle \{1\}} is open ( ∅ ∅ = { } {\displaystyle \varnothing =\{\,\}} is the empty set ).

The closure operator on S is determined by { 0 } ¯ ¯ = { 0 } , { 1 } ¯ ¯ = { 0 , 1 } .

{\displaystyle {\overline {\{0\}}}=\{0\},\qquad {\overline {\{1\}}}=\{0,1\}.} A finite topological space is also uniquely determined by its specialization preorder . For  the Sierpiński space this preorder is actually a partial order and given by 0 ≤ ≤ 0 , 0 ≤ ≤ 1 , 1 ≤ ≤ 1.

{\displaystyle 0\leq 0,\qquad 0\leq 1,\qquad 1\leq 1.} Topological properties [ edit ] The Sierpiński space S {\displaystyle S} is a special case of both the finite particular point topology (with particular point 1) and the finite excluded point topology (with excluded point 0). Therefore, S {\displaystyle S} has many properties in common with one or both of these families.

Separation [ edit ] The points 0 and 1 are topologically distinguishable in S since { 1 } {\displaystyle \{1\}} is an open set which contains only one of these points. Therefore, S is a Kolmogorov (T 0 ) space .

However, S is not T 1 since the point 1 is not closed. It follows that S is not Hausdorff , or T n for any n ≥ ≥ 1.

{\displaystyle n\geq 1.} S is not regular (or completely regular ) since the point 1 and the disjoint closed set { 0 } {\displaystyle \{0\}} cannot be separated by neighborhoods . (Also regularity in the presence of T 0 would imply Hausdorff.) S is vacuously normal and completely normal since there are no nonempty separated sets .

S is not perfectly normal since the disjoint closed sets ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \varnothing } and { 0 } {\displaystyle \{0\}} cannot be precisely separated by a function. Indeed, { 0 } {\displaystyle \{0\}} cannot be the zero set of any continuous function S → → R {\displaystyle S\to \mathbb {R} } since every such function is constant .

Connectedness [ edit ] The Sierpiński space S is both hyperconnected (since every nonempty open set contains 1) and ultraconnected (since every nonempty closed set contains 0).

It follows that S is both connected and path connected .

A path from 0 to 1 in S is given by the function: f ( 0 ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(0)=0} and f ( t ) = 1 {\displaystyle f(t)=1} for t > 0.

{\displaystyle t>0.} The function f : I → → S {\displaystyle f:I\to S} is continuous since f − − 1 ( 1 ) = ( 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle f^{-1}(1)=(0,1]} which is open in I .

Like all finite topological spaces, S is locally path connected .

The Sierpiński space is contractible , so the fundamental group of S is trivial (as are all the higher homotopy groups ).

Compactness [ edit ] Like all finite topological spaces, the Sierpiński space is both compact and second-countable .

The compact subset { 1 } {\displaystyle \{1\}} of S is not closed showing that compact subsets of T 0 spaces need not be closed.

Every open cover of S must contain S itself since S is the only open neighborhood of 0. Therefore, every open cover of S has an open subcover consisting of a single set: { S } .

{\displaystyle \{S\}.} It follows that S is fully normal .

[ 4 ] Convergence [ edit ] Every sequence in S converges to the point 0. This is because the only neighborhood of 0 is S itself.

A sequence in S converges to 1 if and only if the sequence contains only finitely many terms equal to 0 (i.e. the sequence is eventually just 1's).

The point 1 is a cluster point of a sequence in S if and only if the sequence contains infinitely many 1's.

Examples : 1 is not a cluster point of ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , … … ) .

{\displaystyle (0,0,0,0,\ldots ).} 1 is a cluster point (but not a limit) of ( 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , … … ) .

{\displaystyle (0,1,0,1,0,1,\ldots ).} The sequence ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , … … ) {\displaystyle (1,1,1,1,\ldots )} converges to both 0 and 1.

Metrizability [ edit ] The Sierpiński space S is not metrizable or even pseudometrizable since every pseudometric space is completely regular but the Sierpiński space is not even regular .

S is generated by the hemimetric (or pseudo - quasimetric ) d ( 0 , 1 ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(0,1)=0} and d ( 1 , 0 ) = 1.

{\displaystyle d(1,0)=1.} Other properties [ edit ] There are only three continuous maps from S to itself: the identity map and the constant maps to 0 and 1.

It follows that the homeomorphism group of S is trivial .

Continuous functions to the Sierpiński space [ edit ] Let X be an arbitrary set. The set of all functions from X to the set { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle \{0,1\}} is typically denoted 2 X .

{\displaystyle 2^{X}.} These functions are precisely the characteristic functions of X . Each such function is of the form χ χ U ( x ) = { 1 x ∈ ∈ U 0 x ∉ U {\displaystyle \chi _{U}(x)={\begin{cases}1&x\in U\\0&x\not \in U\end{cases}}} where U is a subset of X . In other words, the set of functions 2 X {\displaystyle 2^{X}} is in bijective correspondence with P ( X ) , {\displaystyle P(X),} the power set of X . Every subset U of X has its characteristic function χ χ U {\displaystyle \chi _{U}} and every function from X to { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle \{0,1\}} is of this form.

Now suppose X is a topological space and let { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle \{0,1\}} have the Sierpiński topology. Then a function χ χ U : X → → S {\displaystyle \chi _{U}:X\to S} is continuous if and only if χ χ U − − 1 ( 1 ) {\displaystyle \chi _{U}^{-1}(1)} is open in X . But, by definition χ χ U − − 1 ( 1 ) = U .

{\displaystyle \chi _{U}^{-1}(1)=U.} So χ χ U {\displaystyle \chi _{U}} is continuous if and only if U is open in X . Let C ( X , S ) {\displaystyle C(X,S)} denote the set of all continuous maps from X to S and let T ( X ) {\displaystyle T(X)} denote the topology of X (that is, the family of all open sets). Then we have a bijection from T ( X ) {\displaystyle T(X)} to C ( X , S ) {\displaystyle C(X,S)} which sends the open set U {\displaystyle U} to χ χ U .

{\displaystyle \chi _{U}.} C ( X , S ) ≅ ≅ T ( X ) {\displaystyle C(X,S)\cong T(X)} That is, if we identify 2 X {\displaystyle 2^{X}} with P ( X ) {\displaystyle P(X)} the subset of continuous maps C ( X , S ) ⊆ ⊆ 2 X {\displaystyle C(X,S)\subseteq 2^{X}} is precisely the topology of X : {\displaystyle X:} T ( X ) ⊆ ⊆ P ( X ) .

{\displaystyle T(X)\subseteq P(X).} A particularly notable example of this is the Scott topology for partially ordered sets , in which the Sierpiński space becomes the classifying space for open sets when the characteristic function preserves directed joins .

[ 5 ] Categorical description [ edit ] The above construction can be described nicely using the language of category theory . There is a contravariant functor T : T o p → → S e t {\displaystyle T:\mathbf {Top} \to \mathbf {Set} } from the category of topological spaces to the category of sets which assigns each topological space X {\displaystyle X} its set of open sets T ( X ) {\displaystyle T(X)} and each continuous function f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} the preimage map f − − 1 : T ( Y ) → → T ( X ) .

{\displaystyle f^{-1}:T(Y)\to T(X).} The statement then becomes: the functor T {\displaystyle T} is represented by ( S , { 1 } ) {\displaystyle (S,\{1\})} where S {\displaystyle S} is the Sierpiński space. That is, T {\displaystyle T} is naturally isomorphic to the Hom functor Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( − − , S ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (-,S)} with the natural isomorphism determined by the universal element { 1 } ∈ ∈ T ( S ) .

{\displaystyle \{1\}\in T(S).} This is generalized by the notion of a presheaf .

[ 6 ] The initial topology [ edit ] Any topological space X has the initial topology induced by the family C ( X , S ) {\displaystyle C(X,S)} of continuous functions to Sierpiński space. Indeed, in order to coarsen the topology on X one must remove open sets. But removing the open set U would render χ χ U {\displaystyle \chi _{U}} discontinuous. So X has the coarsest topology for which each function in C ( X , S ) {\displaystyle C(X,S)} is continuous.

The family of functions C ( X , S ) {\displaystyle C(X,S)} separates points in X if and only if X is a T 0 space . Two points x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} will be separated by the function χ χ U {\displaystyle \chi _{U}} if and only if the open set U contains precisely one of the two points. This is exactly what it means for x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} to be topologically distinguishable .

Therefore, if X is T 0 , we can embed X as a subspace of a product of Sierpiński spaces, where there is one copy of S for each open set U in X . The embedding map e : X → → ∏ ∏ U ∈ ∈ T ( X ) S = S T ( X ) {\displaystyle e:X\to \prod _{U\in T(X)}S=S^{T(X)}} is given by e ( x ) U = χ χ U ( x ) .

{\displaystyle e(x)_{U}=\chi _{U}(x).\,} Since subspaces and products of T 0 spaces are T 0 , it follows that a topological space is T 0 if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of a power of S .

In algebraic geometry [ edit ] In algebraic geometry the Sierpiński space arises as the spectrum Spec ⁡ ⁡ ( R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} (R)} of a discrete valuation ring R {\displaystyle R} such as Z ( p ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{(p)}} (the localization of the integers at the prime ideal generated by the prime number p {\displaystyle p} ). The generic point of Spec ⁡ ⁡ ( R ) , {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} (R),} coming from the zero ideal , corresponds to the open point 1, while the special point of Spec ⁡ ⁡ ( R ) , {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} (R),} coming from the unique maximal ideal , corresponds to the closed point 0.
