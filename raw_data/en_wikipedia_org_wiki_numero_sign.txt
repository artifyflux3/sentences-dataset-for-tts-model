The **numero sign** or **numero symbol**, **№** (also represented as **Nº**, **No̱**, **No.**, or **no.**),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-Concise-2) is a [typographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography") abbreviation of the word _number_(_s_) indicating [ordinal numeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_numeral "Ordinal numeral"), especially in names and titles. For example, using the numero sign, the written long-form of the address "Number 29 Acacia Road" is shortened to "№ 29 Acacia Rd", yet both forms are spoken long.

Typographically, the numero sign combines as a single [ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_ligature "Orthographic ligature") the uppercase Latin letter ⟨N⟩ with a usually superscript lowercase [letter ⟨o⟩](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O "O"), sometimes underlined, resembling the masculine [ordinal indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator "Ordinal indicator")⟨º⟩. The ligature has a [code point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point") in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") as a [precomposed character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomposed_character "Precomposed character"), U+2116№NUMERO SIGN.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-3)

The _[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_English\_Dictionary "Oxford English Dictionary")_ derives the numero sign from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin")_numero_, the [ablative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablative_case "Ablative case") form of _numerus_ ("number", with the ablative denotations of "by the number, with the number"). In [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages"), the numero sign is understood as an abbreviation of the word for "number", e.g. Italian _numero_, French _numéro_, and Portuguese and Spanish _número_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-4)

This article describes other typographical abbreviations for "number" in different languages, in addition to the numero sign proper.

The numero sign's non-ligature substitution by the two separate letters ⟨N⟩ and ⟨o⟩ is common. A capital or lower-case "n" may be used, followed by "o.", superscript "o", ordinal indicator, or the degree sign; this will be understood in most languages.

[Bulgarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language "Bulgarian language") keyboard layout (BDS 5237:1978)

In Bulgarian the numero sign is often used and it is present in three widely used keyboard layouts accessible with Shift-0 in BDS and prBDS and with Shift-3 on the Phonetic layout.

In many forms of English, the non-ligature form No. is typical and is often used to abbreviate the word "number".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-Concise-2) In North America, the [number sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign "Number sign"), #, is more prevalent. The ligature form does not appear on [British or American QWERTY keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_and_American_keyboards "British and American keyboards").

The numero symbol is not in common use in France and does not appear on a standard [AZERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZERTY "AZERTY") keyboard. Instead, the French [Imprimerie nationale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprimerie_nationale "Imprimerie nationale") recommends the use of the form "n o" (an "n" followed by a [superscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscript "Superscript") lowercase "o"). The plural form "n os" can also be used.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-imp_nat-5) In practice, the "o" is often replaced by the [degree symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol "Degree symbol") (°), which is visually similar to the superscript "o" and is easily accessible on an AZERTY keyboard.

### Indonesian and Malaysian

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Numero_sign&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Indonesian and Malaysian")]

"Nomor" in Indonesian and "nombor" in Malaysian; therefore "No." is commonly used as an abbreviation with standard spelling and full stop.

The sign is usually replaced with the abbreviations "n." or "nº", the latter using a [masculine ordinal indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculine_ordinal_indicator "Masculine ordinal indicator"), rather than a superscript "O".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-6)

### Philippine languages

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Numero_sign&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Philippine languages")]

Because of more than three centuries of [Spanish colonisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines_(1521%E2%80%931898) "History of the Philippines (1521–1898)"), the word _número_ is found in almost all Philippine languages. "No." is its common notation in local languages as well as English.

In Portugal, the similar-looking notation n.º is often used.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-7) In Brazil, where Portuguese is the official language, nº is often used on official documents.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-8) In both cases, the symbol used (º) is the [masculine ordinal indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculine_ordinal_indicator "Masculine ordinal indicator"). However, the [Brazilian National Standards Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_National_Standards_Organization "Brazilian National Standards Organization") (ABNT) determines that the word "número" should be abbreviated "n." only.

Russian [keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout "Keyboard layout") for [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows"). The № sign can be seen on the 3 key.

Although the letter ⟨[N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N "N")⟩ is not in the [Cyrillic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_alphabet "Russian alphabet"), the numero sign № is typeset in Russian publishing, and is available on [Russian computer and typewriter keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_alphabet#Keyboard_layout "Russian alphabet").

The numero sign is very widely used in Russia and other [post-Soviet states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states "Post-Soviet states") in many official and casual contexts. Examples include usage for law and other official documents numbering, names of institutions (hospitals, kindergartens, schools, libraries, organization departments and so on), numbering of periodical publications (such as newspapers and magazines), numbering of public transport routes, etc.

"№ п/п" (_номер по порядку_, "sequential number") is universally used as a table header to denote a column containing the table row number.

The № sign is sometimes used in Russian [medical prescriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription "Medical prescription") (which according to the law must be written in [Latin language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language")[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-9)) as an abbreviation for the Latin word _numero_ to indicate the number of prescribed dosages (for example, tablets or capsules), and on the price tags in drugstores and pharmacy websites to indicate number of [unit doses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_dose "Unit dose") in drug packages, although the standard abbreviation for use in prescriptions is the Latin N.

The numero sign is not typically used in Iberian Spanish, and it is not present on standard keyboard layouts. According to the [Real Academia Española](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Academia_Espa%C3%B1ola "Real Academia Española")[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-10) and the [Fundéu BBVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fund%C3%A9u_BBVA "Fundéu BBVA"),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign#cite_note-11) the word _número_ (number) is abbreviated per the Spanish typographic convention of [_letras voladas_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_letter#Use_in_Spanish "Superior letter") ("flying letters"). The first letter(s) of the word to be abbreviated are followed by a period; then, the final letter(s) of the word are written as lowercase superscripts. This gives the abbreviations n.o (singular) and n.os (plural). The abbreviation "no." is not used (it might be mistaken for the Spanish negative word _no_). The abbreviations nro. and núm. are also acceptable. The numero sign, either as a one-character symbol № or composed of the letter N plus superscript "o" (sometimes underlined or substituted by the [ordinal indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator "Ordinal indicator"), º), is common in Latin America, where the interpolated period is sometimes not used in abbreviations.

In some languages, _Nr._, _nr._, _nr_ or _NR_ is used instead, reflecting the abbreviation of the language's word for "number". In German, which capitalises all nouns and abbreviations of nouns, the word _\_Nummer\__ is abbreviated as _Nr._ Lithuanian uses this spelling as well, and it is usually capitalised in [bureaucratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy "Bureaucracy") contexts, especially with the meaning "reference number" (such as _\_sutarties Nr.\__, "contract No.") but in other contexts it follows the usual sentence capitalisation (such as _tel. nr._, abbreviation for _\_telefono numeris\__, "telephone number"). It is commonly lowercase in other languages, such as Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Estonian and Swedish. Some languages, such as Polish, omit the dot in [abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation "Abbreviation") if the abbreviation ends with the last letter of the original word.

The sign is encoded in Unicode as U+2116№NUMERO SIGN and many platforms and languages have methods to enter it. See [Unicode input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_input "Unicode input") and the relevant keyboard articles for further details.
