[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Biography [ edit ] Botstein was born in Zürich , Switzerland , in 1946.

[ 5 ] The son of Polish-Jewish physicians who escaped Nazi persecution, Botstein immigrated to New York City at the age of two.

[ 6 ] He studied violin with Roman Totenberg and, during the summers, studied with faculty from the National Conservatory in Mexico City .

[ 5 ] In 1963, at age 16, Botstein graduated from the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan . He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1967 with a bachelor's degree in history. While an undergraduate, he was concertmaster and assistant conductor of the university orchestra and founded its chamber orchestra.

[ 7 ] His music teachers in college included composer Richard Wernick and the musicologists H. Colin Slim and Howard Mayer Brown . In 1967, after studying at Tanglewood , Botstein attended Harvard University , where he studied history under David Landes , writing on musical life of Vienna in the 19th and early 20th centuries, earning an MA in 1968. At Harvard, he was the assistant conductor of the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra and conductor of the Doctors' Orchestra of Boston.

[ 8 ] In 1969, while a graduate student, Botstein was awarded a Sloan Foundation Fellowship and began work for New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay ’s administration as special assistant to the president of the Board of Education of the City of New York.

[ 7 ] [ 9 ] In 1970, at age 23, Botstein became the youngest college president in history after being appointed president of the now-defunct Franconia College in New Hampshire. He was offered the position after meeting his future father-in-law, Oliver Lundquist , who was on the board of trustees.

[ 4 ] President of Bard College [ edit ] In 1975, Botstein left Franconia to become the president of Bard College , a position he still holds.

[ 8 ] He oversaw significant curricular changes, [ 10 ] [ 4 ] and, under his leadership, Bard saw record gains in enrollment, campus growth, endowment, institutional reach, and high-profile faculty.

[ 4 ] [ 10 ] [ 7 ] Botstein directed the launch of the Levy Economics Institute , a public-policy research center, as well as graduate programs in the fine arts, decorative arts, environmental policy, and curatorial studies ; soon thereafter, he helped acquire Bard College at Simon's Rock and later founded Bard High School Early College , which operates in seven cities: Newark , New York City , Cleveland , Washington D.C.

, Baltimore , New Orleans , and Hudson .

[ 7 ] [ 4 ] In the wake of the death of his second child, an 8-year-old daughter, Botstein decided to return to the musical career he had begun at University of Chicago .

[ 8 ] In 1985, he completed his Ph.D. in music history at Harvard [ 11 ] and began retraining as a conductor with Harold Farberman , eventually leading the Hudson Valley Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra.

[ 8 ] [ 4 ] 1990–present: Festivals, international programs, and conducting [ edit ] Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts In 1990, Botstein established the Bard Music Festival , whose success led to the development of the critically acclaimed [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts , a multi-functional facility designed by Frank Gehry on the Bard campus. In 1992, in addition to being named editor of The Musical Quarterly , he was appointed director of the American Symphony Orchestra , a position he still holds.

[ 14 ] Under Botstein's directorship, the orchestra has developed a reputation for rescuing lesser-known works from obscurity.

[ 15 ] In 1999, he helped establish Bard’s acclaimed Prison Initiative , which established college-in-prison programs across the country and is now active in nine states.

[ 15 ] In 2003, following the success of the Bard Music Festival , Botstein developed Bard SummerScape , a festival of opera, theater, film, and music, where, since its founding, he has revived 13 rare operas in full staging.

[ 16 ] Later that year, Botstein became the music director of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra .

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] His concerts with the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra were broadcast in regular series across the U.S. and Europe, and he led the orchestra on several tours, including twice across the U.S. and to Leipzig to open the 2009 Bach Festival with a performance of Felix Mendelssohn ’s Elijah in Bach ’s Thomaskirche . In 2011, he stepped down from that post and became the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra 's Conductor Laureate and, as of 2022, also serves as its Principal Guest Conductor.

[ 18 ] In addition to his work with the ASO and JSO, Botstein has performed or recorded with, among many others, the London Philharmonic Orchestra , New York City Opera , Los Angeles Philharmonic , BBC Symphony Orchestra , London Symphony Orchestra , Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra , St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra , Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra , and NDR Symphony Orchestra . In 2005, his recording of Gavriil Popov ’s First Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra was nominated for a Grammy Award.

Throughout this period, in collaboration with institutions abroad, Botstein helped launch liberal arts programs to countries in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, South Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East. He established programs with Al Quds University , [ 20 ] American University of Central Asia , [ 21 ] and Central European University , [ 22 ] as well as helping found Bard College Berlin [ 23 ] and Smolny College , Russia's first and foremost liberal arts institution.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] Botstein also turned his attention to developing Bard's music program. In 2005, he oversaw the development of The Bard College Conservatory of Music and later became director of The Bard Conservatory Orchestra.

[ 15 ] During this period, he also helped Bard acquire the Longy School of Music , and led The Bard Conservatory Orchestra on tours of China, Eastern Europe, and Cuba. In addition to conducting for the Youth Orchestra of Caracas in Venezuela and on tour in Japan, Botstein also helped develop Take a Stand, a national music program in the U.S. based on principles of El Sistema.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] In 2015, he founded The Orchestra Now, [ 28 ] a pre-professional orchestra and master’s degree program at Bard College ; in addition to performing multiple concerts each season at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center , The Orchestra Now performs a regular concert series at Bard's Fisher Center and takes part in Bard Music Festival concerts.

[ 28 ] In 2016, Botstein received $150,000 as a donation to Bard College from the foundation Gratitude America, which was founded by financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , according to articles in The New York Times [ 29 ] and The Wall Street Journal . At the time, Botstein was on the charity's advisory board.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] In 2018, Botstein was appointed artistic director of Campus Grafenegg in Austria, where he collaborated with Thomas Hampson and Dennis Russell Davies . On January 23, 2020, he was named chancellor of the Open Society University Network, of which Bard College and Central European University are founding members.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] In 2019, Botstein appeared in the documentary College Behind Bars , a four-part television series about the Bard Prison Initiative , a degree program offered to inmates in New York prisons. The series was produced by his daughter, Sarah Botstein , who works for Ken Burns 's documentary production company.

[ 34 ] Musicianship [ edit ] Botstein is renowned [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] for reviving and promoting neglected repertoire and composers.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] In addition, as director of the American Symphony Orchestra and the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra , he emerged as a significant proponent of "thematic programming", which assembles concert programs around common themes grounded in literature, music history, or art.

[ 41 ] He is also known for the series "Classics Declassified", in which he lectures, conducts, and takes questions from the audience.

[ 42 ] Both the Bard Music Festival and Bard SummerScape continue his method of reviving neglected works and synthesizing performance and scholarship. The Wall Street Journal 's Barrymore Laurence Scherer wrote, "the Bard Music Festival…no longer needs an introduction. Under the provocative guidance of the conductor-scholar Leon Botstein, it has long been one of the most intellectually stimulating of all American summer festivals and frequently is one of the most musically satisfying. Each year, through discussions by major scholars and illustrative concerts often programmed to overflowing, Bard audiences have investigated the oeuvre of a major composer in the context of the society, politics, literature, art and music of his times." [ 36 ] Scholarship and writings [ edit ] Botstein's scholarship focuses on the intersection of music, culture, and politics since the early 19th century.

[ 8 ] [ 7 ] He has written books including Judentum und Modernitaet and Von Beethoven zu Berg: Das Gedächtnis der Moderne (2013) and The History of Listening: How Music Creates Meaning (2000).

In addition, he is coeditor of Vienna: Jews and the City of Music, 1870-1938, published in 2004, and editor of The Complete Brahms: A Guide to the Musical Works of Johannes (1999).

Botstein's essays for The Bard Music Festival are published as a series in the Princeton University Press .

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] He has been editor of The Musical Quarterly since 1993 and a frequent contributor to periodicals focusing on music and history.

[ 44 ] Botstein also writes frequently on primary and secondary education and universities: in addition to the book Jefferson's Children: Education and the Promise of American Culture (1997), he is the author of numerous articles on education in the United States .

[ 45 ] Personal life [ edit ] Botstein is the brother of biologist David Botstein and pediatric cardiologist Eva Griepp. Both of his parents were physicians who, after emigrating to the U.S., served on faculty of the Einstein College of Medicine in New York.

He is the husband of art historian Barbara Haskell . They have two children: Clara Haskell Botstein, director of legislation and governmental relations at the D.C. office of the deputy mayor for education, [ 46 ] and Max Botstein.

[ 47 ] [ 4 ] Botstein and his first wife, Jill Lundquist, are the parents of Sarah Botstein , who produced the documentary College Behind Bars , and Abby Botstein (1973-1981).

He waxes nostalgic for the days of "exceptional Jewry," arguing that "Jews have entered the indistinguishable middle class…. We are no longer the people of the book; we are a people of ordinary vulgarity.
