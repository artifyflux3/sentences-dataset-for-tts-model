[ 1 ] Typical examples of viscous damping in mechanical systems include: Fluid films between surfaces Fluid flow around a piston in a cylinder Fluid flow through an orifice Fluid flow within a journal bearing Viscous damping also refers to damping devices. Most often they damp motion by providing a force or torque opposing motion proportional to the velocity. This may be affected by fluid flow or motion of magnetic structures. The intended effect is to bring the damping ratio closer to 1.

Practical examples include: Shock absorbers in cars Seismic retrofitting with viscous dampers [ 2 ] Deployment actuators in spacecraft Single-degree-of-freedom system [ edit ] In a single- degree-of-freedom system, viscous damping models the relatitionship between force and velocity as shown below: f = c x ˙ ˙ {\displaystyle f=c{\dot {x}}} Where c {\displaystyle c} is the viscous damping coefficient with SI units of N ⋅ ⋅ s / m {\displaystyle N\cdot s/m} . This model adequately describes the damping force on a body that is moving at a moderate speed through a fluid.

[ 3 ] It is also the most common modeling choice for damping.
