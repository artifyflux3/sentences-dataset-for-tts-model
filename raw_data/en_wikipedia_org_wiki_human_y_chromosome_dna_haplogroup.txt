Part of a series on Genetic genealogy Concepts Population genetics Haplogroup / Haplotype / Subclade Most recent common ancestor DNA haplogroups ( Human mitochondrial , Human Y-chromosome ) Genomics Related topics Y-chromosome haplogroups by population Genealogical DNA test Surname DNA project Personal genomics Genographic Project ISOGG v t e In human genetics , a human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup is a haplogroup defined by specific mutations in the non- recombining portions of DNA on the male-specific Y chromosome (Y-DNA). Individuals within a haplogroup share similar numbers of short tandem repeats (STRs) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

[ 2 ] The Y-chromosome accumulates approximately two mutations per generation, [ 3 ] and Y-DNA haplogroups represent significant branches of the Y-chromosome phylogenetic tree , each characterized by hundreds or even thousands of unique mutations.

The Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor (Y-MRCA), often referred to as Y-chromosomal Adam , is the most recent common ancestor from whom all currently living humans are descended patrilineally . Y-chromosomal Adam is estimated to have lived around 236,000 years ago in Africa [ citation needed ] . By examining other population bottlenecks , most Eurasian men trace their descent from a man who lived in Africa approximately 69,000 years ago ( Haplogroup CT ). Although Southeast Asia has been proposed as the origin for all non-African human Y chromosomes, [ 4 ] this hypothesis is considered unlikely.

[ 5 ] Other bottlenecks occurred roughly 50,000 and 5,000 years ago, and the majority of Eurasian men are believed to be descended from four ancestors who lived 50,000 years ago, all of whom were descendants of an African lineage (Haplogroup E-M168).

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Naming convention [ edit ] Schematic illustration of Y-DNA haplogroups naming convention. Haplogroups are defined through mutations (SNPs).

Y-DNA haplogroups are defined by the presence of a series of Y-DNA single-nucleotide polymorphisms genetic markers .

Subclades are defined by a terminal SNP , the SNP furthest down in the Y-chromosome phylogenetic tree.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] The Y Chromosome Consortium (YCC) developed a system of naming major Y-DNA haplogroups with the capital letters A through T, with further subclades named using numbers and lower case letters (YCC longhand nomenclature ). YCC shorthand nomenclature names Y-DNA haplogroups and their subclades with the first letter of the major Y-DNA haplogroup followed by a dash and the name of the defining terminal SNP.

[ 11 ] Y-DNA haplogroup nomenclature is changing over time to accommodate the increasing number of SNPs being discovered and tested, and the resulting expansion of the Y-chromosome phylogenetic tree. This change in nomenclature has resulted in inconsistent nomenclature being used in different sources.

[ 2 ] This inconsistency, and increasingly cumbersome longhand nomenclature, has prompted a move toward using the simpler shorthand nomenclature.

It is sparsely distributed in Africa, being concentrated among Khoisan populations in the southwest and Nilotic populations toward the northeast in the Nile Valley . BT is a subclade of haplogroup A, more precisely of the A1b clade (A2-T in Cruciani et al. 2011), as follows: Haplogroup A Haplogroup A00 Haplogroup A0 (formerly also A1b) Haplogroup A1 (also A1a-T) Haplogroup A1a (M31) Haplogroup A1b (also A2-T; P108, V221) Haplogroup A1b1a1 (also A2; M14) Haplogroup A1b1b (also A3; M32) Haplogroup BT (M91, M42, M94, M139, M299) Haplogroup B (M60) Haplogroup CT Haplogroup CT (P143) [ edit ] Main article: Haplogroup CT (Y-DNA) The defining mutations separating CT (all haplogroups except for A and B) are M168 and M294. The site of origin is likely in Africa. Its age has been estimated at approximately 88,000 years old, [ 14 ] [ 15 ] and more recently at around 100,000 [ 16 ] or 101,000 years old.

F1 (P91), F2 (M427) and F3 (M481; previously F5) are all highly rare and virtually exclusive to regions/ethnic minorities in Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, South China , Thailand , Burma , and Vietnam . In such cases, however, the possibility of misidentification is considered to be relatively high and some may belong to misidentified subclades of Haplogroup GHIJK .

[ 20 ] Haplogroup G (M201) [ edit ] Main article: Haplogroup G (Y-DNA) Haplogroup G (M201) originated some 48,000 years ago and its most recent common ancestor likely lived 26,000 years ago in the Middle East. It spread to Europe with the Neolithic Revolution .

( September 2016 ) Haplogroup N [ edit ] Main article: Haplogroup N (Y-DNA) Haplogroup N (M231) is found in northern Eurasia, especially among speakers of the Uralic languages .

Haplogroup N possibly originated in eastern Asia and spread both northward and westward into Siberia , being the most common group found in some Uralic-speaking peoples .

Haplogroup O [ edit ] Main article: Haplogroup O (Y-DNA) Haplogroup O (M175) is found with its highest frequency in East Asia and Southeast Asia , with lower frequencies in the South Pacific , Central Asia , South Asia , and islands in the Indian Ocean ( e.g.

Madagascar, the Comoros).

Haplogroup O1 (F265/M1354, CTS2866, F75/M1297, F429/M1415, F465/M1422) Haplogroup O1a (M119, CTS31, F589/Page20, L246, L466) Found in eastern, central, and southern Mainland China , Taiwan , and Southeast Asia , especially among Austronesian and Tai–Kadai peoples Haplogroup O1b (P31, M268) Haplogroup O1b1 (M95) Found in Japan , China, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent , especially among Austroasiatic - and Tai–Kadai -speaking peoples, Malays , and Indonesians Haplogroup O1b2 (SRY465, M176) Found in Japan, Korea , Manchuria , and Southeast Asia Haplogroup O2 (M122) Found throughout East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Austronesia including Polynesia Haplogroups K2b1, M & S [ edit ] Main article: Haplogroup K2b1 (Y-DNA) No examples of the basal paragroup K2b1* have been identified. Males carrying subclades of K2b1 are found primarily among Papuan peoples , Micronesian peoples , indigenous Australians , and Polynesians .

Its primary subclades are two major haplogroups: Haplogroup S (B254) also known as K2b1a: found in the highlands of Papua New Guinea and; Haplogroup M (P256) also known as K2b1b: found in New Guinea and Melanesia.

( September 2016 ) Haplogroup P (K2b2) [ edit ] Main article: Haplogroup P (Y-DNA) Haplogroup P (P295) has two primary branches: P1 (P-M45) and the extremely rare P2 (P-B253).

[ 24 ] P*, P1* and P2 are found together only on the island of Luzon in the Philippines .

[ 24 ] In particular, P* and P1* are found at significant rates among members of the Aeta (or Agta) people of Luzon.

[ 25 ] While, P1* is now more common among living individuals in Eastern Siberia and Central Asia , it is also found at low levels in mainland South East Asia and South Asia . Considered together, these distributions tend to suggest that P* emerged from K2b in South East Asia.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] P1 is also the parent node of two primary clades: Haplogroup Q (Q-M242) and; Haplogroup R (R-M207). These share the common marker M45 in addition to at least 18 other SNPs.

Haplogroup Q (MEH2, M242, P36) found in Siberia and the Americas Haplogroup R (M207, M306): found in Europe , West Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia Haplogroup Q M242 [ edit ] Main article: Haplogroup Q (Y-DNA) Q is defined by the SNP M242. It is believed to have arisen in Central Asia approximately 32,000 years ago.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] The subclades of Haplogroup Q with their defining mutation(s), according to the 2008 ISOGG tree [ 29 ] are provided below. ss4 bp, rs41352448, is not represented in the ISOGG 2008 tree because it is a value for an STR.

Haplogroup R is defined by the SNP M207. The bulk of Haplogroup R is represented in the descendant subclade R1 (M173), which originated in Siberia . R1 has two descendant subclades: R1a and R1b .

R1a is associated with the proto-Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic peoples, and is now found predominantly in Central Asia , South Asia , and Eastern Europe .

Haplogroup R1b is the dominant haplogroup of Western Europe and is also found sparsely distributed among various peoples of Asia and Africa . Its subclade R1b1a2 (M269) is the haplogroup that is most commonly found among modern Western European populations, and has been associated with the Italo-Celtic and Germanic peoples.

Haplogroup R1 (M173) Found throughout western Eurasia Haplogroup R1a (M420) Found in Central Asia, South Asia, and Central, Northern and Eastern Europe, Balkans Haplogroup R1b (M343) Found in Western Europe, West Asia , Central Asia , North Africa , and northern Cameroon Haplogroup R2 (M124) Found in South Asia, Caucasus, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe Chronological development of haplogroups [ edit ] Haplogroup Possible time of origin Possible place of origin Possible TMRCA [ 36 ] [ 15 ] A00 235,900 [ 7 ] or 275,000 years ago [ 37 ] Africa [ 38 ] 235,900 years ago BT 130,700 years ago [ 7 ] Africa 88,000 years ago CT 88,000 [ 7 ] or 101-100,000 years ago [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Africa 68,500 years ago E 65,200, [ 7 ] 69,000, [ 39 ] or 73,000 years ago [ 40 ] East Africa [ 41 ] or Asia [ 18 ] 53,100 years ago F 65,900 years ago [ 7 ] Eurasia 48,800 years ago G 48,500 years ago [ 7 ] West Asia 26,200 years ago IJ 47,200 years ago [ 7 ] West Asia 42,900 years ago K 47,200 years ago [ 7 ] Asia 45,400 years ago P 45,400 years ago [ 7 ] Asia 31,900 years ago J 42,900 years ago [ 7 ] [ 42 ] West Asia 31,600 years ago I 42,900 years ago [ 7 ] Europe 27,500 years ago E-M215 (E1b1b) 42,300 years ago [ 7 ] [ 43 ] East Africa 34,800 years ago E-V38 (E1b1a) 42,300 years ago [ 7 ] [ 43 ] East Africa 40,100 years ago N 36,800 years ago [ 7 ] [ 44 ] Asia 22,100 years ago E1b1b-M35 34,800 years ago [ 7 ] [ 43 ] East Africa 24,100 years ago R 31,900 years ago [ 7 ] Asia 28,200 years ago J-M267 (J1) 31,600 years ago [ 7 ] [ 42 ] West Asia 18,500 years ago J-M172 (J2) 31,600 years ago [ 7 ] [ 42 ] West Asia 27,800 years ago [ 7 ] [ 45 ] R-M173 (R1) 28,200 years ago [ 7 ] Asia 22,800 years ago I-M253 (I1) 27,500 years ago [ 7 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Europe 4,600 years ago I-M438 (I2) 27,500 years ago [ 7 ] [ 47 ] Europe 21,800 years ago R-M420 (R1a) 22,800 years ago [ 7 ] [ 48 ] Eurasia 18,300 years ago R-M343 (R1b) 22,800 years ago [ 7 ] [ 49 ] Eurasia [ 50 ] 20,400 years ago I2-L460 (I2a) 21,800 years ago [ 7 ] [ 51 ] Europe 21,100 years ago I2a-P37 21,100 years ago [ 7 ] [ 46 ] [ 52 ] Europe 18,500 years ago E1b1b-M78 19,800 years ago [ 7 ] [ 43 ] [ 53 ] Northeast Africa [ 53 ] 13,400 years ago [ 7 ] [ 53 ] I2a-M423 18,500 years ago [ 7 ] [ 52 ] Europe 13,500 years ago I2a-M223 17,400 years ago [ 7 ] Europe 12,100 years ago N1c-M178 14,200 years ago [ 7 ] [ 44 ] Asia 11,900 years ago R1a-M17 14,100 years ago [ 7 ] [ 48 ] [ 54 ] Eastern Europe 8,500 years ago R1b-M269 13,300 years ago [ 7 ] Eastern Europe 6,400 years ago [ 55 ] E1b1b-V12 11,800 years ago [ 7 ] [ 53 ] North Africa 9,900 years ago E-U175 (E1b1a8) 9,200 years ago [ 7 ] [ 43 ] East Africa 8,500 years ago E1b1b-V13 8,100 years ago [ 7 ] [ 53 ] Southern Europe 4,800 years ago E-M191 (E1b1a7) 7,400 years ago [ 7 ] [ 43 ] East Africa 6,400 years ago E-U174 (E1b1a-U174) 6,400 years ago [ 7 ] [ 43 ] East Africa 5,300 years ago R1b-L151 5,800 years ago [ 7 ] Eastern Europe 4,800 years ago R1a-Z280 5,000 years ago [ 7 ] Eastern Europe 4,600 years ago [ 56 ] R1a-M458 4,700 years ago [ 7 ] Eastern Europe 4,700 years ago [ 56 ] See also [ edit ] List of Y-chromosome haplogroups in populations of the world Y-DNA haplogroups in populations of Europe Genetic history of Europe List of Y-DNA single-nucleotide polymorphisms List of Y-STR markers Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup * (haplogroup) Molecular phylogeny Genetic genealogy Genealogical DNA test Conversion table for Y chromosome haplogroups v t e Phylogenetic tree of human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups [ χ 1 ] [ χ 2 ] This article needs to be updated .

"we date the Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) in Africa at 254 (95% CI 192–307) kya and detect a cluster of major non-African founder haplogroups in a narrow time interval at 47–52 kya, consistent with a rapid initial colonization model of Eurasia and Oceania after the out-of-Africa bottleneck. In contrast to demographic reconstructions based on mtDNA, we infer a second strong bottleneck in Y-chromosome lineages dating to the last 10 ky. We hypothesize that this bottleneck is caused by cultural changes affecting variance of reproductive success among males." ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah ai aj ak al am an ao ap "YFull YTree" .

Around 7000 years ago - all the way back in the Neolithic - something really peculiar happened to human genetic diversity. Over the next 2,000 years, and seen across Africa, Europe and Asia, the genetic diversity of the Y chromosome collapsed, becoming as though there was only one man for every 17 women.
