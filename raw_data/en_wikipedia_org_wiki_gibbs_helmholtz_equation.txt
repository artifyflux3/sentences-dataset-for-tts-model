It was originally presented in an 1882 paper entitled " Die Thermodynamik chemischer Vorgänge " by Hermann von Helmholtz . It describes how the Gibbs free energy, which was presented originally by Josiah Willard Gibbs , varies with temperature.

[ 1 ] It was derived by Helmholtz first, and Gibbs derived it only 6 years later.

[ 2 ] The attribution to Gibbs goes back to Wilhelm Ostwald , who first translated Gibbs' monograph into German and promoted it in Europe.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The equation is: [ 5 ] ( ∂ ∂ ( G T ) ∂ ∂ T ) p = − − H T 2 , {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \left({\frac {G}{T}}\right)}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}=-{\frac {H}{T^{2}}},} where H is the enthalpy , T the absolute temperature and G the Gibbs free energy of the system, all at constant pressure p . The equation states that the change in the G/T ratio at constant pressure as a result of an infinitesimally small change in temperature is a factor H/T 2 .

Similar equations include [ 6 ] U = − − T 2 ( ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ T F T ) V {\textstyle U=-T^{2}\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial T}}{\frac {F}{T}}\right)_{V}} F = − − S 2 ( ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ S U S ) V {\textstyle F=-S^{2}\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial S}}{\frac {U}{S}}\right)_{V}} U = − − P 2 ( ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ P H P ) S {\displaystyle U=-P^{2}\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial P}}{\frac {H}{P}}\right)_{S}} U {\displaystyle U} ↔ ↔ U − − F = T S {\displaystyle \leftrightarrow U-F=TS} F {\displaystyle F} F = − − P 2 ( ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ P G P ) T {\textstyle F=-P^{2}\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial P}}{\frac {G}{P}}\right)_{T}} ↕ ↕ U − − H = − − P V {\displaystyle \updownarrow U-H=-PV} ↕ ↕ G − − F = P V {\displaystyle \updownarrow G-F=PV} H = − − V 2 ( ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ V U V ) S {\textstyle H=-V^{2}\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial V}}{\frac {U}{V}}\right)_{S}} H {\displaystyle H} ↔ ↔ G − − H = − − T S {\displaystyle \leftrightarrow G-H=-TS} G {\displaystyle G} G = − − V 2 ( ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ V F V ) T {\textstyle G=-V^{2}\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial V}}{\frac {F}{V}}\right)_{T}} H = − − T 2 ( ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ T G T ) P {\textstyle H=-T^{2}\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial T}}{\frac {G}{T}}\right)_{P}} G = − − S 2 ( ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ S H S ) p {\textstyle G=-S^{2}\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial S}}{\frac {H}{S}}\right)_{p}} Chemical reactions and work [ edit ] Main article: Thermochemistry The typical applications of this equation are to chemical reactions . The equation reads: [ 7 ] ( ∂ ∂ ( Δ Δ G ⊖ ⊖ / T ) ∂ ∂ T ) p = − − Δ Δ H ⊖ ⊖ T 2 {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial (\Delta G^{\ominus }/T)}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}=-{\frac {\Delta H^{\ominus }}{T^{2}}}} with Δ G as the change in Gibbs energy due to reaction, and Δ H as the enthalpy of reaction (often, but not necessarily, assumed to be independent of temperature). The o denotes the use of standard states , and particularly the choice of a particular standard pressure (1 bar), to calculate Δ G and Δ H .

Integrating with respect to T (again p is constant) yields: Δ Δ G ⊖ ⊖ ( T 2 ) T 2 − − Δ Δ G ⊖ ⊖ ( T 1 ) T 1 = Δ Δ H ⊖ ⊖ ( 1 T 2 − − 1 T 1 ) {\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta G^{\ominus }(T_{2})}{T_{2}}}-{\frac {\Delta G^{\ominus }(T_{1})}{T_{1}}}=\Delta H^{\ominus }\left({\frac {1}{T_{2}}}-{\frac {1}{T_{1}}}\right)} This equation quickly enables the calculation of the Gibbs free energy change for a chemical reaction at any temperature T 2 with knowledge of just the standard Gibbs free energy change of formation and the standard enthalpy change of formation for the individual components.

Also, using the reaction isotherm equation, [ 8 ] that is Δ Δ G ⊖ ⊖ T = − − R ln ⁡ ⁡ K {\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta G^{\ominus }}{T}}=-R\ln K} which relates the Gibbs energy to a chemical equilibrium constant , the van 't Hoff equation can be derived.

[ 9 ] Since the change in a system's Gibbs energy is equal to the maximum amount of non-expansion work that the system can do in a process, the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation may be used to estimate how much non-expansion work can be done by a chemical process as a function of temperature.

[ 10 ] For example, the capacity of rechargeable electric batteries can be estimated as a function of temperature using the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation.

[ 11 ] Derivation [ edit ] Background [ edit ] Main articles: Defining equation (physical chemistry) , Enthalpy , and Thermodynamic potential The definition of the Gibbs function is H = G + S T {\displaystyle H=G+ST} where H is the enthalpy defined by: H = U + p V {\displaystyle H=U+pV} Taking differentials of each definition to find dH and dG , then using the fundamental thermodynamic relation (always true for reversible or irreversible processes ): d U = T d S − − p d V {\displaystyle dU=T\,dS-p\,dV} where S is the entropy , V is volume , (minus sign due to reversibility, in which dU = 0 : work other than pressure-volume may be done and is equal to − pV ) leads to the "reversed" form of the initial fundamental relation into a new master equation: d G = − − S d T + V d p {\displaystyle dG=-S\,dT+V\,dp} This is the Gibbs free energy for a closed system. The Gibbs–Helmholtz equation can be derived by this second master equation, and the chain rule for partial derivatives .

[ 5 ] Derivation Starting from the equation d G = − − S d T + V d p {\displaystyle dG=-S\,dT+V\,dp} for the differential of G , and remembering H = G + T S , {\displaystyle H=G+T\,S,} one computes the differential of the ratio G / T by applying the product rule of differentiation in the version for differentials: d ( G T ) = T d G − − G d T T 2 = T ( − − S d T + V d p ) − − G d T T 2 = − − T S d T − − G d T + T V d p T 2 = − − ( G + T S ) d T + T V d p T 2 = − − H d T + T V d p T 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}d\left({\frac {G}{T}}\right)&={\frac {T\,dG-G\,dT}{T^{2}}}={\frac {T\,(-S\,dT+V\,dp)-G\,dT}{T^{2}}}\\&={\frac {-T\,S\,dT-G\,dT+T\,V\,dp}{T^{2}}}={\frac {-(G+T\,S)\,dT+T\,V\,dp}{T^{2}}}\\&={\frac {-H\,dT+T\,V\,dp}{T^{2}}}\end{aligned}}\,\!} Therefore, d ( G T ) = − − H T 2 d T + V T d p {\displaystyle d\left({\frac {G}{T}}\right)=-{\frac {H}{T^{2}}}\,dT+{\frac {V}{T}}\,dp\,\!} A comparison with the general expression for a total differential d ( G T ) = ( ∂ ∂ ( G / T ) ∂ ∂ T ) p d T + ( ∂ ∂ ( G / T ) ∂ ∂ p ) T d p {\displaystyle d\left({\frac {G}{T}}\right)=\left({\frac {\partial (G/T)}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}\,dT+\left({\frac {\partial (G/T)}{\partial p}}\right)_{T}\,dp} gives the change of G / T with respect to T at constant pressure (i.e. when dp = 0 ), the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation: ( ∂ ∂ ( G / T ) ∂ ∂ T ) p = − − H T 2 {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial (G/T)}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}=-{\frac {H}{T^{2}}}} Sources [ edit ] ^ von Helmholtz, Hermann (1882).
