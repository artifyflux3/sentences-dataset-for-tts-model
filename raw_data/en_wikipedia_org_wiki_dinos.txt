Attic dinos , c.

540 BCE , Louvre In the typology of ancient Greek pottery , the dinos (plural dinoi , known in ancient times as a lebes ) is a mixing bowl or cauldron .

Dinos means ' drinking cup ' , but in modern typology is used for the same shape as a lebes , that is, a bowl with a spherical body, often accompanied by a wheel-turned stand. It has no handles and no feet. Literary references to such vessels are known from the Iliad , and examples have been found from between the seventh and fifth centuries BCE. Ancient artists who painted dinoi include the Dinos Painter , the Gorgon Painter , the Berlin Painter , Exekias and Sophilos .

History [ edit ] A dinos was a large, deep bowl, with a round bottom and a wide mouth.

Dinoi were used both for cooking and for mixing wine with water.

[ 1 ] The term is modern; in ancient Greece, the word dinos was used for a drinking-cup, [ 2 ] while the term lebes was used for the rounded bowl.

[ 1 ] Dinoi were often made with wheel-turned stands, and could be made either in metal or in terracotta: it is likely that the metal examples were designed for cooking, while the ceramic ones were more likely to be used (similarly to kraters ) for mixing wine at symposia .

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] Dinoi are known from the seventh to the fifth centuries BCE: the oldest known Athenian black-figure example is the name vase of the Gorgon Painter , [ 1 ] from around 580 BCE.

[ 4 ] Literary references to them are found in the Iliad and the works of Aeschylus and Aristophanes .

[ 1 ] The Dinos Painter , active in Athens during the second half of the fifth century BCE, takes his name from the type of vase characteristic of his work.

[ 5 ] A dinos painted and signed by Sophilos , made around 580–570 BCE, [ 6 ] depicts the wedding of Peleus and Thetis and includes the earliest known depiction of the Muses .

[ 7 ] Sophilos may have dedicated another of his dinoi , now in fragments, to the gods on the Acropolis of Athens .

[ 8 ] His dinoi are the earliest known works of ancient Greek pottery to include encircling friezes of humanoid figures.

[ 9 ] Exekias also made and signed a black-figure dinos , now in the British Museum ; [ 10 ] another dinos is known to have been the work of the Berlin Painter .

[ 11 ] The dinos was the main product, slightly ahead of plates, of a school of potters active in Aeolis , which flourished in the first quarter of the sixth century BCE. These artists included the London Painter , and exported their works to Naucratis in Egypt and to Greek colonies on the Black Sea .
