The notion of "negligible" depends on the context, and may mean "of measure zero" (in a measure space ), "finite" (when infinite sets are involved), or "countable" (when uncountably infinite sets are involved).

For example: The set S = { n ∈ ∈ N | n ≥ ≥ k } {\displaystyle S=\{n\in \mathbb {N} \,|\,n\geq k\}} is almost N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } for any k {\displaystyle k} in N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } , because only finitely many natural numbers are less than k {\displaystyle k} .

The set of prime numbers is not almost N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } , because there are infinitely many natural numbers that are not prime numbers.

The set of transcendental numbers are almost R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } , because the algebraic real numbers form a countable subset of the set of real numbers (which is uncountable).

[ 1 ] The Cantor set is uncountably infinite, but has Lebesgue measure zero.

[ 2 ] So almost all real numbers in (0, 1) are members of the complement of the Cantor set.
