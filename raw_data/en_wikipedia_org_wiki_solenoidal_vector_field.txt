{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =0.} A common way of expressing this property is to say that the field has no sources or sinks .

[ note 1 ] Properties [ edit ] The divergence theorem gives an equivalent integral definition of a solenoidal field; namely that for any closed surface, the net total flux through the surface must be zero: v ⋅ ⋅ d S = 0 , {\displaystyle \;\;\mathbf {v} \cdot \,d\mathbf {S} =0,} where d S {\displaystyle d\mathbf {S} } is the outward normal to each surface element.

The fundamental theorem of vector calculus states that any vector field can be expressed as the sum of an irrotational and a solenoidal field. The condition of zero divergence is satisfied whenever a vector field v has only a vector potential component, because the definition of the vector potential A as: v = ∇ ∇ × × A {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\nabla \times \mathbf {A} } automatically results in the identity (as can be shown, for example, using Cartesian coordinates): ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ v = ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ ( ∇ ∇ × × A ) = 0.

{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf {A} )=0.} The converse also holds: for any solenoidal v there exists a vector potential A such that v = ∇ ∇ × × A .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\nabla \times \mathbf {A} .} (Strictly speaking, this holds subject to certain technical conditions on v , see Helmholtz decomposition .) Etymology [ edit ] Solenoidal has its origin in the Greek word for solenoid , which is σωληνοειδές (sōlēnoeidēs) meaning pipe-shaped, from σωλην (sōlēn) or pipe.

Examples [ edit ] The magnetic field B (see Gauss's law for magnetism ) The velocity field of an incompressible fluid flow The vorticity field The electric field E in neutral regions ( ρ ρ e = 0 {\displaystyle \rho _{e}=0} ); The current density J where the charge density is unvarying, ∂ ∂ ρ ρ e ∂ ∂ t = 0 {\textstyle {\frac {\partial \rho _{e}}{\partial t}}=0} .
