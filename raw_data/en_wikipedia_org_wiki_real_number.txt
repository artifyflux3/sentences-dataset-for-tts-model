In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **real number** is a [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number") that can be used to [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement "Measurement") a [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_variable "Continuous variable") one-[dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")[quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity "Quantity") such as a [duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") or [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"). Here, _continuous_ means that pairs of values can have arbitrarily small differences.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-1) Every real number can be almost uniquely represented by an infinite [decimal expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_expansion "Decimal expansion").[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-2)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-3)

The real numbers are fundamental in [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") (and in many other branches of mathematics), in particular by their role in the classical definitions of [limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics) "Limit (mathematics)"), [continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") and [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative").[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-4)

The set of real numbers, sometimes called "the reals", is traditionally [denoted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_notation "Mathematical notation") by a bold **R**, often using [blackboard bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_bold "Blackboard bold"), ⁠![Image 1: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)⁠.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-5)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-6) The adjective _real_, used in the 17th century by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"), distinguishes real numbers from [imaginary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number "Imaginary number") such as the [square roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") of −1.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-Britannica-7)

The real numbers include the [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"), such as the [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer")−5 and the [fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics) "Fraction (mathematics)")4 / 3. The rest of the real numbers are called [irrational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number "Irrational number"). Some irrational numbers (as well as all the rationals) are the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function") of a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") with integer coefficients, such as the square root [√2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2 "Square root of 2") = 1.414...; these are called [algebraic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number "Algebraic number"). There are also real numbers which are not, such as [π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi") = 3.1415...; these are called [transcendental numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_numbers "Transcendental numbers").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-Britannica-7)

Real numbers can be thought of as all points on a number line

Real numbers can be thought of as all points on a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") called the [number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line "Number line") or [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line"), where the points corresponding to integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.

The informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient for ensuring the correctness of proofs of [theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem") involving real numbers. The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of [19th-century mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mathematics#19th_century "History of mathematics") and is the foundation of [real analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis "Real analysis"), the study of [real functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_function "Real function") and real-valued [sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence"). A current [axiomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") definition is that real numbers form the [unique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentially_unique "Essentially unique") ([up to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to "Up to") an [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism")) [Dedekind-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind-complete "Dedekind-complete")[ordered field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field "Ordered field").[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-8) Other common definitions of real numbers include [equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") of [Cauchy sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence "Cauchy sequence") (of rational numbers), [Dedekind cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut "Dedekind cut"), and infinite [decimal representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_representation "Decimal representation"). All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent.

Characterizing properties
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Characterizing properties")]

Real numbers are completely characterized by their fundamental properties that can be summarized by saying that they form an [ordered field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field "Ordered field") that is [Dedekind complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_complete "Dedekind complete"). Here, "completely characterized" means that there is a unique [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") between any two Dedekind complete ordered fields, and thus that their elements have exactly the same properties. This implies that one can manipulate real numbers and compute with them, without knowing how they can be defined; this is what mathematicians and physicists did during several centuries before the first formal definitions were provided in the second half of the 19th century. See [Construction of the real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_the_real_numbers "Construction of the real numbers") for details about these formal definitions and the proof of their equivalence.

The real numbers form an [ordered field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field "Ordered field"). Intuitively, this means that methods and rules of [elementary arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_arithmetic "Elementary arithmetic") apply to them. More precisely, there are two [binary operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation "Binary operation"), [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition") and [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"), and a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order "Total order") that have the following properties.

*   The _addition_ of two real numbers a and b produce a real number denoted ![Image 3: {\displaystyle a+b,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f46e28334dbcbaf0e8510b0d3ac743f44d525b) which is the _sum_ of a and b.
*   The _multiplication_ of two real numbers a and b produce a real number denoted ![Image 4: {\displaystyle ab,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5535dcf69398b3a353906a003e100ac1e7de20f)![Image 5: {\displaystyle a\cdot b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/620419d3ed53abc98659a5fc0f3a5eb6177830ae) or ![Image 6: {\displaystyle a\times b,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8a20deb883e14147a4bed3afc4ad71f94a55cfaa) which is the _product_ of a and b.
*   Addition and multiplication are both [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative "Commutative"), which means that ![Image 7: {\displaystyle a+b=b+a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/684f43b5094501674e8314be5e24a80ee64682e3) and ![Image 8: {\displaystyle ab=ba}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/794f6c310259e816eed4a00262d91bf4f53e37c5) for every real numbers a and b.
*   Addition and multiplication are both [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative "Associative"), which means that ![Image 9: {\displaystyle (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46b7b8d31d5845966e6abdbb030c73f343c17d4e) and ![Image 10: {\displaystyle (ab)c=a(bc)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ebe39cd5b70c1c6b7e467d25b61554b02b1bd122) for every real numbers a, b and c, and that parentheses may be omitted in both cases.
*   Multiplication is [distributive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property "Distributive property") over addition, which means that ![Image 11: {\displaystyle a(b+c)=ab+ac}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5aad41bae613e8522d4d598bcf9f52772f472c55) for every real numbers a, b and c.
*   There is a real number called [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero "Zero") and denoted 0 which is an [additive identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_identity "Additive identity"), which means that ![Image 12: {\displaystyle a+0=a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4564e28f0f8274644ca4e58664c0593ed48de541) for every real number a.
*   There is a real number denoted 1 which is a [multiplicative identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_identity "Multiplicative identity"), which means that ![Image 13: {\displaystyle a\times 1=a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/04e0634cfe81c515b29a69b624960f73b8167e60) for every real number a.
*   Every real number a has an [additive inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_inverse "Additive inverse") denoted ![Image 14: {\displaystyle -a.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7894ce6a00eba1ed084486b10138019906535e4) This means that ![Image 15: {\displaystyle a+(-a)=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7bee04ca35f37fa95ee387e42959af9038fb8251) for every real number a.
*   Every nonzero real number a has a [multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") denoted ![Image 16: {\displaystyle a^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f5709c8d86f7fec8fb86069bf5d15a9eabe564e) or ![Image 17: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{a}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a859022c8d652c62c88b5926bafb0fea3330415c) This means that ![Image 18: {\displaystyle aa^{-1}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/78ab9896f2fe53b99dfd6558f43e0053284a2367) for every nonzero real number a.
*   The total order is denoted ![Image 19: {\displaystyle a<b.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e3eb27a8baca8de88c99780c03b7c38ea2c4dec) being that it is a total order means two properties: given two real numbers a and b, exactly one of ![Image 20: {\displaystyle a<b,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46f9e3247a4373970cad2b3b37920af5d23ec7c4)![Image 21: {\displaystyle a=b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1956b03d1314c7071ac1f45ed7b1e29422dcfcc4) or ![Image 22: {\displaystyle b<a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec536027666ac731c00e6db3a3b0b10d7ebbe031) is true; and if ![Image 23: {\displaystyle a<b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91a7698e4c7401bb321f97888b872b583a9e4642) and ![Image 24: {\displaystyle b<c,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0ed504ef315749bdb93c39fa79851ff1787d7415) then one has also ![Image 25: {\displaystyle a<c.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/24b684895b16391e41ba40fa838b610191c97a5c)
*   The order is compatible with addition and multiplication, which means that ![Image 26: {\displaystyle a<b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91a7698e4c7401bb321f97888b872b583a9e4642) implies ![Image 27: {\displaystyle a+c<b+c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c4e47dfc103d919e216bfb82b4d4fa645fcd292a) for every real number c, and ![Image 28: {\displaystyle 0<ab}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47c6038f5e06468e8919db9a44a148112265af42) is implied by ![Image 29: {\displaystyle 0<a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5ada64492c51887b535dfa3bad685943145e946) and ![Image 30: {\displaystyle 0<b.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2dffaee0ba4cd4ba6baac3cc7ae236ddcea733e)

Many other properties can be deduced from the above ones. In particular:

### Auxiliary operations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Auxiliary operations")]

Several other operations are commonly used, which can be deduced from the above ones.

### Auxiliary order relations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Auxiliary order relations")]

The [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order "Total order") that is considered above is denoted ![Image 31: {\displaystyle a<b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91a7698e4c7401bb321f97888b872b583a9e4642) and read as "a is [less than](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_than "Less than")b". Three other [order relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_relation "Order relation") are also commonly used:

### Integers and fractions as real numbers

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Integers and fractions as real numbers")]

The real numbers 0 and 1 are commonly identified with the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number")0 and 1. This allows identifying any natural number n with the sum of n real numbers equal to 1.

This identification can be pursued by identifying a negative integer ![Image 32: {\displaystyle -n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f00139753ecf4fe00a10a17bd5620b70a61b29e) (where ![Image 33: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) is a natural number) with the additive inverse ![Image 34: {\displaystyle -n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f00139753ecf4fe00a10a17bd5620b70a61b29e) of the real number identified with ![Image 35: {\displaystyle n.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e59df02a9f67a5da3c220f1244c99a46cc4eb1c6) Similarly a [rational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number")![Image 36: {\displaystyle p/q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8fa5bd4cf049744deac0ac4a04c07998bd6befa9) (where p and q are integers and ![Image 37: {\displaystyle q\neq 0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/13d94671374212c0fc968f2dbb4bb9201152ca0b)) is identified with the division of the real numbers identified with p and q.

These identifications make the set ![Image 38: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a) of the rational numbers an ordered [subfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfield_(mathematics) "Subfield (mathematics)") of the real numbers ![Image 39: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dc9de9049e03e5e5a0cab57076dbe4a369c1e3a7) The [Dedekind completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_completeness "Dedekind completeness") described below implies that some real numbers, such as ![Image 40: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74847cf19189c725cee56e0e5b513d59f6eb9402) are not rational numbers; they are called [irrational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number "Irrational number").

The above identifications make sense, since natural numbers, integers and real numbers are generally not defined by their individual nature, but by defining properties ([axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom")). So, the identification of natural numbers with some real numbers is justified by the fact that [Peano axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms "Peano axioms") are satisfied by these real numbers, with the addition with 1 taken as the [successor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successor_function "Successor function").

Formally, one has an injective [homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism "Homomorphism") of [ordered monoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_monoid "Ordered monoid") from the natural numbers ![Image 41: {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed) to the integers ![Image 42: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f3aa4cb112cbe4f94a3ff8569f869c31dce5fce4) an injective homomorphism of [ordered rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_ring "Ordered ring") from ![Image 43: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/449494a083e0a1fda2b61c62b2f09b6bee4633dc) to the rational numbers ![Image 44: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91185244fbdded6ea99a5e9e6603299128b10928) and an injective homomorphism of [ordered fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field "Ordered field") from ![Image 45: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a) to the real numbers ![Image 46: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dc9de9049e03e5e5a0cab57076dbe4a369c1e3a7) The identifications consist of not distinguishing the source and the image of each injective homomorphism, and thus to write

![Image 47: {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} \subset \mathbb {Q} \subset \mathbb {R} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3e733a6dbf60d2a08af4d23452719616fb6f8af7)
These identifications are formally [abuses of notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_notation "Abuse of notation") (since, formally, a rational number is an equivalence class of pairs of integers, and a real number is an equivalence class of Cauchy series), and are generally harmless. It is only in very specific situations, that one must avoid them and replace them by using explicitly the above homomorphisms. This is the case in [constructive mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_mathematics "Constructive mathematics") and [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"). In the latter case, these homomorphisms are interpreted as [type conversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion "Type conversion") that can often be done automatically by the [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler").

Dedekind completeness
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Dedekind completeness")]

Previous properties do not distinguish real numbers from [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"). This distinction is provided by [Dedekind completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_completeness "Dedekind completeness"), which states that every set of real numbers with an [upper bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_bound "Upper bound") admits a [least upper bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_upper_bound "Least upper bound"). This means the following. A set of real numbers ![Image 48: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2) is _bounded above_ if there is a real number ![Image 49: {\displaystyle u}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3e6bb763d22c20916ed4f0bb6bd49d7470cffd8) such that ![Image 50: {\displaystyle s\leq u}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40dc05034b6135de669ef847a675271cd8c38d21) for all ![Image 51: {\displaystyle s\in S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/acce52dffd84d073a24f4606a175da60148fd0c6); such a ![Image 52: {\displaystyle u}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3e6bb763d22c20916ed4f0bb6bd49d7470cffd8) is called an _upper bound_ of ![Image 53: {\displaystyle S.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/23bbb1f0f6ebdfa78b4fed06049640f7386bb44b) So, Dedekind completeness means that, if S is bounded above, it has an upper bound that is less than any other upper bound.

Dedekind completeness implies other sorts of completeness (see below), but also has some important consequences.

The last two properties are summarized by saying that the real numbers form a [real closed field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_closed_field "Real closed field"). This implies the real version of the [fundamental theorem of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra "Fundamental theorem of algebra"), namely that every polynomial with real coefficients can be factored into polynomials with real coefficients of degree at most two.

Decimal representation
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Decimal representation")]

The most common way of describing a real number is via its decimal representation, a sequence of [decimal digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_digit "Decimal digit") each representing the product of an integer between zero and nine times a [power of ten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_ten "Power of ten"), extending to finitely many positive powers of ten to the left and infinitely many negative powers of ten to the right. For a number x whose decimal representation extends k places to the left, the standard notation is the juxtaposition of the digits ![Image 54: {\displaystyle b_{k}b_{k-1}\cdots b_{0}.a_{1}a_{2}\cdots ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bdfbeeeebd19e48d07e81b75fd67fc0cfbae8288) in descending order by power of ten, with non-negative and negative powers of ten separated by a [decimal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_point "Decimal point"), representing the [infinite series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_series "Infinite series")

![Image 55: {\displaystyle x=b_{k}10^{k}+b_{k-1}10^{k-1}+\cdots +b_{0}+{\frac {a_{1}}{10}}+{\frac {a_{2}}{10^{2}}}+\cdots .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/32af3ba78707e1fb37f59963db7f017f6c9c0c0d)
For example, for the circle constant ![Image 56: {\displaystyle \pi =3.14159\cdots ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3fcb47a0bdeb5182cf54a349a63b38958cbafc75)k is zero and ![Image 57: {\displaystyle b_{0}=3,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/858b64222fb2ca887bf8644bf66db70d2fdafe97)![Image 58: {\displaystyle a_{1}=1,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/314f8ff50afe6b08a2e759a9b69487216620ae73)![Image 59: {\displaystyle a_{2}=4,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a01964682ffcbc94aa50e2b292e0bb441a1db68) etc.

More formally, a _decimal representation_ for a nonnegative real number x consists of a nonnegative integer k and integers between zero and nine in the [infinite sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_sequence "Infinite sequence")

![Image 60: {\displaystyle b_{k},b_{k-1},\ldots ,b_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/93754b0fdce476ca3c7855f90e0e43d0218ea811)
(If ![Image 61: {\displaystyle k>0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/549d18cca65d346b3e92efdaac24eae22da4da35) then by convention ![Image 62: {\displaystyle b_{k}\neq 0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3de5081650099f150f6f8585da5dca892cf3a434))

Such a decimal representation specifies the real number as the least upper bound of the [decimal fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_fraction "Decimal fraction") that are obtained by [truncating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation "Truncation") the sequence: given a positive integer n, the truncation of the sequence at the place n is the finite [partial sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_sum "Partial sum")

![Image 63: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}D_{n}&=b_{k}10^{k}+b_{k-1}10^{k-1}+\cdots +b_{0}+{\frac {a_{1}}{10}}+\cdots +{\frac {a_{n}}{10^{n}}}\\&=\sum _{i=0}^{k}b_{i}10^{i}+\sum _{j=1}^{n}a_{j}10^{-j}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/62c5443872d0158fa7e85a43ef6c10231e5aafa0)
The real number x defined by the sequence is the least upper bound of the ![Image 64: {\displaystyle D_{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f791ccfe467d310fef894c66d25763afacfb438e) which exists by Dedekind completeness.

Conversely, given a nonnegative real number x, one can define a decimal representation of x by [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction"), as follows. Define ![Image 65: {\displaystyle b_{k}\cdots b_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/429759d7b35abe0cad2f2db791b8eed010c78fca) as decimal representation of the largest integer ![Image 66: {\displaystyle D_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b943acf3ade50743482c4ee4570ad3de335d90d8) such that ![Image 67: {\displaystyle D_{0}\leq x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/447f1579a62139fd233b23f2e57ede504a26ffa3) (this integer exists because of the Archimedean property). Then, supposing by [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction") that the decimal fraction ![Image 68: {\displaystyle D_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9f07b53d3212e08ca316a536c8aac0bbefa79ee1) has been defined for ![Image 69: {\displaystyle i<n,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72633327784d8178c3c190440d7a0d69e2822693) one defines ![Image 70: {\displaystyle a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790f9209748c2dca7ed7b81932c37c02af1dbc31) as the largest digit such that ![Image 71: {\displaystyle D_{n-1}+a_{n}/10^{n}\leq a,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4d002ba6c1ce6bcd078f8a95c595339f754736ec) and one sets ![Image 72: {\displaystyle D_{n}=D_{n-1}+a_{n}/10^{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/55c3626b15b9d122fd0971b0afeb911a6fa69036)

One can use the defining properties of the real numbers to show that x is the least upper bound of the ![Image 73: {\displaystyle D_{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/93d4ed899749eb2323c226dd59cbc09586507f3e) So, the resulting sequence of digits is called a _decimal representation_ of x.

Another decimal representation can be obtained by replacing ![Image 74: {\displaystyle \leq x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dfaf3180ac459488b27b0c7fa38d9d2d5fdf0198) with ![Image 75: {\displaystyle <x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9a877ea342f0586e27f88f73408cd1a3e5705b81) in the preceding construction. These two representations are identical, unless x is a [decimal fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_fraction "Decimal fraction") of the form ![Image 76: {\textstyle {\frac {m}{10^{h}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22deaeade236937804abf3c781c9b9a1e32fc18c) In this case, in the first decimal representation, all ![Image 77: {\displaystyle a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790f9209748c2dca7ed7b81932c37c02af1dbc31) are zero for ![Image 78: {\displaystyle n>h,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/98234f3abdb3d56d164a6c7a2a9d51a28ae9d0c7) and, in the second representation, all ![Image 79: {\displaystyle a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790f9209748c2dca7ed7b81932c37c02af1dbc31) 9. (see [0.999...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999... "0.999...") for details).

In summary, there is a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") between the real numbers and the decimal representations that do not end with infinitely many trailing 9.

The preceding considerations apply directly for every [numeral base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_base "Numeral base")![Image 80: {\displaystyle B\geq 2,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef09cb6e27c2a26643b2b48ffae57c0a99c16fd5) simply by replacing 10 with ![Image 81: {\displaystyle B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a) and 9 with ![Image 82: {\displaystyle B-1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f049d49a84ccb0af4dbce30954bb6bcafa4d4dfe)

Topological completeness
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Topological completeness")]

A main reason for using real numbers is so that many sequences have [limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics) "Limit (mathematics)"). More formally, the reals are [complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(topology) "Completeness (topology)") (in the sense of [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") or [uniform spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_space "Uniform space"), which is a different sense than the Dedekind completeness of the order in the previous section):

A [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") (_x_ _n_) of real numbers is called a _[Cauchy sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy\_sequence "Cauchy sequence")_ if for any ε > 0 there exists an integer _N_ (possibly depending on ε) such that the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance")|_x n_ − _x m_| is less than ε for all _n_ and _m_ that are both greater than _N_. This definition, originally provided by [Cauchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin_Louis_Cauchy "Augustin Louis Cauchy"), formalizes the fact that the _x_ _n_ eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to each other.

A sequence (_x_ _n_) _converges to the limit_ _x_ if its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to _x_, that is, if for any ε > 0 there exists an integer _N_ (possibly depending on ε) such that the distance |_x n_ − _x_| is less than ε for _n_ greater than _N_.

Every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, and the converse is true for real numbers, and this means that the [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") of the real numbers is complete.

The set of rational numbers is not complete. For example, the sequence (1; 1.4; 1.41; 1.414; 1.4142; 1.41421; ...), where each term adds a digit of the decimal expansion of the positive [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") of 2, is Cauchy but it does not converge to a rational number (in the real numbers, in contrast, it converges to the positive [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") of 2).

The completeness property of the reals is the basis on which [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"), and more generally [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"), are built. In particular, the test that a sequence is a Cauchy sequence allows proving that a sequence has a limit, without computing it, and even without knowing it.

For example, the standard series of the [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function "Exponential function")

![Image 83: {\displaystyle e^{x}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/67a9298efa55f8da4b31868da8e08f68e6bc2ae2)
converges to a real number for every _x_, because the sums

![Image 84: {\displaystyle \sum _{n=N}^{M}{\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fd930a0fe0e8bd408aae4336638725269fdfbc0)
can be made arbitrarily small (independently of _M_) by choosing _N_ sufficiently large. This proves that the sequence is Cauchy, and thus converges, showing that ![Image 85: {\displaystyle e^{x}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/841c0d168e64191c45a45e54c7e447defd17ec6a) is well defined for every _x_.

### "The complete ordered field"

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: \"The complete ordered field\"")]

The real numbers are often described as "the complete ordered field", a phrase that can be interpreted in several ways.

First, an order can be [lattice-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_lattice "Complete lattice"). It is easy to see that no ordered field can be lattice-complete, because it can have no [largest element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_element "Largest element") (given any element _z_, _z_ + 1 is larger).

Additionally, an order can be Dedekind-complete, see [§Axiomatic approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#Axiomatic_approach). The uniqueness result at the end of that section justifies using the word "the" in the phrase "complete ordered field" when this is the sense of "complete" that is meant. This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from Dedekind cuts, since that construction starts from an ordered field (the rationals) and then forms the Dedekind-completion of it in a standard way.

These two notions of completeness ignore the field structure. However, an [ordered group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_group "Ordered group") (in this case, the additive group of the field) defines a [uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_space "Uniform space") structure, and uniform structures have a notion of [completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(topology) "Completeness (topology)"); the description in [§ Completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#Completeness) is a special case. (We refer to the notion of completeness in uniform spaces rather than the related and better known notion for [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"), since the definition of metric space relies on already having a characterization of the real numbers.) It is not true that ![Image 86: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) is the _only_ uniformly complete ordered field, but it is the only uniformly complete _[Archimedean field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean\_field "Archimedean field")_, and indeed one often hears the phrase "complete Archimedean field" instead of "complete ordered field". Every uniformly complete Archimedean field must also be Dedekind-complete (and vice versa), justifying using "the" in the phrase "the complete Archimedean field". This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from Cauchy sequences (the construction carried out in full in this article), since it starts with an Archimedean field (the rationals) and forms the uniform completion of it in a standard way.

But the original use of the phrase "complete Archimedean field" was by [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert"), who meant still something else by it. He meant that the real numbers form the _largest_ Archimedean field in the sense that every other Archimedean field is a subfield of ![Image 87: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc). Thus ![Image 88: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) is "complete" in the sense that nothing further can be added to it without making it no longer an Archimedean field. This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from [surreal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number "Surreal number"), since that construction starts with a proper class that contains every ordered field (the surreals) and then selects from it the largest Archimedean subfield.

The set of all real numbers is [uncountable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set "Uncountable set"), in the sense that while both the set of all [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"){1, 2, 3, 4, ...}  and the set of all real numbers are [infinite sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set "Infinite set"), there exists no [one-to-one function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_function "One-to-one function") from the real numbers to the natural numbers. The [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality "Cardinality") of the set of all real numbers is called the _[cardinality of the continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality\_of\_the\_continuum "Cardinality of the continuum")_ and commonly denoted by ![Image 89: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {c}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3dcc5360afa3bd774bd5b0b6f4376515b4850abb) It is strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers, denoted ![Image 90: {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1) and called _[Aleph-zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph-zero "Aleph-zero")_ or _aleph-nought_. The cardinality of the continuum equals the cardinality of the [power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set "Power set") of the natural numbers, that is, the set of all subsets of the natural numbers.

The statement that there is no cardinality strictly greater than ![Image 91: {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1) and strictly smaller than ![Image 92: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {c}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b21924b960341255be18e538e51404718f29cbc0) is known as the [continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis "Continuum hypothesis") (CH). It is neither provable nor refutable using the axioms of [Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory "Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory") including the [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice") (ZFC)—the standard foundation of modern mathematics. In fact, some models of ZFC satisfy CH, while others violate it.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-9)

As a topological space, the real numbers are [separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_space "Separable space"). This is because the set of rationals, which is countable, is [dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_set "Dense set") in the real numbers. The irrational numbers are also dense in the real numbers, however they are uncountable and have the same cardinality as the reals.

The real numbers form a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"): the distance between _x_ and _y_ is defined as the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value")|_x_ − _y_|. By virtue of being a totally ordered set, they also carry an [order topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_topology "Order topology"); the [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") arising from the metric and the one arising from the order are identical, but yield different presentations for the topology—in the order topology as ordered intervals, in the metric topology as epsilon-balls. The Dedekind cuts construction uses the order topology presentation, while the Cauchy sequences construction uses the metric topology presentation. The reals form a [contractible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractible "Contractible") (hence [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") and [simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected "Simply connected")), [separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_space "Separable space") and [complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_space "Complete space") metric space of [Hausdorff dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension "Hausdorff dimension")1. The real numbers are [locally compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_compactness "Local compactness") but not [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space"). There are various properties that uniquely specify them; for instance, all unbounded, connected, and separable [order topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order "Total order") are necessarily [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to the reals.

Every nonnegative real number has a [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") in ![Image 93: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc), although no negative number does. This shows that the order on ![Image 94: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) is determined by its algebraic structure. Also, every [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") of odd degree admits at least one real root: these two properties make ![Image 95: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) the premier example of a [real closed field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_closed_field "Real closed field"). Proving this is the first half of one proof of the [fundamental theorem of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra "Fundamental theorem of algebra").

The reals carry a canonical [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics) "Measure (mathematics)"), the [Lebesgue measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure "Lebesgue measure"), which is the [Haar measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_measure "Haar measure") on their structure as a [topological group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_group "Topological group") normalized such that the [unit interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_interval "Unit interval") [0;1] has measure 1. There exist sets of real numbers that are not Lebesgue measurable, e.g. [Vitali sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_set "Vitali set").

The supremum axiom of the reals refers to subsets of the reals and is therefore a second-order logical statement. It is not possible to characterize the reals with [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic") alone: the [Löwenheim–Skolem theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_theorem "Löwenheim–Skolem theorem") implies that there exists a countable dense subset of the real numbers satisfying exactly the same sentences in first-order logic as the real numbers themselves. The set of [hyperreal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number "Hyperreal number") satisfies the same first order sentences as ![Image 96: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc). Ordered fields that satisfy the same first-order sentences as ![Image 97: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) are called [nonstandard models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_model "Nonstandard model") of ![Image 98: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc). This is what makes [nonstandard analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_analysis "Nonstandard analysis") work; by proving a first-order statement in some nonstandard model (which may be easier than proving it in ![Image 99: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)), we know that the same statement must also be true of ![Image 100: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc).

The [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")![Image 101: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) of real numbers is an [extension field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_field "Extension field") of the field ![Image 102: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a) of rational numbers, and ![Image 103: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) can therefore be seen as a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over ![Image 104: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a). [Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory "Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory") with the [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice") guarantees the existence of a [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)") of this vector space: there exists a set _B_ of real numbers such that every real number can be written uniquely as a finite [linear combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination "Linear combination") of elements of this set, using rational coefficients only, and such that no element of _B_ is a rational linear combination of the others. However, this existence theorem is purely theoretical, as such a base has never been explicitly described.

The [well-ordering theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordering_theorem "Well-ordering theorem") implies that the real numbers can be [well-ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order "Well-order") if the axiom of choice is assumed: there exists a total order on ![Image 105: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) with the property that every nonempty [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of ![Image 106: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) has a [least element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_element "Least element") in this ordering. (The standard ordering ≤ of the real numbers is not a well-ordering since e.g. an [open interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_interval "Open interval") does not contain a least element in this ordering.) Again, the existence of such a well-ordering is purely theoretical, as it has not been explicitly described. If [V=L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%3DL "V=L") is assumed in addition to the axioms of ZF, a well ordering of the real numbers can be shown to be explicitly definable by a formula.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-10)

A real number may be either [computable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_number "Computable number") or uncomputable; either [algorithmically random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmically_random_sequence "Algorithmically random sequence") or not; and either [arithmetically random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmically_random_sequence#Stronger_than_Martin-L%C3%B6f_randomness "Algorithmically random sequence") or not.

Real numbers ![Image 108: {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66964ab8a4912f2be91dc22cceb762be1d3d8d05) include the rational numbers ![Image 109: {\displaystyle (\mathbb {Q} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a721495ab8dcae6b57e2b3e33402f94d57f7b9b6), which include the integers ![Image 110: {\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4e7c394740649bbc95dc603df09ceebaac387c04), which in turn include the natural numbers ![Image 111: {\displaystyle (\mathbb {N} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/df81a020f988536b900afeb19accc316516b1b08)

[Simple fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)#Simple,_common,_or_vulgar_fractions "Fraction (mathematics)") were used by the [Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Egypt "History of Egypt") around 1000 BC; the [Vedic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_civilization "Vedic civilization") "[Shulba Sutras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulba_Sutras "Shulba Sutras")" ("The rules of chords") in c. 600 BC include what may be the first "use" of irrational numbers. The concept of irrationality was implicitly accepted by early [Indian mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_mathematics "Indian mathematics") such as [Manava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manava "Manava")(c. 750–690 BC), who was aware that the [square roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") of certain numbers, such as 2 and 61, could not be exactly determined.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-11)

Around 500 BC, the [Greek mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics") led by [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras "Pythagoras") also realized that the [square root of 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2 "Square root of 2") is irrational.

For Greek mathematicians, numbers were only the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"). Real numbers were called "proportions", being the ratios of two lengths, or equivalently being measures of a length in terms of another length, called unit length. Two lengths are "commensurable", if there is a unit in which they are both measured by integers, that is, in modern terminology, if their ratio is a [rational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"). [Eudoxus of Cnidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus "Eudoxus of Cnidus") (c. 390−340 BC) provided a definition of the equality of two irrational proportions in a way that is similar to [Dedekind cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut "Dedekind cut") (introduced more than 2,000 years later), except that he did not use any [arithmetic operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_operation "Arithmetic operation") other than multiplication of a length by a natural number (see [Eudoxus of Cnidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus "Eudoxus of Cnidus")). This may be viewed as the first definition of the real numbers.

The [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") brought about the acceptance of [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero "Zero"), [negative numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number "Negative number"), integers, and [fractional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics) "Fraction (mathematics)") numbers, first by [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_mathematics "Indian mathematics") and [Chinese mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_mathematics "Chinese mathematics"), and then by [Arabic mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam "Mathematics in medieval Islam"), who were also the first to treat irrational numbers as algebraic objects (the latter being made possible by the development of algebra).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-12) Arabic mathematicians merged the concepts of "[number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number")" and "[magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)")" into a more general idea of real numbers.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-13) The Egyptian mathematician [Abū Kāmil Shujā ibn Aslam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab%C5%AB_K%C4%81mil_Shuj%C4%81_ibn_Aslam "Abū Kāmil Shujā ibn Aslam")(c. 850–930) was the first to accept irrational numbers as solutions to [quadratic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation "Quadratic equation"), or as [coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient "Coefficient") in an [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") (often in the form of square roots, [cube roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_root "Cube root"), and [fourth roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root "Nth root")).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-14) In Europe, such numbers, not commensurable with the numerical unit, were called _irrational_ or [_surd_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root "Nth root") ("deaf").

In the 16th century, [Simon Stevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Stevin "Simon Stevin") created the basis for modern [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal "Decimal") notation, and insisted that there is no difference between rational and irrational numbers in this regard.

In the 17th century, [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes") introduced the term "real" to describe roots of a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial"), distinguishing them from "imaginary" numbers.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, there was much work on irrational and transcendental numbers. [Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Lambert "Johann Heinrich Lambert") (1761) gave a flawed proof that π cannot be rational; [Legendre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien-Marie_Legendre "Adrien-Marie Legendre") (1794) completed the proof[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-15) and showed that π is not the square root of a rational number.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-16)[Liouville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Liouville "Joseph Liouville") (1840) showed that neither e nor _e_ 2 can be a root of an integer [quadratic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation "Quadratic equation"), and then established the existence of transcendental numbers; [Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor "Georg Cantor") (1873) extended and greatly simplified this proof.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-17)[Hermite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hermite "Charles Hermite") (1873) proved that [e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant) "E (mathematical constant)") is transcendental, and [Lindemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Lindemann "Ferdinand von Lindemann") (1882), showed that π is transcendental. Lindemann's proof was much simplified by Weierstrass (1885), [Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") (1893), [Hurwitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hurwitz "Adolf Hurwitz"),[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-18) and [Gordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gordan "Paul Gordan").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-19)

The concept that many points existed between rational numbers, such as the square root of 2, was well known to the ancient Greeks. The existence of a continuous number line was considered self-evident, but the nature of this continuity, presently called [completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers "Completeness of the real numbers"), was not understood. The rigor developed for geometry did not cross over to the concept of numbers until the 1800s.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-20)

The developers of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") used real numbers and [limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics) "Limit (mathematics)") without defining them rigorously. In his _[Cours d'Analyse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cours\_d%27Analyse "Cours d'Analyse")_ (1821), [Cauchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy "Cauchy") made calculus rigorous, but he used the real numbers without defining them, and assumed without proof that every [Cauchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy "Cauchy") sequence has a limit and that this limit is a real number.

In 1854 [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann") highlighted the limitations of calculus in the method of [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series "Fourier series"), showing the need for a rigorous definition of the real numbers.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-OxfordHistory-21): 672

Beginning with [Richard Dedekind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dedekind "Richard Dedekind") in 1858, several mathematicians worked on the definition of the real numbers, including [Hermann Hankel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hankel "Hermann Hankel"), [Charles Méray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_M%C3%A9ray "Charles Méray"), and [Eduard Heine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Heine "Eduard Heine"), leading to the publication in 1872 of two independent definitions of real numbers, one by Dedekind, as [Dedekind cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut "Dedekind cut"), and the other one by [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor "Georg Cantor"), as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-22) Several problems were left open by these definitions, which contributed to the [foundational crisis of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundational_crisis_of_mathematics "Foundational crisis of mathematics"). Firstly both definitions suppose that [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") and thus [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") are rigorously defined; this was done a few years later with [Peano axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms "Peano axioms"). Secondly, both definitions involve [infinite sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set "Infinite set") (Dedekind cuts and sets of the elements of a Cauchy sequence), and Cantor's [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory") was published several years later. Thirdly, these definitions imply [quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_(logic) "Quantification (logic)") on infinite sets, and this cannot be formalized in the classical [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic") of [first-order predicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_predicate "First-order predicate"). This is one of the reasons for which [higher-order logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_logic "Higher-order logic") were developed in the first half of the 20th century.

In 1874 Cantor showed that the set of all real numbers is [uncountably infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable "Uncountable"), but the set of all algebraic numbers is [countably infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable "Countable"). [Cantor's first uncountability proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_first_uncountability_proof "Cantor's first uncountability proof") was different from his famous [diagonal argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument "Cantor's diagonal argument") published in 1891.

The real number system ![Image 112: {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ;{}+{};{}\cdot {};{}<{})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff154b8792236508b68b8acae57419c62b82c93c) can be defined [axiomatically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system") up to an [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism"), which is described hereinafter. There are also many ways to construct "the" real number system, and a popular approach involves starting from natural numbers, then defining rational numbers algebraically, and finally defining real numbers as equivalence classes of their [Cauchy sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence "Cauchy sequence") or as Dedekind cuts, which are certain subsets of rational numbers.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-23) Another approach is to start from some rigorous axiomatization of Euclidean geometry (say of Hilbert or of [Tarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski "Alfred Tarski")), and then define the real number system geometrically. All these constructions of the real numbers have been shown to be equivalent, in the sense that the resulting number systems are [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic "Isomorphic").

Let ![Image 113: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) denote the [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of all real numbers. Then:

The last property applies to the real numbers but not to the rational numbers (or to [other more exotic ordered fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field#Examples_of_ordered_fields "Ordered field")). For example, ![Image 114: {\displaystyle \{x\in \mathbb {Q} :x^{2}<2\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/83fa3b4d01cd46631546f4f5fb874daaa149a27c) has a rational upper bound (e.g., 1.42), but no _least_ rational upper bound, because [![Image 115: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4afc1e27d418021bf10898eb44a7f5f315735ff)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") is not rational.

These properties imply the [Archimedean property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_property "Archimedean property") (which is not implied by other definitions of completeness), which states that the set of integers has no upper bound in the reals. In fact, if this were false, then the integers would have a least upper bound _N_; then, _N_ – 1 would not be an upper bound, and there would be an integer _n_ such that _n_>_N_ – 1, and thus _n_ + 1 >_N_, which is a contradiction with the upper-bound property of _N_.

The real numbers are uniquely specified by the above properties. More precisely, given any two Dedekind-complete ordered fields ![Image 116: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/880c089509beeddaae996a6985f29fb00a7f45e7) and ![Image 117: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/139c792da4e0dfb9cca58316eb540fb919dce79d), there exists a unique field [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") from ![Image 118: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/880c089509beeddaae996a6985f29fb00a7f45e7) to ![Image 119: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R_{2}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/647c077b3e97c62ac9987a516c658d71614ded86). This uniqueness allows us to think of them as essentially the same mathematical object.

For another axiomatization of ![Image 120: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) see [Tarski's axiomatization of the reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_axiomatization_of_the_reals "Tarski's axiomatization of the reals").

### Construction from the rational numbers

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Construction from the rational numbers")]

The real numbers can be constructed as a [completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric_space "Complete metric space") of the rational numbers, in such a way that a sequence defined by a decimal or binary expansion like (3; 3.1; 3.14; 3.141; 3.1415; ...) [converges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence "Limit of a sequence") to a unique real number—in this case π. For details and other constructions of real numbers, see _[Construction of the real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction\_of\_the\_real\_numbers "Construction of the real numbers")_.

Applications and connections
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Applications and connections")]

In the physical sciences most physical constants, such as the universal gravitational constant, and physical variables, such as position, mass, speed, and electric charge, are modeled using real numbers. In fact the fundamental physical theories such as [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), and the [standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_model "Standard model") are described using mathematical structures, typically [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifolds "Smooth manifolds") or [Hilbert spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_spaces "Hilbert spaces"), that are based on the real numbers, although actual measurements of physical quantities are of finite [accuracy and precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision "Accuracy and precision").

Physicists have occasionally suggested that a more fundamental theory would replace the real numbers with quantities that do not form a continuum, but such proposals remain speculative.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-24)

The real numbers are most often formalized using the [Zermelo–Fraenkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel "Zermelo–Fraenkel") axiomatization of set theory, but some mathematicians study the real numbers with other logical foundations of mathematics. In particular, the real numbers are also studied in [reverse mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics "Reverse mathematics") and in [constructive mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics) "Constructivism (mathematics)").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-25)

The [hyperreal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number "Hyperreal number") as developed by [Edwin Hewitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hewitt "Edwin Hewitt"), [Abraham Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Robinson "Abraham Robinson"), and others extend the set of the real numbers by introducing [infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") and infinite numbers, allowing for building [infinitesimal calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_calculus "Infinitesimal calculus") in a way closer to the original intuitions of [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz "Leibniz"), [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler "Euler"), [Cauchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy "Cauchy"), and others.

[Edward Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Nelson "Edward Nelson")'s [internal set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_set_theory "Internal set theory") enriches the [Zermelo–Fraenkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel "Zermelo–Fraenkel") set theory syntactically by introducing a unary predicate "standard". In this approach, infinitesimals are (non-"standard") elements of the set of the real numbers (rather than being elements of an extension thereof, as in Robinson's theory).

The [continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis "Continuum hypothesis") posits that the cardinality of the set of the real numbers is ![Image 121: {\displaystyle \aleph _{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/78c211ce8badf4ffbf9417ecceb0ef7ab0a8caed); i.e. the smallest infinite [cardinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number "Cardinal number") after ![Image 122: {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1), the cardinality of the integers. [Paul Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cohen_(mathematician) "Paul Cohen (mathematician)") proved in 1963 that it is an axiom independent of the other axioms of set theory; that is: one may choose either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as an axiom of set theory, without contradiction.

[Electronic calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator "Calculator") and [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers "Computers") cannot operate on arbitrary real numbers, because finite computers cannot directly store infinitely many digits or other infinite representations. Nor do they usually even operate on arbitrary [definable real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definable_real_number "Definable real number"), which are inconvenient to manipulate.

Instead, computers typically work with finite-precision approximations called [floating-point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_number "Floating-point number"), a representation similar to [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation "Scientific notation"). The achievable precision is limited by the [data storage space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage "Computer data storage") allocated for each number, whether as [fixed-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic "Fixed-point arithmetic"), floating-point, or [arbitrary-precision numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic "Arbitrary-precision arithmetic"), or some other representation. Most [scientific computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science "Computational science") uses [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number "Binary number") floating-point arithmetic, often a [64-bit representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format "Double-precision floating-point format") with around 16 decimal [digits of precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures "Significant figures"). Real numbers satisfy the [usual rules of arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)#Definition_and_illustration "Field (mathematics)"), but [floating-point numbers do not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Accuracy_problems "Floating-point arithmetic"). The field of [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis "Numerical analysis") studies the [stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_stability "Numerical stability") and [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision "Accuracy and precision") of numerical [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") implemented with approximate arithmetic.

Alternately, [computer algebra systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system "Computer algebra system") can operate on irrational quantities exactly by [manipulating symbolic formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_computation "Symbolic computation") for them (such as ![Image 123: {\textstyle {\sqrt {2}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e0f5c15c16a3fd0a131a84b96064b3f11ba697f1)![Image 124: {\textstyle \arctan 5,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/32036042a792282343ab9423598b7082e83ee3ef) or ![Image 125: {\textstyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{x}\,dx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5985a6f02db89ab30214ea284ff563b6956cb38b)) rather than their rational or decimal approximation.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-26) But exact and symbolic arithmetic also have limitations: for instance, they are computationally more expensive; it is not in general possible to determine whether two symbolic expressions are equal (the [constant problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_problem "Constant problem")); and arithmetic operations can cause [exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth "Exponential growth") explosion in the size of representation of a single number (for instance, squaring a rational number roughly doubles the number of digits in its numerator and denominator, and squaring a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") roughly doubles its number of terms), overwhelming finite computer storage.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-27)

A real number is called _[computable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable\_number "Computable number")_ if there exists an algorithm that yields its digits. Because there are only [countably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countably_infinite "Countably infinite") many algorithms,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#cite_note-28) but an uncountable number of reals, [almost all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_all "Almost all") real numbers fail to be computable. Moreover, the equality of two computable numbers is an [undecidable problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem "Undecidable problem"). Some [constructivists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics) "Constructivism (mathematics)") accept the existence of only those reals that are computable. The set of [definable numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definable_number "Definable number") is broader, but still only countable.

In [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory"), specifically [descriptive set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_set_theory "Descriptive set theory"), the [Baire space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baire_space_(set_theory) "Baire space (set theory)") is used as a surrogate for the real numbers since the latter have some topological properties (connectedness) that are a technical inconvenience. Elements of Baire space are referred to as "reals".

Vocabulary and notation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Vocabulary and notation")]

The [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of all real numbers is denoted ![Image 126: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) ([blackboard bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_bold "Blackboard bold")) or **R** (upright bold). As it is naturally endowed with the structure of a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), the expression _field of real numbers_ is frequently used when its algebraic properties are under consideration.

The notation ![Image 137: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) refers to the set of the [n-tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") of elements of ![Image 138: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) ([real coordinate space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space "Real coordinate space")), which can be identified to the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product") of n copies of ![Image 139: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dc9de9049e03e5e5a0cab57076dbe4a369c1e3a7) It is an n-[dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")[vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over the field of the real numbers, often called the [coordinate space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_space "Coordinate space") of dimension n; this space may be identified to the n-[dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")[Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") as soon as a [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") has been chosen in the latter. In this identification, a [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") of the Euclidean space is identified with the tuple of its [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates").

In mathematics _real_ is used as an adjective, meaning that the underlying field is the field of the real numbers (or _the real field_). For example, _real [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix\_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)")_, _real polynomial_ and _real [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie\_algebra "Lie algebra")_. The word is also used as a [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun"), meaning a real number (as in "the set of all reals").

Generalizations and extensions
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Generalizations and extensions")]

The real numbers can be generalized and extended in several different directions:

*   The [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") contain solutions to all polynomial equations and hence are an [algebraically closed field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_field "Algebraically closed field") unlike the real numbers. However, the complex numbers are not an ordered field.
*   The [affinely extended real number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinely_extended_real_number_system "Affinely extended real number system") adds two elements +∞ and −∞. It is a [compact space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space"). It is no longer a field, or even an additive group, but it still has a total order; moreover, it is a [complete lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_lattice "Complete lattice").
*   The [real projective line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_line "Real projective line") adds only one value ∞. It is also a compact space. Again, it is no longer a field, or even an additive group. However, it allows division of a nonzero element by zero. It has [cyclic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_order "Cyclic order") with topology described by [point-pair separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-pair_separation "Point-pair separation").
*   The [long real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_line_(topology) "Long line (topology)") pastes together ℵ 1* + ℵ 1 copies of the real line plus a single point (here ℵ 1* denotes the reversed ordering of ℵ 1) to create an ordered set that is "locally" identical to the real numbers, but somehow longer; for instance, there is an order-preserving embedding of ℵ 1 in the long real line but not in the real numbers. The long real line is the largest ordered set that is complete and locally Archimedean. As with the previous two examples, this set is no longer a field or additive group.
*   Ordered fields extending the reals are the [hyperreal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number "Hyperreal number") and the [surreal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number "Surreal number"); both of them contain [infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") and infinitely large numbers and are therefore [non-Archimedean ordered fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Archimedean_ordered_field "Non-Archimedean ordered field").
*   [Self-adjoint operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adjoint_operator "Self-adjoint operator") on a [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space") (for example, self-adjoint square complex [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)")) generalize the reals in many respects: they can be ordered (though not totally ordered), they are complete, all their [eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector "Eigenvector") are real and they form a real [associative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_algebra "Associative algebra"). [Positive-definite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite "Positive-definite") operators correspond to the positive reals and [normal operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_operator "Normal operator") correspond to the complex numbers.

*   [Completeness of the real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers "Completeness of the real numbers")
*   [Continued fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction "Continued fraction")
*   [Definable real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definable_real_number "Definable real number")
*   [Positive real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_real_numbers "Positive real numbers")
*   [Real analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis "Real analysis")
