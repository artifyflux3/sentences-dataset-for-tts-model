Staples High School in Westport, Connecticut , U.S.

A secondary school , high school , or senior school , is an institution that provides secondary education . Some secondary schools provide both lower secondary education (ages 11 to 14) and upper secondary education (ages 14 to 18), i.e., both levels 2 and 3 of the ISCED scale, but these can also be provided in separate schools. There may be other variations in the provision: for example, children in Australia , Hong Kong , and Spain change from the primary to secondary systems a year later at the age of 12, with the ISCED's first year of lower secondary being the last year of primary provision.

In the United States , most local secondary education systems have separate middle schools and high schools . Middle schools are usually from grades 6–8 or 7–8, and high schools are typically from grades 9–12. In the United Kingdom , most state schools and privately funded schools accommodate pupils between the ages of 11 and 16 or between 11 and 18; some UK private schools, i.e.

public schools , admit pupils between the ages of 13 and 18.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Secondary schools follow on from primary schools and prepare for vocational or tertiary education . In high and middle income countries, attendance is usually compulsory for students at least until age 16. The organisations, buildings, and terminology are more or less unique in each country.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Levels of education [ edit ] In the ISCED 2014 education scale, [ 6 ] levels 2 and 3 correspond to secondary education which are as follows: Lower secondary education First stage of secondary education building on primary education, typically with a more subject-oriented curriculum. Students are generally around 11–15 years old.

[ 6 ] Upper secondary education Second stage of secondary education and final stage of formal education for students typically aged 15–18, preparing for tertiary/adult education or providing skills relevant to employment, usually with an increased range of subject options and streams.

[ 6 ] Terminology [ edit ] Within the English-speaking world, there are three widely used systems to describe the age of the child. The first is the "equivalent ages"; then countries that base their education systems on the "English model" use one of two methods to identify the year group, while countries that base their systems on the "American K–12 model" refer to their year groups as "grades". The Irish model is structured similarly to the English model, but differs significantly in terms of labels. This terminology extends into the research literature. Below is a comparison of some countries: Secondary cohorts Location Terminology Equivalent age 11–12 12–13 13–14 14–15 15–16 16–17 17–18 Australia [ 7 ] Year [ a ] 7 8 9 10 11 12 Grouping Junior high school Senior high school Hong Kong [ 8 ] Secondary/form 1 2 3 4 5 6 Grouping Junior secondary Senior secondary Indonesia Grade 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Nickname SD Kelas 6 SMP Kelas 7 SMP Kelas 8 SMP Kelas 9 SMA Kelas 10 SMA Kelas 11 SMA Kelas 12 Ireland [ 9 ] Other name Junior Cycle Senior Cycle Class & year 6th Class 1st Year 2nd Year 3rd Year 4th Year 5th Year 6th Year Jamaica Form First Second Third Fourth Fifth Lower Sixth (6B) Upper Sixth (6A) Year 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Grouping Lower School Upper School Sixth Form Programme Japan Grade [ a ] 1 2 3 1 2 3 Grouping Junior high school Senior high school United Kingdom England / Wales Form First Second Third Fourth Fifth Lower Sixth Upper Sixth Year 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Scotland S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 Northern Ireland 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 United States [ 10 ] Grade 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Nickname Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior Grouping Middle School High School Spain [ 11 ] Grade [ a ] 1 2 3 4 1 2 Grouping ESO (Mandatory Secondary Education) Bachillerato ISCED level [ 12 ] 2 3 Legal framework [ edit ] Schools exist within a strict legal framework where they may be answerable to their government through local authorities and their stakeholders. In England there are six general types of state-funded schools running in parallel to the private sector. The state takes an interest in safeguarding issues in all schools. All state-funded schools in England are legally required to have a website where they must publish details of their governance, finance, curriculum intent and staff and pupil protection policies to comply with The School Information (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2012 and 2016 .

Ofsted monitors these.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Theoretical framework [ edit ] School building design does not happen in isolation. The building or school campus needs to accommodate: Curriculum content Teaching methods Costs Education within the political framework Use of school building (also in the community setting) Constraints imposed by the site Design philosophy Each country will have  a different education system and priorities.

[ 15 ] Schools need to accommodate students, staff, storage, mechanical and electrical systems, support staff, ancillary staff, and administration. The number of rooms required can be determined from the predicted roll of the school and the area needed.

According to standards used in the United Kingdom, a general classroom for 30 students needs to be 55 m 2 , or more generously 62 m 2 . A general art room for 30 students needs to be 83 m 2 , but 104 m 2 for 3D textile work. A drama studio or a specialist science laboratory for 30 needs to be 90 m 2 . Examples are given on how this can be configured for a 1,200 place secondary (practical specialism).

[ 16 ] and 1,850 place secondary school.

[ 17 ] Size [ edit ] The ideal size for a typical comprehensive high school is large enough to offer a variety of classes, but small enough that students develop a sense of community.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Some research has suggested that academic achievement is best when there are about 150 to 250 students in each grade level, and that above a total school size of 2,000 for a secondary school, academic achievement and the sense of school community decline substantially.

[ 18 ] Arguments in favor of smaller schools include having a shared experience of school (e.g., everyone takes the same classes, because the school is too small to offer alternatives), higher average academic achievement, and lower educational inequality .

[ 20 ] Arguments in favor of larger schools tend to focus on economy of scale .

[ 20 ] For example, a single basketball court could serve a school with 200 students just as well as a school with 500 students, so construction and maintenance costs, on a per-student basis, can be lower for larger schools.  However, cost savings from larger schools have generally not materialized, as larger schools require more administrative support staff, and rural areas see the potential savings offset by increased transportation costs.

[ 20 ] Larger schools can also support more specialization, such as splitting students into advanced, average, and basic tracks , offering a greater variety of classes, or sponsoring a greater number of extra-curricular activities .

[ 20 ] (Some of these benefits can also be achieved through smaller but specialized schools, such as a dedicated special school for students with disabilities or a magnet school for students with a particular subject-matter interest.) In terms of structure, organization, and relationships, larger schools tend to be more hierarchical and bureaucratic , with fewer and weaker personal connections and more rigidly defined, unvarying roles for all staff.

[ 20 ] Teachers find that large schools result in more information to process in the larger environment (e.g., announcements about 100 programs instead of just 10) and that as individuals they form fewer relationships with teachers outside of their primary subject area.

[ 20 ] Smaller schools have less social isolation and more engagement.

[ 20 ] These effects cannot be entirely overcome through implementation of a house system or " school within a school " programs.

[ 20 ] Building design specifications [ edit ] The building providing the education has to fulfill the needs of: students, teachers, non-teaching support staff, administrators, and the community. It has to meet general government building guidelines, health requirements, minimal functional requirements for classrooms, toilets and showers, electricity and services, preparation and storage of textbooks, and basic teaching aids.

[ 21 ] An optimum secondary school will meet the minimum conditions and will have: adequately-sized classrooms; specialized teaching spaces; a staff preparation room; an administration block; multipurpose classrooms; a general purpose school hall; laboratories for science, technology, mathematics, and life sciences, as may be required; adequate equipment; a library or library stocks that are regularly renewed; and computer rooms or media centres.

[ 21 ] A secondary school may have a canteen , serving a set of foods to students, and storage where the equipment of a school is kept.

Government accountants having read the advice then publish minimum guidelines on schools. These enable environmental modelling and establishing building costs. Future design plans are audited to ensure that these standards are met but not exceeded. Government ministries continue to press for the "minimum" space and cost standards to be reduced.

[ citation needed ] The UK government published this downwardly revised space formula in 2014. It said the floor area should be 1050 m 2 (+ 350 m 2 if there is a sixth form) + 6.3 m 2 /pupil place for 11- to 15-year-olds + 7 m 2 /pupil place for students above 16 years old. The external finishes were to be downgraded to meet a build cost of £1113/m 2 .

[ 22 ] By country [ edit ] For a more comprehensive list, see List of secondary education systems by country .

A secondary school locally may be called a high school (abbreviated as HS or H.S.

), or called a senior high school . In some countries there are two phases to secondary education (ISCED 2) and (ISCED 3). The junior high school , intermediate school, lower secondary school, or middle school occurs between the primary school (ISCED 1) and high school.
