( September 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The questionable cause —also known as causal fallacy , false cause , or non causa pro causa ("non-cause for cause" in Latin )—is a category of informal fallacies in which the cause or causes is/are incorrectly identified. In other words, it is a fallacy of reaching a conclusion that one thing caused another, simply because they are regularly associated.

Questionable cause can be logically reduced to: "A is regularly associated with B; therefore, A causes B." [ 1 ] For example: "Every time I score an A on the test its a sunny day. Therefore the sunny day causes me to score well on the test." Here is the example the two events may coincide or correlate, but have no causal connection.

[ 2 ] Fallacies of questionable cause include: Circular cause and consequence [ citation needed ] Correlation implies causation ( cum hoc, ergo propter hoc ) Third-cause fallacy Wrong direction Fallacy of the single cause Post hoc ergo propter hoc Observational interpretation fallacy Regression fallacy Texas sharpshooter fallacy Jumping to conclusions Association fallacy Magical thinking References [ edit ] ^ "Questionable Cause" .
