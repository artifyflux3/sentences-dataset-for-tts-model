A set-valued function that is both upper and lower hemicontinuous is said to be continuous in an analogy to the property of the same name for single-valued functions.

To explain both notions, consider a sequence a of points in a domain, and a sequence b of points in the range. We say that b corresponds to a if each point in b is contained in the image of the corresponding point in a .

Upper hemicontinuity requires that, for any convergent sequence a in a domain, and for any convergent sequence b that corresponds to a , the image of the limit of a contains the limit of b .

Lower hemicontinuity requires that, for any convergent sequence a in a domain, and for any point x in the image of the limit of a , there exists a sequence b that corresponds to a subsequence of a , that converges to x .

Examples [ edit ] This set-valued function is upper hemicontinuous everywhere, but not lower hemicontinuous at x {\displaystyle x} : for a sequence of points ( x m ) {\displaystyle \left(x_{m}\right)} that converges to x , {\displaystyle x,} we have a y {\displaystyle y} ( y ∈ ∈ f ( x ) {\displaystyle y\in f(x)} ) such that no sequence of ( y m ) {\displaystyle \left(y_{m}\right)} converges to y {\displaystyle y} where each y m {\displaystyle y_{m}} is in f ( x m ) .

{\displaystyle f\left(x_{m}\right).} This set-valued function is lower hemicontinuous everywhere, but not upper hemicontinuous at x , {\displaystyle x,} because the graph (set) is not closed.

The image on the right shows a function that is not lower hemicontinuous at x . To see this, let a be a sequence that converges to x from the left. The image of x is a vertical line that contains some point ( x , y ). But every sequence b that corresponds to a is contained in the bottom horizontal line, so it cannot converge to y . In contrast, the function is upper hemicontinuous everywhere. For example, considering any sequence a that converges to x from the left or from the right, and any corresponding sequence b , the limit of b is contained in the vertical line that is the image of the limit of a .

The image on the left shows a function that is not upper hemicontinuous at x . To see this, let a be a sequence that converges to x from the right. The image of a contains vertical lines, so there exists a corresponding sequence b in which all elements are bounded away from f ( x ). The image of the limit of a contains a single point f ( x ), so it does not contain the limit of b . In contrast, that function is lower hemicontinuous everywhere.  For example, for any sequence a that converges to x , from the left or from the right, f ( x ) contains a single point, and there exists a corresponding sequence b that converges to f ( x ).

Definitions [ edit ] Upper hemicontinuity [ edit ] A set-valued function Γ Γ : A ⇉ ⇉ B {\displaystyle \Gamma :A\rightrightarrows B} is said to be upper hemicontinuous at a point a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle a\in A} if, for every open V ⊂ ⊂ B {\displaystyle V\subset B} with Γ Γ ( a ) ⊂ ⊂ V , {\displaystyle \Gamma (a)\subset V,} there exists a neighbourhood U {\displaystyle U} of a {\displaystyle a} such that for all x ∈ ∈ U , {\displaystyle x\in U,} Γ Γ ( x ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (x)} is a subset of V .

{\displaystyle V.} Lower hemicontinuity [ edit ] A set-valued function Γ Γ : A ⇉ ⇉ B {\displaystyle \Gamma :A\rightrightarrows B} is said to be lower hemicontinuous at the point a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle a\in A} if for every open set V {\displaystyle V} intersecting Γ Γ ( a ) , {\displaystyle \Gamma (a),} there exists a neighbourhood U {\displaystyle U} of a {\displaystyle a} such that Γ Γ ( x ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (x)} intersects V {\displaystyle V} for all x ∈ ∈ U .

{\displaystyle x\in U.} (Here V {\displaystyle V} intersects S {\displaystyle S} means nonempty intersection V ∩ ∩ S ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle V\cap S\neq \varnothing } ).

Continuity [ edit ] If a set-valued function is both upper hemicontinuous and lower hemicontinuous, it is said to be continuous.

Properties [ edit ] Upper hemicontinuity [ edit ] Sequential characterization [ edit ] Theorem — For a set-valued function Γ Γ : A ⇉ ⇉ B {\displaystyle \Gamma :A\rightrightarrows B} with closed values, if Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is upper hemicontinuous at a ∈ ∈ A , {\displaystyle a\in A,} then for every sequence a ∙ ∙ = ( a m ) m = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle a_{\bullet }=\left(a_{m}\right)_{m=1}^{\infty }} in A {\displaystyle A} and every sequence ( b m ) m = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(b_{m}\right)_{m=1}^{\infty }} such that b m ∈ ∈ Γ Γ ( a m ) , {\displaystyle b_{m}\in \Gamma \left(a_{m}\right),} if lim m → → ∞ ∞ a m = a {\displaystyle \lim _{m\to \infty }a_{m}=a} and lim m → → ∞ ∞ b m = b {\displaystyle \lim _{m\to \infty }b_{m}=b} then b ∈ ∈ Γ Γ ( a ) .

{\displaystyle b\in \Gamma (a).} If B {\displaystyle B} is compact, then the converse is also true.

As an example, look at the image at the right, and consider sequence a in the domain that converges to x (either from the left or from the right). Then, any sequence b that satisfies the requirements converges to some point in f ( x ).

Closed graph theorem [ edit ] The graph of a set-valued function Γ Γ : A ⇉ ⇉ B {\displaystyle \Gamma :A\rightrightarrows B} is the set defined by G r ( Γ Γ ) = { ( a , b ) ∈ ∈ A × × B : b ∈ ∈ Γ Γ ( a ) } .

{\displaystyle Gr(\Gamma )=\{(a,b)\in A\times B:b\in \Gamma (a)\}.} The domain of Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is the set of all a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle a\in A} such that Γ Γ ( a ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (a)} is not empty.

Theorem — If Γ Γ : A ⇉ ⇉ B {\displaystyle \Gamma :A\rightrightarrows B} is an upper hemicontinuous set-valued function with closed domain (that is, the domain of Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is closed) and closed values (i.e.

Γ Γ ( a ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (a)} is closed for all a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle a\in A} ), then Gr ⁡ ⁡ ( Γ Γ ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Gr} (\Gamma )} is closed.

If B {\displaystyle B} is compact, then the converse is also true.

[ 1 ] Lower hemicontinuity [ edit ] Sequential characterization [ edit ] Theorem — Γ Γ : A ⇉ ⇉ B {\displaystyle \Gamma :A\rightrightarrows B} is lower hemicontinuous at a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle a\in A} if and only if for every sequence a ∙ ∙ = ( a m ) m = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle a_{\bullet }=\left(a_{m}\right)_{m=1}^{\infty }} in A {\displaystyle A} such that a ∙ ∙ → → a {\displaystyle a_{\bullet }\to a} in A {\displaystyle A} and all b ∈ ∈ Γ Γ ( a ) , {\displaystyle b\in \Gamma (a),} there exists a subsequence ( a m k ) k = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(a_{m_{k}}\right)_{k=1}^{\infty }} of a ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle a_{\bullet }} and also a sequence b ∙ ∙ = ( b k ) k = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle b_{\bullet }=\left(b_{k}\right)_{k=1}^{\infty }} such that b ∙ ∙ → → b {\displaystyle b_{\bullet }\to b} and b k ∈ ∈ Γ Γ ( a m k ) {\displaystyle b_{k}\in \Gamma \left(a_{m_{k}}\right)} for every k .

{\displaystyle k.} Open graph theorem [ edit ] A set-valued function Γ Γ : A → → B {\displaystyle \Gamma :A\to B} is said to have open lower sections if the set Γ Γ − − 1 ( b ) = { a ∈ ∈ A : b ∈ ∈ Γ Γ ( a ) } {\displaystyle \Gamma ^{-1}(b)=\{a\in A:b\in \Gamma (a)\}} is open in A {\displaystyle A} for every b ∈ ∈ B .

{\displaystyle b\in B.} If Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } values are all open sets in B , {\displaystyle B,} then Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is said to have open upper sections .

If Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } has an open graph Gr ⁡ ⁡ ( Γ Γ ) , {\displaystyle \operatorname {Gr} (\Gamma ),} then Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } has open upper and lower sections and if Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } has open lower sections then it is lower hemicontinuous.

[ 2 ] Open Graph Theorem — If Γ Γ : A → → P ( R n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma :A\to P\left(\mathbb {R} ^{n}\right)} is a set-valued function with convex values and open upper sections, then Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } has an open graph in A × × R n {\displaystyle A\times \mathbb {R} ^{n}} if and only if Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is lower hemicontinuous.

[ 2 ] Operations Preserving Hemicontinuity [ edit ] Set-theoretic, algebraic and topological operations on set-valued functions (like union, composition, sum, convex hull, closure) usually preserve the type of continuity. But this should be taken with appropriate care since, for example, there exists a pair of lower hemicontinuous set-valued functions whose intersection is not lower hemicontinuous. 
This can be fixed upon strengthening continuity properties: if one of those lower hemicontinuous multifunctions has open graph then their intersection is again lower hemicontinuous.

Function Selections [ edit ] Crucial to set-valued analysis (in view of applications) are the investigation of single-valued selections and approximations to set-valued functions. 
Typically lower hemicontinuous set-valued functions admit single-valued selections ( Michael selection theorem , Bressan–Colombo directionally continuous selection theorem, Fryszkowski decomposable map selection). 
Likewise, upper hemicontinuous maps admit approximations (e.g. Ancel–Granas–Górniewicz–Kryszewski theorem).

Other concepts of continuity [ edit ] The upper and lower hemicontinuity might be viewed as usual continuity: Theorem — A set-valued map Γ Γ : A → → B {\displaystyle \Gamma :A\to B} is lower [resp. upper] hemicontinuous if and only if the mapping Γ Γ : A → → P ( B ) {\displaystyle \Gamma :A\to P(B)} is continuous where the hyperspace P(B) has been endowed with the lower [resp. upper] Vietoris topology .

(For the notion of hyperspace compare also power set and function space ).

Using lower and upper Hausdorff uniformity we can also define the so-called upper and lower semicontinuous maps in the sense of Hausdorff (also known as metrically lower / upper semicontinuous maps ).
