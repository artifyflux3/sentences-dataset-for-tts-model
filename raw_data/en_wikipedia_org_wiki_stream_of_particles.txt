Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

Find sources: "Particle beam" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( November 2008 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A particle beam is a stream of charged or neutral particles other than photons . In particle accelerators , these particles can move with a velocity close to the speed of light .

[ 1 ] There is a difference between the creation and control of charged particle beams and neutral particle beams, as only the first type can be manipulated to a sufficient extent by devices based on electromagnetism . The manipulation and diagnostics of charged particle beams at high kinetic energies using particle accelerators are main topics of accelerator physics .

Sources [ edit ] Charged particles such as electrons , positrons , and protons may be separated from their common surroundings. This can be accomplished by processes such as thermionic emission or arc discharge . The following devices are commonly used as sources for particle beams: Ion source Cathode-ray tube , or more specifically in one of its parts called electron gun . This is also part of traditional television and computer screens.

Photocathodes may also be built in as a part of an electron gun , using the photoelectric effect to separate particles from their substrate.

[ 2 ] Neutron beams may be created by energetic proton beams which impact on a target, e.g. of beryllium material. (see article Particle therapy ) Bursting a petawatt laser onto a titanium foil to produce a proton beam.

[ 3 ] Manipulation [ edit ] Acceleration [ edit ] See also: Accelerator physics and Superconducting radio frequency Charged beams may be further accelerated by use of high resonant, sometimes also superconducting , microwave cavities . These devices accelerate particles by interaction with an electromagnetic field . Since the wavelength of hollow macroscopic, conducting devices is in the radio frequency (RF) band, the design of such cavities and other RF devices is also a part of accelerator physics.

More recently, plasma acceleration has emerged as a possibility to accelerate particles in a plasma medium, using the electromagnetic energy of pulsed high-power laser systems or the kinetic energy of other charged particles. This technique is under active development, but cannot provide reliable beams of sufficient quality at present.

Guidance [ edit ] In all cases, the beam is steered with dipole magnets and focused with quadrupole magnets . With the end goal of reaching the desired position and beam spot size in the experiment.

Applications [ edit ] High-energy physics [ edit ] See also: Particle collider and Large Hadron Collider High-energy particle beams are used for particle physics experiments in large facilities; the most common examples being the Large Hadron Collider and the Tevatron .

Synchrotron radiation [ edit ] Main articles: Synchrotron light source and Synchrotron radiation Electron beams are employed in synchrotron light sources to produce X-ray radiation with a continuous spectrum over a wide frequency band which is called synchrotron radiation . This X-ray radiation is used at beamlines of the synchrotron light sources for a variety of spectroscopies ( XAS , XANES , EXAFS , μ -XRF , μ -XRD ) in order to probe and to characterize the structure and the chemical speciation of solids and biological materials.

Particle therapy [ edit ] Main article: Particle therapy Energetic particle beams consisting of protons , neutrons , or positive ions (also called particle microbeams ) may also be used for cancer treatment in particle therapy.

Linear accelerators use electron beam at near speed of light to treat deep cancers in patients. A tungsten/molybdenum target can be moved into the beam to create x-rays to treat surface cancers.

Astrophysics and space physics [ edit ] Many phenomena in astrophysics are attributed to particle beams of various kinds.

[ 4 ] Solar Type III radio bursts, the most common impulsive radio signatures from the Sun, are used by scientists as a tool to better understand solar accelerated electron beams.

[ 5 ] Additionally, particle beams cause instabilities when interacting with plasma, which may lead to conditions causing electrostatic solitary waves .

[ 6 ] Military [ edit ] The U.S.

Advanced Research Projects Agency started work on particle beam weapons in 1958.

[ 7 ] The general idea of such weaponry is to hit a target object with a stream of accelerated particles with high kinetic energy , which is then transferred to the atoms, or molecules, of the target. The power needed to project a high-powered beam of this kind surpasses the production capabilities of any standard battlefield powerplant, [ 7 ] thus such weapons are not anticipated to be produced in the foreseeable future.
