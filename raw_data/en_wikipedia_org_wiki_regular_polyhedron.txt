A **regular polyhedron** is a [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") with [regular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") and [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)") polygons as [faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry) "Face (geometry)"). Its [symmetry group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_group "Symmetry group") acts [transitively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_group_action "Transitive group action") on its [flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_(geometry) "Flag (geometry)"). A regular polyhedron is highly symmetrical, being all of [edge-transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge-transitive "Edge-transitive"), [vertex-transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex-transitive "Vertex-transitive") and [face-transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-transitive "Face-transitive"). In classical contexts, many different equivalent definitions are used; a common one is that the faces are [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)") regular polygons which are assembled in the same way around each [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)").

A regular polyhedron is identified by its [Schläfli symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol "Schläfli symbol") of the form {_n_, _m_}, where _n_ is the number of sides of each face and _m_ the number of faces meeting at each vertex. There are 5 finite convex regular polyhedra (the [Platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid "Platonic solid")), and four regular [star polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_polyhedra "Star polyhedra") (the [Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%E2%80%93Poinsot_polyhedra "Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra")), making nine regular polyhedra in all. In addition, there are five regular compounds of the regular polyhedra.

### Equivalent properties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Equivalent properties")]

The property of having a similar arrangement of faces around each vertex can be replaced by any of the following equivalent conditions in the definition:

*   The vertices of a convex regular polyhedron all lie on a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere").
*   All the [dihedral angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_angle "Dihedral angle") of the polyhedron are equal
*   All the [vertex figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_figure "Vertex figure") of the polyhedron are [regular polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon").
*   All the [solid angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle "Solid angle") of the polyhedron are congruent.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-1)

A convex regular polyhedron has all of three related spheres (other polyhedra lack at least one kind) which share its centre:

*   An [insphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insphere "Insphere"), tangent to all faces.
*   An intersphere or [midsphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsphere "Midsphere"), tangent to all edges.
*   A [circumsphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumsphere "Circumsphere"), tangent to all vertices.

The regular polyhedra are the most [symmetrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") of all the polyhedra. They lie in just three [symmetry groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_group "Symmetry group"), which are named after the Platonic solids:

*   Tetrahedral
*   Octahedral (or cubic)
*   Icosahedral (or dodecahedral)

Any shapes with icosahedral or octahedral symmetry will also contain tetrahedral symmetry.

### Euler characteristic

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Euler characteristic")]

The five Platonic solids have an [Euler characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic "Euler characteristic") of 2. This simply reflects that the surface is a topological 2-sphere, and so is also true, for example, of any polyhedron which is star-shaped with respect to some interior point.

The sum of the distances from any point in the interior of a regular polyhedron to the sides is independent of the location of the point (this is an extension of [Viviani's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viviani%27s_theorem "Viviani's theorem").) However, the converse does not hold, not even for [tetrahedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedra "Tetrahedra").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-2)

Duality of the regular polyhedra
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Duality of the regular polyhedra")]

In a [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_polyhedron "Dual polyhedron") pair of polyhedra, the vertices of one polyhedron correspond to the faces of the other, and vice versa.

The regular polyhedra show this duality as follows:

*   The [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron "Tetrahedron") is self-dual, i.e. it pairs with itself.
*   The [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube") and [octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron "Octahedron") are dual to each other.
*   The [icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_icosahedron "Regular icosahedron") and [dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron "Dodecahedron") are dual to each other.
*   The [small stellated dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_stellated_dodecahedron "Small stellated dodecahedron") and [great dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_dodecahedron "Great dodecahedron") are dual to each other.
*   The [great stellated dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_stellated_dodecahedron "Great stellated dodecahedron") and [great icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_icosahedron "Great icosahedron") are dual to each other.

The Schläfli symbol of the dual is just the original written backwards, for example the dual of {5, 3} is {3, 5}.

Stones carved in shapes resembling clusters of spheres or knobs have been found in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland "Scotland") and may be as much as 4,000 years old. Some of these stones show not only the symmetries of the five Platonic solids, but also some of the relations of duality amongst them (that is, that the centres of the faces of the cube gives the vertices of an octahedron). Examples of these stones are on display in the John Evans room of the [Ashmolean Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashmolean_Museum "Ashmolean Museum") at [Oxford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University "Oxford University"). Why these objects were made, or how their creators gained the inspiration for them, is a mystery. There is doubt regarding the mathematical interpretation of these objects, as many have non-platonic forms, and perhaps only one has been found to be a true icosahedron, as opposed to a reinterpretation of the icosahedron dual, the dodecahedron.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-3)

It is also possible that the [Etruscans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_civilization "Etruscan civilization") preceded the Greeks in their awareness of at least some of the regular polyhedra, as evidenced by the discovery near [Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padua "Padua") (in Northern [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy")) in the late 19th century of a [dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron "Dodecahedron") made of [soapstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soapstone "Soapstone"), and dating back more than 2,500 years (Lindemann, 1987).

The earliest known _written_ records of the regular convex solids originated from Classical Greece. When these solids were all discovered and by whom is not known, but [Theaetetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theaetetus_(mathematician) "Theaetetus (mathematician)") (an [Athenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens")) was the first to give a mathematical description of all five (Van der Waerden, 1954), (Euclid, book XIII). [H.S.M. Coxeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.S.M._Coxeter "H.S.M. Coxeter") (Coxeter, 1948, Section 1.9) credits [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") (400 BC) with having made models of them, and mentions that one of the earlier [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreans "Pythagoreans"), [Timaeus of Locri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_of_Locri "Timaeus of Locri"), used all five in a correspondence between the polyhedra and the nature of the universe as it was then perceived – this correspondence is recorded in Plato's dialogue [_Timaeus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(dialogue) "Timaeus (dialogue)"). Euclid's reference to Plato led to their common description as the _Platonic solids_.

One might characterise the Greek definition as follows:

*   A regular polygon is a ([convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon "Convex polygon")) planar figure with all edges equal and all corners equal.
*   A regular polyhedron is a solid (convex) figure with all faces being congruent regular polygons, the same number arranged all alike around each vertex.

This definition rules out, for example, the [square pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_pyramid "Square pyramid") (since although all the faces are regular, the square base is not congruent to the triangular sides), or the shape formed by joining two tetrahedra together (since although all faces of that [triangular bipyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_bipyramid "Triangular bipyramid") would be equilateral triangles, that is, congruent and regular, some vertices have 3 triangles and others have 4).

This concept of a regular polyhedron would remain unchallenged for almost 2000 years.

### Regular star polyhedra

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Regular star polyhedra")]

Regular star polygons such as the [pentagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram "Pentagram") (star pentagon) were also known to the ancient Greeks – the [pentagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram "Pentagram") was used by the [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreans "Pythagoreans") as their secret sign, but they did not use them to construct polyhedra. It was not until the early 17th century that [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") realised that pentagrams could be used as the faces of regular [star polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_polyhedron "Star polyhedron"). Some of these star polyhedra may have been discovered by others before Kepler's time, but Kepler was the first to recognise that they could be considered "regular" if one removed the restriction that regular polyhedra be convex. Two hundred years later [Louis Poinsot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Poinsot "Louis Poinsot") also allowed star [vertex figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_figure "Vertex figure") (circuits around each corner), enabling him to discover two new regular star polyhedra along with rediscovering Kepler's. These four are the only regular star polyhedra, and have come to be known as the [Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%E2%80%93Poinsot_polyhedra "Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra"). It was not until the mid-19th century, several decades after Poinsot published, that Cayley gave them their modern English names: (Kepler's) [small stellated dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_stellated_dodecahedron "Small stellated dodecahedron") and [great stellated dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_stellated_dodecahedron "Great stellated dodecahedron"), and (Poinsot's) [great icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_icosahedron "Great icosahedron") and [great dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_dodecahedron "Great dodecahedron").

The Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra may be constructed from the Platonic solids by a process called [stellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellation "Stellation"). The reciprocal process to stellation is called [facetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facetting "Facetting") (or faceting). Every stellation of one polyhedron is [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_polyhedron "Dual polyhedron"), or reciprocal, to some facetting of the dual polyhedron. The regular star polyhedra can also be obtained by facetting the Platonic solids. This was first done by Bertrand around the same time that Cayley named them.

By the end of the 19th century there were therefore nine regular polyhedra – five convex and four star.

Regular polyhedra in nature
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Regular polyhedra in nature")]

Each of the Platonic solids occurs naturally in one form or another.

The tetrahedron, cube, and octahedron all occur as [crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal"). These by no means exhaust the numbers of possible forms of crystals (Smith, 1982, p212), of which there are 48. Neither the [regular icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_icosahedron "Regular icosahedron") nor the [regular dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_dodecahedron "Regular dodecahedron") are amongst them, but crystals can have the shape of a [pyritohedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyritohedron "Pyritohedron"), which is visually almost indistinguishable from a regular dodecahedron. Truly icosahedral crystals may be formed by [quasicrystalline materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal "Quasicrystal") which are very rare in nature but can be produced in a laboratory.

A more recent discovery is of a series of new types of [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon") molecule, known as the [fullerenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerene "Fullerene") (see Curl, 1991). Although C 60, the most easily produced fullerene, looks more or less spherical, some of the larger varieties (such as C 240, C 480 and C 960) are hypothesised to take on the form of slightly rounded icosahedra, a few nanometres across.

Regular polyhedra appear in biology as well. The [coccolithophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccolithophore "Coccolithophore")_[Braarudosphaera bigelowii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braarudosphaera\_bigelowii "Braarudosphaera bigelowii")_ has a regular dodecahedral structure, about 10 [micrometres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre "Micrometre") across.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-Hagino2013-4) In the early 20th century, [Ernst Haeckel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel "Ernst Haeckel") described a number of species of [radiolarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolarians "Radiolarians"), some of whose shells are shaped like various regular polyhedra.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-Haeckel1904-5) Examples include _Circoporus octahedrus_, _Circogonia icosahedra_, _Lithocubus geometricus_ and _Circorrhegma dodecahedra_; the shapes of these creatures are indicated by their names.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-Haeckel1904-5) The outer protein shells of many [viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus "Virus") form regular polyhedra. For example, [HIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV "HIV") is enclosed in a regular icosahedron, as is the head of a typical [myovirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myovirus "Myovirus").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-7)

The [radiolarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolarian "Radiolarian")_[Circogonia icosahedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circoporidae "Circoporidae")_ has a regular icosahedral structure 
*   [![Image 17: A myovirus typically has a regular icosahedral capsid (head) about 100 nanometers across.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Structure_of_a_Myoviridae_bacteriophage_2.jpg/349px-Structure_of_a_Myoviridae_bacteriophage_2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Structure_of_a_Myoviridae_bacteriophage_2.jpg "A myovirus typically has a regular icosahedral capsid (head) about 100 nanometers across.")

A [myovirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myovirus "Myovirus") typically has a regular icosahedral [capsid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid "Capsid") (head) about 100 [nanometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometer "Nanometer") across. 

In ancient times the [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism "Pythagoreanism") believed that there was a harmony between the regular polyhedra and the orbits of the [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"). In the 17th century, [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") studied data on planetary motion compiled by [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe") and for a decade tried to establish the Pythagorean ideal by finding a match between the sizes of the polyhedra and the sizes of the planets' orbits. His search failed in its original objective, but out of this research came Kepler's discoveries of the Kepler solids as regular polytopes, the realisation that the orbits of planets are not circles, and [the laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion") for which he is now famous. In Kepler's time only five planets (excluding the earth) were known, nicely matching the number of Platonic solids. Kepler's work, and the discovery since that time of [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus "Uranus") and [Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune "Neptune"), have invalidated the Pythagorean idea.

Around the same time as the Pythagoreans, Plato described a theory of matter in which the five elements (earth, air, fire, water and spirit) each comprised tiny copies of one of the five regular solids. Matter was built up from a mixture of these polyhedra, with each substance having different proportions in the mix. Two thousand years later [Dalton's atomic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton%27s_atomic_theory "Dalton's atomic theory") would show this idea to be along the right lines, though not related directly to the regular solids.

Further generalisations
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Further generalisations")]

The 20th century saw a succession of generalisations of the idea of a regular polyhedron, leading to several new classes.

### Regular skew apeirohedra

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Regular skew apeirohedra")]

In the first decades, Coxeter and Petrie allowed "saddle" vertices with alternating ridges and valleys, enabling them to construct three infinite folded surfaces which they called [regular skew polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_skew_polyhedron "Regular skew polyhedron").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-8) Coxeter offered a modified [Schläfli symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol "Schläfli symbol") {l,m|n} for these figures, with {l,m} implying the [vertex figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_figure "Vertex figure"), with _m_ regular _l_-gons around a vertex. The _n_ defines _n_-gonal _holes_. Their vertex figures are [regular skew polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_skew_polygon "Regular skew polygon"), vertices zig-zagging between two planes.

### Regular skew polyhedra

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Regular skew polyhedra")]

Finite regular skew polyhedra exist in 4-space. These finite regular skew polyhedra in 4-space can be seen as a subset of the faces of [uniform 4-polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_4-polytope "Uniform 4-polytope"). They have planar [regular polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") faces, but [regular skew polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_skew_polygon "Regular skew polygon")[vertex figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_figure "Vertex figure").

Two dual solutions are related to the [5-cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-cell "5-cell"), two dual solutions are related to the [24-cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-cell "24-cell"), and an infinite set of self-dual [duoprisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duoprism "Duoprism") generate regular skew polyhedra as {4, 4 | n}. In the infinite limit these approach a [duocylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duocylinder "Duocylinder") and look like a [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus") in their [stereographic projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection "Stereographic projection") into 3-space.

### Regular polyhedra in non-Euclidean and other spaces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Regular polyhedra in non-Euclidean and other spaces")]

Studies of [non-Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean "Non-Euclidean") ([hyperbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space "Hyperbolic space") and [elliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_space "Elliptic space")) and other spaces such as [complex spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_affine_space "Complex affine space"), discovered over the preceding century, led to the discovery of more new polyhedra such as [complex polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_polytope "Complex polytope") which could only take regular geometric form in those spaces.

#### Regular polyhedra in hyperbolic space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Regular polyhedra in hyperbolic space")]

[![Image 26](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/633_honeycomb_one_cell_horosphere.png/250px-633_honeycomb_one_cell_horosphere.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:633_honeycomb_one_cell_horosphere.png)

The [hexagonal tiling honeycomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_tiling_honeycomb "Hexagonal tiling honeycomb"), {6,3,3}, has [hexagonal tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_tiling "Hexagonal tiling"), {6,3}, facets with vertices on a [horosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horosphere "Horosphere"). One such facet is shown in as seen in this [Poincaré disk model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model "Poincaré disk model").

In H 3[hyperbolic space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space "Hyperbolic space"), [paracompact regular honeycombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracompact_regular_honeycomb "Paracompact regular honeycomb") have Euclidean tiling [facets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facet_(geometry) "Facet (geometry)") and [vertex figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_figure "Vertex figure") that act like finite polyhedra. Such tilings have an [angle defect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_defect "Angle defect") that can be closed by bending one way or the other. If the tiling is properly scaled, it will _close_ as an [asymptotic limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote "Asymptote") at a single [ideal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_point "Ideal point"). These Euclidean tilings are inscribed in a [horosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horosphere "Horosphere") just as polyhedra are inscribed in a sphere (which contains zero ideal points). The sequence extends when hyperbolic tilings are themselves used as facets of noncompact hyperbolic tessellations, as in the [heptagonal tiling honeycomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptagonal_tiling_honeycomb "Heptagonal tiling honeycomb") {7,3,3}; they are inscribed in an equidistant surface (a 2-[hypercycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercycle_(hyperbolic_geometry) "Hypercycle (hyperbolic geometry)")), which has two ideal points.

#### Regular tilings of the real projective plane

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Regular tilings of the real projective plane")]

Another group of regular polyhedra comprise tilings of the [real projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane "Real projective plane"). These include the [hemi-cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemi-cube_(geometry) "Hemi-cube (geometry)"), [hemi-octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemi-octahedron "Hemi-octahedron"), [hemi-dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemi-dodecahedron "Hemi-dodecahedron"), and [hemi-icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemi-icosahedron "Hemi-icosahedron"). They are (globally) [projective polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_polyhedra "Projective polyhedra"), and are the projective counterparts of the [Platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid "Platonic solid"). The tetrahedron does not have a projective counterpart as it does not have pairs of parallel faces which can be identified, as the other four Platonic solids do.

These occur as dual pairs in the same way as the original Platonic solids do. Their Euler characteristics are all 1.

### Abstract regular polyhedra

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Abstract regular polyhedra")]

By now, polyhedra were firmly understood as three-dimensional examples of more general _[polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope "Polytope")_ in any number of dimensions. The second half of the century saw the development of abstract algebraic ideas such as [Polyhedral combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedral_combinatorics "Polyhedral combinatorics"), culminating in the idea of an [abstract polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_polytope "Abstract polytope") as a [partially ordered set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set "Partially ordered set") (poset) of elements. The elements of an abstract polyhedron are its body (the maximal element), its faces, edges, vertices and the _null polytope_ or empty set. These abstract elements can be mapped into ordinary space or _realised_ as geometrical figures. Some abstract polyhedra have well-formed or _faithful_ realisations, others do not. A _flag_ is a connected set of elements of each dimension – for a polyhedron that is the body, a face, an edge of the face, a vertex of the edge, and the null polytope. An abstract polytope is said to be _regular_ if its combinatorial symmetries are transitive on its flags – that is to say, that any flag can be mapped onto any other under a symmetry of the polyhedron. Abstract regular polytopes remain an active area of research.

Five such regular abstract polyhedra, which can not be realised faithfully, were identified by [H. S. M. Coxeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._S._M._Coxeter "H. S. M. Coxeter") in his book _[Regular Polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular\_Polytopes "Regular Polytopes")_ (1977) and again by [J. M. Wills](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=J._M._Wills&action=edit&redlink=1 "J. M. Wills (page does not exist)") in his paper "The combinatorially regular polyhedra of index 2" (1987). All five have C 2×S 5 symmetry but can only be realised with half the symmetry, that is C 2×A 5 or icosahedral symmetry.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-11) They are all topologically equivalent to [toroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroid "Toroid"). Their construction, by arranging _n_ faces around each vertex, can be repeated indefinitely as tilings of the [hyperbolic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#Models_of_the_hyperbolic_plane "Hyperbolic geometry"). In the diagrams below, the hyperbolic tiling images have colors corresponding to those of the polyhedra images.

### Spherical polyhedra

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Spherical polyhedra")]

The usual five regular polyhedra can also be represented as spherical tilings (tilings of the [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere")):

#### Regular polyhedra that can only exist as spherical polyhedra

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_polyhedron&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Regular polyhedra that can only exist as spherical polyhedra")]

For a regular polyhedron whose Schläfli symbol is {_m_,_n_}, the number of polygonal faces may be found by:

![Image 69: {\displaystyle N_{2}={\frac {4n}{2m+2n-mn}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc673b89dab301192bd2af766cc0b9498ac2f50b)
The [Platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid "Platonic solid") known to antiquity are the only integer solutions for _m_ ≥ 3 and _n_ ≥ 3. The restriction _m_ ≥ 3 enforces that the polygonal faces must have at least three sides.

When considering polyhedra as a [spherical tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_tiling "Spherical tiling"), this restriction may be relaxed, since [digons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digon "Digon") (2-gons) can be represented as spherical lunes, having non-zero [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_(geometry) "Area (geometry)"). Allowing _m_ = 2 admits a new infinite class of regular polyhedra, which are the [hosohedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosohedron "Hosohedron"). On a spherical surface, the regular polyhedron {2,_n_} is represented as _n_ abutting lunes, with interior angles of 2 π/_n_. All these lunes share two common vertices.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-cox-13)

A regular [dihedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedron "Dihedron"), {_n_,2}[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron#cite_note-cox-13) (2-hedron) in three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") can be considered a [degenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics) "Degeneracy (mathematics)")[prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(geometry) "Prism (geometry)") consisting of two (planar) _n_-sided [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon") connected "back-to-back", so that the resulting object has no depth, analogously to how a digon can be constructed with two [line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment"). However, as a [spherical tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_tiling "Spherical tiling"), a dihedron can exist as nondegenerate form, with two _n_-sided faces covering the sphere, each face being a [hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), and vertices around a [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle"). It is _regular_ if the vertices are equally spaced.

The hosohedron {2,_n_} is dual to the dihedron {_n_,2}. Note that when _n_ = 2, we obtain the polyhedron {2,2}, which is both a hosohedron and a dihedron. All of these have Euler characteristic 2.
