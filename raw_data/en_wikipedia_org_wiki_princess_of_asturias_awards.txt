The awards are presented every October in a solemn ceremony at Teatro Campoamor [ ast ; es ] in Oviedo , the capital of the Principality of Asturias , and are presented by the Princess of Asturias . Each recipient present at the ceremony receives a diploma, a sculpture expressly created for the awards by Spanish sculptor Joan Miró and a pin with the emblem of the Foundation. There is also a monetary prize of €50,000 for each category; this amount is shared if the category has more than one recipient.

They were declared of "exceptional contribution to the cultural heritage of Humanity" by UNESCO in 2004.

[ 2 ] Background [ edit ] The Princess of Asturias Awards Ceremony takes place in Oviedo at the Campoamor Theatre (2015 ceremony pictured) The Prince of Asturias Awards were established on 24 September 1980, with the creation of the Prince of Asturias Foundation, in a ceremony presided by Felipe, Prince of Asturias , then heir to the throne of Spain , "to consolidate links between the Principality and the Prince of Asturias, and to contribute to, encourage and promote scientific, cultural and humanistic values that form part of mankind's universal heritage".

[ 3 ] Following the accession of the Prince as King of Spain on 19 June 2014, it was announced that from 2015, the foundation and the awards are to be renamed the Princess of Asturias Awards to reflect the new heiress presumptive to the Spanish throne, Leonor, Princess of Asturias .

[ 4 ] King Felipe continued to preside over the awards ceremony until the Princess of Asturias turned 18 (the age of majority for Spanish royal purposes) on 31 October 2023. Princess Leonor first attended the ceremony, handed out awards to winners and delivered her first speech ever as heiress to the crown during the 39th Princess of Asturias Awards Ceremony on 18 October 2019. Her father, then Prince Felipe, did the same during the 1st Prince of Asturias Awards Ceremony on 31 October 1981.

[ 5 ] If a laureate does not attend to the ceremony to collect their award, they receive neither the sculpture nor the monetary prize, even if the absence is because of force majeure. Only a few laureates have not attended; among them are Bob Dylan , who refused to go to Oviedo in 2007 but asked for the sculpture unsuccessfully, writer Philip Roth in 2012 for medical reasons, and Pau and Marc Gasol in 2015, who were not allowed to attend by their NBA teams.

Year Image Laureate Country Rationale [ E ] Ref Prince of Asturias Award for Literature 1981 José Hierro Spain "the intense lyrical value of his work, which represents a historical testimony and, at the same time, an ethical attitude, both of which are worthy of public acknowledgement." [ 13 ] 1982 Miguel Delibes Spain "the work of each of them, so different from each other and yet, so profoundly expressive about contemporary Spanish reality, observed in very significant spaces, with singular love and fidelity. In both cases their capacity of invention and description has been displayed in a masterful control of the Spanish language, which guarantees their survival in the history of Spanish literature." [ 14 ] Gonzalo Torrente Ballester 1983 Juan Rulfo Mexico "the great aesthetic quality, depth of invention, aptness and expressive novelty, as well as his decisive influence on subsequent narrative in his country and the outstanding place he occupies in the world of Spanish literature as a whole." [ 15 ] 1984 Pablo García Baena Spain "for his perseverance in cultivating an independent aesthetic attitude, and for his influence upon new tendencies in Spanish poetry." [ 16 ] 1985 Ángel González Spain "because poetry, through his work, survives the scepticism of an epoch with paradoxical tenderness."

[ 18 ] Rafael Lapesa Spain "his rigorous, constant and profound work in clarifying the history of the Spanish language, as well as his fruitful teaching work in Spain and America." 1987 Camilo José Cela Spain "for the high literary quality of his abundant and universally known work and for his singular importance in Spanish letters this century, which he has influenced considerably, reason which making him undoubtedly deserving of this award." [ 19 ] 1988 Carmen Martín Gaite Spain "for her extensive career and recognized merits in the field of contemporary Spanish narrative, within which both she and her work have built a bridge between mid-century realism and the intimacy of the contemporary novel, while paying special attention to the problems of Spanish women of all times." [ 20 ] José Ángel Valente "because his poetry, continually evolving from its initial existential beat to subsequent phenomenological inquiry, is a deep interrogation into the meaning of the world, captured in dense, symbolic language of disturbing beauty, which has made him into one of the finest contemporary Spanish lyricists." 1989 Ricardo Gullón Spain "during a whole life which has been passionately dedicated to the study of Spanish letters, has managed to make his research work transcend the limits of criticism to become a revelation of the mystery of artistic invention in mankind, a highly personal and genuine literary creation, though which, with exemplary mastery, he has known how to make modern Spanish literature known in numerous universities in the United States." [ 21 ] 1990 Arturo Uslar Pietri Venezuela "creator of the modern historical novel in Spanish America, whose incessant and fruitful literary activity has greatly contributed to enlivening our common tongue, illuminating the imagination of the New World and enriching the cultural community of the Americas." [ 22 ] 1991 The people of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico "to the people of Puerto Rico, whose representative authorities, with exemplary decisiveness, have declared Spanish to be the only official language of their country." [ 23 ] 1992 Francisco Morales Nieva Spain "his continual work in renewing the finest Spanish theatrical tradition, his creative power with words and the inventiveness of his scenic spaces." [ 24 ] 1993 Claudio Rodríguez Spain "for shedding light upon everyday reality and remaining true to it in his symbolic depth, for his importance in the 50s group of poets and in terms of current young Spanish poetry." [ 25 ] 1994 Carlos Fuentes Mexico "for his defence, in his writings, of freedom of imagination and the dignity of thought; for the contribution made by his work to culture and to universal solidarity and progress for the peoples of the world." [ 26 ] 1995 Carlos Bousoño Spain "an example of creative development characterised by profound existentialist concerns [...] on criticism in the theory of poetic expression, the study of symbolism and the meaning of literary epochs [...] a bridge between different generations of writers. From a position of fine sensitivity, he has always encouraged the youngest Spanish poetry. His books have had a considerable impact in the university world of recent decades." [ 27 ] 1996 Francisco Umbral Spain "a lively and controversial example of complete dedication to literature. His writing is perpetual and has favoured, in many of his narrative fiction books, the subjects of personal and historic memory. A prominent essayist, a brilliant literary journalist who has turned the daily column into a permanent lesson on verbal art [...] excellence of style [...] capable of lyrical flight and of the most forceful satire, which has renewed our literary language." [ 28 ] 1997 Álvaro Mutis Colombia "for the originality and intellectual commitment of his poetic and narrative work [...] His literary creation, unanimously recognized as one of the Spanish-speaking world's highest achievements, links the tenets of Magic Realism with the concerns of modern man." [ 29 ] 1998 Francisco Ayala Spain "one of the most accomplished intellectual figures of our contemporary literature [...] sociologist, professor in many American universities, memoirist, writer of articles, [...] master in the use of our language. All of his work is characterised by its lucidity, open-mindedness, and delving into the human condition, never afraid of reaching what is at bottom." [ 30 ] 1999 Günter Grass Germany "whose literary work in the fields of creative and essay writing, and life-long civic-mindedness and humanism make him an outstanding figure in literature, critical humanism and moral commitment in our times. His writing, of great aesthetic quality, pays passionate service to the values of freedom, and the defence of the weak, and gives decisive backing to the fundamental aspects of modern democratic systems." [ 31 ] 2000 Augusto Monterroso Guatemala "His narrative works and essays create a literary universe of extraordinary ethical and aesthetic depth, highlighted by a Cervantine, melancholic sense of humour. His narrative work has changed the short story, and has bestowed upon it a literary intensity and an opening-up towards unprecedented story lines." [ 32 ] 2001 Doris Lessing United Kingdom "The Jury thus recognises not only one of the unquestionably major figures of world literature, whose work is the fruit of a lifetime's dedication to the narrative, but also a passionate fighter for freedom who has spared no effort in her commitment to Third World causes, both in her literature and in the personal experience that her eventful life has provided her." [ 33 ] 2002 Arthur Miller United States "an undeniable master of contemporary drama who has projected modern day society's fears, conflicts and aspirations through the medium of the theatre, demonstrating his noteworthy independence of spirit and critical sense, and reworking the ever-present lessons in humanism of the best in stage production." [ 34 ] 2003 Fatema Mernissi Morocco "Both authoresses share having produced literary works in different genres that are of outstanding quality from an aesthetic point of view, and which confront the essential issues of our times with profound depth of vision; they provide complementary perspectives in a dialogue between cultures." [ 35 ] Susan Sontag United States 2004 Claudio Magris Italy "the finest humanistic tradition and the pluralism of early twenty-first century European literature in his work - a multifaceted Europe without frontiers, supportive of others and open to dialogue between cultures. Magris employs a powerful narrative voice in his books to highlight certain niches that constitute a land of freedom within which a yearning takes form: European unity within its historical diversity." [ 36 ] 2005 Nélida Piñón Brazil "author of a stimulating body of literary works artistically founded upon reality and recall, as well as upon fantasy and reverie. Furthermore, diverse literary traditions that constitute a unique theory of the mingling of peoples and cultures all merge in her writing." [ 37 ] 2006 Paul Auster United States "for the transformation in literature that he has wrought by blending the best of American and European traditions, for the innovation he has brought to narrative style in the cinema, and for integrating a number of devices used by the cinema into literature. Auster has managed to appeal to young readers by exploring new perspectives of reality and by providing an aesthetically pleasing, invaluable account of the problems faced by the individual and by social groups in our times." [ 38 ] 2007 Amos Oz Israel "a narrator, essayist and journalist that has contributed towards fashioning the Hebrew language into a brilliant instrument for literary art and for the truthful disclosure of the most dire and universal realities of our time, focussing especially on advocating peace amongst peoples and condemning all forms of fanaticism." [ 39 ] 2008 Margaret Atwood Canada "for her outstanding literary work that has explored different genres with acuteness and irony, and because she cleverly assumes the classic tradition, defends women's dignity and denounces social unfairness." [ 40 ] 2009 Ismail Kadare Albania "for the beauty and profound commitment of his literary works. Using everyday language which is nonetheless full of lyricism, Ismaíl Kadaré narrates the tragedy of his land, an incessant battleground. Giving life to old myths through new words, he expresses all the grief and dramatic load of conscience. His commitment is rooted in the great literary tradition of the Hellenic world, which he projects onto the contemporary stage as an open condemnation of any form of totalitarianism and in defence of reason." [ 41 ] 2010 Amin Maalouf France "who, through historical fiction and theoretical reflection, has managed to lucidly address the complexity of the human condition. Using intense, suggestive language, Maalouf places us in the grand Mediterranean mosaic of languages, cultures and religions to construct a symbolic space for meeting and understanding. Contrary to desperation, resignation or victimism, his work traces a path of its own towards tolerance and reconciliation, a bridge that extends deeply into the shared roots of peoples and cultures." [ 42 ] 2011 Leonard Cohen Canada "for a body of literary work that has influenced three generations of people worldwide through his creation of emotional imagery in which poetry and music are fused in an oeuvre of immutable merit. The passing of time, sentimental relationships, the mystical traditions of the East and the West and life sung as an unending ballad make up a body of work associated with certain moments of decisive change at the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st century." [ 43 ] 2012 Philip Roth [ A ] United States "The narrative work of Philip Roth forms part of the great American novel, in the tradition of Dos Passos, Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Faulkner, Bellow and Malamud. Characters, events and plots form a complex view of contemporary reality torn between reason and feeling, such as the sign of the times and the sense of unease about the present. His literary quality is displayed in his fluid, incisive writing." [ 44 ] 2013 Antonio Muñoz Molina Spain "for the depth and brilliance with which he has narrated relevant fragments of his country's history, crucial episodes of the contemporary world and meaningful aspects of his personal experience. A body of work which admirably reveals his condition as an intellectual with a commitment to his time." [ 45 ] 2014 John Banville Ireland "for his intelligent, insightful and original work as a novelist, and on his alter ego, Benjamin Black, author of disturbing, critical crime novels. John Banville's prose opens up dazzling lyrical landscapes through cultural references in which he breathes new life into classical myths and beauty goes hand in hand with irony. At the same time, he displays an intense analysis of complex human beings that ensnare us in their descent into the darkness of baseness or in their existential fellowship. Each of his works attracts and delights for his skill in developing the plot and his mastery of registers and expressive nuances, as well as for his reflections on the secrets of the human heart." [ 46 ] Princess of Asturias Award for Literature 2015 Leonardo Padura Cuba "a decidedly contemporary author rooted in tradition; an investigator of both what is considered cultured and what is considered popular; an independent intellectual, with a firm ethical temperament. In Leonardo Padura's vast body of work, which covers all genres of prose, one recourse that characterizes his literary resolve stands out: an interest in listening to people's voices and the lost stories of others. Via his fiction, Padura reveals the challenges and limits involved in the search for truth. An impeccable exploration of history and the ways of recounting it. His work is a magnificent adventure of dialogue and freedom." [ 47 ] 2016 Richard Ford United States "His work forms part of the great tradition of the 20th-century American novel. [...] his characters, plots and story lines are defined by an ironic, minimalist sense of epic. The careful attention to detail in his descriptions and his sombre, dense gaze at the daily lives of anonymous, invisible people meld with the desolation and emotions emanating from his stories. All this makes Ford a profoundly contemporary narrator, as well as the great chronicler of the mosaic of interwoven tales that is American society." [ 48 ] 2017 Adam Zagajewski Poland "In addition to his reflections on creation and his intense work of memorialization, Zagajewski's poetry validates the ethical sense of literature and in a single, yet diverse voice in his native Polish accent unites Western tradition, all the while reflecting on the sorrows of exile. Careful attention to lyrical imagery, the intimate experience of time and the conviction that a certain brilliance feeds the flame of artistic creation form the inspiration for one of the most exciting poetic experiences of this Europe, heir to Rilke, Miłosz and Antonio Machado." [ 49 ] 2018 Fred Vargas [ A ] France "the originality of her plots, the irony with which she describes the characters, the depth of her cultural insights and her overflowing imagination, which opens up unprecedented literary horizons to readers. Her writing combines intrigue, action and reflection at a pace that recalls the characteristic musicality of fine French prose. In each of her novels, history emerges as a metaphor of an unsettling present. The vicissitudes of time and the exposure of evil are combined in a solid literary architecture, set against a disquieting backdrop that, for the reader's enjoyment, is always solved as a logical challenge." [ 50 ] 2019 Siri Hustvedt United States "Her work is one of the most ambitious on today's literary scene. Employing a feminist perspective, she addresses a variety of the facets that sketch a convulsive, disconcerting present. Furthermore, she does so using fiction and the essay, as an intellectual concerned with the fundamental issues of contemporary ethics. Translated into more than thirty languages, her work contributes to interdisciplinary dialogue between the humanities and the sciences." [ 51 ] 2020 Anne Carson [ C ] Canada "In the different areas of her writing, Anne Carson has attained levels of intensity and intellectual standing that place her among the most outstanding of present-day writers. From the study of the Greco-Latin world, she has built a body of innovative poetics in which the vitality of great classical thought acts as a map to invite the reader to elucidate the complexities of the current moment in time. Her oeuvre maintains a commitment to emotion and thought, with the study of tradition and the renewed presence of the Humanities as a way to achieve an enhanced awareness of our time." [ 52 ] 2021 Emmanuel Carrère France "Emmanuel Carrère has constructed a highly personal oeuvre that generates a new space for expression which erases the boundaries between reality and fiction. His books contribute to the unmasking of the human condition while relentlessly dissecting reality. Carrère draws an incisive portrait of contemporary society and has exerted a notable influence on the literature of our time, in addition to showing a strong commitment to writing as a vocation inseparable from life itself." [ 53 ] 2022 Juan Mayorga Spain "for the tremendous quality, critical insight and intellectual commitment of his oeuvre: action, emotion, poetry and thought. Since his beginnings as a playwright, Mayorga has proposed a formidable renovation of theatre, endowing it with a moral and philosophical concern that challenges our society by conceiving his work as a theatre for the future and for the essential dignity of human beings." [ 54 ] 2023 Haruki Murakami Japan "for the uniqueness of his literature, its universal scope and ability to reconcile Japanese tradition and the legacy of Western culture in an ambitious and innovative narrative, which has managed to express some of the great themes and conflicts of our time: loneliness, existential uncertainty, terrorism and dehumanization in big cities, as well as the care of one's body and his own reflections on the creative process." [ 55 ] 2024 Ana Blandiana Romania "Ana Blandiana is heir to the most brilliant European traditions, as well as a radically unique creator. Combining transparency and complexity, her writing raises fundamental questions about the existence of human beings, both alone and within society, in the face of nature and of history. Through her indomitable poetry, she has shown an extraordinary capacity for defying censorship." [ 56 ] 2025 Eduardo Mendoza Spain "for his decisive contribution to Spanish literature over the past half-century, comprising a compendium of novels that fuse a desire for innovation with the ability to reach a broad-ranging audience and enjoy widespread international acclaim."
