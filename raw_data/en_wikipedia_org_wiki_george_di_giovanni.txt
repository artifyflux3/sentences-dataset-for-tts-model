He specializes in German idealism , nineteenth century philosophy , phenomenology ( Husserl and Merleau-Ponty ), and philosophy of religion .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Life and works [ edit ] George di Giovanni did his classical studies in Rome , at the Ginnasio Torquato Tasso, and his university studies in Toronto and occasionally in Germany . He received his PhD from the University of Toronto with a thesis on Hegel ’s concept of contingency with the title " Contingency: Its foundation in Hegel’s logic of becoming " under the direction of Emil Fackenheim in 1970.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Di Giovanni provided a new translation of Hegel 's Science of Logic in 2010, nearly 40 years after Arnold Miller 's translation in 1969 and Johnston and Struthers in 1929. Di Giovanni has also provided a detailed introduction to his translation which according to John W. Burbidge is the best discussion on development of Hegel's logic in the Jena period .

[ 6 ] In the introduction, di Giovanni argues that in contrast to general or formal logic , Hegel's logic is best understood as a form of the Kantian transcendental logic .

[ 7 ] Overall Di Giovanni's translation has been noted as an improvement over previous translations of the Logic .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] in his work Between Kant and Hegel, together with H. S. Harris , Di Giovanni has provided translations from the selected writings of K. L. Reinhold , G. E. Schulze , S. Maimon and J. S. Beck ; which has been a major contribution to the anglophone reception of German Idealism .
