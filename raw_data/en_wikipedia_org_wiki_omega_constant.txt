For other omega constants, see omega (disambiguation) § Mathematics .

The omega constant is a mathematical constant defined as the unique real number that satisfies the equation Ω Ω e Ω Ω = 1.

{\displaystyle \Omega e^{\Omega }=1.} It is the value of W (1) , where W is Lambert's W function .  The name is derived from the alternate name for Lambert's W function, the omega function . The numerical value of Ω is given by Ω = 0.56714 32904 09783 87299 99686 62210 ...

(sequence A030178 in the OEIS ).

1/Ω = 1.76322 28343 51896 71022 52017 76951 ...

(sequence A030797 in the OEIS ).

Properties [ edit ] Fixed point representation [ edit ] The defining identity can be expressed, for example, as ln ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 Ω Ω ) = Ω Ω .

{\displaystyle \ln \left({\tfrac {1}{\Omega }}\right)=\Omega .} or − − ln ⁡ ⁡ ( Ω Ω ) = Ω Ω {\displaystyle -\ln(\Omega )=\Omega } as well as e − − Ω Ω = Ω Ω .

{\displaystyle e^{-\Omega }=\Omega .} Computation [ edit ] One can calculate Ω iteratively , by starting with an initial guess Ω 0 , and considering the sequence Ω Ω n + 1 = e − − Ω Ω n .

{\displaystyle \Omega _{n+1}=e^{-\Omega _{n}}.} This sequence will converge to Ω as n approaches infinity. This is because Ω is an attractive fixed point of the function e − x .

It is much more efficient to use the iteration Ω Ω n + 1 = 1 + Ω Ω n 1 + e Ω Ω n , {\displaystyle \Omega _{n+1}={\frac {1+\Omega _{n}}{1+e^{\Omega _{n}}}},} because the function f ( x ) = 1 + x 1 + e x , {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1+x}{1+e^{x}}},} in addition to having the same fixed point, also has a derivative that vanishes there. This guarantees quadratic convergence; that is, the number of correct digits is roughly doubled with each iteration.

Using Halley's method , Ω can be approximated with cubic convergence (the number of correct digits is roughly tripled with each iteration): (see also Lambert W function § Numerical evaluation ).

Ω Ω j + 1 = Ω Ω j − − Ω Ω j e Ω Ω j − − 1 e Ω Ω j ( Ω Ω j + 1 ) − − ( Ω Ω j + 2 ) ( Ω Ω j e Ω Ω j − − 1 ) 2 Ω Ω j + 2 .

{\displaystyle \Omega _{j+1}=\Omega _{j}-{\frac {\Omega _{j}e^{\Omega _{j}}-1}{e^{\Omega _{j}}(\Omega _{j}+1)-{\frac {(\Omega _{j}+2)(\Omega _{j}e^{\Omega _{j}}-1)}{2\Omega _{j}+2}}}}.} Integral representations [ edit ] An identity due to Victor Adamchik [ citation needed ] is given by the relationship ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ d t ( e t − − t ) 2 + π π 2 = 1 1 + Ω Ω .

{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {dt}{(e^{t}-t)^{2}+\pi ^{2}}}={\frac {1}{1+\Omega }}.} Other relations due to Mező [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and Kalugin-Jeffrey-Corless [ 3 ] are: Ω Ω = 1 π π Re ⁡ ⁡ ∫ ∫ 0 π π log ⁡ ⁡ ( e e i t − − e − − i t e e i t − − e i t ) d t , {\displaystyle \Omega ={\frac {1}{\pi }}\operatorname {Re} \int _{0}^{\pi }\log \left({\frac {e^{e^{it}}-e^{-it}}{e^{e^{it}}-e^{it}}}\right)dt,} Ω Ω = 1 π π ∫ ∫ 0 π π log ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 + sin ⁡ ⁡ t t e t cot ⁡ ⁡ t ) d t .

{\displaystyle \Omega ={\frac {1}{\pi }}\int _{0}^{\pi }\log \left(1+{\frac {\sin t}{t}}e^{t\cot t}\right)dt.} The latter two identities can be extended to other values of the W function (see also Lambert W function § Representations ).

Transcendence [ edit ] The constant Ω is transcendental . This can be seen as a direct consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem . For a contradiction, suppose that Ω is algebraic. By the theorem, e −Ω is transcendental, but Ω = e −Ω , which is a contradiction. Therefore, it must be transcendental.
