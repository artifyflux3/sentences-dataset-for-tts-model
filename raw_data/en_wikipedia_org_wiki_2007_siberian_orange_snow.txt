Beginning on 31 January 2007, an orange-tinted snow fell across an area of 1,500 square kilometres (580 sq mi) in Omsk Oblast , Siberian Federal District , Russia, approximately 2,300 km (1,400 mi) from Moscow, as well as into the neighboring Tomsk and Tyumen Oblasts . It was unclear what caused the orange snow. Speculation ranged from pollutants to a sandstorm in neighboring Kazakhstan .

[ 1 ] Description [ edit ] The orange snow was malodorous, oily to the touch, and reported to contain four times the normal level of iron . Though mostly orange, some of the snow was red or yellow. It affected an area with about 27,000 residents. It was originally speculated that it was caused by industrial pollution , a rocket launch or even a nuclear accident. It was later determined that the snow was non-toxic; however, people in the region were advised not to use the snow or allow animals to feed upon it.

[ 2 ] Colored snow is uncommon in Russia but not unheard of, as there have been many cases of black, [ 3 ] blue, [ 4 ] green and red snowfall.

Possible causes [ edit ] This orange snow may have been caused by a heavy sandstorm in neighboring Kazakhstan . Tests on the snow revealed numerous sand and clay dust particles, which were blown into Russia in the upper stratosphere.

[ 3 ] The speculation that the coloration was caused by a rocket launch from Baikonur in Kazakhstan [ 1 ] was later dismissed, as the last launch before the event took place on 18 January 2007.

[ 5 ] [ original research?

] Russia's environmental watchdog originally claimed that the colored snowfall was caused by industrial pollution, such as "waste from metallurgical plants." [ 3 ] It stated that the snow contained four times the normal quantities of acids, nitrates , and iron. However, it would be nearly impossible to pinpoint a culprit if pollution were the cause, as there are various industries nearby, such as the city of Omsk , which is a center of the oil industry in Russia.
