( / ˈ w ʊ l f r əm / WUUL -frəm ) is an American multinational company that creates computational technology. Wolfram's flagship product is the technical computing program Wolfram Mathematica , first released on June 23, 1988. Other products include WolframAlpha , Wolfram System Modeler , Wolfram Workbench, [ 2 ] gridMathematica , Wolfram Finance Platform, [ 3 ] webMathematica , the Wolfram Cloud, and the Wolfram Programming Lab.

[ 4 ] Wolfram Research founder Stephen Wolfram is the CEO . The company is headquartered in Champaign, Illinois , United States.

History [ edit ] The company launched Wolfram Alpha , an answer engine on May 16, 2009. It brings a new approach to knowledge generation and acquisition that involves large amounts of curated computable data in addition to semantic indexing of text.

[ 5 ] Wolfram Research acquired MathCore Engineering AB on March 30, 2011.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] On July 21, 2011, Wolfram Research launched the Computable Document Format (CDF). CDF is an electronic document format [ 8 ] designed to allow easy authoring [ 9 ] of dynamically generated interactive content.

In June 2014, Wolfram Research officially introduced the Wolfram Language as a new general multi-paradigm programming language.

[ 10 ] It is the primary programming language used in Mathematica .

[ 11 ] On April 15, 2020, Wolfram Research received $5,575,000 to help pay its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the U.S. government 's Paycheck Protection Program administered by the Small Business Administration . The loan was forgiven.

( September 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Mathematica [ edit ] Main article: Wolfram Mathematica Mathematica began as a software program for doing mathematics by computer, and has evolved to cover all domains of technical computing software, with features for neural networks , machine learning , image processing , geometry , data science , and visualizations . Central to Mathematica's mission is its ability to perform symbolic computation, for example, the ability to solve indefinite integrals symbolically. Mathematica includes a notebook interface and can produce slides for presentations. Mathematica is available in a desktop version, a grid computing version, and a cloud version.

Wolfram Alpha [ edit ] Main article: Wolfram Alpha Wolfram Alpha is a free online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from externally sourced curated data, rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a search engine might. Users submit queries and computation requests via a text field and Wolfram Alpha then computes answers and relevant visualizations. In 2012, a paid "Pro" level with additional features was released.

[ 14 ] In 2016, Wolfram Alpha Enterprise, a business-focused analytics tool, was launched. The program combines data supplied by a corporation with the algorithms from Wolfram Alpha to answer questions related to that corporation.

[ 15 ] Wolfram System Modeler [ edit ] Main article: Wolfram SystemModeler Wolfram System Modeler is a platform for engineering as well as life-science modeling and simulation based on the Modelica language. It provides an interactive graphical modeling and simulation environment and a customizable set of component libraries. The primary interface, ModelCenter , is an interactive graphical environment including a customizable set of component libraries. The software also provides a tight integration with Mathematica. Users can develop, simulate, document, and analyze their models within Mathematica notebooks.

Publishing [ edit ] Wolfram Research publishes several free websites including the MathWorld and ScienceWorld encyclopedias. ScienceWorld, which launched in 2002, is divided into sites on chemistry, physics, astronomy and scientific biography.

[ 16 ] In 2005, the physics site was deemed a "valuable resource" by American Scientist magazine.

[ 17 ] However, by 2009, the astronomy site was said to suffer from outdated information, incomplete articles and link rot .

[ 18 ] The Wolfram Demonstrations Project is a collaborative site hosting interactive technical demonstrations powered by a free Mathematica Player runtime.

Wolfram Research publishes The Mathematica Journal .

[ 19 ] Wolfram has also published several books via Wolfram Media, Wolfram's publishing arm.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] In addition, they have experimented with electronic textbook creation.

[ 22 ] Media activities [ edit ] Wolfram Research served as the mathematical consultant for the CBS television series Numb3rs , a show about the mathematical aspects of crime-solving.
