It is bordered to its west by Mercer and Middlesex Counties, to its south by Ocean County , to its east by the Atlantic Ocean , and to its north by the Raritan Bay (sharing a border with the boroughs of Staten Island , Brooklyn , and Queens in New York City , across it). Monmouth County's geographic area comprises 30% water. The county is part of the Jersey Shore region of the state.

[ 6 ] As of the 2020 United States census , the county was the state's fifth-most-populous county [ 7 ] with a population of 643,615, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 13,235 (+2.1%) from the 2010 census count of 630,380, [ 8 ] which in turn reflected an increase of 15,079 from 615,301 at the 2000 census .

[ 9 ] As of 2010, the county fell to the fifth-most populous county in the state, having been surpassed by Hudson County .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Monmouth's county seat is Freehold Borough , [ 1 ] though many county offices are also located in neighboring Freehold Township .

[ 12 ] The most populous place was Middletown Township , with 67,106 residents at the time of the 2020 Census, [ 4 ] while Howell Township covered 61.21 square miles (158.5 km 2 ), the largest total area of any municipality.

[ 11 ] While there are differing historical theories, the most plausible of theories in the origin of the county's name are attributed to many settlers originating from Rhode Island where the Rhode Island Monmouth Society hailed from, or it being named after the historic county of Monmouthshire in Wales , Great Britain . The county, like much of the state, was significantly involved during the American Revolutionary War . The Battle of Monmouth was fought in June 1778 in what has been preserved as Monmouth Battlefield State Park , currently located in Freehold Township and Manalapan Township .

[ 13 ] The county's economy is rich and diverse, due to its high population density and proximity to New York City. Located in the middle of the Northeast megalopolis , its inland county seat of Freehold Borough , the Tri-City region of coastal cities of Red Bank , Long Branch , and Asbury Park , along with the county constituting a vast swath of the New Jersey coastline, has contributed in its draw of tourists throughout the state (and much of the Northeastern United States at large), particularly during the summer months.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Many communities within the county serve as commuter towns to and from New York City and other points north . Highways such as the Garden State Parkway , U.S. 9 , Route's 34 , 35 , and 36 , along with NJ Transit 's North Jersey Coast Line and Seastreak , connects county residents to economic centers in North Jersey and New York City.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] In 2015, the county had a per capita personal income of $69,410, making it the fifth highest in New Jersey and ranked 74th of 3,113 counties in the United States.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Many inland areas of the county are still quite agricultural, with many orchards, wineries, equestrian farms, and distilleries, such as Cream Ridge Winery , Delicious Orchards , Four JG's Orchards & Vineyards , and Laird & Company . The Bell Labs Complex is a major scientific research facility in Holmdel Township , where important breakthroughs, such as evidence for the Big Bang , were discovered.

[ 20 ] The county is also home to Monmouth University , a private university in West Long Branch .

History [ edit ] Craig House at Monmouth Battlefield State Park The Battle of Monmouth was fought on June 28, 1778 The Allentown Mill in Allentown Etymology [ edit ] The naming of Monmouth County has different historical theories. It is thought that the county received its name from the Rhode Island Monmouth Society.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] This is likely, due to many of the county's earliest settlers originating from Rhode Island . Another plausible theory, is from a suggestion from Colonel Lewis Morris that the county should be named after Monmouthshire in Wales , Great Britain . Other suggestions include that it was named for James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth (1649–1685), who had many allies among the East Jersey leadership.

[ 23 ] Indigenous history [ edit ] See also: Lenape people Around the year 1000, the area of Monmouth County began to be inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans prior to the arrival of European settlers. They came from the Mississippi River area. They lived along the vicinity of the Jersey Shore , the Raritan Bay , the Raritan River and other areas in the northeastern United States . The Lenape were a hunter-gatherer society. They were largely sedentary, changing campsites seasonally. They were prolific hunters of small game and birds. They were also skilled fisherman, and were known to harvest vast amounts of clams from the bays and inlets on the Jersey Shore. They also practiced some agriculture to augment their food supply. During this time, an important crossroad of two major Lenape trails was located in the area of Freehold Township in western Monmouth County.

[ 24 ] Colonial era [ edit ] See also: Monmouth Tract In 1609, the English navigator, Henry Hudson , and his crew aboard the Dutch vessel Half Moon spotted land in what is now Monmouth County, [ 25 ] most likely off Sandy Hook ; however, some historical accounts credit this landing to present-day Keansburg .
Among the first European settlers and majority landowners in the area were Richard and Penelope Stout . Penelope "miraculously" survived her wounds from a native attack in Sandy Hook and lived to the age of 110.  A group of Quaker families from Long Island settled the Monmouth Tract , an early land grant from Richard Nicolls issued in 1665.

[ 26 ] They were followed by a group of Scottish settlers who inhabited Freehold Township in about 1682–1885, followed several years later by Dutch settlers. As they arrived in this area, they were greeted by Lenape people, who lived in scattered small family bands and developed a largely amicable relationship with the new arrivals.

[ 27 ] Enslaved Africans were present in the area from at least 1680, and by 1726 made up 9% of the total population of the county.

[ 28 ] Monmouth County was established on March 7, 1683, while part of the province of East Jersey . On October 31, 1693, the county was partitioned into the townships of Freehold , Middletown and Shrewsbury .

[ 29 ] In 1764, the Sandy Hook Lighthouse was built.

At the June 28, 1778, Battle of Monmouth , near Freehold Township , General George Washington 's soldiers battled the British under Sir Henry Clinton , in the longest land battle of the American Revolutionary War . At Monmouth the tactics and training from Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben developed at Valley Forge during the winter encampment were first implemented on a large scale.

[ 30 ] Other battles and massacres during the war in Monmouth County include sites such as the Burrowes Mansion in Matawan , and the Allen House in Shrewsbury .

At independence, Monmouth's population included 1,640 slaves, as well as an undetermined number of free African Americans . The number of enslaved persons fell steeply after 1820, though a small number remained until at least 1850. Monmouth's free African American population climbed from 353 in 1790 to 2,658 in 1860.

[ 28 ] There was a small African-American middle class consisting of freedmen present in Monmouth County by the 1840s and 1850s.

[ 31 ] In 1790 Monmouth County's population was 16,918, of whom roughly 6,600 were of English descent and the remainder were Welsh , Dutch and Swedish , as well as small amounts of African Americans and Northern Irish Protestants .

[ 32 ] By 2010 Monmouth County's population was 628,112 of whom 40,489 were of English descent .

[ 33 ] Between 1890 and 1907 nearly 18 million European immigrants came to America.

[ 34 ] At the same time the region underwent massive and not unrelated economic changes, this process led to places like Monmouth County, New Jersey becoming significantly more diverse and somewhat less rural.

[ 35 ] 19th century [ edit ] In 1822, James P. Allaire bought land that would be used to establish the Howell Works Iron Foundry in what is now Wall Township . The village was an early example of a company town , having its workers live on site with numerous types of stores and facilities for them. The furnace had ceased to operate by 1848 as iron and coal production moved to Pennsylvania . Today, the land is a living history museum and U.S. historic district known as Allaire Village .

On May 18, 1826, the Navesink Twin Lights were commissioned by Congress , and were first used in 1828. The twin lighthouses were one of only seven in the country. However, this structure deteriorated rapidly, and was in need of replacement. On May 1, 1862, the current structure was first lit at a much grander scale. Upon completion, it was the most powerful lighthouse in the United States. In 1883, it became the first lighthouse in the country to use a mineral-oil lamp. Today, the lighthouse is open to the public as a U.S. historic landmark and place .

[ 36 ] In 1848, one of the original Life Saving Stations was built in Sandy Hook for the United States Coast Guard . Between 1857 and 1867, construction began on the Fort at Sandy Hook. The fort remained nameless until 1895 when it was named Fort Hancock after Winfield Scott Hancock . On August 7, 1874, the Sandy Hook Proving Ground was established as a weapons testing area, considered a separate facility from the fort. In 1890, construction began on the artillery batteries of the fort. The Battery Porter was an early prototype of the gun lift carriage .

[ 37 ] During the 19th century, Keyport's Marine Park was a major shipbuilding hub, having built 55 steamships between 1807 and 1868, which was more than Hoboken , Jersey City , or Camden during this period.

[ 38 ] In 1850, Ocean County was carved out of Monmouth County.

[ 29 ] On July 30, 1870, Monmouth Park Racetrack opened, a thoroughbred racing track in Eatontown . The facility closed and reopened several times, with the current facility having been in use since 1946.

[ 39 ] On September 19, 1881, U.S. President James A. Garfield died in the Elberon section of Long Branch , a few months after being shot in a failed assassination attempt. Garfield was one of several presidents who would vacation in Long Branch around the Gilded Age , with other presidents who frequented the town including Chester A. Arthur , Ulysses S. Grant , Benjamin Harrison , Rutherford B. Hayes , William McKinley , and Woodrow Wilson .

[ 40 ] On July 5, 1886, the Seabright Lawn Tennis and Cricket Club in Rumson opened as the first lawn tennis club in the United States.

[ 41 ] In 1888, Palace Amusements opened in Asbury Park alongside the boardwalk, and contained numerous amusement rides and games, such as a carousel . After years of a declining economy within the city, the palace closed in 1988, 100 years after it opened. In 2004, the building was deemed unsafe, and was ordered to be demolished, although various elements were saved such as the iconic Tillie mural and the carousel.

In 1899, Guglielmo Marconi 's first demonstration of the wireless telegraph in the United States took place at the Navesink Twin Lights .

[ 42 ] 20th century [ edit ] In 1910, the Wright Brothers hosted an aviation show in Interlaken , where numerous records were broken, such as high altitudes , longest time airborne, the first night flight, and the first air mail delivery.

[ 43 ] Fort Hancock in Sandy Hook played a minor role in World War 1 and World War 2 . The fort was intended as one of the defensive forts of New York City, and as neither war came to the area, the fort was largely unaffected. However, during World War 1, several of the artillery guns were removed for use elsewhere. In 1919, the Sandy Hook Proving Ground was essentially abandoned in favor of a large site at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland . During World War 2, the fort served as a mobilization center. In 1946, the guns at the fort were considered obsolete, leading to their scrapping and subsequent decommissioning of the fort. The fort was reactivated twice, first as an antiaircraft defense and later as a Nike missile base, but was closed for good in 1974.

[ 37 ] Today, the fort is a National Historic Place and Landmark .

In 1916, two of the three Jersey Shore shark attacks occurred in Monmouth County, with one occurring on July 6 in Spring Lake while the other occurred on July 12 in Matawan . One person was killed in the Spring Lake attack, while in Matawan two people were killed and one was injured.

In 1917, construction of Fort Monmouth began under the name of Camp Little Silver as training grounds. The first permanent structure, a barracks , was erected in 1928. In 1928, the first radio -equipped meteorological balloon reached the atmosphere , a precursor to modern day weather sounding . Numerous buildings were constructed during the 1930s-1940s at the facility, with the fort significantly expanding in size.

[ 44 ] Fort Monmouth was also where Soviet spies Julius Rosenberg , Joel Barr , and Alfred Sarant operated. Numerous scientific breakthroughs occurred at Fort Monmouth, including Project Diana in 1946; SCORE , the world's first communications satellite in 1958; TIROS-1 , the world's first full-scale weather satellite in 1960, and other projects including photography .

[ 45 ] On November 11, 1926, the Count Basie Theater opened as the Carlton Theater in Red Bank . In 1970, the theater had closed alongside most of the other historic theaters in the town. In 1973, an anonymous donation allowed for the preservation of the theater. In 1984, it was renamed after Count Basie , a native of Red Bank. Many well-known acts had performed at the theater, such as Tony Bennett , Olivia Newton-John , Bruce Springsteen , and Jon Bon Jovi .

[ 46 ] In 1928, the Asbury Park Convention Hall was constructed alongside the boardwalk . On January 1, 1930, the Paramount Theater in Asbury Park showed its first film, Wings .

The buildings are connected by a grand arcade alongside the boardwalk.

[ 47 ] On September 8, 1934, the SS Morro Castle caught fire and burned during a storm on its route from New York City to Havana , Cuba . The ship drifted ashore to Asbury Park by the Convention Hall , where it remained until 1935 when it was towed away to be scrapped. The disaster was one of the deadliest maritime disasters in United States history, having killed 137 people.

[ 48 ] On December 13, 1943, Naval Weapons Station Earle was commissioned, which is designed to safely store and transport military ordinance. The 11,000 acre main facility consumes land in Colts Neck Township , Howell Township , Wall Township , and Tinton Falls , while the three-pronged pier in the Leonardo section of Middletown Township is connected to the main facility via Normandy Road, a military-only railroad and road that connects the facilities.

[ 49 ] The Bell Labs complex in Holmdel Township was a major center for scientific research throughout the 20th century. On May 4, 1933, radio astronomy , one of the most significant achievements in the field of astronomy , was invented by Karl Guthe Jansky .

[ 50 ] On June 25, 1946, the silicon solar cell was patented by Russell S. Ohl , who operated out of Bell Labs. In 1959, AT&T began construction on the current building, completing it in 1962, where the building acted as a research and development facility. The facility was expanded twice in 1966 and 1982. On October 17, 1978, cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered at the site by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson .

[ 51 ] On June 12, 1968, the Garden State Arts Center opened in Holmdel Township alongside the Garden State Parkway , having its own exit of 116. The amphitheater often hosted classical and popular music , as well as various other programs, and has a capacity of roughly 10,000 people. In 1995, on the opposite side of the parkway, the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans' Memorial was opened. In 1996, the facility expanded heavily, adding thousands in capacity, and shifting toward general music with broader appeal to compete with other amphitheaters. In 1996, the facility was renamed to PNC Bank Arts Center. The theater is one of the most successful amphitheaters in the country.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] In 1970, Asbury Park experienced a major race riot between July 4 and July 10, one of the largest in New Jersey. The riot was largely due to high unemployment , poor housing conditions, and lack of recreational activities within the African American community. Over 180 people were injured during the week long riot. The largely African American West Side of the city experienced the most damage, with an estimated $5,600,000 in damages.

[ 54 ] On February 8, 1974, The Stone Pony opened in Asbury Park across the street from the boardwalk. The live music venue is small but well-known, with its most notable talents Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band as well as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes having launched their career out of the venue.

[ 55 ] 21st century [ edit ] In 2005, Fort Monmouth was recommended for closure, and in 2011 the facility shut down for good. Redevelopment of the land had been in talks since 2006, and in 2021 Netflix had announced it was going to create a film studio at the facility.

[ 56 ] In 2022, a proposal to develop housing units where the fort's housing stands was approved.

[ 57 ] In 2006, Bell Labs was sold, and preservation efforts were made by residents and former employees. In 2013, a developer began site redevelopment, with the research building becoming a New Urbanism inspired mixed-use facility, while the surrounding land became residential housing.

In 2016, Monmouth Mall in Eatontown announced that it would be redeveloped into a pedestrian-friendly mixed-used development, including demolition of some of the abandoned parts of the mall, with the addition of housing, plazas and walkways, amongst many other changes. The mall, which opened in 1960, had faced lots of vacancies and financial troubles over the years that led to the decision. The plans were finalized in 2023.

[ 58 ] On June 14, 2018, Monmouth Park Racetrack became the first place in New Jersey to offer sports betting .

Geography and climate [ edit ] Sunrise on the Jersey Shore at Spring Lake , New Jersey , facing the Atlantic Ocean The historic Navesink Twin Lights is located on the Navesink Highlands in Highlands , one of the highest points in Monmouth County and constitute among the highest headlands along the United States east coast south of Maine [ 59 ] According to the U.S. Census Bureau , as of the 2020 Census, the county had a total area of 661.40 square miles (1,713.0 km 2 ), of which 468.18 square miles (1,212.6 km 2 ) was land (70.8%) and 193.22 square miles (500.4 km 2 ) was water (29.2%).

[ 2 ] Much of Monmouth County remains flat and low-lying, even at its western inland extreme. However, there are some low hills in and around Holmdel Township , and one of them, Crawford Hill , the former site of a radar facility, is the county's highest point, variously listed at 380 to 391 feet (116 to 119 m) above sea level.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] The top portion of the hill is owned by Alcatel-Lucent and houses a research laboratory of Bell Laboratories .

[ 62 ] The northeastern portion of the county, in the Locust section of Middletown Township and the boroughs of Highlands and Atlantic Highlands , are also very hilly. The lowest point is sea level.

Along with adjacent Middlesex and Ocean counties, Monmouth County is a mecca for boating and fishing. Its waterways include several tributaries that flow from the more agrarian regions of western Monmouth County into the Raritan River , and various rivers and inlets that flow from the more densely populated region of the Raritan Bayshore of northern Monmouth County into the Raritan Bay and the Lower New York Bay , before finally draining out into the Atlantic Ocean . The Manasquan Inlet is located in the county, which connects the Atlantic Ocean with the estuary of the Manasquan River , a bay-like body of saltwater that serves as the starting point of the Intracoastal Waterway , which attracts as many as 1,600 boats each weekend during the peak season.

[3] On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused catastrophic damage to coastal areas of Monmouth County. As Sandy's surge arrived in Monmouth County, flood levels of 13.31 feet (4.06 m) above normal were measured at Sandy Hook shortly before the destruction of the tidal station, breaking all previous local records. The surge caused waves as high as 32.5 feet (9.9 m), measured where the Sandy Hook Bay meets the New York Bay .

The measurement of cosmic background radiation (as the Holmdel telescope's noise is now called), combined with Edwin Hubble's much earlier finding that the galaxies are rushing away, makes a strong case for the big bang.
