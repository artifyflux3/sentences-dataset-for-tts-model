University of Georgia Latin : Universitas Georgiae [ 1 ] Motto Latin : Et docere et rerum exquirere causas Motto in English "To teach, to serve, and to inquire into the nature of things." "To serve" was later added to the motto without changing the seal; the Latin motto directly translates as "To teach and to inquire into the nature of things."

Chartered in 1785, it is the oldest public university in the United States .

[ 9 ] It is the flagship school of the University System of Georgia .

[ 10 ] In addition to the main campuses in Athens with their approximately 470 buildings, the university has two smaller campuses located in Tifton and Griffin . The university has two satellite campuses located in Atlanta and Lawrenceville , and residential and educational centers in Washington, D.C.

, at Trinity College of Oxford University , and in Cortona , Italy. The total acreage of the university in 30 Georgia counties is 41,539 acres (168.10 km 2 ).

[ 6 ] The university is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High research activity", [ 11 ] and is considered to have "Very High" undergraduate admissions standards with "Higher Earnings".

[ 12 ] [ 11 ] The University of Georgia's intercollegiate sports teams, commonly known by their Georgia Bulldogs name, compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The university has had more alumni as Rhodes Scholars since 1990 than nearly all other public universities in the country.

[ 13 ] Alumni also include a United States Poet Laureate , Emmy Award winners, Grammy Award winners, and multiple Super Bowl champions .

History [ edit ] Antebellum history [ edit ] Lyman Hall , one of the founders of the University of Georgia In 1784, Lyman Hall , a Yale University graduate [ 14 ] and one of three medical doctors to sign the Declaration of Independence , [ 15 ] as Governor of Georgia persuaded the Georgia legislature to grant 40,000 acres (160 km 2 ) as an endowment for the purposes of founding a "college or seminary of learning." Besides Hall, credit for founding the university goes to Abraham Baldwin who wrote the original charter for University of Georgia.

[ 16 ] Originally from Connecticut , Baldwin graduated from and later taught at Yale before moving to Georgia .

[ 17 ] The Georgia General Assembly approved Baldwin's charter on January 27, 1785, [ 16 ] and the University of Georgia became the first university in the United States to gain a state charter.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Considered one of the Founding Fathers of the United States , Baldwin would later represent Georgia in the 1786 Constitutional Convention that created the Constitution of the United States [ 20 ] and go on to be President pro tempore of the United States Senate .

[ 21 ] The task of creating the university was given to the Senatus Academicus, [ 16 ] which consisted of the Board of Visitors – made up of "the governor, all state senators, all superior court judges and a few other public officials" – and the Board of Trustees, "a body of 14 appointed members that soon became self-perpetuating." [ 17 ] The first meeting of the university's board of trustees was held in Augusta, Georgia , on February 13, 1786. The meeting installed Baldwin as the university's first president.

[ 16 ] Abraham Baldwin , one of the founders and first president of the University of Georgia For the first 16 years of the school's history, the University of Georgia only existed on paper.

[ 22 ] By the new century, a committee was appointed to find suitable land to establish a campus. Committee member John Milledge purchased 633 acres of land on the west bank of the Oconee River and immediately gave it to the university. This tract of land, now a part of the consolidated city–county of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia , was then part of Jackson County .

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] As of 2013 [update] , 37 acres of that land remained as part of the North Campus.

[ 23 ] [ 25 ] Because Baldwin was elected to the U.S. Senate , the school needed a new president. Baldwin chose his former student and fellow professor at Yale, Josiah Meigs , as his replacement. Meigs became the school's president, as well as the first and only professor. After traveling the state to recruit a few students, Meigs opened the school with no building in the fall of 1801. The first school building patterned after Yale's Connecticut Hall was built the year later. Yale's early influence on the new university extended into the classical curriculum with emphasis on Latin and Greek .

[ 23 ] By 1803, the students formed a debate society, Demosthenian Literary Society .

[ 26 ] Meigs had his first graduating class of nine by 1804.

[ 23 ] In 1806, the school dedicated the first legacy building, Franklin College (named after Benjamin Franklin ). The building is now known as Old College.

[ 26 ] After the tenure of the next two presidents, John Brown (1811–1816) and Robert Finley (1817), [ 27 ] a timeframe that saw enrollment drop, presidents Moses Waddel (1819–1829) and Alonzo Church (1829–1859) worked to re-engage new students. By 1859, enrollment had risen to 100 students, and the university employed eight faculty members and opened a new law school.

[ 28 ] During this timeframe, the university erected the New College building followed by the Chapel in 1832.

[ 26 ] Church was the longest-serving president in UGA history.

[ 29 ] In 1859, the state legislature abolished the Senatus Academicus, leaving the board of trustees as the only official governing body. When Church retired, [ 30 ] Andrew A. Lipscomb was appointed to the newly renamed position of chancellor in 1860.

[ 28 ] Civil War era and late 19th century [ edit ] The University of Georgia closed in September 1863 due to the Civil War and reopened in January 1866 with an enrollment of about 80 students [ 31 ] including veterans using an award of $300 granted by the General Assembly to former soldiers under an agreement that they would remain in Georgia as teachers after graduation.

[ 32 ] [ 28 ] The university received additional funding through the 1862 Morrill Act , which was used to create land-grant colleges across the nation. In 1872, the $243,000 federal allotment to Georgia was invested to create a $16,000 annual income used to establish the Georgia State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (A&M), initially separate and independent from the University of Georgia. However, A&M's funding was considered part of the university, which helped save it from bankruptcy during the Reconstruction era .

[ 28 ] As a land-grant school, UGA was required to provide military training, which the university began to offer in the 1870s.

[ 33 ] Several of the university's extracurricular organizations began in the late 1800s. In 1886, fraternities at UGA began publishing the school's yearbook, the Pandora . The same year, the university gained its first intercollegiate sport when a baseball team was formed, followed by a football team formed in 1892. Both teams played in a small field west of campus now known as Herty Field . The Demosthenian and Phi Kappa literary societies together formed the student paper, The Red & Black , in 1883.

[ 33 ] In 1894, the University of Georgia joined six other southeastern schools to form the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA).

[ 34 ] Early 20th century [ edit ] Mary Ethel Creswell , in 1919, the first woman to earn an undergraduate degree at the university The turn of the century brought many changes in the administration and organization of the university including the naming of a new chancellor in 1899.

Walter B. Hill became the first UGA alumnus to lead the university. A progressive leader, his six-year tenure, before his death from pneumonia, was marked with increased enrollment, expansion of the university's course offerings, and the addition of state funding through appropriation, for the first time bringing the university's annual income to over $100,000 in 1902. Hill and his successors David C. Barrow (1906–1925), Charles Snelling (1926–1932), and Steadman Sanford (1932–1935) would grow the school to take on the role of a true university.

[ 33 ] Many of the university's schools and colleges were established during Barrow's tenure. The College of Education (1908), the Graduate School (1910), the School of Commerce (1912), the School of Journalism (1915), and the Division of Home Economics (1918) were all established during this period. In 1906, UGA also incorporated the College of Agriculture by bringing together A&M (agricultural and mechanical) courses. The college of science and engineering continued as formed in the previous century. Conner Hall became the first building built in South Campus and first of several buildings that housed the university's agriculture programs on what came to be known as "Ag Hill". In 1914, the first Phi Beta Kappa chapter in the state of Georgia was founded at UGA.

[ 35 ] In 1923, another honor society, Phi Kappa Phi , established a chapter at the university.

[ 36 ] In 1920, UGA's athletic program was among 14 of the 30 universities to leave the SIAA to form the Southern Conference .

[ 37 ] With students limited to white males for the first century of its history, the University of Georgia began admitting white female students during the summer of 1903 as postgraduate students to the State Normal School established in 1893 a few miles west of the campus. When the University of Georgia established a graduate school in 1910, female students were permitted to attend summer classes and some were also unofficially allowed to attend regular classes, as well.

[ 38 ] However, at that time only junior college transfers majoring in Home Economics were integrated into regular courses.

[ 35 ] Before official admission of women to the university, several women were able to complete graduate degrees through credit earned during the summer sessions. The first white woman to earn such a degree was Mary Dorothy Lyndon . She received a Master of Arts degree in 1914.

[ 39 ] Women were admitted as full-time undergraduates in 1918.

Mary Ethel Creswell earned a Bachelor of Science in home economics in June 1919, becoming the first woman to earn an undergraduate degree at the university.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] Two UGA dormitories were later named after these graduates: Mary Lyndon Hall [ 41 ] and Creswell Hall .

[ 42 ] This postcard depicts Mary Lyndon Hall (built in 1938), named after the first female student at UGA to earn a graduate degree.

[ 41 ] In 1932, the reorganization of the university's administrative structure continued through the establishment of the University System of Georgia (USG), which brought UGA along with several other public colleges in the state under the control of a single board of regents. The State Normal School (later State Teachers College) was fully absorbed by the College of Education, with the former's previous campus becoming UGA's Coordinate Campus. UGA and Georgia Tech traded several school programs; all engineering programs (except agriculture) were transferred to Georgia Tech and UGA received Georgia Tech's commerce program in return. The title of the university's lead administrator was changed from chancellor back to the original title of president. Sanford was named UGA's first president since 1860 [ 27 ] and was succeeded by Harmon Caldwell (1935–1948). In 1933, the Division of Home Economics was reorganized as the School of Home of Economics , [ 43 ] with UGA's first female graduate, Creswell, appointed as dean.

[ 40 ] The university also became a founding member of the Southeastern Conference [ 44 ] and established the University of Georgia Press in 1938.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] Throughout this period, UGA's enrollment grew every year with student population reaching 3,000 by 1937 and almost 4,000 by 1941. Through President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal , UGA received a $2 million infusion of funding and an additional $1 million from the state legislature. The university used the new funds to make a number of improvements to the campus from 1936 to the early 1940s. Many renovation projects were undertaken including the establishment of five new residence halls, a dining hall, eight new academic buildings, a nursery school, and several auxiliary facilities. An engineering professor Rudolph Driftmier and architect Roy Hitchcock were responsible for the design of several buildings in the neoclassical style , giving the campus a homogeneous and distinctive appearance. The funds were also used to pave roads, build sidewalks, and improve the campus's landscaping.

[ 43 ] Racial integration and the mid-20th century [ edit ] See also: University of Georgia desegregation riot The dean of the College of Education in 1941, Walter Cocking , was fired by Georgia Governor Eugene Talmadge in a controversial decision known as the Cocking affair .

[ 47 ] Talmadge was motivated by his belief that Cocking favored racial integration. The governor's interference in the workings of USG's board of regents prompted a response by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools , which stripped UGA and nine other schools in the system of their accreditation. The issue became a major point of contention in Talmadge's 1942 re-election campaign. After his loss, a constitutional amendment passed by the state legislature gave the board independence from political interference which led to the schools quickly regaining their accreditation.

[ 43 ] As the United States entered World War II , enrollment among male students dropped significantly, allowing female students to outnumber male students for the first time in the school's history. The United States Navy set up a Navy Pre-Flight School on the campus, occupying many of the university's buildings and constructing many new buildings and athletic facilities used by generations of students in the following decades.

In 1945, UGA accepted a donation of about 100 paintings from the New York art collector Alfred Holbrook and created the Georgia Museum of Art . In 1946, the School of Veterinary Medicine was re-established as a separate school, 13 years after it was discontinued as part of the agricultural college.

[ 45 ] The following year, the quarterly literary journal The Georgia Review began publication in 1947.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] After Jonathan Rogers ' brief tenure as president (1949–1950), [ 27 ] Omer Clyde Aderhold started his 17-year-long stint as UGA president. During his tenure, the university sold Coordinate Campus to the U.S. Navy . He opened the school's main library, the Ilah Dunlap-Little Memorial Library, in 1952, and in 1964, established the School of Social Work .

[ 45 ] The university also built a new Science Center on South Campus consisting of six buildings.

[ 48 ] After UGA's pharmacy school moved to the new facility on the South Campus, the two portions of the campus took on distinct characteristics, with North Campus focused on arts, humanities, and law, and South Campus focused on natural sciences and agricultural programs.

[ 49 ] The Holmes-Hunter Academic Building Until January 1961, Georgia state law required racial segregation in publicly funded higher education. On January 6, 1961, the District Court mandated that UGA immediately admit two African American teenagers, Hamilton E. Holmes and Charlayne Hunter , who were previously denied admission in 1959 on the basis of race. This court order was quickly followed by an injunction preventing the enforcement of the segregation-mandating state law. On January 11, a riot formed outside Charlayne Hunter's dormitory window, which "shouted racial insults, and tossed firecrackers, bottles and bricks at the dormitory window". Dean Williams suspended the two students for "their personal safety", but they returned to classes on January 16 following a court order. The university faculty subsequently formed a night patrol to help ensure the peace.

[ 50 ] Holmes graduated Phi Beta Kappa and was the first African-American student to attend the Emory University School of Medicine , where he earned his MD in 1967 and later became a professor of orthopedics and associate dean at Emory, the medical director at Grady Memorial Hospital , and a trustee of the University of Georgia Foundation, the university's private fund-raising organization.

[ 51 ] Hunter (later, Hunter-Gault) graduated with a degree in journalism and was awarded two Emmys and a Peabody for excellence in broadcast journalism. Commemorating the 40th anniversary of when Holmes and Hunter "walked through the Arch and into the Academic Building" to register for classes on January 9, 1961, the university renamed the campus building where they registered as the Holmes-Hunter Academic Building. The university now presents the Holmes-Hunter Lectures series, which brings noted African-American speakers to the campus each year to discuss racial issues.

[ 51 ] In June 1961, Holmes and Hunter were joined by another African American, Mary Frances Early , who transferred to the school as a graduate student. Before Holmes and Hunter, Early became the first African American to graduate from UGA in 1962. The College of Education later established a professorship in her honor.

[ 52 ] In February 2020, the UGA College of Education was officially named in honor of Mary Frances Early.

Late 20th century [ edit ] Zell Miller , UGA alumnus and former Governor and U.S. Senator who helped establish the HOPE Scholarship In 1968, Fred Davison was appointed UGA president and served in the position for 19 years.

[ 53 ] During his tenure, the school's research budget increased from $15.6 million to more than $90 million. UGA inaugurated the School of Environmental Design , was designated as a Sea Grant College , and built 15 new buildings on campus. By the 1970s, the University of Georgia ranked among the top 50 research universities in the U.S.

[ 49 ] and in 1973, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education designated UGA as a "Research 1 Doctoral University with very high research activity" .

[ 54 ] By the time the school celebrated its bicentennial with a 15-month-long celebration, student enrollment had grown to about 25,000.

[ 49 ] In the end, Davison's tenure as president was marred by controversy surrounding the dismissal of Jan Kemp , a faculty member who also tutored student athletes.

[ 49 ] Kemp filed a lawsuit against the university for her termination; it garnered national media attention and led to criticism of instances of lax academic standards for a few students participating in some of UGA's athletic programs.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] The courts finally awarded Kemp more than $1 million, leading to Davison's resignation in 1986 and student athlete academic standards revisions.

[ 49 ] Henry King Stanford served as interim president before the appointment of Charles Knapp in 1987.

[ 58 ] Together with UGA alumnus and Georgia Governor Zell Miller , Knapp helped establish the state's HOPE Scholarship in 1993 with funds appropriated from the new state lottery .

[ 59 ] Knapp also was a founding member of the Georgia Research Alliance , and construction projects totaling more than $400 million were started during his administration, including the Biological Sciences Complex (1992), Ramsey Student Center for Physical Activities (1995), the Performing Arts Center, Hodgson Hall (1996), the music building (1996), the Georgia Museum of Art (1996), Dean Rusk Hall (1996), and the UGA Welcome Center (1996). The campus hosted four events in the 1996 Summer Olympics : rhythmic gymnastics , volleyball , women's Gold Medal football match , and men's Gold Medal football match .

[ 60 ] In 1997, Knapp was succeeded by Michael Adams , who served as UGA president for 16 years, well into the 21st century.

[ 61 ] After his retirement as president, Knapp continued to serve by joining UGA's Institute of Higher Education as a part-time Distinguished Public Service Fellow and as a professor of economics in the university's Terry College of Business .

21st century [ edit ] The Peabody Awards (statuettes pictured) originated at, and are awarded by, the University of Georgia Adams began a strategic plan to grow the university's academic programs in the new century.

[ 61 ] In 2001, UGA inaugurated the College of Environment and Design and the School of Public and International Affairs , the first new schools to open since 1964.

[ 62 ] The strategic plan also chose medicine and health sciences as a major focus of growth and development. Together with Provost Karen Holbrook and Arnett Mace (who succeed Holbrook), Adams opened the Biomedical and Health Sciences Institute, the UGA Cancer Center, the Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases, and the Regenerative Bioscience Center.

[ 61 ] In 2005, the College of Public Health was created to bring together the various medical and health sciences programs.

[ 62 ] In 2011, UGA purchased back the former campus of the State Normal School from the U.S. Navy to create the UGA Health Sciences Campus. The Health Sciences Campus provides additional medical and health sciences programs, some in partnership with the Medical College of Georgia . The newly reacquired campus also became home to the College of Public Health.

[ 61 ] The Odum School of Ecology (2007) and the College of Engineering (2012) became the fourth and fifth schools to open during Adams's tenure.

[ 62 ] After Adams's retirement on June 30, 2013, Jere Morehead was appointed as UGA's 22nd president. Morehead is an alumnus of UGA's law school and previously served as provost and vice president of academic affairs.

[ 63 ] Under Morehead, UGA continues its focus on research with a $458 million budget as of the 2017 fiscal year, placing 54th on the National Science Foundation rankings.

[ 64 ] In 2015, the College of Veterinary Medicine moved its teaching hospital to a new off-campus facility, leaving its previous building available for research and other uses.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] In September 2017, UGA used a combination of private and public funds to complete the second of three phases to build the Terry College of Business complex. The project has four buildings completed and will include a total of six buildings upon completion of the third phase.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] In 2020 the university concluded its fundraising campaign, after raising $1.45 billion.

Until the School of Medicine is staffed, in addition to the colleges and schools, the university is home to the University of Georgia/Medical College of Georgia Medical Partnership that provides education leading to the Doctor of Medicine ( M.D.

) degree from the University of Georgia as well as extensive facilities for medically related education and research at the University of Georgia.

[ 70 ] In the construction phase is a $100 million facility set to open in 2026 to provide training for at least 60 more University of Georgia medical students.

[ 71 ] The President of the University of Georgia ( Jere Morehead ) is the head administrator and is appointed and overseen by the Georgia Board of Regents . University of Georgia has had 22 presidents since its founding in 1785. Each individual college and school is headed by a dean . The university has a student-to-faculty ratio of 17 students per faculty member.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] According to the 2018–2019 estimated cost of attendance, based on a nine-month academic year for an average undergraduate student, the tuition and fees for Georgia residents is $11,830, and $30,404 for non-residents. The tuition and fees for an average international undergraduate student (based on a nine-month academic year) is $30,392.

72000379 Added to NRHP March 16, 1972 Main article: Campuses of the University of Georgia The University of Georgia's main campus is made up of 465 buildings covering an area of about 762 acres (308 hectares). The campus was ranked among the nation’s most beautiful by Travel + Leisure .

[ 74 ] The university owns an additional 39,743 acres (160.83 km 2 ) of land in 31 counties across Georgia, and has off-campus facilities including in Washington D.C.

, at Trinity College of Oxford University , at Cortona , Italy, and at Monteverde , Costa Rica. Near the main campus is a Botanical Garden and the university's 56-acre UGA Health Sciences Campus. As of October 2020, UGA employed 11,127 people of which more than 2,500 are faculty members.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] The main campus sits across from Athens, a consolidated city–county located 60 miles northeast of downtown Atlanta , Georgia. The city is the hometown of several popular musical artists including the American rock bands the B-52's and R.E.M.

Rolling Stone magazine named UGA among "Top Ten Schools that Rock".

[ 77 ] In August 2015, Outside magazine named Athens sixth on a list of "The 16 Best Places to Live in the U.S." [ 78 ] [ 79 ] The campuses' dominant architectural themes are Federal , Classical and Antebellum style. Though there have been many additions, changes, and augmentations, the University of Georgia's campus maintains its historic character.

[ 80 ] In 2000, the entire campus was designated as an arboretum, the University of Georgia Campus Arboretum . It is estimated to be home to about 9,000 trees with over 154 identified species including native trees such magnolias , red oaks , white oaks , and beeches , as well as non-native trees such as the North Africa Atlas cedar , the Chinese parasol and royal paulownia , and the Japanese zelkova and black pine .

[ 81 ] North Campus [ edit ] The North Campus is bounded by Baldwin Street to the south, Lumpkin Street to the west, Broad Street to the north and traditionally by Jackson Street to the east, but also extends past Jackson Street to East Campus Road. Several of the buildings that make up the old campus are designated as historic, [ 82 ] covering part of the 37 acres (15 hectares) originally gifted to the university in 1801.

[ 23 ] The entire Old North Campus of the University of Georgia is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district .

[ 82 ] Located at a central location in North Campus [ 82 ] and constructed in 1806 as the first permanent building, Old College is the oldest building in Athens and one of the oldest in Northeast Georgia . The building closely resembles Yale University's Connecticut Hall . It was designed with identical front and back to allow the university to grow in either direction. Currently housing the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences , the building originally served both instructional and residential purposes.

[ 83 ] New College was built in 1823 as a residence hall and was rebuilt in 1832.

[ 84 ] Other historic buildings in the National Historic District include Waddel Hall, Demosthenian Hall, The chapel, Phi Kappa Hall, Lustrat Hall, Moore College, and Holmes–Hunter Academic Building. Named after UGA's fifth president, Waddel Hall is the second-oldest building on campus. Built in the Federal style of architecture in 1821, it is also one of the smallest buildings on campus.

[ 85 ] Home to the oldest student organization and debate society at UGA, the 1824 Demosthenian Hall houses the Demosthenian Literary Society named after the Greek orator Demosthenes .

[ 86 ] Founded in 1803, the Demosthenian is among the oldest literary societies in the English-speaking world.

[ 87 ] Located between New College and Demosthenian Hall, The chapel is a Greek Revival-style building which resembles a classic temple. Considered "the most beautiful building on campus", the interior features a large painting of the nave and aisles of the St. Peter's Basilica , painted by the artist George Cooke .

[ 88 ] Also built in the Greek Revival style in 1836, Phi Kappa Hall is home to the university's second-oldest student organization and debate society, Phi Kappa Literary Society , founded in 1820 to rival the Demosthenian Literary Society.

[ 89 ] Founders Memorial Garden The seventh-oldest building on campus, Lustrat Hall was originally built in 1847, north of its current location. Named after its last faculty occupant, it is the only remaining faculty residence house from Old North Campus. Used for a variety of purposes in the past, the building most recently houses the Office of Legal Affairs.

[ 85 ] Built in 1874, Moore College is the only remaining building constructed during post-Civil War Reconstruction . Originally home to the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Moore College currently houses the university's Honors Program.

[ 90 ] The Holmes/Hunter Academic Building was simply known as the Academic Building when it was originally assembled in 1905. Following a Beaux-Arts architectural design by engineering professor Charles Strahan, the building was constructed by inserting a new building in between the older Ivy Building and Old Library. In 2001, the building was renamed after the first two African-American students at UGA. It houses the Office of the Registrar, and several other administrative offices.

[ 91 ] Also listed in the National Register of Historic Places is the Founders Memorial Garden which is named in honor of the Ladies Garden Club of Athens. Founded in 1891, it was the first garden club in the United States.

[ 92 ] [ 93 ] The Arch Throughout the historic buildings, several architectural, sculptural, and landscape features adorn the North Campus. Chief among them is The Arch which serves as the traditional entrance to the campus. Built in 1858 and modeled after the Great Seal of the State of Georgia , the area near the three-columned gate is a popular venue for the staging of demonstrations, gatherings, protests, and rallies.

[ 94 ] Although the Seal's three pillars represent the state's three branches of government, [ 95 ] the pillars of The Arch are usually taken to represent the Georgia Constitution 's three principles of wisdom, justice, and moderation, which are engraved over the pillars of the Seal.

[ 96 ] On the opposite side of the Arch Quad, at the front of the Old College building sits a statue of the university's founder Abraham Baldwin, installed by the University of Georgia Alumni Association.

[ 97 ] The President's Club Garden, first planted in 1973 on the opposite side of the Old College building, honors the thousands of families who have made major financial contributions to the university.

[ 98 ] A fountain named after Hubert B. Owens and built in 1989 is tucked in the space between Old College, Lustrat House, and the Administration Building. Serving as a UGA faculty member for 45 years, Owen was responsible for initiating the university's landscape architecture program, which later grew into the College of Environment and Design.

[ 99 ] The Administration Building is another one of the later additions to the North Campus built in 1905 with $50,000 donated to the university from a major contributor, the philanthropist George Foster Peabody . It was the first building on campus designed to be fireproof in light of the fact that several fires in UGA's history have destroyed key buildings. Originally used as the location for a library, it houses the offices of the university president and other senior administrative offices.

[ 100 ] Hirsch Hall was built in 1932 in Georgian style and named after Harold Hirsch who for a long period served as general counsel to The Coca-Cola Company . The building is home to the School of Law and the Alexander Campbell King Law Library located in a north-side addition built in 1967. Hirsch Hall connects by way of an overhead bridge to the J. Alton Hosch Law Library Annex built in 1981 and named after the former dean of the law school.

[ 101 ] Ilah Dunlap Little Memorial Library The university's main library, the Ilah Dunlap Little Memorial Library, was built with funds bequeathed by its namesake, the wife of a UGA alumnus who stipulated several design requirements including that it face north across the mall towards Old College. Home to the University of Georgia Press and the Georgia Review , the library serves as the headquarters to a network of secondary libraries located throughout the campus. Following the addition of a seven-story annex in 1974, the library became the third-largest academic building at UGA and the largest in North Campus.

[ 102 ] The main library is part of a quad consisting of Hirsch Hall, Old College, Waddell Hall and Peabody Hall.

[ 103 ] Although the aforementioned George Foster Peabody also contributed to funds used to build Peabody Hall, the building is actually named after George Peabody who in an 1869 testamentary trust created a $2.25-million fund to benefit several universities in the South . The University of Georgia combined $40,000 from this fund with other contributions to construct Peabody Hall which houses the Departments of Religion and Philosophy and the Institute of Native American Studies.

[ 104 ] South Campus [ edit ] Located across Field Street from Central Campus to its north, South Campus is encircled by East Campus Road to its east, Pinecrest Drive to the south, and Lumpkin Street to the west. It is connected to the areas to its north by way of the Jim Gillis Bridge, named after the former director of the Georgia State Highway Board.

[ 105 ] South Campus is the largest of the five segments of the UGA campus, latitudinally stretching for more than a mile. Originally begun as an expansion to accommodate the growing agricultural programs in an area known as "Ag Hill", it is home most of the university's science and engineer programs.

[ 106 ] In 2006, work was completed on D. W. Brooks Mall to give the campus a more green aesthetic similar to North Campus, replacing parking lots and a section of the street by the same name which bisected the area lengthwise.

[ 107 ] Lumpkin House on Cedar Street on the UGA campus Lumpkin House, also known as "Rock House", is the oldest building on South Campus, built in 1844. The building is named after its original owner, Wilson Lumpkin , the former Georgia congressman, governor, and U.S. Senator who designed and built the house as his retirement home. In 1970, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

[ 108 ] The second-oldest building, named after the state legislator James J. Conner, sits on one of the highest points in Athens. Built in the Renaissance Revival style , Conner Hall also serves the CAES. Barrow Hall, built in 1911, is the third-oldest building in South Campus and serves a variety of academic programs. Originally known as the Farm Mechanics Building, the building was renamed after Chancellor David C. Barrow, during whose tenure it was constructed.

[ 109 ] Home to the College of Family and Consumer Sciences, Dawson Hall was built in 1932 to house the university's growing home economics department, then part of the College of Agriculture. In 1971, the school added an annex to Dawson Hall and later renamed it after Mary Spiers who was dean of the School of Home Economics from 1954 to 1971.

[ 110 ] The College of Family and Consumer Sciences also has five other buildings, built in 1939 and 1940, known collectively as the McPhaul Center.

[ 111 ] On the curved hill between Dawson Hall and Sanford Stadium, a plan envisioned in 1953, proposed the construction of a Science Center to house the university's various scientific programs. Between 1959 and 1960, six buildings were constructed to each house studies in physics, Food Sciences, Geography–Geology, Chemistry, Biological Sciences, and Poultry Science.

[ 112 ] Located south of the Food Sciences Building, the Museum of Natural History manages several collections of artifacts and specimens from archaeology, biology, geology, and paleontology located throughout the buildings on campus.

[ 113 ] The Science Library was built south of Dawson Hall in 1968 to supplement the Science Center complex. Containing a thirteen-feet and over-2,500-pound skeleton of a giant North American ground sloth , a foyer connects the Science Library with the Boyd Graduate Studies Building also built in 1968.

[ 114 ] Paul D. Coverdell Center for Biomedical and Health Sciences Named after U.S. Senator Paul D. Coverdell , the Paul D. Coverdell Center for Biomedical and Health Sciences is a $40-million facility [ 63 ] with 172,180 square feet (16,000 m 2 ) of space, giving enough room for about 275 scientists, staff and graduate students. The center was specifically designed to maximize energy efficiency and it was built with local and recycled materials.

[ 115 ] Laboratory intensive groups at the Coverdell Center include the Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases, [ 116 ] [ 117 ] and the Biomedical Health Sciences Institute. Former President George H. W. Bush spoke at the center's grand opening in 2006.

[ 115 ] In 2016, the university also opened the Science Learning Center, a 116,000-square-foot (10,800 m 2 ) facility located near Stegeman Coliseum .

The Driftmier Engineering Center, named after a campus engineer and the head of the former Agricultural Engineering Division of the College of Agriculture. Partnering with Roy Hitchcock, Rudolph H. Driftmier was responsible for the design and construction of 15 buildings on campus from 1930 to 1965. The 110,000-square-foot (10,000 m 2 ) building renamed after Driftmier in 1982 was constructed in 1966 and is now home to the College of Engineering .

[ 118 ] The Georgia Center for Continuing Education & Hotel [ 119 ] is also located on South Campus. The building hosts many seminars and conferences every year. The Georgia Center was built in 1957.

[ 120 ] The center is also home to the WUGA , an affiliate of the National Public Radio .

[ 120 ] Central Campus [ edit ] Bounded by Lumpkin Street to the west and East Campus Road to the east, Central Campus was developed on the remaining woodland area between the larger and older North and South Campuses. Development began in 1910 with Memorial Hall which remained unfinished until 1925 due to financial constraints.

[ 121 ] Originally envisioned as a student athletic facility and constructed with a swimming pool and gymnasium, Memorial Hall has served a wide variety of purposes before becoming home to the offices of the vice president of student affairs and several other administrative offices.

[ 122 ] Several former athletic facilities were located in this area before they were replaced by newer academic buildings, student life centers, and residence halls. Of these athletic facilities, only Sanford Stadium remains and continues to dominate Central Campus.

[ 123 ] Zell B. Miller Learning Center Located in the northwest corner, the Fine Arts Building was modeled in the neoclassical architectural style and built in 1941 with funds from the Public Works Administration , part of the New Deal initiated in the 1930s. The building covers an area about the size of a city block, and the interior features a giant mural by French-American artist Jean Charlot . At the time of its construction, it was the largest and most expensive academic building on campus.

[ 124 ] The Zell B. Miller Learning Center became the largest academic building in Central Campus when it was built in 2003 with a footprint of 6.5 acres (2.6 hectares). With 26 classrooms and lecture halls and a total of 2,200 seats, the Learning Center is also probably the most heavily used by students. In 2009, the building was renamed in honor of UGA alumnus Zell B. Miller who went on to serve as the 79th Governor of Georgia and later as the U.S. Senator from Georgia .

[ 125 ] Another heavily used building is the Dean Tate Student Center built in 1983 and expanded in 2009. The LEED Gold-certified building features a green roof and 75,000 gallon cistern to catch rainwater for use in irrigation and flushing toilets. The building was named after William Tate, the former dean of men.

[ 126 ] The Psychology and Journalism Building was built on grounds which formerly housed the university's tennis courts and gymnasium, Woodruff Hall. In 1967, a $6.1 million construction project created the building to house two of the largest departments at the university, the psychology department, part of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, and the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, named after the former editor of The Atlanta Constitution .

[ 127 ] Other buildings in the area include Clark Howell Hall, built in 1937 as a dormitory but which later became home to the UGA Career Center, [ 128 ] and the UGA Bookstore built in 1968.

[ 129 ] West Campus [ edit ] Richard B. Russell Jr. Special Collections Libraries Building Several residential halls are located in what is known as West Campus. It is made up of eight residence halls built in the 1960s and a pre-existing private residence hall, Oglethorpe House, which the university purchased in 1979. Lipscomb Hall, Mell Hall, Creswell Hall, Russell Hall, Brumby Hall, Hill Hall, Church Hall, and Boggs Hall are all named after former UGA presidents, deans, and administrators.

[ 130 ] Other notable buildings west of the campus include the Wray-Nicholson House, which was built in 1825, named after two businessmen who previously occupied the house and now home to the UGA Alumni Association; [ 131 ] The Richard B. Russell Jr. Special Collections Libraries Building, built in 2012, was named after the former Georgia governor and senator , and currently houses the Hargrett Rare Book and Manuscript Library, including the University Archives; the Richard B. Russell Jr. Library for Political Research and Studies; and the Walter J. Brown Media Archives and Peabody Awards Collection.

[ 132 ] In 2013, the university began construction on Terry College of Business Complex.

[ 133 ] A total of six buildings were to be completed in a three-phase construction project. The first phase completed in 2015 led to the opening of Correll Hall.

[ 134 ] Phase II was completed in September 2017, opening Amos Hall, Benson Hall and Moore-Rooker Hall. All of the buildings were named after major contributors to the business school.

[ 135 ] Construction then began on the third phase of the project in 2018 to include two more buildings named Ivester and Orkin Hall which were completed in 2020.

[ 134 ] [ 135 ] East Campus [ edit ] The newest addition to the campus, East Campus is demarcated by College Station Road to the south, East Campus Road to the west, River Road to the north and stretches to the Athens Perimeter or Loop 10 to the east. Its most northern building is the Performing Arts Center. Its main concert hall, the 1,100-seat Hodgson Hall, has hosted the performances of notable orchestras such the Royal Philharmonic and the St. Petersburg Philharmonic , and regularly hosts seasonal performances by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra . The center also holds the smaller Ramsey Hall, which stages performances by solo and small chamber groups .

[ 136 ] East Campus is also home to the Georgia Museum of Art located just south of the Performing Arts Center. The museum's collection began with a donation of paintings by American artists from the art collector Alfred Heber Holbrook who developed a close friendship with the head of UGA Art Department, Lamar Dodd . Holbrook subsequently moved to Athens to become the museum's director, donated more than 900 works, and served as director for 25 years. In 1982, the Georgia General Assembly designated the museum as the official state museum of art. The current building in which the museum is located was built in 1996 and expanded in 2011. The building received a Gold LEED certification its "use of materials and construction strategies to achieve environmental sustainability." [ 137 ] The Ramsey Student Physical Activities Center is located on East Campus. It was built in 1995 and named in honor of Eugenia A. and Bernard Ramsey .

[ 361 ] Pandora is the yearbook of the University of Georgia; its first issue was published in 1886.

[ 362 ] [ 363 ] Athletics [ edit ] Main article: Georgia Bulldogs See also: Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate ; Auburn–Georgia football rivalry ; and Florida–Georgia football rivalry The first football squad at the University of Georgia in 1892.

The University of Georgia varsity athletic teams participate in the NCAA's Division I FBS as a member of the Southeastern Conference . Since the 1997–1998 season, UGA has seven top ten rankings in the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) Directors' Cup , a numerical ranking based on the success of universities in all varsity sports .

[ 364 ] The university has won national championships in football , women's gymnastics, women's equestrian , baseball , tennis (men's and women's), golf (men's and women's), indoor and outdoor track & field, and women's swimming and diving. The Gym Dogs, the university's women's gymnastics team, have an NCAA-leading 10 national championships in gymnastics, including five consecutive championships from 2005 to 2009.

The Bulldogs' most historic rivalry is with the nearby Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets . However, major rivalries have grown since, including the rivalry with the Florida Gators , and with the Auburn Tigers , referred to as the " Deep South's Oldest Rivalry " in reference to the first football game played between the two teams in 1892 and the more than one hundred meetings since. In 2011, The Huffington Post named the Florida–Georgia football rivalry one of college football's top 10 rivalries.

[ 365 ] The university also hosts several non-varsity sports, including wrestling, [ 366 ] men's soccer , crew , [ 367 ] ultimate frisbee, [ 368 ] [ 369 ] rugby , lacrosse , ice hockey , and sailing. Georgia's men's lacrosse team has won the South Eastern Lacrosse Conference three times, in 1998, 2007, and 2008, and received an automatic bid to the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association national tournament, while the women's team earned an at-large bid to the WDIA National Tournament in 2007.

1996 Summer Olympic Games [ edit ] The Olympic flag waves at the 1996 games The University of Georgia played an instrumental role in Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics . The University of Georgia conducted a majority of the preliminary studies for the economic impact of bringing the Olympic Games to Atlanta, and hosted many Olympic events .

[ 370 ] In 1987, Atlanta attorney and former football player at the University of Georgia, William "Billy" Payne , conceived the idea of hosting the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. Atlanta mayor Andrew Young was among the first to join Payne in the quest to develop a bid and sell the proposal, first to local business leaders, then to the U.S. Olympic Committee, and finally to the members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

[ 371 ] The home of the Bulldogs hosted the medal round of the men's and women's Olympic football (soccer) in July 1996.

Sanford Stadium was temporarily converted into a soccer stadium which saw the removal of the privet hedges surrounding the playing field. The hedges had been symbolic to UGA since the early 1930s. The hedges were restored after the Olympic games. In 1996, UGA's High Point was selected as the training site for the U.S. Dressage Team , which competed in the Summer Olympic games at the International Horse Park in Conyers, Georgia .

[ 372 ] The university's basketball stadium, Stegeman Coliseum , was the venue for Volleyball and Rhythmic Gymnastics .

[ 163 ] Traditions [ edit ] School colors [ edit ] UGA athletics logo The University of Georgia's original colors included old gold , until the intense rivalry between Georgia Tech and Georgia around 1891 resulted in a skirmish over colors. Georgia students and alumni declared yellow an unfit color for the Georgia Bulldogs , deeming it a cowardly color. After the 1893 football game against Georgia Tech , University of Georgia President, Charles Herty , removed old gold as an official school color.

Crimson (also referred to as "Good Old Georgia Red") and black have been the official colors ever since.

[ 373 ] The decision to include crimson red is also thought to be a tribute to the state of Georgia and a reminder of the university's flagship status.

Kaolinite , commonly referred to as "Georgia red clay" is commonly found throughout the state, especially in the Red Hills Region . The red color that is so evident in Georgia soils is due primarily to iron oxides .

The mascot [ edit ] Uga VI , the official live mascot of the Georgia Bulldogs 1999–2008 Bulldogs have been on the sidelines for UGA athletic events since at least the 1800s.

[ 374 ] The origin of the English Bulldog representing UGA athletic teams came from Yale University , with whom UGA had strong ties in its early years. Many early buildings and campus plans followed the layout of Yale.

[ 375 ] The bulldog mascot stems from the university's founding father and first president, Abraham Baldwin , who was a graduate of Yale. The Bulldog mascots were thought to be a tribute to Baldwin's alma mater. The term "Georgia Bulldogs" to identify a Georgia team was first coined on November 3, 1920, by Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer Morgan Blake. After a 0–0 tie with the University of Virginia in Charlottesville on November 6, 1920, Atlanta Constitution writer Cliff Wheatley used the name "Bulldogs" in his story five times. This name for UGA teams caught on and has been used ever since.

[ 375 ] Uga the Bulldog is the official live mascot of the Georgia Bulldogs . Uga is from a line owned by Frank W. (Sonny) Seiler of Savannah, Georgia since 1956. The current line began with Uga I, a solid white English Bulldog who was the grandson of a former Georgia mascot who made the trip to the 1943 Rose Bowl . Perhaps the most famous Uga was Uga V who made appearances in the movie Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil .

Uga V was also featured on the cover of the April 1997 edition of Sports Illustrated .

[ 376 ] Uga XI became the mascot in 2023.

The University of Georgia is the only major college that buries its mascots within the confines of its stadium.

[ citation needed ] Ugas I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX are buried in marble vaults near the main gate in the embankment of the south stands of Sanford Stadium. Epitaphs to the dogs are inscribed in bronze, and before each home game, flowers are placed on their graves.

[ 377 ] The Chapel Bell [ edit ] The ringing of the Chapel Bell is a tradition held by students and alumni of the University of Georgia The Chapel Bell is a historic monument and long-standing tradition of the University of Georgia. The Chapel Bell is located on the historic North Campus. Built in 1832, when Protestant orthodoxy dominated the campus region, the chapel was a center of campus activities. A daily religious service, which students were required to attend, were held there, as were assemblies and commencements . The bell was also rung to mark the beginning and the end of class.

[ 378 ] Over the years, the Chapel Bell has served as an athletic tradition at the University of Georgia. The ringing of the Chapel Bell after a Georgia victory is a tradition that has endured since the 1890s. In Georgia football's early days, Herty Field was located only yards from the chapel, and first-year students were compelled to ring the bell until midnight in celebration of a Bulldog victory. Today, students, alumni, fans and townspeople still rush to the chapel to ring the bell after a victory.

[ 375 ] The bell is also utilized for University meetings and events, weddings and remembrance ringing. The bell was rung in memory of victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001. After the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, the University of Georgia partook in a nationwide mourning by ringing the Chapel Bell in honor of the victims of the shooting.

[ 379 ] On October 27, 2007, as tradition warrants, Georgia fans rang the Chapel Bell to celebrate the 42–30 win over the university's archrival, the Florida Gators . The excitement caused the yoke holding the 877 lb. bell to give way, and it fell from the support platform. The university has returned the bell to its historic post and as of November 2017 [update] , it still rings daily across campus.

Founders Week [ edit ] January 27, 1785, is the date the University of Georgia became the first public university to have a charter granted. Each year, January 27 is commemorated to honor UGA's place in the history of American colleges and universities . The tradition began in 2002 and is now celebrated as Founders Week. During Founders Week, a series of celebrations are hosted by various campus departments including the Student Alumni Association and the Student Government Association.

The Emeriti Scholars, a group of retired faculty members especially known for their teaching abilities and continued involvement in the university's academic life, sponsor the Founders Day Lecture. The lecture is held in the UGA Chapel and has become a Founders Day tradition, drawing alumni, students, faculty, esteemed guests and members of the community.

The Arch [ edit ] The Arch at the University of Georgia In 1857, the University of Georgia constructed a cast iron representation of the architectural elements featured on the obverse of the Great Seal of the state of Georgia. It stands at the north entrance of the campus, and has become known as The Arch. Fashioned from existing material, The Arch is a representation but not an exact replica of the architectural elements of the Seal. Originally serving both symbolic and practical functions, it was connected to a barrier which kept cows from roaming over parts of the campus, and was initially known as The Gate.

[ 380 ] It serves as the official icon and a historic landmark for the university. Since the 1900s, tradition has held that students may not pass beneath the Arch until they have received a diploma from the University of Georgia. Those who walked under the Arch prior to graduation commencement were said never to graduate. The tradition began when Daniel Huntley Redfearn, Class of 1910, arrived as a freshman from Boston, Georgia and vowed not to pass beneath the Arch until he had graduated. One of Redfearn's professors heard the vow and repeated it to his class, and the tradition has stood ever since. Many freshmen, learning of the tradition during orientation or from other sources still choose to honor the century-old tradition. Years of following the tradition are visible on the concrete steps leading to the Arch. Steps to each side have been worn down over the years as undergraduates have kept their vows.

[ 381 ] The Arch has been a site of historic political demonstrations . In 1961, when UGA officials desegregated the university with the admission of its first two African-American students, Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne Hunter-Gault . The Arch was a witness to students protesting both for and against segregation in the protesting the Persian Gulf War and a demonstration following the 1970 shootings at Kent State University . In 2001, along with the Chapel Bell, the Arch was the site of a memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks .

The fight song and "Alma Mater" [ edit ] " Glory, Glory " is the rally song for the Georgia Bulldogs . "Glory, Glory" is sung to the tune of " The Battle Hymn of the Republic ". It was sung at games as early as the 1890s, but arranged in its present form by musician-composer Hugh Hodgson in 1915. There have been many Bulldog songs through the years and at least two collections dating back to 1909 have been published, but "Glory, Glory" has been the most accepted among students and alumni. The only known original reference to the piece is in a history of the Redcoat Band written in 1962, which briefly mentions the march as "Georgia's first original school song" and notes that "all copies of the work have been lost." The document is kept in the university's Hargrett Library for rare and historic documents.

[ 382 ] Although "Glory, Glory" is generally thought to be the school's fight song, the official fight song is "Hail to Georgia." Both are performed at football games by the Georgia Redcoat Marching Band , which plays the fight song after field goals and extra points, and "Glory, Glory" after touchdowns, interceptions, and victories. First stablished in 1905 as a military band, the Redcoat Band now has over 430 members and represents the university in sporting and community events.

[ 383 ] The "Alma Mater", the official school song of the University of Georgia, is set to the tune of " Annie Lisle ", a popular 1857 ballad by H. S. Thompson . The lyrics to "Alma Mater", penned by J.B. Wright Jr., and Gail Carter Dendy, are unique to UGA. The song is sung at commencement and various official events of the University of Georgia.

[ 384 ] Playing "Between the Hedges" and Sanford Stadium [ edit ] Sanford Stadium is the on-campus playing venue for football at the University of Georgia in Athens. The 92,746-seat stadium is the seventh largest stadium in the National Collegiate Athletic Association and has a grass (versus synthetic) field. The stadium is the eighth largest non-racing stadium in the United States and the 14th largest such stadium in the world. The stadium played host to the Olympic medal competition of men's and women's Olympic football (soccer) at the 1996 Summer Olympics .

[ 385 ] [ 386 ] A panoramic view from Sanford's upper North Deck during the October 14, 2006 home game against the Vanderbilt Commodores (picture does not show newly constructed additions from 2009 to Tate Student Center) The University of Georgia playing "Between the Hedges" is a reference to Sanford Stadium that dates back to the early 1930s. The famous Chinese privet hedges that surround Sanford's playing field were only one foot high when the stadium was dedicated in 1929 and were protected by a wooden fence. Sports writers, referring to an upcoming home game, were said to observe "that the Bulldogs will have their opponent "between the hedges." The phrase was coined by the Atlanta sportswriter Grantland Rice .

[ 387 ] Games played there are said to be played "Between the Hedges" due to the privet hedges, which had stood around the field since 1929, but removed in the summer of 1996 so that soccer could be played for the 1996 Summer Olympics; new, albeit considerably shorter, hedges were restored in the fall of 1996. The hedges have been dubbed Hedges II by UGA fans.

[ 388 ] The Dawg Walk [ edit ] The Dawg Walk is a Saturday football tradition and celebration at University of Georgia home games when UGA students and fans line up in the Tate Center parking lot to form a tunnel that greets the players and coaches as they enter Sanford Stadium . The team enters the stadium through Gate 10 at Sanford Stadium to the music of the Redcoat Marching Band . The march is often led by the team's costumed mascot Hairy Dawg .

[ 389 ] The Dawg Walk is preceded by two show section shows. The Redcoat Sousaphones perform a warm up concert in the Tate Center assembly area, while the Redcoat Drumline performs a drumshow in the parking lot.
