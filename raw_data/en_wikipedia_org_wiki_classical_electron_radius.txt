It links the classical electrostatic self-interaction energy of a homogeneous charge distribution to the electron's rest mass energy .  According to modern understanding, the electron has no internal structure, and hence no size attributable to it.  Nevertheless, it is useful to define a length that characterizes electron interactions in atomic-scale problems.  The CODATA value for the classical electron radius is [ 1 ] r e = 1 4 π π ε ε 0 e 2 m e c 2 = {\displaystyle r_{\text{e}}={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {e^{2}}{m_{\text{e}}c^{2}}}=} 2.817 940 3205 (13) × 10 −15 m where e {\displaystyle e} is the elementary charge , m e {\displaystyle m_{\text{e}}} is the electron mass , c {\displaystyle c} is the speed of light , and ε ε 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}} is the permittivity of free space .

[ 2 ] This is about three times larger than the charge radius of the proton .

The classical electron radius is sometimes known as the Lorentz radius or the Thomson scattering length.  It is one of a trio of related scales of length, the other two being the Bohr radius a 0 {\displaystyle a_{0}} and the reduced Compton wavelength of the electron ⁠ λ λ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle \lambda \!\!\!{\bar {}}} ⁠ .   Any one of these three length scales can be written in terms of any other using the fine-structure constant α α {\displaystyle \alpha } : r e = λ λ ¯ ¯ α α = a 0 α α 2 .

{\displaystyle r_{\text{e}}=\lambda \!\!\!{\bar {}}\alpha =a_{0}\alpha ^{2}.} Derivation [ edit ] The classical electron radius length scale can be motivated by considering the energy necessary to assemble an amount of charge q {\displaystyle q} into a sphere of a given radius ⁠ r {\displaystyle r} ⁠ .

[ 3 ] The electrostatic potential at a distance r {\displaystyle r} from a charge q {\displaystyle q} is V ( r ) = 1 4 π π ε ε 0 q r .

{\displaystyle V(r)={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {q}{r}}.} To bring an additional amount of charge d q {\displaystyle dq} from infinity adds energy ⁠ d U {\displaystyle dU} ⁠ to the system: d U = V ( r ) d q .

{\displaystyle dU=V(r)dq.} If the sphere is assumed to have constant charge density , ⁠ ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ⁠ , then q = ρ ρ 4 3 π π r 3 {\displaystyle q=\rho {\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}} and d q = ρ ρ 4 π π r 2 d r .

{\displaystyle dq=\rho 4\pi r^{2}dr.} Integrating ⁠ d U {\displaystyle dU} ⁠ for r {\displaystyle r} from zero to a final radius r ′ {\displaystyle r'} yields the expression for the total energy ⁠ U {\displaystyle U} ⁠ , necessary to assemble the total charge q ′ {\displaystyle q'} uniformly into a sphere of radius ⁠ r ′ {\displaystyle r'} ⁠ : U = 3 5 1 4 π π ε ε 0 q ′ 2 r ′ .

{\displaystyle U={\frac {3}{5}}{\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {q'^{2}}{r'}}.} This is called the electrostatic self-energy of the object. Interpreting the charge q ′ {\displaystyle q'} as the electron charge, ⁠ − − e {\displaystyle -e} ⁠ , and equating the total energy U {\displaystyle U} with the energy-equivalent of the electron's rest mass, ⁠ m e c 2 {\displaystyle m_{\text{e}}c^{2}} ⁠ , and solving for ⁠ r ′ {\displaystyle r'} ⁠ : r ′ = 3 5 1 4 π π ε ε 0 e 2 m e c 2 .

{\displaystyle r'={\frac {3}{5}}{\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {e^{2}}{m_{\text{e}}c^{2}}}.} The numerical factor 3/5 is ignored as being specific to the special case of a uniform charge density (e.g., for a charged spherical surface, this factor is 1/2). The resulting radius r ′ {\displaystyle r'} adjusted to ignore this factor is then defined to be the classical electron radius, ⁠ r e {\displaystyle r_{\text{e}}} ⁠ , and one arrives at the expression given above.

Note that this derivation does not say that r e {\displaystyle r_{\text{e}}} is an indication of the actual radius of an electron.  It only establishes a link between electrostatic self-energy and the energy-equivalent of the rest mass of the electron, and neglects the energy in the magnetic dipole field of an electron, which if considered, leads to a substantially larger calculated radius.

Discussion [ edit ] The classical electron radius appears in the classical limit of modern theories as well, including non-relativistic Thomson scattering and the relativistic Klein–Nishina formula .  Also, r e {\displaystyle r_{\text{e}}} is roughly the length scale at which renormalization becomes important in quantum electrodynamics .  That is, at short-enough distances, quantum fluctuations within the vacuum of space surrounding an electron begin to have calculable effects that have measurable consequences in atomic and particle physics .

Based on the assumption of a simple mechanical model, attempts to model the electron as a non-point particle have been described by some as ill-conceived and counter-pedagogic.
