One model uses Kan complexes which are fibrant objects in the category of simplicial sets (with the standard model structure ).

[ 1 ] It is an ∞-category generalization of a groupoid , a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism .

The homotopy hypothesis states that ∞-groupoids are equivalent to spaces up to homotopy.

[ 2 ] : 2–3 [ 3 ] Globular Groupoids [ edit ] Alexander Grothendieck suggested in Pursuing Stacks [ 2 ] : 3–4, 201 that there should be an extraordinarily simple model of ∞-groupoids using globular sets , originally called hemispherical complexes. These sets are constructed as presheaves on the globular category G {\displaystyle \mathbb {G} } . This is defined as the category whose objects are finite ordinals [ n ] {\displaystyle [n]} and morphisms are given by σ σ n : [ n ] → → [ n + 1 ] τ τ n : [ n ] → → [ n + 1 ] {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\sigma _{n}:[n]\to [n+1]\\\tau _{n}:[n]\to [n+1]\end{aligned}}} such that the globular relations hold σ σ n + 1 ∘ ∘ σ σ n = τ τ n + 1 ∘ ∘ σ σ n σ σ n + 1 ∘ ∘ τ τ n = τ τ n + 1 ∘ ∘ τ τ n {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\sigma _{n+1}\circ \sigma _{n}&=\tau _{n+1}\circ \sigma _{n}\\\sigma _{n+1}\circ \tau _{n}&=\tau _{n+1}\circ \tau _{n}\end{aligned}}} These encode the fact that n -morphisms should not be able to see (n + 1) -morphisms. When writing these down as a globular set X ∙ ∙ : G o p → → Sets {\displaystyle X_{\bullet }:\mathbb {G} ^{op}\to {\text{Sets}}} , the source and target maps are then written as s n = X ∙ ∙ ( σ σ n ) t n = X ∙ ∙ ( τ τ n ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}s_{n}=X_{\bullet }(\sigma _{n})\\t_{n}=X_{\bullet }(\tau _{n})\end{aligned}}} We can also consider globular objects in a category C {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}} as functors X ∙ ∙ : : G o p → → C .

{\displaystyle X_{\bullet }\colon \mathbb {G} ^{op}\to {\mathcal {C}}.} There was hope originally that such a strict model would be sufficient for homotopy theory, but there is evidence suggesting otherwise. It turns out for S 2 {\displaystyle S^{2}} its associated homotopy n {\displaystyle n} -type π π ≤ ≤ n ( S 2 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{\leq n}(S^{2})} can never be modeled as a strict globular groupoid for n ≥ ≥ 3 {\displaystyle n\geq 3} .

[ 2 ] : 445 [ 4 ] This is because strict ∞-groupoids only model spaces with a trivial Whitehead product .

[ 5 ] Examples [ edit ] Fundamental ∞-groupoid [ edit ] Given a topological space X {\displaystyle X} there should be an associated fundamental ∞-groupoid Π Π ∞ ∞ X {\displaystyle \Pi _{\infty }X} where the objects are points x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} , 1-morphisms f : x → → y {\displaystyle f:x\to y} are represented as paths , 2-morphisms are homotopies of paths, 3-morphisms are homotopies of homotopies, and so on. From this ∞-groupoid we can find an n {\displaystyle n} -groupoid called the fundamental n {\displaystyle n} -groupoid Π Π n X {\displaystyle \Pi _{n}X} whose homotopy type is that of π π ≤ ≤ n X {\displaystyle \pi _{\leq n}X} .

Note that taking the fundamental ∞-groupoid of a space Y {\displaystyle Y} such that π π > n Y = 0 {\displaystyle \pi _{>n}Y=0} is equivalent to the fundamental n -groupoid Π Π n Y {\displaystyle \Pi _{n}Y} . Such a space can be found using the Whitehead tower .

Abelian globular groupoids [ edit ] One useful case of globular groupoids comes from a chain complex which is bounded above, hence let's consider a chain complex C ∙ ∙ ∈ ∈ Ch ≤ ≤ 0 ( Ab ) {\displaystyle C_{\bullet }\in {\text{Ch}}_{\leq 0}({\text{Ab}})} .

[ 6 ] There is an associated globular groupoid. Intuitively, the objects are the elements in C 0 {\displaystyle C_{0}} , morphisms come from C 0 {\displaystyle C_{0}} through the chain complex map d 1 : C 1 → → C 0 {\displaystyle d_{1}:C_{1}\to C_{0}} , and higher n {\displaystyle n} -morphisms can be found from the higher chain complex maps d n : C n → → C n − − 1 {\displaystyle d_{n}:C_{n}\to C_{n-1}} . We can form a globular set C ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} _{\bullet }} with C 0 = C 0 C 1 = C 0 ⊕ ⊕ C 1 ⋯ ⋯ C n = ⨁ ⨁ k = 0 n C k {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}\mathbb {C} _{0}=&C_{0}\\\mathbb {C} _{1}=&C_{0}\oplus C_{1}\\&\cdots \\\mathbb {C} _{n}=&\bigoplus _{k=0}^{n}C_{k}\end{matrix}}} and the source morphism s n : C n → → C n − − 1 {\displaystyle s_{n}:\mathbb {C} _{n}\to \mathbb {C} _{n-1}} is the projection map p r : ⨁ ⨁ k = 0 n C k → → ⨁ ⨁ k = 0 n − − 1 C k {\displaystyle pr:\bigoplus _{k=0}^{n}C_{k}\to \bigoplus _{k=0}^{n-1}C_{k}} and the target morphism t n : C n → → C n − − 1 {\displaystyle t_{n}:C_{n}\to C_{n-1}} is the addition of the chain complex map d n : C n → → C n − − 1 {\displaystyle d_{n}:C_{n}\to C_{n-1}} together with the projection map. This forms a globular groupoid giving a wide class of examples of strict globular groupoids. Moreover, because strict groupoids embed inside weak groupoids, they can act as weak groupoids as well.

Applications [ edit ] Higher local systems [ edit ] One of the basic theorems about local systems is that they can be equivalently described as a functor from the fundamental groupoid Π Π X = Π Π ≤ ≤ 1 X {\displaystyle \Pi X=\Pi _{\leq 1}X} to the category of abelian groups , the category of R {\displaystyle R} -modules , or some other abelian category . That is, a local system is equivalent to giving a functor L : Π Π X → → Ab {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}:\Pi X\to {\text{Ab}}} generalizing such a definition requires us to consider not only an abelian category, but also its derived category . A higher local system is then an ∞-functor L ∙ ∙ : Π Π ∞ ∞ X → → D ( Ab ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\bullet }:\Pi _{\infty }X\to D({\text{Ab}})} with values in some derived category. This has the advantage of letting the higher homotopy groups π π n X {\displaystyle \pi _{n}X} to act on the higher local system, from a series of truncations. A toy example to study comes from the Eilenberg–MacLane spaces K ( A , n ) {\displaystyle K(A,n)} , or by looking at the terms from the Whitehead tower of a space. Ideally, there should be some way to recover the categories of functors L ∙ ∙ : Π Π ∞ ∞ X → → D ( Ab ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\bullet }:\Pi _{\infty }X\to D({\text{Ab}})} from their truncations Π Π n X {\displaystyle \Pi _{n}X} and the maps τ τ ≤ ≤ n − − 1 : Π Π n X → → Π Π n − − 1 X {\displaystyle \tau _{\leq n-1}:\Pi _{n}X\to \Pi _{n-1}X} whose fibers should be the categories of n {\displaystyle n} -functors Π Π n ( K ( π π n X , n ) ) → → D ( Ab ) {\displaystyle \Pi _{n}(K(\pi _{n}X,n))\to D({\text{Ab}})} Another advantage of this formalism is it allows for constructing higher forms of ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } -adic representations by using the etale homotopy type π π ^ ^ ( X ) {\displaystyle {\hat {\pi }}(X)} of a scheme X {\displaystyle X} and construct higher representations of this space, since they are given by functors L : π π ( X ) ^ ^ → → D ( Q ¯ ¯ ℓ ℓ ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}:{\hat {\pi (X)}}\to D({\overline {\mathbb {Q} }}_{\ell })} Higher gerbes [ edit ] Another application of ∞-groupoids is giving constructions of n -gerbes and ∞-gerbes. Over a space X {\displaystyle X} an n -gerbe should be an object G → → X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}\to X} such that when restricted to a small enough subset U ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle U\subset X} , G | U → → U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}|_{U}\to U} is represented by an n -groupoid, and on overlaps there is an agreement up to some weak equivalence. Assuming the homotopy hypothesis is correct, this is equivalent to constructing an object G → → X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}\to X} such that over any open subset G | U → → U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}|_{U}\to U} is an n -group , or a homotopy n -type . Because the nerve of a category can be used to construct an arbitrary homotopy type, a functor over a site X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {X}}} , e.g.

p : C → → X {\displaystyle p:{\mathcal {C}}\to {\mathcal {X}}} will give an example of a higher gerbe if the category C U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}_{U}} lying over any point U ∈ ∈ Ob ⁡ ⁡ X {\displaystyle U\in \operatorname {Ob} {\mathcal {X}}} is a non-empty category. In addition, it would be expected this category would satisfy some sort of descent condition.
