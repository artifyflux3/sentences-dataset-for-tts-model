[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The Frankfurter Buchmesse with the fair's tower ( Messeturm , 2004) The Frankfurt Book Fair has a tradition spanning more than 500 years. Before the advent of printed books, the general trade fair in Frankfurt was the place for selling handwritten books , as early as the 12th century.

[ 2 ] A printers' and publishers' fair became established sometime in the decades after Johannes Gutenberg developed printing in movable letters in Mainz near Frankfurt; although no official founding date of the Frankfurt Book Fair is documented, it had definitely been established by 1462, the year that the printers Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer , who had taken over Gutenberg's printing operations after a legal dispute, moved their operations to Frankfurt.

[ 3 ] The fair became the primary point for book marketing, but also a hub for the diffusion of written texts. During the Reformation , the fair was attended by merchants testing the market for new books and by scholars looking for newly available scholarship.

[ 4 ] Until the end of the 17th century, the Frankfurt Book Fair was the most important book fair in Europe.

[ citation needed ] It was eclipsed in 1632 by the Leipzig Book Fair during the Enlightenment as a consequence of political and cultural developments.

[ 5 ] After World War II, the first book fair was held again in 1949 at the St. Paul's Church . Since then, it has regained its preeminent position.

[ citation needed ] Significance [ edit ] The Frankfurter Buchmesse is the world's largest trade fair for books, based on the number of publishing companies represented.

Organisation [ edit ] The fair is organised by Frankfurter Buchmesse GmbH, a subsidiary of the German Publishers and Booksellers Association .

[ 7 ] The five-day annual event in mid-October is held at the Frankfurt Trade Fair grounds in Frankfurt am Main , Germany . The first three days are restricted exclusively to trade visitors; the general public can attend on the weekend, for a fee.

Certain initiatives would not exist without the Frankfurter Buchmesse and are closely linked to its goals and, up to a point, management structure.

[ citation needed ] On the occasion of the 1980 Fair, Litprom was founded – the Society for the Promotion of African, Asian and Latin American Literature. As a non profit association, it monitors literary trends and selects the best examples of creative writing from Africa, Asia and Latin America for translation into German. It promotes them in Germany, Switzerland and Austria by encouraging contacts between authors and publishers from the Third World and those in German-speaking countries. It serves as an information hub and clearing house about literature from Africa, Asia and Latin America, establishing a forum of debate about "Third World" literature.

[ 8 ] In 2006, Litcam , a campaign against illiteracy was founded. In this context, the 2007 Frankfurt Book Fair also started a short story project named "Who's on the line? Call for free" by and for people with migration background.

[ citation needed ] Guest of honour, focus of interest [ edit ] Turkey's Guest of Honour pavilion in 2008 Since 1976, a guest of honour , or a focus of interest is named for the fair. A special literary programme is organised for the occasion (readings, arts exhibitions, public discussion panels, theatre productions, and radio and TV programmes). A special exhibition hall is set up for the guest country, and the major publishing houses are present at the fair.  Canada's presentation as 2020 guest of honour was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic .

German news magazine Der Spiegel described it as "closed-minded" for its policy of not including the many Catalans who write in Spanish in its definition of Catalan literature.

[ 11 ] The decision to exclude any element of "Spanishness", defined as literature exclusively done in Spanish, from the fair was made in spite of the fact that the Spanish government contributed more than €6 million towards the cost of the fair.

[ 12 ] In 2023 Litprom cancelled the LiBeraturpreis Literature Prize award ceremony for Adania Shibli , a Palestinian author for her novel about the rape and murder of a Palestinian girl in 1949 by Israeli soldiers.

[ 13 ] In response the Emirates Publishers Association and the Arab Publishers’ Association withdrew from the Fair.

[ 14 ] In the opening ceremony of the book fair, the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek criticised Litprom and the book fair for this: "Here we are approaching the paradoxes of cancel culture . All that cancel culture does is exclude those who don't fit your [ì.e. the book fair's] notion of inclusion and diversity." [ 15 ] In 2024, critical authors Roberto Saviano and Antonio Scurati are not on the list of 100 Italian authors attending Frankfurt Book Fair where Italy is special guest.
