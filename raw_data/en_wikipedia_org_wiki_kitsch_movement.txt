Cover of On Kitsch by Odd Nerdrum and others.

[ note 1 ] Kitsch painting is an international movement made up of classical painters , a result of a 24 September 1998 speech and philosophy given by the Norwegian figurative artist, Odd Nerdrum , [ 1 ] later clarified in his book On Kitsch [ 2 ] with Jan-Ove Tuv and others.

[ note 1 ] The movement incorporates the techniques of the Old Masters with narrative, romanticism , and emotionally charged imagery. The movement defines Kitsch as synonymous with the arts of ancient Rome or the techne of ancient Greece. Kitsch painters embrace kitsch as a positive term not in opposition to " art ", but as its own independent superstructure. Kitsch painters assert that Kitsch is not an art movement, but a philosophical movement separate from art. The Kitsch movement has been considered an indirect criticism of the contemporary art world, but according to Nerdrum, this is not the expressed intention.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Origins of kitsch painting philosophy [ edit ] The philosophy originated by Nerdrum first manifested into a group among Nerdrum's circle of students [ 6 ] Jan-Ove Tuv, Helene Knoop, Hege Elizabeth Haugen, Monika Helgesen, Jeremy Caniglia , Kjetil Jul, Brad Silverstein, Carlos Madrid, Stefan Boulter, Brandon Kralik, Nanne Nyander, and soon expanded. Many kitsch painters were featured in and contributed essays to Nerdrum's book Kitsch: More than Art [ 7 ] Collaborations [ edit ] The Kitsch Movement has collaborated with The Florence Academy in a 2009 biennale exhibition titled "Immortal Works".

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] a traveling exhibition which includes painters from around the world.
