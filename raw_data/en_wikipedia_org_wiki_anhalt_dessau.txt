Ruled by the House of Ascania , it was created in 1396 following the partition of the Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst , and finally merged into the re-united Duchy of Anhalt in 1863. The capital of the state was Dessau in present-day Saxony-Anhalt .

History [ edit ] Johannbau , preserved west wing of Dessau Palace The Principality of Anhalt arose in 1212 under its first ruler Henry I , son of the Saxon duke Bernhard III . Named after Anhalt Castle , the ancestral seat of the Ascanian dynasty near Harzgerode , the principality experienced a number of partitions throughout its centuries-long existence.

Anhalt after being divided among the sons of Henry I, 1259 The Anhalt territory was divided among the sons of Prince Henry I into the principalities of Anhalt-Aschersleben , Anhalt-Bernburg and Anhalt-Zerbst in 1252. In the course of the partition, Prince Siegfried I , the youngest son of Henry I, received the lands around Köthen , Dessau , and Zerbst . His son and successor Prince Albert I took his residence at Köthen Castle in 1295. In 1396, the surviving sons of Prince John II of Anhalt-Zerbst again divided their heritage. The elder Sigismund I became Prince of Anhalt-Dessau and took his residence at Dessau, while his younger brother Albert IV went on to rule as Prince of Anhalt-Köthen.

Upon the death of Sigismund's son Prince George I of Anhalt-Dessau in 1474, the principality was again divided with Anhalt-Köthen . Anhalt-Dessau was partitioned for a second time in 1544 with Anhalt-Zerbst and Anhalt-Plötzkau being created. From 1561 until 1603 Anhalt-Dessau was under the rule of the Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, and in 1603 Anhalt-Dessau was recreated, being raised to a duchy in 1807.

Anhalt-Köthen became extinct on the death of the Duke of Anhalt-Köthen, 23 November 1847, and its territories were united to Anhalt-Dessau by Patent of 22 May 1853.

[ 1 ] Following the death of the last Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg on 19 August 1863, all of the Anhalt lands came under the rule of the Duke of Anhalt-Dessau who then took the new title of Duke of Anhalt for the newly created Duchy of Anhalt .
