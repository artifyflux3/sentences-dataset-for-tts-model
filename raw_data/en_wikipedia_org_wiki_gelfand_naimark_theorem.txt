In mathematics , the Gelfand–Naimark theorem states that an arbitrary C*-algebra A is isometrically *-isomorphic to a C*-subalgebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space .  This result was proven by Israel Gelfand and Mark Naimark in 1943 and was a significant point in the development of the theory of C*-algebras since it established the possibility of considering a C*-algebra as an abstract algebraic entity without reference to particular realizations as an operator algebra .

Details [ edit ] The Gelfand–Naimark representation π is the Hilbert space analogue of the direct sum of representations π f of A where f ranges over the set of pure states of A and π f is the irreducible representation associated to f by the GNS construction .  Thus the Gelfand–Naimark representation acts on the Hilbert direct sum of the Hilbert spaces H f by π π ( x ) [ ⨁ ⨁ f H f ] = ⨁ ⨁ f π π f ( x ) H f .

{\displaystyle \pi (x)[\bigoplus _{f}H_{f}]=\bigoplus _{f}\pi _{f}(x)H_{f}.} π( x ) is a bounded linear operator since it is the direct sum of a family of operators, each one having norm ≤ || x ||.

Theorem . The Gelfand–Naimark representation of a C*-algebra is an isometric *-representation.

It suffices to show the map π is injective , since for *-morphisms of C*-algebras injective implies isometric. Let x be a non-zero element of A .  By the Krein extension theorem for positive linear functionals , there is a state f on A such that f ( z ) ≥ 0 for all non-negative z in A and f (− x * x ) < 0.  Consider the GNS representation π f with cyclic vector ξ. Since ‖ ‖ π π f ( x ) ξ ξ ‖ ‖ 2 = ⟨ ⟨ π π f ( x ) ξ ξ ∣ ∣ π π f ( x ) ξ ξ ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ ξ ξ ∣ ∣ π π f ( x ∗ ∗ ) π π f ( x ) ξ ξ ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ ξ ξ ∣ ∣ π π f ( x ∗ ∗ x ) ξ ξ ⟩ ⟩ = f ( x ∗ ∗ x ) > 0 , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\|\pi _{f}(x)\xi \|^{2}&=\langle \pi _{f}(x)\xi \mid \pi _{f}(x)\xi \rangle =\langle \xi \mid \pi _{f}(x^{*})\pi _{f}(x)\xi \rangle \\[6pt]&=\langle \xi \mid \pi _{f}(x^{*}x)\xi \rangle =f(x^{*}x)>0,\end{aligned}}} it follows that π f (x) ≠ 0, so π (x) ≠ 0, so π is injective.

The construction of Gelfand–Naimark representation depends only on the GNS construction and therefore it is meaningful for any Banach *-algebra A having an approximate identity .  In general (when A is not a C*-algebra) it will not be a faithful representation .  The closure of the image of π( A )  will be a C*-algebra of operators called the C*-enveloping algebra of A . Equivalently, we can define the 
C*-enveloping algebra as follows: Define a real valued function on A by ‖ ‖ x ‖ ‖ C ∗ ∗ = sup f f ( x ∗ ∗ x ) {\displaystyle \|x\|_{\operatorname {C} ^{*}}=\sup _{f}{\sqrt {f(x^{*}x)}}} as f ranges over pure states of A .   This is a semi-norm, which we refer to as the C* semi-norm of A .  The set I of elements of A whose semi-norm is 0 forms a two sided-ideal in A closed under involution.  Thus the quotient vector space A / I is  an involutive algebra and the norm ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ C ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|_{\operatorname {C} ^{*}}} factors through a norm on A / I , which except for completeness, is a C* norm on A / I (these are sometimes called pre-C*-norms). Taking the completion of A / I relative to this pre-C*-norm produces a C*-algebra B .

By the Krein–Milman theorem one can show without too much difficulty that for x an element of the Banach *-algebra A having an approximate identity: sup f ∈ ∈ State ⁡ ⁡ ( A ) f ( x ∗ ∗ x ) = sup f ∈ ∈ PureState ⁡ ⁡ ( A ) f ( x ∗ ∗ x ) .

{\displaystyle \sup _{f\in \operatorname {State} (A)}f(x^{*}x)=\sup _{f\in \operatorname {PureState} (A)}f(x^{*}x).} It follows that an equivalent form for the C* norm on A is to take the above supremum over all states.

The universal construction is also used to define universal C*-algebras of isometries.

Remark . The Gelfand representation or Gelfand isomorphism for a commutative C*-algebra with unit A {\displaystyle A} is an isometric *-isomorphism from A {\displaystyle A} to the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on the space of multiplicative linear functionals, which in the commutative case are precisely the pure states, of A with the weak* topology.
