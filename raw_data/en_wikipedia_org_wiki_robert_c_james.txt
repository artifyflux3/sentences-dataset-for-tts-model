Biography [ edit ] James attended UCLA as an undergraduate, where his father was a professor.  As a devout Quaker , he was a conscientious objector during World War II .

[ 2 ] He obtained his PhD at Caltech in 1946 under the direction of Aristotle Demetrius Michal.

[ 3 ] He spent a year as a Benjamin Peirce Fellow at Harvard and joined the faculty at UC Berkeley .  In 1950, during the loyalty oath controversy , James refused to sign the oath and moved to Haverford College .  Later he was the founding math department chair both at Harvey Mudd College and at the Claremont Graduate University .

[ 2 ] James constructed a number of counterexamples in the theory of Banach spaces , including James' space and James' tree space .  He also characterized reflexivity for Banach spaces with an unconditional Schauder basis and proved an eponymous compactness criterion .

With his father Glenn James [ de ] (a professor at UCLA and long-time editor of Mathematics Magazine ) he published a mathematical dictionary which went through several editions.

[ 4 ] James was made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1978.
