"Archon" (ἄρχων, pl. ἄρχοντες, archontes ) means "ruler" or "lord", frequently used as the title of a specific public office, [ 1 ] while "eponymous" means that he gave his name to the year in which he held office, much like the Roman dating by consular years .

In Classical Athens , a system of nine concurrent archons evolved, led by three respective remits over the civic, military, and religious affairs of the state: the three office holders were known as the eponymous archon (ruler of Athens, the highest political office in the city-state), the polemarch (πολέμαρχος, "war ruler", the commander-in-chief of the Athenian military), and the archon basileus (ἄρχων βασιλεύς, "king ruler",  the high priest of the city).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The six others were the thesmothetai , judicial officers.  Originally these offices were filled from the wealthier classes by elections every ten years. During this period the eponymous archon was the chief magistrate, the polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the archon basileus was responsible for some civic religious arrangements, and for the supervision of some major trials in the law courts. After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the eponymous archon.

Background [ edit ] The archon was the chief magistrate in many Greek cities, but in Athens there was a council of archons which exerted a form of executive government. From the late 8th century BC there were three archons: the archon eponymos , the polemarchos (originally with a military role, which was transferred to the ten strategoi in 501 BC), and the archon basileus (the ceremonial vestige of the Athenian monarchy ).

[ 4 ] These positions were filled from the aristocracy (the Eupatridae ) by elections every ten years. During this period Archon Eponymous was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements.

After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the archon eponymous.

[ citation needed ] The year ran from July to June.

[ 5 ] The archon eponymous was the chief archon, and presided over meetings of the Boule and Ecclesia , the ancient Athenian assemblies. The archon eponymous remained the titular head of state even under the democracy, though with much reduced political importance. Under the reforms of Solon , himself archon eponymous in 594 BC, there was a brief period when the number of archons rose to ten. After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the Areopagus , though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically.

One of the archons oversaw the procedure for ostracism after 487 BC.

[ 6 ] An archon's court was in charge of the epikleroi .

[ 7 ] Other duties of the archons included supervising the Panathenaea and Dionysia festivals.

[ 8 ] List of archons of Athens [ edit ] In the following list of Archons, years where the name of the archon is unknown are identified as such. Years listed as " anarchy " mean that there was literally "no archon". There are various conflicting reconstructions of lists; sources for this list are given at the end. Note that the term of an archon covered two of our years, beginning in the spring or summer and continuing into the next spring or summer. The polemarch or strategoi, basileus, and thesmothetai (the six assistants to the archons) are also listed, where known.

Archaic period [ edit ] Main article: Archaic Greece See also: Greek Dark Ages and Ancient Greece Life archons [ edit ] See also: King of Athens and Chronicon (Jerome) The later Athenian tradition varies on the exact position of this line; they held archonship for life, sometimes referred to as "Perpetual Archon", and exercised the sacral powers of kingship, as did the archon basileus later. The historicity of any of this ancient list may be reasonably doubted.  However, Aristotle indicates, within the Constitution of Athens, that it was indeed the house of Codrus that abolished the title of king in favor of Archon.

Polemarch (replaced in 501 BC by ten strategoi ) Roman consul References [ edit ] ^ At first the chief of the city was only a priest. "The charge of the public sacrifices of the city belongs according to religious custom, not to special priests, but to those men who derive their dignity from the hearth, and who are here called kings, elsewhere Prytaneis , and again archons." (Aristotle, Politics, VIII.5) ^ Michael Rostovtzeff, Greece , passim.

^ "The Athenian archons when they entered upon their duties ascended to the Acropolis wearing crowns of myrtles, and offered a sacrifice to the titular, divinity of the town. It was also customary for them to wear crowns of foliage when they exercised their functions. And it is certain that the crown, which became and which still remains the emblem of power, was then only a religious symbol, an exterior sign, which accompanied prayer and sacrifice. Amongst the nine archons, the second archon, the one called the King, was the representative of the high priestly function of the old Kings, but each of his colleagues had some priestly duty to fulfill, some sacrifice to offer to the gods.

Cadoux, "The Athenian Archons from Kreon to Hypsichides" , Journal of Hellenic Studies , 68 (1948), pp. 70-123 ^ Cadoux, "Athenian Archons", p. 88 ^ a b Cadoux notes "We cannot be sure that it was the same man who held the second archonship, nor, if we held that it was, do we know anything of the circumstances under which this happened. Nor, again, do we know if this man or men belonged to the Philaid family." ("Athenian Archons", p. 90) ^ Cadoux notes this entry is based on a surviving passage of Hippys of Rhegion which is very obscure; Hippys states one Epainetos was king at Athens in the 36th Olympiad. However, this statement is full of mistakes which makes Cadooux suspicious of this passage. ("Athenian Archons", p. 91) ^ a b c d e Per one surviving fragment of the Athenian Archon list. Donald W.

Merrit notes the name could be read "Onetorides". (Merrit, "Greek inscriptions, 14-27", Hesperia , 8 (1939), p 60) ^ This identification has been questioned by Matthew P. J. Dillon, "Was Kleisthenes of Pleisthenes Archon at Athens in 525 BC?" , Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik , 155 (2006), pp. 91-107 ^ Herodotus, Histories , books V and VI Google Books link ^ But he adds, "It seems gratuitous to invent a third Miltiades-presumably from another family; and there are no solid chronological grounds for rejecting either of the two Philaids." (Cadoux, "Athenian Archons", p. 110) ^ See Cadoux, "Athenian Archons", pp. 111f ^ Alan Samuel is doubtful this archon existed, claiming this is based on Eustathius' misunderstanding his source, which provides the date Pindar died, not when he was born.  Samuel, Greek and Roman Chronology (Muenchen: Beck'sche, 1972), p. 204 ^ Cadoux suspects this is a corruption of the archon's real name. ("Athenian Archons", p. 116) ^ Added from Samuel, Greek and Roman Chronology , p. 205 ^ Nine archons were appointed by lot by the tribes from 500 nominees chosen by the demes and that this was the method in the Archonship of Telesinus.

Thucydides reports a solar eclipse that summer (2.28), which can be confidently dated to 3 August 431 BC. (E. J.

(Osborne, "Archons of Athens", p. 85 n. 14) ^ This year is commonly attributed to "Gorgias" based on Pseudo-Plutarch ( Vitae Decem Oratorum , 847D); however, Gorgias may be a corruption of the very rare name "Ourias" archon in 281/0 BC; Gorgias is thus a ghost. (Osborne, "Archons of Athens", p. 87 n. 21) ^ Osborne notes that Pytharatus "is one of the very few archons of the 3rd century after the 290s to be securely dated on the basis of Olympiads and literary testimony."

For further details, see Aleshire, "The Athenian Archon Hoplon" , Hesperia , 57 (1988), pp. 253-5 ^ Thrasyphon is commonly dated to 221/0 BC based on a Magnesian inscription that allows his archonship to be dated to the fourth year of Olympiad 139; Osborne has argued that the correlation is not that exact and his archonship could fall in the first year of Olympiad 140. (Osborne, "The Date", pp. 85, 88) ^ Merrit disagrees, placing Sostratos here and providing a primary source; Osborne provides no supporting evidence for Aeschron here. Merritt, "Athenian Archons", p. 178 ^ Unless otherwise noted, the archons from 209/8 to 201/0 BC are taken from John S. Traill, "A Revision of Hesperia, XLIII, 1974, 'A New Ephebic Inscription from the Athenian Agora'" , Hesperia , 45 (1976), pp. 296-303 ^ Unless otherwise noted, archons from 201/0 to 160/59 BC are taken from Osborne, "Archons of Athens" ^ a b Following the arguments of John S. Traill, "The Athenian Archon Pleistainos" , Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik , 103 (1994), pp. 109-114 ^ Christian Habicht argues that, based on the floruit of the letter-cutter of inscription did not extend beyond 185 BC, Achaeus' archonship occurred earlier and places Epaenetus in this year. (Habicht, "The Eponymous Archons", p. 245) ^ a b Unless otherwise noted, archons from 159/8 to 141/0 BC are taken from Christian Habicht, "The Eponymous Archons of Athens from 159/8 to 141/0 B.
