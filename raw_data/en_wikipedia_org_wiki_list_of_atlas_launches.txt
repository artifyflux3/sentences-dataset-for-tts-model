The currently operational variant, Atlas V , has flown 92 consecutive missions without failure between October 2007 and April 2025.

In August 2021, ULA announced that Atlas V would be retired, and all remaining launches had been sold. As of June 2025 [update] , 13 launches remain, all of which are listed here: six Starliner missions, six launches for Project Kuiper, and one launch for ViaSat.

Due to the size of the list, it has been split by decade: List of Atlas launches (1957–1959) List of Atlas launches (1960–1969) List of Atlas launches (1970–1979) List of Atlas launches (1980–1989) List of Atlas launches (1990–1999) List of Atlas launches (2000–2009) , first Atlas V launch in 2002, last Atlas III launch in 2005 List of Atlas launches (2010–2019) List of Atlas launches (2020–2029) In addition, the variants Atlas LV3C and Atlas LV3B have dedicated lists.
