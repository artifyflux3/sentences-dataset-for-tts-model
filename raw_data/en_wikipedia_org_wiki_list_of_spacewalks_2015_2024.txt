[ 1 ] As of 19 August 2016, 215 astronauts have made spacewalks (out of 549 people who have gone into Earth orbit).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Since 1981, NASA has measured spacewalk duration from when the suits went to internal power until the start of airlock re-pressurization.

Roscosmos and China have always used the time from hatch opening to hatch closure.

[ 1 ] These charts typically follow the agency's measurements of spacewalk duration, because those figures tend to be the most readily available, as they are most often provided by the agency.

2015–2019 spacewalks [ edit ] Spacewalk beginning and ending times are given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

Parmitano and Morgan went outside and removed a cover plate from AMS and jettisoned it into space to make way for a cryo pump that they will assemble between spacewalks. Some of the bolts put up a fight but Parmitano got them all out. The highlight of the spacewalk is when Andrew Morgan threw the cover plate overboard and it drifted off aft of the station into the vacuum of space. The plate will stay in orbit for a few days until the end of December when it enters the atmosphere and burns up. The crew also removed several carbon fiber strips around fluid lines and installed handrails and grapple bars as get-ahead task.

Spacewalk suffered a 15- minute delay when Koch lost her helmet lights and camera. Meir managed to attach a hook onto the camera to prevent it from floating away and stowed it in Koch's tool bag. The spacewalkers managed to replace two batteries plus a third as a getahead task and had to stay in signal range of the WETA antennas so Meir could check on Koch at night who did not have any helmet lights. The spacewalkers will replace the camera between spacewalks and will head back out to replace the final three batteries on the next spacewalk.

[ 43 ] 415 20 January 11:35 6 hours, 58 minutes 18:33 Expedition 61 ISS Quest Christina Koch Jessica Meir The fifth and final in a series of five spacewalks to replace the batteries on the P6 Truss. Koch and Meir managed to get all the batteries replaced and stored two old ones on the exposed pallet to return to earth on HTV-9 where they will be incinerated on reentry. Koch and Meir finished the day by sending down a message to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. Day . This spacewalk moved Koch up to third place and Meir up to fourth place on the all-time female spacewalker list.

[ 44 ] 416 25 January 12:04 6 hours, 16 minutes 18:20 Expedition 61 ISS Quest Andrew Morgan Luca Parmitano The fourth and final in a series of four spacewalks to repair the AMS. Spacewalk suffered a 10- minute delay when a strap got stuck in the hatch preventing depressurization of the airlock. The two spacewalkers completed all the task and at 17:30 hours, Luca Parmitano opened a valve to start the flow of CO2 gas to AMS and contacted CERN to turn the experiment on. AMS passed all test and worked flawlessly. A leak was found in a cooling line but Parmitano patched it and the spacewalk resumed without incident. As a getahead task Parmitano and Morgan cleaned and replaced glare filters on the NASA TV cameras used to film the spacewalk.

The EVA (Russian EVA-51) was the first of six spacewalks over 2022 to fully integrate Nauka into the ISS.

[ 66 ] 440 15 March 12:11 6 hours, 54 minutes 19:06 Expedition 66 ISS Quest Raja Chari Kayla Barron First spacewalk to install the IROSA mounting brackets on the S4 Truss. Tasks included installing the struts, mounting brackets, and triangles at the 3A Array in preparation for the delivery of the IROSA solar arrays on SpaceX CRS-25 at the end of May. The astronauts also tied back insulation on S6 so Dextre can replace the Battery Charge Discharge Modules at this location which has shown signs of decay and will be replaced at a later date. As a get ahead the astronauts photographed a worn keel pin cover which has come loose on one of the pins that were used to secure the airlock in the shuttle bay when it was launched.

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] 441 23 March 12:32 6 hours, 54 minutes 19:26 Expedition 66 ISS Quest Raja Chari Matthias Maurer The astronauts will install and vent ammonia jumpers on the P1 Truss and reposition a radiator beam valve module which has been giving them trouble. The astronauts will also route cables, install cable clamps on the Bartolomeo platform, tie back thermal insulation on the Kibo Exposed Facility Berthing Mechanism, break torque on the P4 electronics boxes, replace Camera 8 on the truss which has a bad filter and light, outfit the radiator grapple bars for a future spacewalk, and also do other maintenance task outside the station.

[ 70 ] 442 18 April 15:01 6 hours, 37 minutes 21:37 Expedition 67 ISS Poisk Oleg Artemyev Denis Matveev Third spacewalk in a series to activate Nauka and Prichal and to commission ERA .

During the spacewalk the cosmonauts will remove covers and install electrical cables so ERA can be activated at the end of the spacewalk. They will also install handrails, experiments, and work platforms outside, and break torque on bolts that secure ERA to the lab.

[ 71 ] 443 28 April 14:58 7 hours, 42 minutes 22:40 Expedition 67 ISS Poisk Oleg Artemyev Denis Matveev Fourth spacewalk in a series to activate Nauka and Prichal and to commission ERA.

During the spacewalk the cosmonauts jettisoned thermal covers, released launch locks, and walked off the arm to its stowage point at worksite 2 on the forward face of the lab where it was latched in place. Because of time they did not release the grapple at worksite 1 and the arm is bent over the solar arrays. The cosmonauts also installed handrails on Nauka and the arm and deployed a banner for Victory Day on the side of the station. ERA will be checked out inside before it moved remotely to its grapple point at worksite 3 where it will be secured until the next spacewalk when it will be moved to worksite 4. During the spacewalk a cable got snagged which was deployed during EVA 50 back in January which caused issues with the KURS antennas on Prichal which forced Soyuz MS-21 to be flown in manually. Artemyev tied down the cables with wire ties and the antenna was redeployed into a safe configuration.

[ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] 444 21 July 14:50 7 hours, 5 minutes 21:55 Expedition 67 ISS Poisk Oleg Artemyev Samantha Cristoforetti Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev and Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti worked on the ERA robotic arm as part of the work scheduled to commission the Nauka module and robotic arm. They launched two Tsiolkovsky-Ryazan (No. 1-2) and eight YUZGU-55 (No. 5-12) satellites, installed an ERA grapple point on Poisk to facilitate future relocation of the experiment airlock on the next spacewalk, translated a work platform over to Nauka , reconfigured ERA and set the control panel from grapple mode to stowed, replaced a camera port window on ERA that prevented grappling on the previous spacewalk, replaced MLI blankets on Nauka that were knocked loose by the thruster firings when the module arrived, and installed retainers on Strela 1 on Poisk . The final task to relocate Strela 2 on Zarya over to Poisk and install its retainer was deferred to the next spacewalk because they ran out of time and they had a late start. Cristoforetti become the first female European astronaut to perform a spacewalk, and only the third woman to perform a spacewalk using the Russian Orlan spacesuit (after Svetlana Savitskaya and Peggy Whitson ).

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] 445 17 August 13:53 4 hours, 1  minute 17:54 Expedition 67 ISS Poisk Oleg Artemyev Denis Matveev Sixth spacewalk in a series to outfit Nauka and to prepare the Russian Segment for module transfers which will take place in the fall. The primary task to install cameras on the elbow joint was completed on time and both cameras passed their telemetry checkouts. The final tasks to relocate the ERA control panel, set the arm back to "grapple mode", and remove the launch rings from the wrist of ERA will be moved to the next spacewalk. Artemyev was in the process of removing the launch ring at worksite 2 from ERA when he suffered a voltage drop in his spacesuit batteries.

Mission Control Moscow ordered him back inside the airlock where he connected to internal power to recharge his suit. Because they were ahead and then behind the timeline, in light of the battery issue Mission Control Moscow gave the order to terminate the EVA at 16:34 GMT and the spacewalk concluded at 17:54 GMT, 4 hours, and 1  minute into the spacewalk.

[ 80 ] Artemyev was never in any danger and they will be replacing the battery before the next spacewalk. Because of the early EVA termination, the getahead task to relocate Strela 2 over to Poisk was also moved to the next spacewalk along with the other tasks.
