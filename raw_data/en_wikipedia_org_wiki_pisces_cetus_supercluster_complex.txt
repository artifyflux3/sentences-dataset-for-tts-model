It includes the Laniakea Supercluster which contains the Virgo Supercluster lobe which in turn contains the Local Group , the galaxy cluster that includes the Milky Way .

[ 1 ] This filament is adjacent to the Perseus–Pegasus Filament .

[ 2 ] Astronomer R. Brent Tully of the University of Hawaii 's Institute of Astronomy identified the Complex in 1987.

[ 3 ] Extent [ edit ] The Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex is estimated to be about 1.0 billion light-years (Gly) long and 150 million light years (Mly) wide.  It is one of the largest structures known in the observable universe , but is exceeded by the Sloan Great Wall (1.3 Gly), Clowes–Campusano LQG (2.0 Gly), U1.11 LQG (2.5 Gly), Huge-LQG (4.0 Gly), and Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall (10 Gly), respectively.

Sixty clusters comprise the complex, which is estimated to have a total mass of 10 18 M ☉ .

[ 4 ] According to the discoverer, the complex is composed of 5 parts: The Pisces–Cetus Supercluster The Perseus–Pegasus chain, including the Perseus–Pisces Supercluster The Pegasus–Pisces chain The Sculptor region, including the Sculptor Supercluster and Hercules Supercluster The Laniakea Supercluster , which contains our Virgo Supercluster (Local Supercluster) as well as the Hydra–Centaurus Supercluster .

[ 4 ] With its mass of 10 15 M ☉ , our Virgo Supercluster accounts only for 0.1 percent of the total mass of the complex.

The complex was named after the Pisces–Cetus Superclusters, which are its richest superclusters.
