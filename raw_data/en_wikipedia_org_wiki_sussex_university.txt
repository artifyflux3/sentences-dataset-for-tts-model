It lies mostly within the city boundaries of Brighton and Hove . Its large campus site is surrounded by the South Downs National Park , and provides convenient access to central Brighton 5.5 kilometres ( 3 + 1 ⁄ 2 miles) away. The university received its royal charter in August 1961, the first of the plate glass university generation.

[ 5 ] More than a third of its students are enrolled in postgraduate programmes and approximately a third of staff are from outside the United Kingdom.

[ 6 ] Sussex has a diverse community of nearly 20,000 students, with around one in three being foreign students, and over 1,000 academics, representing over 140 different nationalities.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The annual income of the institution for 2023–24 was £379.6 million of which £39.9 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £291.3 million.

[ 1 ] Sussex counts five Nobel Prize winners, 15 Fellows of the Royal Society , 10 Fellows of the British Academy , 24 fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences and a winner of the Crafoord Prize among its faculty. By 2011, many of its faculty members had also received the Royal Society of Literature Prize, the Order of the British Empire and the Bancroft Prize . Alumni include heads of states, diplomats, politicians, eminent scientists and activists.

History [ edit ] 20th century [ edit ] In an effort to establish a university to serve Sussex, a public meeting was held in December 1911 at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton to discover ways to fund the construction of a university; the project was halted by World War I , and the money raised was used instead for books for the Municipal Technical College.

The idea was revived in the 1950s,  and in June 1958 the government approved the corporation's scheme for a university at Brighton , to be the first of a new generation of what came to be known as plate glass universities .

[ 5 ] The university was established as a company in 1959, with a Royal Charter being granted on 16 August 1961.

[ 5 ] This was the first university to be established in the UK since the Second World War, apart from Keele University . The university's organisation broke new ground in seeing the campus divided into Schools of Study, with students able to benefit from a multidisciplinary teaching environment. Sussex would emphasise cross-disciplinary activity, so that students would emerge from the university with a range of background or 'contextual' knowledge to complement their specialist 'core' skills in a particular subject area.

[ 9 ] For example, arts students spent their first year taking sciences while science students took arts.This experimental interdisciplinary educational model was famously described by Professor Asa Briggs as pioneering "a new map of learning".

[ 10 ] The university grew from 52 students in 1961–62 to 3,200 in 1967–68. After starting at Knoyle Hall in Brighton, the Falmer campus was gradually built with Falmer House opening in 1962.

[ 11 ] The campus was praised as gorgeously modernist and groundbreaking, receiving numerous awards.

[ 12 ] The student union, as is typical, organised events and concerts, bringing in acts like Pink Floyd , Jimi Hendrix and Chuck Berry to perform at the University Common Room.

[ 13 ] Academically, Sussex was home to figures such as Asa Lord Briggs , Helmut Pappe, Gillian Rose , Jennifer Platt and Tom Bottomore . In its first years, the university attracted a number of renowned academics such as Sir John Cornforth , John Maynard Smith , Martin Wight , David Daiches , Roger Blin-Stoyle and Colin Eaborn . Similarly, renowned scholars like Marcus Cunliffe , Gabriel Josipovici , Quentin Bell , Dame Helen Wallace , Stuart Sutherland and Marie Jahoda also became central figures at the university and founded many of its current departments. Additionally, a number of initiatives at the university were started at this time, such as the Subaltern Studies Group , founded by Ranajit Guha who was Reader in History at Sussex between 1962 and 1981.

[ 14 ] In the late 1960s, the United Nations asked for science policy recommendations from a team of renowned academics at Sussex. The ensuing report became known as the Sussex Manifesto .

[ 15 ] Sussex came to be identified with student radicalism . In 1973, a group of students prevented United States government adviser Samuel P. Huntington from giving a speech on campus, because of his involvement in the Vietnam War .

[ 16 ] Similarly, when the spokesperson for the US embassy, Robert Beers, visited to give a talk to students entitled 'Vietnam in depth' three students were waiting outside Falmer House and threw a bucket of red paint over the diplomat as he was leaving.

[ 17 ] In both 1967 and 1969, Sussex won the television quiz University Challenge .

[ 18 ] In 1980, Sussex edged out the University of Oxford to become the university with the highest income from research grants and contracts.

[ 19 ] 21st century [ edit ] The Jubilee Building In an attempt to appeal to a modern audience, the university chose in 2004 to cease using its coat of arms [ 20 ] and to replace it with the "US" logo.

[ 21 ] In 2011, Sussex celebrated its 50th anniversary and saw the production of a number of works including a book on the university's history and an oral history and photography project. The university launched its first major fundraising campaign, Making the Future, and gathered over £51.3 million.

[ 22 ] The university underwent a number of changes with the Sussex Strategic Plan 2009–2015, including the introduction of new academic courses, the opening of new research centres, the renovation and refurbishment of a number of its schools and buildings as well as the ongoing expansion of its student housing facilities.

In 2018, the university moved all of its investments out of fossil fuels (known as fossil fuel divestment ) after a four-year student union run campaign.

[ 23 ] In October 2021 a student campaign called for Kathleen Stock 's dismissal.

[ 24 ] In October 2021, the university's vice-chancellor Professor Adam Tickell gave his support to Stock who has been accused of transphobia .

The Times reported students have called for Stock's dismissal and claimed that she has been victimised.

[ 25 ] Following Tickell's statement, the Sussex branch of the University and College Union (UCU) called for an investigation into "institutional transphobia" at the University of Sussex.

[ 25 ] Students have accused the university management of being "anti-student and pro-transphobia".

[ 26 ] Taiwo Owatemi , the Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities , called UCU's statement "strong and principled".

[ 27 ] In 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic , Sussex was one of few universities that returned to real-world teaching. Most lectures at other universities chose to remain online-only .

[ 28 ] In March 2025, Sussex was fined £585,000 by the Office for Students (OfS), which said it had failed to uphold freedom of speech in its trans and non-binary equality policy statement passed in 2018. The policy stated that course materials should "positively represent trans people" and that  "transphobic propaganda" would not be tolerated. The OfS gave the case of Kathleen Stock as an example of the "chilling effect" this had on expression of lawful views. Professor Sasha Roseneil, the university’s vice chancellor, said "The way the OfS has conducted this investigation has been completely unacceptable, its findings are egregious and concocted, and the fine that is being imposed on Sussex is wholly disproportionate." The university has said that it will legally challenge the penalty.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Campus [ edit ] Grade I listed Falmer House A picture of Meeting House View of Arts A Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts Arts Inner courtyard, characteristic of the Spence design University of Sussex Monolith Brighton and Sussex Medical School The University of Sussex is situated near the city of Brighton and Hove , next to the Stanmer Park reserve, and extends into the Lewes District in its eastern fringe. The closest train station is Falmer railway station , located at about nine minutes from Brighton station. The campus is also close to the medieval town of Lewes and is approximately an hour away from London.

[ 31 ] Located within the South Downs National Park , it is the only English university existing in a National Park.

[ 32 ] The campus, designed by Sir Basil Spence , is next to the village of Falmer but mostly within the city boundaries of Brighton and Hove . It is close to the South Downs , which influenced Spence's design of the campus. In 1959, the Basil Spence and Partners company began planning and designing the campus, to be built over a 15-year period. In 1971, 17 buildings had been designed and built winning numerous awards including a medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects and a Civic Trust award.

[ 12 ] Spence expressed his awe at the beauty of the surrounding region and designed the campus as a stream of low buildings so as not to disturb the natural scenery around. Brick was chosen throughout as it was the dominant material used across Sussex.

[ 12 ] As the campus developed, Spence connected the buildings by a series of 'green, interlocking courtyards that he felt created a sense of enclosure'.

[ 12 ] The campus is self-contained, with facilities including eights cafes/restaurants, a post office, a Co-op Food store, a market, a bank, a pharmacy, a health centre (including a dentist) and childcare facilities.

[ 33 ] Spence's designs were appreciated by architects; many of the campus buildings won awards. A number of features define these buildings, including the materials used and the fact that many of them have planted and tree-filled courtyards. The gatehouse -inspired Falmer House won a bronze medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects .

[ 5 ] Another campus building, The Meeting House, won the Civic Trust award in 1969.

[ 34 ] In 1993, the buildings which made up the core of Spence's designs were given listed building status, with Falmer House being awarded the highest designation, Grade 1, as a building of "exceptional interest".

[ 34 ] A number of the original buildings are now Grade II listed buildings .

[ 35 ] Sussex laid claim to being the "only English university located entirely within a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ".

[ 36 ] It is now entirely surrounded by the newly founded South Downs National Park .

Essex House The Gardner Arts Centre, another of Basil Spence's designs, was opened in 1969 as the first university campus arts centre.

[ 37 ] It had a 480-seat purpose-built theatre, a visual art gallery and studio space, and was frequently used for theatre and dance as well as showing a range of films on a modern cinema screen. The Centre closed in the summer of 2007: [ 38 ] withdrawal of funding and the cost of renovating the building were given as the key reasons. Following an extensive refurbishment, the Centre reopened as the Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts (ACCA) in the autumn of 2015, and a public performance programme started in Spring 2016. The centre is now a national arts and performance hub hosting various kinds of performances year-round.

The campus has facilities such as the Genome Damage and Stability Centre; the medical imaging equipment at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS); and the university's Library, until 2013 the home of the Mass Observation Archive, which relocated to The Keep , a purpose-built archive facility nearby.

Library [ edit ] The Sussex Main Library The university's main library is at the centre of its campus. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 13 November 1964. The Royal Literary fund office is based at the Library, providing support for students around academic writing. The Library also houses a research support centre and a research hive for PhD students and research staff.

[ 39 ] There is also a Skills Hub, training facilities, a support centre, a café and a Careers and Employability Centre.

There are also smaller libraries within individual schools and research centres, as well as The Keep .

The university holds a number of acclaimed collections and archives, mostly related to twentieth-century literary, political and cultural history. Collections include original manuscripts and first editions by Virginia Woolf , Jane Austen and Rudyard Kipling as well as The New Statesman Archive and the Mass-Observation Archive .

Organisation and administration [ edit ] Schools of Studies [ edit ] The university was founded with the unusual structure of "Schools of Study" (ubiquitously abbreviated to "schools") rather than traditional university departments within arts and science faculties.

In the early 1990s, the university promoted the system by claiming "[c]lusters of faculty [come] together within schools to pursue new areas of intellectual enquiry. The schools also foster broader intellectual links.

Physics with Management Studies, Science and Engineering with European Studies, Economics with Mathematics all reach beyond conventional Arts/Science divisions." [ 40 ] By this time the original schools had been developed somewhat and were: Shawcross Building African and Asian Studies (abbreviated to AFRAS) Biological Sciences (BIOLS) Chemistry and Molecular Sciences (MOLS) Cognitive and Computing Sciences (COGS) Cultural and Community Studies (CCS) Engineering and Applied Sciences (ENGG, formerly EAPS) English and American (ENGAM or EAM) European Studies (EURO) Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MAPS) Social Sciences (SOC) There was also the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) . This is still located on Sussex's campus, but is now a separate institution.

In 2001, as the university celebrated its 40th anniversary, the then Vice-Chancellor Alasdair Smith proposed major changes to the curriculum across the "Arts schools", and the senate agreed to structural changes which would create two Arts schools and a "Sussex Institute" in place of the five schools then in place. Corresponding changes would be made in Sciences.

[ 41 ] The changes were finally implemented in September 2003.

[ 42 ] After discussion in senate and the schools, disciplinary departments which had been located across the different schools, were located firmly within one school, and undergraduates were offered straightforward degree subjects. The multi-disciplinarity provided by the school courses was now to be achieved through elective courses from other departments and schools.

In 2009 the university adopted a new organisational structure. The term "Schools of Studies" was retained, but each was headed by a "Head of School" rather than the traditional "Dean".

In 2020 the School of English, School of History, Art History and Philosophy, and School of Media, Film and Music were merged to create the School of Media, Arts and Humanities.

[ 43 ] The schools as of 2020 are listed below.

[ 44 ] The term "department" has been retained in some cases, where a school contains separate disciplines.

The Law, Politics and Sociology school School of Engineering and Informatics (two separate schools before 2011) [ 45 ] School of Life Sciences (includes Biology, Environmental Science, Chemistry and Biochemistry and houses the Centre for Genome Damage and Stability) School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) (includes Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy) School of Psychology School of Education and Social Work (ESW) School of Global Studies (includes Anthropology, [ 46 ] Geography, International Development and International Relations, as well as interdisciplinary programmes in Development Studies) School of Law, Politics and Sociology (LPS) School of Media, Arts and Humanities (MAH) (three separate schools before 2020) University of Sussex Business School None of these changes have affected the Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS).

The Doctoral School supports PhD student and Post-docs across all schools and departments and supports PhD students and Post-Docs through the Sussex Research hive, the Researcher Development Program, funding schemes as well as its own partnerships.

[ 47 ] Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors [ edit ] Lord Attenborough in academic regalia The current and fifth Chancellor of the university is Sanjeev Bhaskar , who succeeded Lord Attenborough in 2009.

[ 1 ] Academic profile [ edit ] The university, a member of the Erasmus charter, offers over 400 Undergraduate programs, over 210 Postgraduate taught programs and over 70 PhD programs. It is research-led, with around 1,000 teaching and research staff of which around 300 are research-only staff. Additionally, there are over 1200 PhD students at the university distributed across the different Schools. The university fees are at £9,250 per year for home fee status undergraduates, the highest a university can charge in the United Kingdom.

[ 73 ] Sussex has a number of research collaborations with other Higher Education institutions as well as governmental and non-governmental organisations and institutes around the world. For example, the Harvard Sussex program is a long-standing research collaboration between Sussex and Harvard University focusing on public policy towards chemical and biological weapons. The CBW Conventions Bulletin is a quarterly newsletter published by the HSP.

[ 74 ] Sussex-Cornell Partnership, the Sussex-Bocconi-Renmin Intrapreneurship Hub and the Sussex-Lund Partnership in Middle Eastern and North African Studies are recent examples. Sussex also co-coordinates the Consortium for the Humanities and the Arts.

[ 75 ] Sussex is also one of the eight universities of the Tyndall Centre network.

[ 76 ] In Europe, Sussex is one of the collaborating institutions of the Paul Scherrer Institute , the largest research institute in Switzerland, focusing on issues of technology and the natural sciences.

[ 77 ] Sussex is involved with many projects with the EU and with European countries. For example, BAR research is an Anglo-French collaboration between the Sussex, the East Sussex County Council and three French universities.

[ 78 ] Nationally, Sussex is involved in a number of partnerships including the Nexus Network (A partnership between Sussex, University of Cambridge and the University of East Anglia ) and CIED (a collaboration between Sussex, Oxford University and University of Manchester ).

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] The university is also a partner of the Metropolitan Police , with Demos (UK think tank) and Palantir Technologies .

[ 81 ] In recent years, [ when?

] the institutes for the study of consciousness science, Centre for Advanced International Theory (CAIT), the institute for the study of corruption and the Middle East studies institute were opened at the university. The university also has a Genome Damage and Stability Centre, a nuclear magnetic resonance facility and a purpose-built apparatus in cryogenic research.

[ 82 ] In terms of policy, Sussex is highly involved with the UK government, the UN and governments around the world. For example, the university is a UN Habitat partner.

[ 83 ] Nationally, the UK Trade Policy Observatory was set up at the university to offer the UK government, the UK industry as well as the public advice in addressing trade issues resulting from Brexit.

[ 84 ] The university is also one of the UK government's partner institutions on the Arctic Research Program.

[ 102 ] Educational partners [ edit ] Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) results from a partnership between the University of Brighton and the University of Sussex. The school, the first medical school in the South East outside London, gained its licence in 2002 and opened in 2003. The Guardian ranked the medical school as 16th in the UK in 2018.

[ 103 ] BSMS building The Institute of Development Studies offers research, teaching and communications related to international development. IDS originated in 1966 as a research institute based at the university. It is financially and constitutionally independent under the status of a charitable company limited by guarantee.

The Centre for Research in Innovation Management , a research-based school of the University of Brighton , dates from 1990. It was located in the Freeman Centre building but has now moved to the University of Brighton campus.

The Sussex Innovation Centre, an on-campus commercial business centre, opened in 1996. It provides services for the formation and growth of technology- and knowledge-based companies in the South East. It offers a business environment to over 40 companies in the IT, biotech, media and engineering sectors.

Nationally, the university has a number of partner institutions across the UK including Bellerbys College , British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM), University Centre Croydon (UCC, also known as Croydon College ), Highbury College Portsmouth, International Study Centre (Study Group), Roffey Park Institute, University of Brighton and West Dean College . These partnerships include both validated courses (designed and delivered by the partner institution but awarded and quality assured by the university) and franchised courses (designed and assessed by the university, but delivered by another institution).

[ 104 ] Study Group works in partnership with the university to provide the University of Sussex International Study Centre (ISC).

[ 105 ] It offers a course of academic subjects, study skills and English-language training for students who wish to study a degree at the university but who do not yet possess the necessary qualifications to start a degree. The ISC course provides students with English-language and academic skills to start at Sussex the following year.

It runs two bars (Falmer Bar, which once hosted bands such as The Who , and Northfield Bar), two shops, a cafe and a number of other outlets and schemes (such as the buddy scheme).

[ 113 ] There are 261 student clubs and societies at Sussex, all functioning under the Student Union.

[ 114 ] Like many campus universities, many of the students studying at Sussex live in the city. Students are highly involved in Brighton's life, from its cultural scene to community service. In 2016, Sussex won the AGCAS award for Student engagement.

[ 115 ] In 2017, Sussex was ranked as top in the UK for political scene (tied with Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester, Goldsmith and LSE).

[ 116 ] Student support [ edit ] A wide range of support is offered by the university, with key student support services (e.g. financial, counselling, careers, exceptional circumstances, disability support) offered via the Student Centre, [ 117 ] which replaced the Student Life Centre in 2022.

[ 142 ] Around 5000 undergraduate and postgraduate students live in University-managed accommodation, [ 143 ] but many live in private accommodation or with family members.

After the initial campus opening, accommodation on campus was expanded in the 1970s with the construction of Kulukundis House, for students with physical disabilities, and the unusual split-level flats of East Slope, [ 144 ] a development that included a social building with a porter's office and bar.  Two newer accommodation areas were completed in the 2000s: one next to Falmer railway station , named Stanmer Court, [ 145 ] and the other next to East Slope, opposite Bramber House, known as Swanborough.

[ 146 ] Northfield was constructed at the top end of campus, beyond Lewes Court, and opened in September 2011.

[ 147 ] In 2017, the old East Slope buildings were demolished to create up to date accommodation (also called East Slope) and a new Student Centre, which opened in phases between 2021 and 2022 [ 148 ] [ 149 ] In 2020, the university announced that they plan to replace Park Village and Park Houses (excluding Norwich House) with the new West Slope development, as well as creating new facilities including a new library, cafe, supermarket, additional study spaces, and flexible green space. The first phase is projected to be completed by autumn 2022 and this work is projected to be fully completed by 2025. The new accommodation will provide approximately 1000 additional bedrooms.

[ 150 ] The university's Sustainability Action Plan released in June 2021 includes plans for increasing the energy efficiency of campus housing and ancillary facilities in an effort to reach net zero by 2035. The plan includes upgrading building energy management systems by August 2022 and assessing if the BREEAM Excellent environmental construction standards are sufficient for new construction by December 2022.
