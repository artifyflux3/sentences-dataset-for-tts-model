New Jersey is a state located in both the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the United States. Located  at the geographic hub of the heavily urbanized Northeast megalopolis , it is bordered to the northwest, north, and northeast by New York State ; on its east, southeast, and south by the Atlantic Ocean ; on its west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania ; and on its southwest by Delaware Bay and Delaware . At 7,354 square miles (19,050 km 2 ), New Jersey is the fifth-smallest state in land area . According to a 2024 U.S. Census Bureau estimate, it is the 11th-most populous state , with over 9.5 million residents, its highest estimated count ever. The state capital is Trenton , and the state's most populous city is Newark . New Jersey is the only U.S. state in which every county is deemed urban by the U.S. Census Bureau. It is the most densely populated U.S. state.

New Jersey was first inhabited by Paleo-Indians as early as 13,000 BC. The Lenape were the dominant Indigenous group when Europeans arrived in the early 17th century, and they were subdivided into dialectal groups such as the Munsee, in the north, and the Unami and the Unalachtigo, elsewhere.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Dutch and Swedish colonists founded the first European settlements in the state, [ 11 ] with the British later seizing control of the region and establishing the Province of New Jersey , named after Jersey .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] The colony's fertile lands and relative religious tolerance drew a large and diverse population. New Jersey was among the Thirteen Colonies that supported the American Revolution , hosting several pivotal battles and military commands in the American Revolutionary War . New Jersey remained in the Union during the American Civil War and provided troops, resources, and military leaders in support of the Union Army . After the war, the state emerged as a major manufacturing center and a leading destination for immigrants, helping drive the Industrial Revolution in the U.S. New Jersey was the site of many industrial, technological, and commercial innovations .

[ 14 ] Many prominent Americans associated with New Jersey have proven influential nationally and globally, including in academia, advocacy, business, entertainment, government, military, non-profit leadership, and other fields.

New Jersey's central location in the Northeast megalopolis helped fuel its rapid growth and suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the state's economy has become highly diversified, with major sectors including biotechnology , pharmaceuticals , information technology , finance , and tourism, and it has become an Atlantic seaboard epicenter for logistics and distribution . New Jersey remains a major destination for immigrants and is home to one of the world's most multicultural populations .

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Echoing historical trends, the state has increasingly re-urbanized, with growth in cities outpacing suburbs since 2008.

[ 17 ] New Jersey is one of the most educated, affluent, healthy, diverse, and highly developed states in the U.S., ranking high among states in several quality of life metrics.

[ 18 ] New Jersey had a median household income of $99,781 as of 2023, the second-highest of any U.S. state behind Massachusetts .

[ 19 ] Almost one-tenth of all households in the state, or over 323,000, are millionaires , the highest representation of millionaires among all states.

[ 20 ] New Jersey's public school system consistently ranks at or among the top of all U.S. states.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] In 2024, New Jersey was ranked as having the second-healthiest population overall.

[ 25 ] New Jersey ranks near the top on both the American Human Development Index and the standard Human Development Index . According to climatology research by the U.S.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , New Jersey has been the fastest-warming state by average air temperature over a 100-year period beginning in the early 20th century, which has been attributed to warming of the North Atlantic Ocean .

[ 26 ] History Main article: History of New Jersey Prehistoric era See also: Paleontology in New Jersey The pressure of collision between North America and Africa gave rise to the Appalachian Mountains . Around 18,000 years ago, the Ice Age resulted in glaciers that reached New Jersey. As glaciers retreated, they left behind Lake Passaic along with rivers, meadows , swamps, and gorges .

[ 27 ] Since the 6th millennium BC , Native American people have inhabited New Jersey, beginning with the Lenape tribe .

Scheyichbi is the Lenape name for the land that represents present-day New Jersey.

[ 28 ] The Lenape were several autonomous groups that practiced maize agriculture in order to supplement their hunting and gathering in the region surrounding the Delaware River , the lower Hudson River , and western Long Island Sound . The Lenape were divided into matrilineal clans that were based upon common female ancestors. Clans were organized into three distinct phratries identified by their animal sign: Turtle , Turkey , and Wolf . They first encountered the Dutch in the early 17th century, and their primary relationship with the Dutch and later European settlers was through fur trade .

Colonial era Main articles: Colonial history of New Jersey , New Netherland , New Sweden , Province of New Jersey , East Jersey , West Jersey , and Dominion of New England A map of New Netherland and New Sweden in present-day New Jersey during the colonial era The Dutch were the first Europeans to lay claim to geographic territory in New Jersey. The Dutch colony of New Netherland consisted of parts of the modern Mid-Atlantic states. Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape , Dutch West India Company policy required its colonists to purchase land that they settled. The first to do so was Michiel Pauw , who established a patron ship called Pavonia in 1630 along North River , that eventually became Bergen .

Peter Minuit 's purchase of lands along the Delaware River established the colony of New Sweden , that lasted until the Dutch conquered it in 1655. Then the entire region became a territory of England on June 24, 1664, after an English fleet under command of Colonel Richard Nicolls sailed into what is now New York Harbor and took control of Fort Amsterdam , annexing the entire province.

During the English Civil War , the Channel Island of Jersey remained loyal to the British Crown and gave sanctuary to the King . In the Royal Square in St Helier , Charles II of England was proclaimed King in 1649, following the execution of his father, Charles I . North American lands were divided by Charles II , who gave his brother, the Duke of York (later King James II ), the region between New England and Maryland as a proprietary colony (as opposed to a royal colony ). James then granted land between the Hudson River and the Delaware River (the land that would become New Jersey) to two friends who had remained loyal through the English Civil War : Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkeley of Stratton .

[ 29 ] The area was named the Province of New Jersey .

Since its inception, New Jersey has been characterized by ethnic and religious diversity . New England Congregationalists settled alongside Scots Presbyterians and Dutch Reformed migrants. While the majority of residents lived in towns with individual landholdings of 100 acres (40 ha), a few rich proprietors owned vast estates. English Quakers and Anglicans owned large landholdings. Unlike Plymouth Colony , Jamestown and other colonies, New Jersey was populated by a secondary wave of immigrants who came from other colonies instead of those who migrated directly from Europe. New Jersey remained agrarian and rural throughout the colonial era, and commercial farming developed sporadically. Some townships, such as Burlington on the Delaware River and Perth Amboy , emerged as important ports for shipping to New York City and Philadelphia. The colony's fertile lands and tolerant religious policy drew more settlers, and New Jersey's population had increased to 120,000 by 1775.

Settlement for the first ten years of English rule took place along the Hackensack River and Arthur Kill . Settlers came primarily from New York and New England. On March 18, 1673, Berkeley sold his half of the colony to Quakers in England, who settled the Delaware Valley region as a Quaker colony, with William Penn acting as trustee for the lands for a time. New Jersey was governed as two distinct provinces, East and West Jersey , for 28 years between 1674 and 1702, which were part of the Dominion of New England from 1686 to 1689.

In 1702, the two provinces were reunited under a royal governor rather than a proprietary one .

Edward Hyde , titled Lord Cornbury, became the first governor of the royal colony. Britain believed that he was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land. In 1708, he was recalled to England. New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of New York, but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey, who accused these governors of favoritism to New York.

Judge Lewis Morris led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor by King George II in 1738.

The New Jersey Constitution of 1776 was passed July 2, 1776, just two days before the Second Continental Congress declared American Independence from Great Britain . It was an act of the Provincial Congress , which made itself into the State Legislature . To reassure neutrals, it provided that the legislature would disband if New Jersey reached reconciliation with Great Britain. Among the 56 Founding Fathers who signed the Declaration of Independence , five were New Jersey representatives: Richard Stockton , John Witherspoon , Francis Hopkinson , John Hart , and Abraham Clark .

During the American Revolutionary War , British and American armies crossed New Jersey numerous times, and several pivotal battles took place in the state. Because of this, New Jersey today is sometimes referred to as "The Crossroads of the American Revolution".

[ 31 ] The winter quarters of the Continental Army were established in New Jersey twice by General George Washington in Morristown , which has been called "The Military Capital of the American Revolution." [ 32 ] On the night of December 25–26, 1776, the Continental Army under George Washington crossed the Delaware River . After the crossing, they surprised and defeated the Hessian troops in the Battle of Trenton . Slightly more than a week after victory at Trenton , Continental Army forces gained an important victory by stopping General Cornwallis's charges at the Second Battle of Trenton . By evading Cornwallis's army, the Continental Army was able to make a surprise attack on Princeton and successfully defeated the British forces there on January 3, 1777.

Emanuel Leutze 's painting of Washington Crossing the Delaware became an icon of the Revolution.

Continental Army forces under Washington's command met British forces under General Henry Clinton at the Battle of Monmouth in an indecisive engagement in June 1778. Washington's forces attempted to take the British column by surprise. When the British army attempted to flank the Americans, the Continental Army retreated in disorder. Their ranks were later reorganized and withstood British charges.

[ 33 ] In the summer of 1783, the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall at Princeton University , making Princeton the nation's capital for four months. It was there that the Continental Congress learned of the signing of the Treaty of Paris , which ended the war.

On December 18, 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the United States Constitution , which was overwhelmingly popular in New Jersey since it prevented New York and Pennsylvania from charging tariffs on goods imported from Europe. On November 20, 1789, New Jersey became the first in the newly formed Union to ratify the Bill of Rights .

[ 34 ] The 1776 New Jersey State Constitution gave the vote to all inhabitants who had a certain level of wealth. This included women and Black people, but not married women because they were not legally permitted to own property separately from their husbands. Both sides, in several elections, claimed that the other side had had unqualified women vote and mocked them for use of petticoat electors, whether entitled to vote or not; on the other hand, both parties passed Voting Rights Acts. In 1807, legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal white male suffrage , excluding paupers; the constitution was itself an act of the legislature and not enshrined as the modern constitution.

[ 35 ] 19th century Main articles: New Jersey in the 19th century and New Jersey in the American Civil War Map of the 107-mile-long (172 km) Morris Canal , which crosses the state On February 15, 1804, New Jersey became the last northern state to abolish new slavery and enacted legislation that slowly phased out existing slavery. This led to a gradual decrease of the slave population. By the American Civil War 's end, about a dozen African Americans in New Jersey were still held in bondage.

[ 36 ] New Jersey voters eventually ratified the constitutional amendments banning slavery and granting rights to the United States' black population.

Industrialization accelerated in the present-day North Jersey region of the state following completion of the Morris Canal in 1831. The canal allowed for anthracite coal to be transported from eastern Pennsylvania 's Lehigh Valley to North Jersey's growing industries in Paterson , Newark , and Jersey City .

In 1844, the second state constitution was ratified and brought into effect. Counties thereby became districts for the state senate, and some realignment of boundaries (including the creation of Mercer County ) immediately followed. This provision was retained in the 1947 Constitution, but was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1962, by the decision Baker v. Carr . While the Governorship was stronger than under the 1776 constitution, the constitution of 1844 created many offices that were not responsible to him, or to the people, and it gave him a three-year term, but he could not succeed himself.

New Jersey was one of the few Union states (the others being Delaware and Kentucky ) to select a candidate other than Abraham Lincoln twice in national elections, and sided with Stephen A. Douglas (1860) and George B. McClellan (1864) during their campaigns. McClellan, a native Philadelphian, had New Jersey ties and formally resided in New Jersey at the time; he later became Governor of New Jersey (1878–81). (In New Jersey, the factions of the Democratic party managed an effective coalition in 1860.) During the American Civil War , the state was led first by Republican governor Charles Smith Olden , then by Democrat Joel Parker . During the course of the war, between 65,000 and 80,000 soldiers from the state enlisted in the Union army; unlike many states, including some Northern ones, no battle was fought there.

[ 37 ] In the Industrial Revolution , cities like Paterson grew and prospered. Previously, the economy had been largely agrarian, which was problematically subject to crop failures and poor soil. This caused a shift to a more industrialized economy, one based on manufactured commodities such as textiles and silk.

Inventor Thomas Edison also became an important figure of the Industrial Revolution, having been granted 1,093 patents , many of which for inventions he developed while working in New Jersey. Edison's facilities, first at Menlo Park and then in West Orange , are considered perhaps the first research centers in the United States. Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first thoroughfare in the world to have electric lighting. Transportation was greatly improved as locomotion and steamboats were introduced to New Jersey.

Iron mining was also a leading industry during the middle to late 19th century.

Bog iron pits in the New Jersey Pine Barrens were among the first sources of iron for the new nation.

[ 38 ] Mines such as Mt. Hope, Mine Hill, and the Rockaway Valley Mines created a thriving industry. Mining generated the impetus for new towns and was one of the driving forces behind the need for the Morris Canal .

Zinc mines were also a major industry, especially the Sterling Hill Mine .

20th century Main article: New Jersey in the 20th century New Jersey prospered through the Roaring Twenties . The first Miss America Pageant was held in 1921 in Atlantic City ; the Holland Tunnel connecting Jersey City to Manhattan opened in 1927; and the first drive-in movie was shown in 1933 in Camden . During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the state offered begging licenses to unemployed residents, [ 39 ] the zeppelin airship Hindenburg crashed in flames over Lakehurst , and the SS Morro Castle beached itself near Asbury Park after going up in flames while at sea.

Through both World Wars , New Jersey was a center for war production, especially naval construction. The Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company yards in Kearny and Newark and the New York Shipbuilding Corporation yard in Camden produced aircraft carriers , battleships, cruisers, and destroyers.

[ 40 ] New Jersey manufactured 6.8 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II , ranking fifth among the 48 states.

[ 41 ] In addition, Fort Dix (1917) (originally called "Camp Dix"), [ 42 ] Camp Merritt (1917), [ 43 ] and Camp Kilmer (1941) [ citation needed ] were all constructed to house and train American soldiers through both World Wars. New Jersey also became a principal location for defense in the Cold War . Fourteen Nike missile stations were constructed for the defense of the New York City and Philadelphia areas.

PT-109 , a motor torpedo boat commanded by Lt. (j.g.) John F. Kennedy in World War II, was built at the Elco Boatworks in Bayonne . The aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CV-6) was briefly docked at the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne in the 1950s before she was sent to Kearney to be scrapped.

[ 44 ] In 1962, the world's first nuclear-powered cargo ship, the NS Savannah , was launched at Camden.

In 1951, the New Jersey Turnpike opened, facilitating efficient travel by car and truck between North Jersey and metropolitan New York , and South Jersey and metropolitan Philadelphia .

[ 45 ] Subsequently, in 1957, the Garden State Parkway was completed, serving as a diagonal counterpart to the Turnpike, and opening up highway travel along New Jersey's coastal flank between Bergen County in the northeast and the Cape May County peninsula at the southeastern tip of New Jersey; in doing so, the Jersey Shore became readily accessible to millions of residents in the New York metropolitan area. In 1959, Air Defense Command deployed the CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missile to McGuire Air Force Base . On June 7, 1960, an explosion in a CIM-10 Bomarc missile fuel tank caused an accident and subsequent plutonium contamination.

[ 46 ] In the 1960s, race riots erupted in many of the industrial cities of North Jersey . The first race riots in New Jersey occurred in Jersey City on August 2, 1964. Several others ensued in 1967, in Newark and Plainfield .

Other riots followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

in April 1968, just as in the rest of the country. A riot occurred in Camden in 1971. As a result of an order from the New Jersey Supreme Court to fund schools equitably, the New Jersey legislature passed an income tax bill in 1976. Prior to this bill, the state had no income tax.

[ 47 ] 21st century Main article: New Jersey in the 21st century In the early part of the 2000s, two light rail systems were opened: the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) in Hudson County and the River Line between Camden and Trenton . The intent of these projects was to encourage transit-oriented development in North Jersey and South Jersey , respectively. The HBLR was credited with a revitalization of Hudson County and Jersey City .

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Urban revitalization has continued in North Jersey in the 21st century. In 2014, Jersey City's Census-estimated population was 262,146, [ 52 ] with the largest population increase of any municipality in New Jersey since 2010, [ 53 ] representing an increase of 5.9% from the 2010 U.S. census , when the city's population was enumerated at 247,597.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] In 2017, Jersey City's tax base grew by US$136 million, giving Jersey City the largest municipal tax base in New Jersey.

[ 56 ] Between 2000 and 2010 Newark experienced its first population increase since the 1950s, and by 2020 had rebounded to 311,549.

At 69.6 mi (112.0 km) in length, Raritan River is the longest river entirely within New Jersey, flowing from Raritan Valley near Clinton (above), eastward to Raritan Bay and the Atlantic Ocean .

Great Falls of the Passaic River in Paterson was designated a U.S. National Historical Park in 2009.

New Jersey is at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , the most populated American urban agglomeration . It is bordered on the north and northeast by New York (parts of which are across the Hudson River , Upper New York Bay , the Kill Van Kull , Newark Bay , and the Arthur Kill ); on the east by the Atlantic Ocean; on the southwest by Delaware across Delaware Bay ; and on the west by Pennsylvania across the Delaware River .

New Jersey is broadly divided into the North , Central , and South Jersey geographic regions, although some residents do not consider Central Jersey a region in its own right. Across the regions are five distinct areas divided by natural geography and population concentration. Northeastern New Jersey, often referred to as the Gateway Region , lies closest to Manhattan in New York City, and up to a million residents commute daily into the city for work, many via public transportation.

[ 68 ] The Jersey Shore , along the Atlantic Coast in Central and South Jersey, has its own unique natural, residential, and cultural characteristics owing to its location by the ocean. South Jersey represents the southernmost geographical region of the northeastern United States . The Delaware Valley includes the southwestern counties of the state, which reside within the Delaware Valley surrounding Philadelphia .

Despite the state's heavily urban character and a long history of industrialization , forests cover roughly 45 percent of New Jersey's land area, or approximately 2.1 million acres (8,500 km 2 ), ranking 31st among the 50 U.S. states and six territories.

[ 69 ] Northwestern New Jersey, often referred to as the Skylands Region , is more wooded, rural, and mountainous. The chief tree of the northern forests is the oak . The New Jersey Pine Barrens is situated in the southern interior of New Jersey and covered extensively by mixed pine and oak forest; its population density is lower than most of the state.

High Point in Montague Township , Sussex County is the state's highest elevation at 1,803 feet (550 m) above sea level. The state's highest prominence is Kitty Ann Mountain in Morris County , rising 892 feet (272 m). The Palisades are a line of steep cliffs on the west side of the Hudson River in Bergen and Hudson Counties . Major New Jersey rivers include the Hudson , Delaware , Raritan , Passaic , Hackensack , Rahway , Musconetcong , Mullica , Rancocas , Manasquan , Maurice , and Toms rivers. Due to New Jersey's peninsular geography, both sunrise and sunset are visible over water from different points on the Jersey Shore.

Prominent geographic features The Jersey Shore extends inland from the Atlantic Ocean into its many inlets , including Manasquan Inlet , looking westward at sunset from the jetty at Manasquan Delaware Water Gap Great Bay Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge Highlands Hudson Palisades Jersey Shore On the shore, New Jersey hosts the highest concentration of oceanside boardwalks in the world .

Meadowlands New Jersey Pine Barrens Ramapo Mountain South Mountain Climate Main article: Climate of New Jersey The state consists of two climate zones; most of the state has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), while the northwest has a humid continental climate (Dfa).

[ 70 ] New Jersey receives between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually.

[ 71 ] Summers are typically hot and humid, with statewide average high temperatures of 82–87 °F (28–31 °C) and lows of 60–69 °F (16–21 °C); however, temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on average 25 days each summer, exceeding 100 °F (38 °C) in some years. Winters are usually cold, with average high temperatures of 34–43 °F (1–6 °C) and lows of 16 to 28 °F (−9 to −2 °C) for most of the state, but temperatures can, for brief periods, fall below 10 °F (−12 °C) and sometimes rise above 50 °F (10 °C). Northwestern parts of the state have significantly colder winters with sub-0 °F (−18 °C) being an almost annual occurrence. Spring and autumn may feature wide temperature variations, with lower humidity than summer. The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone classification ranges from 6 in the northwest of the state, to 7B near Cape May.

[ 72 ] All-time temperature extremes recorded in New Jersey include 110 °F (43 °C) on July 10, 1936, in Runyon , Middlesex County and −34 °F (−37 °C) on January 5, 1904, in River Vale , Bergen County.

[ 73 ] Average annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 51 inches (1,100 to 1,300 mm), spread uniformly throughout the year. Average snowfall per winter season ranges from 10–15 inches (25–38 cm) in the south and near the seacoast, 15–30 inches (38–76 cm) in the northeast and central part of the state, to about 40–50 inches (1.0–1.3 m) in the northwestern highlands, but this often varies considerably from year to year. Precipitation falls on an average of 120 days a year, with 25 to 30 thunderstorms, most of which occur during the summer.

During winter and early spring, New Jersey can experience nor'easters , which are capable of causing blizzards or flooding throughout the northeastern United States.

Hurricanes and tropical storms , tornadoes , and earthquakes are rare; the state was impacted by a hurricane in 1903 , Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999 , [ 74 ] and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 , which made landfall in the state with top winds of 90 mph (145 km/h).

Climate change Climate change is affecting New Jersey faster than much of the rest of the United States.

Climatologists at the U.S.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have concluded that New Jersey has been the fastest-warming state by average air temperature over a 100-year period beginning in the early 20th century.

Warren County is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area based in eastern Pennsylvania .

Counties Map of New Jersey counties The 21 counties in New Jersey, ranked by population in the 2020 United States census , are: [ 75 ] Bergen County : 955,732 Essex County : 863,728 Middlesex County : 863,162 Hudson County : 724,854 Monmouth County : 643,615 Ocean County : 637,229 Union County : 575,345 Passaic County : 524,118 Camden County : 523,485 Morris County : 509,285 Burlington County : 461,860 Mercer County : 387,340 Somerset County : 345,361 Gloucester County : 302,294 Atlantic County : 274,534 Cumberland County : 154,152 Sussex County : 144,221 Hunterdon County : 128,947 Warren County : 109,632 Cape May County : 95,263 Salem County : 64,837 Municipalities For its overall population and nation-leading population density, New Jersey has a relative paucity of classic large cities. This paradox is most pronounced in Bergen County , the state's most populous county, whose 955,732 residents at the 2020 census inhabited 70 municipalities, of which the most populous is Hackensack , with 46,030 residents. Many urban areas extend far beyond the limits of a single large city, as New Jersey municipalities tend to be geographically small; three of the four largest cities in New Jersey by population have under 20 square miles (52 km 2 ) of land area, and eight of the top ten, including all the top five, have a land area under 30 square miles (78 km 2 ). As of the 2010 United States census [update] , only four municipalities had over 100,000 residents (although Edison and Woodbridge Township came very close); this number increased to seven by the 2020 census.

According to the 2020 U.S. census , the state had a population of 9,288,994, a 5.7% increase since the 2010 U.S. census , which counted 8,791,894 residents.

[ 5 ] The state ranked eleventh in the country by total population and first in population density, with 1,185 residents per square mile (458 per km 2 ). Historically, New Jersey has experienced one of the fastest growth rates in the country, with its population increasing by double digits almost every decade until 1980; growth has since slowed but remained relatively robust until recently. In 2022, the Census Bureau estimated there were 6,262 fewer residents than in 2020, a decline of 0.3% from 2020, related to the COVID-19 pandemic .

[ 78 ] In 2024, the Census Bureau reported that the state population rebounded by 2.3% or 211,837 residents from April 2020. New Jersey lead the Northeast with a 1.3% growth rate or 121,209 residents from 2023 placing it among the top ten states nationwide for population growth.

[ 79 ] New Jersey is the only state where every county is deemed urban as defined by the Census Bureau .

[ 80 ] Most residents live in the counties surrounding New York City , the nation's largest city, Philadelphia , the nation's sixth-largest city, or along the eastern Jersey Shore ; the extreme southern and northwestern counties are relatively less dense overall. Since the 2000 census, the United States Census Bureau calculated that New Jersey's center of population was located in East Brunswick .

[ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] The state is located in the middle of the Northeast megalopolis , which has more than 50 million residents.

As of 2023, New Jersey had a median household income of $99,781, the second-highest of any U.S. state behind Massachusetts .

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] Conversely, New Jersey's poverty rate of 9.4% was slightly lower than the national average of 11.4%, [ 85 ] and the sixth lowest of the fifty states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico . This is attributed to several factors, including the state's proximity to the major economic centers of New York City and Philadelphia , its hosting the highest number of millionaires both per capita and per square mile in the U.S., and the fact that it has the most scientists and engineers per square mile in the world.

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report , there were an estimated 8,752 homeless people in New Jersey.

[ 89 ] The top countries of origin for New Jersey's immigrants in 2018 were India , Dominican Republic , Mexico , Ecuador , and the Philippines .

[ 90 ] Race and ethnicity Ethnic origins in New Jersey New Jersey is one of the most ethnically diverse states in the United States: as of 2022, over one-fifth (21.5%) of its residents are Hispanic or Latino, 15.3% are Black, and one-tenth are Asian. One in four New Jerseyans were born abroad and more than one million (12.1%) are not fully fluent in English. Compared to the U.S. as a whole, the state is more racially and ethnically diverse and has a higher proportion of immigrants.

Same-sex marriage in New Jersey has been legally recognized since October 21, 2013, the effective date of a trial court ruling invalidating New Jersey's restriction of marriage to persons of different sexes at the time. In September 2013, Mary C. Jacobson, Assignment Judge of the Mercer Vicinage of the Superior Court , ruled that as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court 's June 2013 decision in United States v. Windsor , the Constitution of New Jersey requires the state to recognize same-sex marriages .

[ 152 ] Numerous gayborhoods have emerged in New Jersey, most prominently in Jersey City , [ 153 ] Asbury Park , Maplewood , [ 154 ] Montclair , and Lambertville .

As of 2023, the Devils have appeared in 23 postseasons in 40 seasons in New Jersey, reaching five Stanley Cup Finals (most recently in 2012 ) and winning it in 1995 , 2000 , and 2003 . The organization is the youngest of the nine "Big Four" major league teams based in New York metropolitan area, ultimately establishing its core following throughout the northern and central portions of the state and carving a place in a media market once dominated by the New York Rangers and Islanders which has the distinction of being the only metropolitan area in the country with three major league professional sports teams participating in the same sport.

In 2018, the Philadelphia Flyers renovated and expanded their training facility, the Virtua Center Flyers Skate Zone, in Voorhees Township in the southern portion of the state.

The intense rivalry between Rutgers and Princeton athletics began with the first intercollegiate football game in 1869. The schools have not met on the football field since 1980, but they continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.

Rutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its football program, with a 6–4 all-time bowl record; and its women's basketball programs, which appeared in a National Final in 2007. In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home, Rutgers Stadium , now called SHI Stadium, on the Busch Campus . The basketball teams play at the Rutgers Athletic Center on Livingston Campus . Both venues and campuses are in Piscataway , across the Raritan River from New Brunswick . The university also fields men's basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers' fans live mostly in the western parts of the state and Middlesex County ; its alumni base is the largest in the state.

Rutgers' satellite campuses in Camden and Newark each field their own athletic programs—the Rutgers–Camden Scarlet Raptors and the Rutgers–Newark Scarlet Raiders —which both compete in NCAA Division III .

Seton Hall fields no football team, but its men's basketball team is one of the Big East 's storied programs. No New Jersey team has won more games in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament , and it is the state's only men's basketball program to reach a modern National Final . The Pirates play their home games at Prudential Center in downtown Newark , about 4 miles (6 km) from the university's South Orange campus. Their fans hail largely from the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the Jersey Shore . The annual inter-conference rivalry game between Seton Hall and Rutgers, whose venue alternates between Newark and Piscataway, the Garden State Hardwood Classic, is planned through 2026.

[ 273 ] Other schools The state's other Division I schools include the Monmouth University Hawks (West Long Branch), the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders (Newark), the Rider University Broncs (Lawrenceville), and the Saint Peter's University Peacocks and Peahens (Jersey City).

Fairleigh Dickinson University competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the Northeast Conference and NCAA Division I. The college at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the Middle Atlantic Conferences' Freedom Conference and NCAA Division III.

Among the various Division III schools in the state, the Stevens Institute of Technology Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men's lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.

High school New Jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA).

Governor since September 8, 2023 The position of Governor of New Jersey is one of the most powerful in the nation. The governor is elected on a ticket with their lieutenant governor as the only statewide elected executive officials in the state; the governor appoints the entire executive cabinet and judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts.

Phil Murphy ( D ) is the governor . The governor's mansion is Drumthwacket , located in Princeton , Mercer County .

Before 2010, New Jersey was one of the few states without a lieutenant governor .

Republican Kim Guadagno was elected the first lieutenant governor of New Jersey on the Republican ticket with Governor Chris Christie and took office on January 19, 2010. The position was created as the result of a Constitutional amendment to the New Jersey State Constitution passed by the voters in 2005. Previously a gubernatorial vacancy would be filled by the president of the New Jersey State Senate as acting governor, thus directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process.

Legislative Main article: New Jersey Legislature The design of the golden-domed New Jersey State House in Trenton differs from most other U.S. state houses in not resembling the U.S. Capitol .

The current version of the New Jersey State Constitution was adopted in 1947. It provides for a bicameral New Jersey Legislature , consisting of an upper house Senate of 40 members and a lower house General Assembly of 80 members. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one state senator and two Assembly members. Assembly members are elected for a two-year term in all odd-numbered years; state senators are elected in years ending in 1, 3, and 7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms.

New Jersey is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years (the others are Kentucky , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Virginia ). New Jersey holds elections for these offices every four years, in the year following each federal Presidential election year.

Judicial Main article: Judiciary of New Jersey The New Jersey Supreme Court [ 276 ] consists of a chief justice and six associate justices. All are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. Justices serve an initial seven-year term, after which they can be reappointed to serve until age 70.

Most of the day-to-day work in the New Jersey courts is carried out in the Municipal Court, where simple traffic tickets, minor criminal offenses, and small civil matters are heard.

More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the Superior Court for each county. All Superior Court judges are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. Each judge serves an initial seven-year term and can be reappointed to serve until age 70. New Jersey's judiciary is unusual in that it still has separate courts of law and equity , like its neighbor Delaware but unlike most other U.S. states. The New Jersey Superior Court is divided into Law and Chancery Divisions at the trial level; the Law Division hears both criminal cases and civil lawsuits where the plaintiff's primary remedy is damages , while the Chancery Division hears family cases, civil suits where the plaintiff's primary remedy is equitable relief, and probate trials.

The Superior Court also has an Appellate Division , which functions as the state's intermediate appellate court . Superior Court judges are assigned to the Appellate Division by the Chief Justice.

There is also a Tax Court, which is a court of limited jurisdiction. Tax Court judges hear appeals of tax decisions made by County Boards of Taxation. They also hear appeals on decisions made by the director of the Division of Taxation on such matters as state income, sales and business taxes, and homestead rebates. Appeals from Tax Court decisions are heard in the Appellate Division of Superior Court. Tax Court judges are appointed by the governor for initial terms of seven years, and upon reappointment are granted tenure until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70. There are 12 Tax Court judgeships.

Counties Further information: List of New Jersey counties New Jersey is divided into 21 counties; 13 date from the colonial era. New Jersey was completely divided into counties by 1692; the present counties were created by dividing the existing ones; most recently Union County in 1857.

[ 277 ] New Jersey was formerly the only state in the nation where elected county officials were called freeholders. Elected county officials are now called county commissioners as of bill S855 signed by Governor Murphy on August 8, 2020. The county commissioners govern each county as part of its own Board of Chosen County Commissioners [ 278 ] The number of county commissioners in each county is determined by referendum, and must consist of three, five, seven or nine members.

Depending on the county, the executive and legislative functions may be performed by the Board of County Commissioners or split into separate branches of government. In 16 counties, the County Commissioners perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis, with each commissioner assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments. In the other five counties ( Atlantic , Bergen , Essex , Hudson and Mercer ), there is a directly elected County Executive who performs the executive functions while the commissioners retain a legislative and oversight role. In counties without an Executive, a County Administrator (or County Manager) may be hired to perform day-to-day administration of county functions.

[ 279 ] Municipalities Further information: List of municipalities in New Jersey New Jersey currently has 564 municipalities; the most recent dissolution of a municipality was when Pine Valley merged into Pine Hill on January 1, 2022. Unlike other states, all New Jersey land is part of a municipality. In 2008, Governor Jon Corzine proposed cutting state aid to all towns under 10,000 people, to encourage mergers to reduce administrative costs.

[ 280 ] In May 2009, the Local Unit Alignment Reorganization and Consolidation Commission began a study of about 40 small communities in South Jersey to decide which ones might be good candidates for consolidation.

[ 281 ] Forms of municipal government New Jersey municipal government Traditional types Borough Township City Town Village Modern forms Walsh Act commission 1923 municipal manager Faulkner Act forms Mayor–council Council–manager Small municipality Mayor–council–administrator Nonstandard forms Special charter Changing form of municipal government Charter Study Commission v t e Starting in the 20th century, largely driven by reform-minded goals, a series of six modern forms of government was implemented. This began with the Walsh Act , enacted in 1911 by the New Jersey Legislature , which provided for a three- or five-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis. This was followed by the 1923 Municipal Manager Law , which offered a non-partisan council, provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council, and introduced a Council-manager government structure with an appointed manager responsible for the day-to-day administration of municipal affairs.

The Faulkner Act , originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981, offers four basic plans: Mayor-Council , Council-Manager , Small Municipality , and Mayor-Council-Administrator . The act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government: the number of seats on the council; seats selected at-large, by wards, or through a combination of both; staggered or concurrent terms of office; and a mayor chosen by the council or elected directly by voters. Most large municipalities and a majority of New Jersey's residents are governed by municipalities with Faulkner Act charters. Municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a Special Charter with the approval of the New Jersey Legislature .

[ 282 ] While municipalities retain their names derived from types of government, they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government, or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms, leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public. For example, though there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type, none use the village form of government.

Loch Arbour and Ridgefield Park (now with a Walsh Act form), Ridgewood (now with a Faulkner Act Council-Manager charter) and South Orange (now operates under a Special Charter ) all migrated to other non-village forms.

[ 283 ] [ 284 ] Politics Main article: Politics of New Jersey Social attitudes and issues See also: LGBT rights in New Jersey and Gun laws in New Jersey Socially, New Jersey is considered one of the more liberal states in the nation. Polls indicate that 60% of the population are self-described as pro-choice , although a majority are opposed to late trimester and intact dilation and extraction and public funding of abortion.

[ 285 ] [ 286 ] As of 2022, all aspects of reproductive choice (including abortion) are protected by law.

[ 287 ] In a 2009 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll, a plurality supported same-sex marriage 49% to 43% opposed.

[ 288 ] On October 18, 2013, the New Jersey Supreme Court rendered a provisional, unanimous (7–0) order authorizing same-sex marriage in the state, pending a legal appeal by Governor Chris Christie, [ 289 ] who then withdrew this appeal hours after the inaugural same-sex marriages took place on October 21, 2013.

[ 290 ] New Jersey also has some of the most stringent gun control laws in the U.S. These include bans on assault firearms , hollow-nose bullets and slingshots. No gun offense in New Jersey is graded less than a felony.

BB guns and black-powder guns are all treated as modern firearms. New Jersey does not recognize out-of-state gun licenses and aggressively enforces its own gun laws.

[ 291 ] In 2020, the state's voting population passed a public question [ 292 ] that amended the state constitution to legalize marijuana and erase past legal convictions for possession. The measure passed by a two-thirds vote. At the time the measure was enacted, about a dozen other U.S. states had also legalized the sale and possession of marijuana. As of 2024, local governments and municipalities are still in the process of regulating marijuana-related businesses within their jurisdictions.

Elections Main article: Elections in New Jersey See also: Political party strength in New Jersey Cory Booker (D) Senior U.S. Senator Andy Kim (D) Junior U.S. Senator New Jersey is a Democratic stronghold.

New Jersey Democrats have majority control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature (Senate, 24–16, and Assembly, 46–34), 9–3 split of the state's twelve seats in the U.S. House of Representatives , and both U.S. Senate seats. There have been recent Republican governors, however: Christine Todd Whitman won election in 1993 and 1997 and Chris Christie in 2009 and 2013.

In federal elections, the state leans heavily towards the Democratic Party , having last voted for a Republican for president in 1988. New Jersey was a crucial swing state in the elections of 1960 , 1968 , and 1992 . The last elected Republican to hold a Senate seat from New Jersey was Clifford P. Case in 1979. Newark Mayor Cory Booker was elected in October 2013 to join Robert Menendez to make New Jersey the first state with concurrently serving black and Latino U.S. senators.

[ 293 ] 2024 U.S. presidential election results by county in New Jersey Democratic Republican The state's Democratic strongholds include Camden County , Essex County (the state's most Democratic county—it includes Newark , the state's largest city), Hudson County (the second-strongest Democratic county, including Jersey City , the state's second-largest city); Mercer County (especially around Trenton and Princeton ), Middlesex County , and Union County (including Elizabeth , the state's fourth-largest city).

[ 294 ] Other suburban counties, especially Bergen County and Burlington County , had the majority of votes go to the Democratic Party .

The northwestern and southeastern counties of the state are reliably Republican: Republicans have support along the coast in Ocean County and Cape May County as well as in the mountainous northwestern part of the state, especially in Hunterdon County , Sussex County , and Warren County .

To be eligible to vote in a U.S. election, all New Jerseyans are required to start their residency in the state 30 days prior to an election and register 21 days prior to election day.

[ 295 ] Capital punishment Main article: Capital punishment in New Jersey On December 17, 2007, Governor Jon Corzine signed into law a bill that would eliminate the death penalty in New Jersey. New Jersey was the first state to pass such legislation since Iowa and West Virginia eliminated executions in 1965.

[ 296 ] Corzine also signed a bill that would downgrade the Death Row prisoners' sentences from "Death" to "Life in Prison with No Parole".

[ 299 ] New Jersey is home to the world's highest concentration of boardwalks.

Many communities along the Jersey Shore have a boardwalk with various attractions, entertainment, shopping, dining, arcades, water parks, and amusement parks. The Atlantic City boardwalk, opened in 1870, as the world's first boardwalk .

The vote in the special election means that Loch Arbour is still a village, at least for now, but the town will have three commissioners elected at the same time every four years.... The special election to change the form of government under the Walsh Act is part of a number of steps being taken in search of an answer to a very high school-tax bill, which residents were forced to take on after the state in 2008 ended a special financial deal the village worked out with Ocean Township a decade ago to keep school taxes low." ^ "Poll says majority of Americans opposed to abortion funding in health care bill :: Catholic News Agency (CNA)" .
