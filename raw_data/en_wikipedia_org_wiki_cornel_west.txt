[ 12 ] West was an independent candidate in the 2024 United States presidential election and is an outspoken voice in left-wing politics in the United States .

The grandson of a Baptist minister, West's primary philosophy focuses on the roles of race , gender , and class struggle in American society. A socialist , West draws intellectual contributions from multiple traditions, including Christianity , the black church , democratic socialism , left-wing populism , neopragmatism , and transcendentalism .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] During his career, he has held professorships and fellowships at Harvard University , Yale University , Union Theological Seminary , Princeton University , Dartmouth College , Pepperdine University , and the University of Paris in Saint-Denis .

[ 16 ] Among his most influential books are Race Matters (1993) and Democracy Matters (2004).

He has been featured in several documentaries, and made appearances in Hollywood films such as The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions , as well as providing commentary for both films. West has also made several spoken word and hip hop albums.

Early life and education [ edit ] West was born on June 2, 1953, in Tulsa , Oklahoma , [ 17 ] and grew up in Sacramento , California, where he graduated from John F. Kennedy High School . His mother, Irene Rayshell (Bias), was a teacher and principal. His father, Clifton Louis West Jr., was a general contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense .

[ 18 ] His grandfather Clifton L. West, Sr. was pastor of the Tulsa Metropolitan Baptist Church.

[ 19 ] Irene B. West Elementary School in Elk Grove , California, is named after his mother.

[ 20 ] As a teen, West marched in civil rights demonstrations and organized protests demanding Black studies courses at his high school, where he was the student body president. He later wrote that, in his youth, he admired "the sincere Black militancy of Malcolm X , the defiant rage of the Black Panther Party , and the livid Black theology of James Cone ".

[ 21 ] In 1970, after graduation from high school, he enrolled at Harvard College and took classes taught by the philosophers Robert Nozick and Stanley Cavell . In 1973, West was graduated from Harvard magna cum laude in Near Eastern languages and civilization.

[ 22 ] [ better source needed ] He credits Harvard with exposing him to a broader range of ideas and that he was influenced by his professors as well as the Black Panther Party (BPP). West says his Christianity prevented him from joining the BPP, instead choosing to work in local breakfast, prison, and church programs.

[ 23 ] After completing his undergraduate work at Harvard, West enrolled at Princeton University , where he received a master's degree and a Ph.D.

in 1980, completing a dissertation under the supervision of Raymond Geuss and Sheldon Wolin .

[ 10 ] He became the first African American to graduate from Princeton with a Ph.D. degree in philosophy.

[ 24 ] At Princeton, West was heavily influenced by the neopragmatism of Richard Rorty .

[ 25 ] Rorty remained a close friend and colleague of West's for many years following West's graduation. The title of West's dissertation was Ethics, Historicism, and the Marxist Tradition , [ 26 ] which was later revised and published under the title The Ethical Dimensions of Marxist Thought .

[ 25 ] Career [ edit ] Academic appointments [ edit ] In his late 20s, he returned to Harvard as a W. E. B. Du Bois Fellow before becoming an assistant professor at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York . In 1984, he went to Yale Divinity School in what eventually became a joint appointment in American studies . While at Yale, he participated in campus protests for a clerical labor union and divestment from apartheid South Africa. One of the protests resulted in his being arrested and jailed. As punishment, the university administration canceled his leave for the spring term in 1987, leading him to commute from Yale in New Haven , Connecticut , where he was teaching two classes, across the Atlantic Ocean to the University of Paris in Saint-Denis .

[ 13 ] [ 27 ] He then returned to Union Theological Seminary  for one year before going to Princeton to become a professor of religion and director of the program in African American Studies from 1988 to 1994.

[ 13 ] After Princeton, he accepted an appointment as professor of African American studies at Harvard University, with a joint appointment at the Harvard Divinity School .

[ 28 ] West taught one of the university's most popular courses, an introductory class on African American studies.

[ 29 ] In 1998, he was appointed the first Alphonse Fletcher University Professor .

[ 30 ] West used this new position to teach in not only African American studies, but also courses in divinity, religion, and philosophy.

[ 28 ] West was also inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa in 1998 at SUNY Plattsburgh .

Dispute with Lawrence Summers [ edit ] In 2000, economist and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers became president of Harvard. Soon after, Summers held a private meeting with West, in which he reportedly rebuked West for missing too many classes, contributing to grade inflation , neglecting serious scholarship, and spending too much time on his financially profitable projects.

[ 31 ] Summers reportedly suggested that West produce an academic book befitting his professorial position, as his recent output had consisted primarily of co-written and edited volumes. According to some reports, Summers also objected to West's production of a CD, the critically panned Sketches of My Culture , and to his political campaigning, including spending an alleged three weeks to promote Bill Bradley 's 2000 presidential campaign .

[ 32 ] West contended he had missed only one class during his time at Harvard "in order to give a keynote address at a Harvard-sponsored conference on AIDS". Summers also allegedly suggested that since West held the rank of Harvard University Professor and thus reported directly to the president, he should meet with Summers regularly to discuss the progress of his academic production.

[ 33 ] Summers refused to comment on the details of his conversation with West, except to state that he hoped that West would remain at Harvard. Soon after, West was hospitalized for prostate cancer . West noted that Summers failed to send him get-well wishes until weeks after his surgery, whereas newly installed Princeton president Shirley Tilghman had contacted him frequently before and after his treatment.

[ 33 ] In 2002, West left Harvard University to return to Princeton. West criticized Summers in public interviews, calling him "the Ariel Sharon of higher education" on the NPR program The Tavis Smiley Show .

[ 34 ] In response to these remarks, five Princeton faculty members, led by professor of molecular biology Jacques Robert Fresco , said they looked with "strong disfavor upon his characterization" of Summers and that "such an analogy carries innuendoes and implications ... that many on the Princeton faculty find highly inappropriate, indeed repugnant and intolerable".

[ 35 ] Harvard 's undergraduate student newspaper, The Harvard Crimson , suggested in October 2002 that the premise of the Law and Order: Criminal Intent episode " Anti-Thesis " was based on West's conflicts with Summers.

[ 36 ] Post [ edit ] In 2002, West returned to Princeton, where he helped found the Center for African American studies in 2006. In 2012, West left Princeton and returned to the institution where he began his teaching career, Union Theological Seminary.

[ 37 ] He continued to teach occasional courses at Princeton in an emeritus capacity as the Class of 1943 University Professor in the Center for African American Studies.

[ 38 ] [ non-primary source needed ] West returned to Harvard in November 2016, leaving Union Theological Seminary for a nontenured position as Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy. He was appointed jointly at the Harvard Divinity School and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Department of African and African American Studies.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] In February 2021, reports circulated that West was denied consideration for tenure at Harvard and that he had threatened to leave the university again.

[ 42 ] On March 8, 2021, West announced that he would leave Harvard and move to the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] He submitted a resignation letter to Harvard on June 30, 2021.

[ 46 ] [ non-primary source needed ] West implied that the decision to deny him tenure was retaliation for his critical stance on Israel and the Palestinian cause. West wrote: Is Harvard a place for a free Black man like myself whose Christian faith and witness put equal value on Palestinian and Jewish babies – like all babies – and reject all occupations as immoral?

On July 1, 2021, West rejoined the faculty of Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan, holding the prestigious Dietrich Bonhoeffer Chair. Affiliated with Columbia University since 1928, Union Theological Seminary in the city of New York has served as the Columbia University constituent faculty of theology.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Activism [ edit ] Views on race in the United States [ edit ] West discussing race and human nature in 2019 West has called the U.S. a "racist patriarchal" nation where white supremacy continues to define everyday life. "White America", he writes, "has been historically weak-willed in ensuring racial justice and has continued to resist fully accepting the humanity of Blacks." He goes on to say this has created many "degraded and oppressed people hungry for identity, meaning, and self-worth." West attributes most of the Black community's problems to "existential angst derive[d] from the lived experience of ontological wounds and emotional scars inflicted by white supremacist beliefs and images permeating U.S. society and culture." [ 80 ] [ non-primary source needed ] In West's view, the September 11 attacks "gave white Americans a glimpse of what it means to be a Black person in the United States", feeling "unsafe, unprotected, subject to random violence, and hatred for who they are".

[ 85 ] Politics [ edit ] West (left) with Robert P.

[ 13 ] In the Matrix -themed documentary entitled, The Burly Man Chronicles , he described himself as a "radical democrat, suspicious of all forms of authority".

[ 88 ] [ non-primary source needed ] West has argued "the overthrow of Saddam Hussein 's ugly totalitarian regime was desirable," [ 89 ] [ non-primary source needed ] but that the war in Iraq was the result of "dishonest manipulation" on the part of the Bush administration.

[ 90 ] [ non-primary source needed ] He asserts that Bush administration hawks "are not simply conservative elites and right-wing ideologues," but rather are "evangelical nihilists – drunk with power and driven by grand delusions of American domination of the world." He adds, "[we now] are experiencing the sad gangsterization of America, an unbridled grasp at power, wealth, and status." Viewing capitalism as the root cause of these alleged American lusts, West warns, " Free-market fundamentalism trivializes the concern for public interest. It puts fear and insecurity in the hearts of anxiety-ridden workers. It also makes money-driven, poll-obsessed elected officials deferential to corporate goals of profit – often at the cost of the common good." [ 91 ] [ better source needed ] West has been involved with such projects as the Million Man March and Russell Simmons 's Hip-Hop Summit, and he has worked with such public figures as Al Sharpton , whose 2004 presidential campaign West advised.

[ 93 ] [ non-primary source needed ] In April 2002, West and Rabbi Michael Lerner engaged in an act of civil disobedience by sitting in the street in front of the U.S. State Department "in solidarity with suffering Palestinian and Israeli brothers and sisters". West said, "[w]e must keep in touch with the humanity of both sides".

[ 94 ] In May 2007, West joined a demonstration against "injustices faced by the Palestinian people resulting from the Israeli occupation" and "to bring attention to this 40-year travesty of justice". In 2011, West called on the University of Arizona to divest from companies profiting from the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories .

[ 97 ] [ better source needed ] West is a member of the Campaign for Peace and Democracy .

In 2011, West expressed his frustration with some critics of Occupy Wall Street , who said the movement lacked a clear and unified message. West replied by saying: [ better source needed ] It's impossible to translate the issue of the greed of Wall Street into one demand, or two demands. We're talking about a democratic awakening...you're talking about raising political consciousness so it spills over all parts of the country, so people can begin to see what's going on through a set of different lens, and then you begin to highlight what the more detailed demands would be. Because in the end we're really talking about what Martin King would call a revolution: A transfer of power from oligarchs to everyday people of all colors. And that is a step by step process.

[ 98 ] On October 16, 2011, West was in Washington, D.C., participating in the Occupy D.C.

protests on the steps of the Supreme Court over the court's decision in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case the previous year.

[ 103 ] West stated that he believed the Russian invasion of Ukraine was "a criminal invasion, provoked by the expansion of NATO , which is an instrument of U.S. global power" and described the war as a "proxy war between the American Empire and the Russian Federation".

[ 104 ] [ 105 ] West condemned Israeli war crimes in the Gaza Strip and called for a ceasefire in the Gaza war , saying that the US veto at the UN Security Council "to block a vote to end Israel’s barbaric genocidal campaign in Gaza is an act of spiritual obscenity and moral bankruptcy." [ 106 ] [ better source needed ] He called President Joe Biden a war criminal and said Israel and the US are complicit in the genocide of the Palestinians .

[ 107 ] Views on Barack Obama [ edit ] West discussing a public feud with Michael Eric Dyson over Barack Obama West has often spoken about the lack of adequate Black leadership and how it results in doubt within Black communities as to their political potential to ensure change.

[ 108 ] West publicly supported 2008 Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama , and spoke to more than 1,000 of Obama's supporters at the Apollo Theater in Harlem , on November 29, 2007.

[ 109 ] West became a surrogate for Obama, making 65 speeches in support of the campaign, [ 110 ] : 546 but worried in private that Obama was "the Johnny Mathis of American politics" and had managed to simply glide to victory.

[ 110 ] : 548 West felt betrayed by Obama's cabinet choices, including his appointments of Robert Gates (who had also served in the preceding Bush administration), James L. Jones , and Dennis Ross to defense and international relations posts and his appointments of Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers to key economic positions.

[ 110 ] : 548 He had expected Obama's economic policy would be progressive and Keynesian in nature and led by economists such as Joseph Stiglitz or Paul Krugman .

[ 110 ] : 548 West criticized Obama when he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, saying that it would be difficult for Obama to be "a war president with a peace prize". West further retracted his support for Obama in an April 2011 interview, stating that Obama is "a black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs and a black muppet of corporate plutocrats. And now he has become head of the American killing machine and is proud of it".

[ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ] In November 2012, West said in an interview that he considered Obama a " Rockefeller Republican in blackface ".

[ 114 ] In 2011, West participated in a "Poverty Tour" with Tavis Smiley , his co-host on the Public Radio International program Smiley & West .

They recounted their experience on the tour in their 2012 bestselling book The Rich and the Rest of Us . The stated aim of the tour was to highlight the plight of the impoverished population of the United States prior to the 2012 presidential election , whose candidates, West and Smiley stated, had ignored the plight of the poor.

[ 115 ] [ better source needed ] West introduces Bernie Sanders at a September 2015 campaign rally in South Carolina In 2014, West gave an interview criticizing Obama, calling him a "counterfeit" who posed as a progressive. West defined Obama's presidency as "a Wall Street presidency, a drone presidency, a national security presidency".

[ 116 ] Support for Bernie Sanders [ edit ] In 2015, West expressed his support for Democratic contender Bernie Sanders during an interview on CNN Tonight . West argued that the Sanders plans to redistribute wealth from Wall Street elites to the poorest members of society would be beneficial for the African-American community.

[ 117 ] [ better source needed ] On August 24, 2015, West tweeted, "I endorse Brother @BernieSanders because he is a long-distance runner with integrity in the struggle for justice for over 50 years." [ 118 ] In July 2016, after Sanders exited the presidential race, West endorsed Green Party nominee Jill Stein and her running mate Ajamu Baraka .

[ 119 ] West, who was critical of the U.S.

interventionist foreign policy in 2016, referred to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as a " neoliberal disaster", [ 120 ] and accused Clinton of merely posing as a progressive .

[ 121 ] Following the victory of Donald Trump , West contended in an op-ed for The Guardian that white working- and middle-class voters "rejected the economic neglect of neoliberal policies and the self-righteous arrogance of elites", yet "supported a candidate who appeared to blame their social misery on minorities, and who alienated Mexican immigrants, Muslims, Black people, Jews, gay people, women, and China in the process." [ 122 ] [ non-primary source needed ] Nina Turner and West campaigning for Sanders in 2020 In 2020, West once again put his support behind Bernie Sanders, who mounted a second presidential bid in that election cycle.

[ 130 ] West's campaign received extensive support from Republican and Trump allies to stay on the ballot in swing states in hope that he would take votes from Kamala Harris.

[ 131 ] [ 132 ] [ 133 ] West expressed ambivalence about the support from Republicans.

Republicans and their allies have worked to get West on the ballot in Wisconsin and other states in the hope that West would help boost Trump's chances of winning by pulling support from Harris. West would not have needed to win a state to serve as a spoiler candidate — a few thousand votes in battleground states could have been decisive.

His alliances also betray his proclamations of 'love,' 'service,' and 'justice.' A so-called 'revolutionary Christian,' West has praised and appeared at events with the likes of Claudia De La Cruz, the presidential candidate for the Party for Socialism and Liberation. As David Corn reported for Mother Jones, the PSL supports Kim Jong Un's pursuit of nuclear weapons and defends the Chinese government against accusations of human rights abuses. Among West's other allies are former Radio Sputnik hosts who revere Putin and compliment the Chinese Communist Party as an 'inspiration.' ^ Slodysko, Brian; Cooper, Jonathan J. (August 17, 2024).
