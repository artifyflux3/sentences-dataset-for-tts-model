Together with the electron , it forms the first generation of leptons , hence the name electron neutrino . It was first hypothesized by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930, to account for missing momentum and missing energy in beta decay , and was discovered in 1956 by a team led by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines (see Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment ).

[ 1 ] Proposal [ edit ] In the early 1900s, theories predicted that the electrons resulting from beta decay should have been emitted at a specific energy. However, in 1914, James Chadwick showed that electrons were instead emitted in a continuous spectrum.

[ 1 ] n 0 → p + + e − The early understanding of beta decay In 1930, Wolfgang Pauli theorized that an undetected particle was carrying away the observed difference between the energy , momentum , and angular momentum of the initial and final particles.

[ a ] [ 2 ] n 0 → p + + e − + ν 0 e Pauli's version of beta decay Pauli's letter [ edit ] On 4 December 1930, Pauli wrote a letter to the Physical Institute of the Federal Institute of Technology , Zürich , in which he proposed the electron "neutron" [neutrino] as a potential solution to solve the problem of the continuous beta decay spectrum. A translated excerpt of his letter reads: [ 1 ] Dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen, As the bearer of these lines [...] will explain more exactly, considering the 'false' statistics of N-14 and Li-6 nuclei, as well as the continuous β -spectrum, I have hit upon a desperate remedy to save the "exchange theorem" of statistics and the energy theorem. Namely [there is] the possibility that there could exist in the nuclei electrically neutral particles that I wish to call neutrons, [ b ] which have spin ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ and obey the exclusion principle , and additionally differ from light quanta in that they do not travel with the velocity of light: The mass of the neutron must be of the same order of magnitude as the electron mass and, in any case, not larger than 0.01 proton mass. The continuous β -spectrum would then become understandable by the assumption that in β decay a neutron is emitted together with the electron, in such a way that the sum of the energies of neutron and electron is constant.

[...] But I don't feel secure enough to publish anything about this idea, so I first turn confidently to you, dear radioactives, with a question as to the situation concerning experimental proof of such a neutron, if it has something like about 10 times the penetrating capacity of a γ ray .

I admit that my remedy may appear to have a small a priori probability because neutrons, if they exist, would probably have long ago been seen. However, only those who wager can win, and the seriousness of the situation of the continuous β -spectrum can be made clear by the saying of my honored predecessor in office, Mr. Debye , [...] " One does best not to think about that at all, like the new taxes ." [...] So, dear radioactives, put it to test and set it right. [...] With many greetings to you, also to Mr. Back , Your devoted servant, W. Pauli A translated reprint of the full letter can be found in the September 1978 issue of Physics Today .

[ 3 ] Discovery [ edit ] Main article: Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment The electron neutrino was discovered by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in 1956.

[ 1 ] Name [ edit ] Pauli originally named his proposed light particle a neutron . When James Chadwick discovered a much more massive nuclear particle in 1932 and also named it a neutron , this left the two particles with the same name.

Enrico Fermi , who developed the theory of beta decay , introduced the term neutrino in 1934 (it was jokingly coined by Edoardo Amaldi during a conversation with Fermi at the Institute of physics of via Panisperna in Rome, in order to distinguish this light neutral particle from Chadwick's neutron) to resolve the confusion. It was a pun on neutrone , the Italian equivalent of neutron : the -one ending can be an augmentative in Italian, so neutrone could be read as the "large neutral thing"; -ino replaces the augmentative suffix with a diminutive one ("small neutral thing").

[ 4 ] Upon the prediction and discovery of a second neutrino, it became important to distinguish between different types of neutrinos. Pauli's neutrino is now identified as the electron neutrino , while the second neutrino is identified as the muon neutrino .

Electron antineutrino [ edit ] The electron neutrino has a corresponding antiparticle , the electron antineutrino ( ν e ),  which differs only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign . One major open question in particle physics is whether neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are the same particle.

[ citation needed ] If so, they would be Majorana fermions , whereas if not, they would be Dirac fermions . They are produced in beta decay and other types of weak interactions .

Notes [ edit ] ^ Niels Bohr was notably opposed to this interpretation of beta decay and was ready to accept that energy, momentum, and angular momentum were not conserved quantities.

^ Pauli means what was later named "neutrino". See § Name , above.
