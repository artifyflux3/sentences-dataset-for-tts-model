[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] After her undergraduate degree, she chose to follow her passion in physics and pursued graduate studies in physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , receiving her MSc in 1993 and her PhD in 1997.

[ 5 ] [ 8 ] Following her graduate studies, Safi-Harb completed a fellowship at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center where she worked in the high energy astrophysics lab.

[ 5 ] In 2000, she left NASA to start the University of Manitoba 's graduate astrophysics program.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Research [ edit ] Safi-Harb's research focuses on high energy studies of the remnants leftover by supernovae , including neutron stars and their nebulae .

[ 1 ] [ 9 ] In 2021, Safi-Harb and her former graduate student Harsha Blumer published their results from their observations of the magnetar Swift J1818.0−1607 , first detected by the NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in 2020, using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory .
