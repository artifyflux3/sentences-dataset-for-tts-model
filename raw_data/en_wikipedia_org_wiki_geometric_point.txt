F ( n ), F ( D ) 1.  If X is a projective scheme with Serre's twisting sheaf O X ( 1 ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(1)} and if F is an O X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}} -module, then F ( n ) = F ⊗ ⊗ O X O X ( n ) .

{\displaystyle F(n)=F\otimes _{{\mathcal {O}}_{X}}{\mathcal {O}}_{X}(n).} 2.  If D is a Cartier divisor and F is an O X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}} -module ( X arbitrary), then F ( D ) = F ⊗ ⊗ O X O X ( D ) .

{\displaystyle F(D)=F\otimes _{{\mathcal {O}}_{X}}{\mathcal {O}}_{X}(D).} If D is a Weil divisor and F is reflexive, then one replaces F ( D ) by its reflexive hull (and calls the result still F ( D )).

| D | The complete linear system of a Weil divisor D on a normal complete variety X over an algebraically closed field k ; that is, | D | = P ( Γ Γ ( X , O X ( D ) ) ) {\displaystyle |D|=\mathbf {P} (\Gamma (X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X}(D)))} . There is a bijection between the set of k -rational points of | D | and the set of effective Weil divisors on X that are linearly equivalent to D .

[ 1 ] The same definition is used if D is a Cartier divisor on a complete variety over k .

[X/G] The quotient stack of, say, an algebraic space X by an action of a group scheme G .

X / / G {\displaystyle X/\!/G} The GIT quotient of a scheme X by an action of a group scheme G .

L n An ambiguous notation. It usually means an n -th tensor power of L but can also mean the self-intersection number of L . If L = O X {\displaystyle L={\mathcal {O}}_{X}} , the structure sheaf on X , then it means the direct sum of n copies of O X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}} .

O X ( − − 1 ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(-1)} The tautological line bundle . It is the dual of Serre's twisting sheaf O X ( 1 ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(1)} .

O X ( 1 ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(1)} Serre's twisting sheaf . It is the dual of the tautological line bundle O X ( − − 1 ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(-1)} . It is also called the hyperplane bundle.

O X ( D ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(D)} 1.  If D is an effective Cartier divisor on X , then it is the inverse of the ideal sheaf of D .

2.  Most of the times, O X ( D ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(D)} is the image of D under the natural group homomorphism from the group of Cartier divisors to the Picard group Pic ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Pic} (X)} of X , the group of isomorphism classes of line bundles on X .

3.  In general, O X ( D ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(D)} is the sheaf corresponding to a Weil divisor D (on a normal scheme ). It need not be locally free, only reflexive .

4.  If D is a Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } -divisor, then O X ( D ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(D)} is O X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}} of the integral part of D .

Ω Ω X p {\displaystyle \Omega _{X}^{p}} 1.

Ω Ω X 1 {\displaystyle \Omega _{X}^{1}} is the sheaf of Kähler differentials on X .

2.

Ω Ω X p {\displaystyle \Omega _{X}^{p}} is the p -th exterior power of Ω Ω X 1 {\displaystyle \Omega _{X}^{1}} .

Ω Ω X p ( log ⁡ ⁡ D ) {\displaystyle \Omega _{X}^{p}(\log D)} 1.  If p is 1, this is the sheaf of logarithmic Kähler differentials on X along D (roughly differential forms with simple poles along a divisor D .) 2.

Ω Ω X p ( log ⁡ ⁡ D ) {\displaystyle \Omega _{X}^{p}(\log D)} is the p -th exterior power of Ω Ω X 1 ( log ⁡ ⁡ D ) {\displaystyle \Omega _{X}^{1}(\log D)} .

P ( V ) The notation is ambiguous. Its traditional meaning is the projectivization of a finite-dimensional k -vector space V ; i.e., P ( V ) = Proj ⁡ ⁡ ( k [ V ] ) = Proj ⁡ ⁡ ( Sym ⁡ ⁡ ( V ∗ ∗ ) ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (V)=\operatorname {Proj} (k[V])=\operatorname {Proj} (\operatorname {Sym} (V^{*}))} (the Proj of the ring of polynomial functions k [ V ]) and its k -points correspond to lines in V . In contrast, Hartshorne and EGA write P ( V ) for the Proj of the symmetric algebra of V .

Q-factorial A normal variety is Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } -factorial if every Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } -Weil divisor is Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } -Cartier.

Spec( R ) The set of all prime ideals in a ring R with Zariski topology; it is called the prime spectrum of R .

Spec X ( F ) The relative Spec of the O X -algebra F . It is also denoted by Spec ( F ) or simply Spec( F ).

Spec an ( R ) The set of all valuations for a ring R with a certain weak topology; it is called the Berkovich spectrum of R .

A [ edit ] abelian 1.  An abelian variety is a complete group variety. For example, consider the complex variety C n / Z 2 n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}/\mathbb {Z} ^{2n}} or an elliptic curve E {\displaystyle E} over a finite field F q {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{q}} .

2.  An abelian scheme is a (flat) family of abelian varieties.

adjunction formula 1.  If D is an effective Cartier divisor on an algebraic variety X , both admitting dualizing sheaves ω ω D , ω ω X {\displaystyle \omega _{D},\omega _{X}} , then the adjunction formula says: ω ω D = ( ω ω X ⊗ ⊗ O X ( D ) ) | D {\displaystyle \omega _{D}=(\omega _{X}\otimes {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(D))|_{D}} .

2.  If, in addition, X and D are smooth, then the formula is equivalent to saying: K D = ( K X + D ) | D {\displaystyle K_{D}=(K_{X}+D)|_{D}} where K D , K X {\displaystyle K_{D},K_{X}} are canonical divisors on D and X .

affine 1.

Affine space is roughly a vector space where one has forgotten which point is the origin 2.  An affine variety is a variety in affine space 3.  An affine scheme is a scheme that is the prime spectrum of some commutative ring.

4.  A morphism is called affine if the preimage of any open affine subset is again affine. In more fancy terms, affine morphisms are defined by the global Spec construction for sheaves of O X -Algebras, defined by analogy with the spectrum of a ring . Important affine morphisms are vector bundles , and finite morphisms .

5.  The affine cone over a closed subvariety X of a projective space is the Spec of the homogeneous coordinate ring of X .

Algebraic geometry occupied a central place in the mathematics of the last century. The deepest results of Abel, Riemann, Weierstrass, many of the most important papers of Klein and Poincare belong to this domain. At the end of the last and the beginning of the present century the attitude towards algebraic geometry changed abruptly. ... The style of thinking that was fully developed in algebraic geometry at that time was too far removed from the set-theoretical and axiomatic spirit, which then determined the development of mathematics. ... Around the middle of the present century algebraic geometry had undergone to a large extent such a reshaping process. As a result, it can again lay claim to the position it once occupied in mathematics.

From the preface to I.R. Shafarevich, Basic Algebraic Geometry.

algebraic variety An algebraic variety over a field k is an integral separated scheme of finite type over Spec ⁡ ⁡ ( k ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} (k)} . Note, not assuming k is algebraically closed causes some pathology; for example, Spec ⁡ ⁡ C × × R Spec ⁡ ⁡ C {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} \mathbb {C} \times _{\mathbb {R} }\operatorname {Spec} \mathbb {C} } is not a variety since the coordinate ring C ⊗ ⊗ R C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} \otimes _{\mathbb {R} }\mathbb {C} } is not an integral domain .

birational morphism A birational morphism between schemes is a morphism that becomes an isomorphism after restricted to some open dense subset. One of the most common examples of a birational map is the map induced by a blowup.

blow-up A blow-up is a birational transformation that replaces a closed subscheme with an effective Cartier divisor. Precisely, given a noetherian scheme X and a closed subscheme Z ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle Z\subset X} , the blow-up of X along Z is a proper morphism π π : X ~ ~ → → X {\displaystyle \pi :{\widetilde {X}}\to X} such that (1) π π − − 1 ( Z ) ↪ ↪ X ~ ~ {\displaystyle \pi ^{-1}(Z)\hookrightarrow {\widetilde {X}}} is an effective Cartier divisor, called the exceptional divisor , and (2) π π {\displaystyle \pi } is universal with respect to (1). Concretely, it is constructed as the relative Proj of the Rees algebra of O X {\displaystyle O_{X}} with respect to the ideal sheaf determining Z .

If the base field has characteristic zero instead of normality, then one may replace i by a resolution of singularities.

3.  The canonical divisor is a representative of the canonical class K X {\displaystyle K_{X}} denoted by the same symbol (and not well-defined.) 4.  The canonical ring of a normal variety X is the section ring of the canonical sheaf .

canonical model The canonical model is the Proj of a canonical ring (assuming the ring is finitely generated.) Cartier An effective Cartier divisor D on a scheme X over S is a closed subscheme of X that is flat over S and whose ideal sheaf is invertible (locally free of rank one).

Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity The Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity of a coherent sheaf F on a projective space f : P S n → → S {\displaystyle f:\mathbf {P} _{S}^{n}\to S} over a scheme S is the smallest integer r such that R i f ∗ ∗ F ( r − − i ) = 0 {\displaystyle R^{i}f_{*}F(r-i)=0} for all i > 0.

catenary A scheme is catenary , if all chains between two irreducible closed subschemes have the same length. 
Examples include virtually everything, e.g. varieties over a field, and it is hard to construct examples that are not catenary.

Chow group The k -th Chow group A k ( X ) {\displaystyle A_{k}(X)} of a smooth variety X is the free abelian group generated by closed subvarieties of dimension k (group of k - cycles ) modulo rational equivalences .

classification 1.

Classification is a guiding principle in all of mathematics where one tries to describe all objects satisfying certain properties up to given equivalences by more accessible data such as invariants or even some constructive process. In algebraic geometry one distinguishes between discrete and continuous invariants. For continuous classifying invariants one additionally attempts to provide some geometric structure which leads to moduli spaces .

2.

Complete smooth curves over an algebraically closed field are classified up to rational equivalence by their genus g {\displaystyle g} . (a) g = 0 {\displaystyle g=0} .

rational curves, i.e. the curve is birational to the projective line P 1 {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ^{1}} . (b) g = 1 {\displaystyle g=1} .

Elliptic curves , i.e. the curve is a complete 1-dimensional group scheme after choosing any point on the curve as identity. (c) g ≥ ≥ 2 {\displaystyle g\geq 2} .

Hyperbolic curves , also called curves of general type . See algebraic curves for examples . The classification of smooth curves can be refined by the degree for projectively embedded curves, in particular when restricted to plane curves . Note that all complete smooth curves are projective in the sense that they admit embeddings into projective space, but for the degree to be well-defined a choice of such an embedding has to be explicitly specified. The arithmetic of a complete smooth curve over a number field (in particular number and structure of its rational points) is governed by the classification of the associated curve base changed to an algebraic closure. See Faltings's theorem for details on the arithmetic implications.

3.  Classification of complete smooth surfaces over an algebraically closed field up to rational equivalence. See an overview of the classification or Enriques–Kodaira classification for details.

4.  Classification of singularities resp. associated Zariski neighboorhoods over algebraically closed fields up to isomorphism. (a) In characteristic 0 Hironaka's resolution result attaches invariants to a singularity which classify them. (b) For curves and surfaces resolution is known in any characteristic which also yields a classification. See here for curves or here for curves and surfaces .

5.  Classification of Fano varieties in small dimension.

6.  The minimal model program is an approach to birational classification of complete smooth varieties in higher dimension (at least 2). While the original goal is about smooth varieties, terminal singularites naturally appear and are part of a wider classification.

7.  Classification of split reductive groups up to isomorphism over algebraically closed fields.

classifying stack An analog of a classifying space for torsors in algebraic geometry; see classifying stack .

closed Closed subschemes of a scheme X are defined to be those occurring in the following construction. Let J be a quasi-coherent sheaf of O X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}} - ideals . The support of the quotient sheaf O X / J {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}/J} is a closed subset Z of X and ( Z , ( O X / J ) | Z ) {\displaystyle (Z,({\mathcal {O}}_{X}/J)|_{Z})} is a scheme called the closed subscheme defined by the quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals J .

[ 6 ] The reason the definition of closed subschemes relies on such a construction is that, unlike open subsets, a closed subset of a scheme does not have a unique structure as a subscheme.

Cohen–Macaulay A scheme is called Cohen-Macaulay
if all local rings are Cohen-Macaulay .
For example,  regular schemes, and Spec k [ x,y ]/( xy ) are Cohen–Macaulay, but is not.

coherent sheaf A coherent sheaf on a Noetherian scheme X is a quasi-coherent sheaf that is finitely generated as O X -module.

conic An algebraic curve of degree two.

connected The scheme is connected as a topological space. Since the connected components refine the irreducible components any irreducible scheme is connected but not vice versa. An affine scheme Spec(R) is connected iff the ring R possesses no idempotents other than 0 and 1; such a ring is also called a connected ring .

Examples of connected schemes include affine space , projective space , and an example of a scheme that is not connected is Spec ( k [ x ]× k [ x ]) compactification See for example Nagata's compactification theorem .

Cox ring A generalization of a homogeneous coordinate ring. See Cox ring .

curve An algebraic variety of dimension one.

D [ edit ] deformation Let S → → S ′ {\displaystyle S\to S'} be a morphism of schemes and X an S -scheme. Then a deformation X ' of X is an S '-scheme together with a pullback square in which X is the pullback of X ' (typically X ' is assumed to be flat ).

degeneracy locus Given a vector-bundle map f : E → → F {\displaystyle f:E\to F} over a variety X (that is, a scheme X -morphism between the total spaces of the bundles), the degeneracy locus is the (scheme-theoretic) locus X k ( f ) = { x ∈ ∈ X | rk ⁡ ⁡ ( f ( x ) ) ≤ ≤ k } {\displaystyle X_{k}(f)=\{x\in X|\operatorname {rk} (f(x))\leq k\}} .

degeneration 1.  A scheme X is said to degenerate to a scheme X 0 {\displaystyle X_{0}} (called the limit of X ) if there is a scheme π π : Y → → A 1 {\displaystyle \pi :Y\to \mathbf {A} ^{1}} with generic fiber X and special fiber X 0 {\displaystyle X_{0}} .

2.  A flat degeneration is a degeneration such that π π {\displaystyle \pi } is flat.

dimension The dimension , by definition the maximal length of a chain of irreducible closed subschemes, is a global property. It can be seen locally if a scheme is irreducible. It depends only on the topology, not on the structure sheaf. See also Global dimension .

Examples: equidimensional schemes in dimension 0: Artinian schemes, 1: algebraic curves , 2: algebraic surfaces .

degree 1.  The degree of a line bundle L on a complete variety is an integer d such that χ χ ( L ⊗ ⊗ m ) = d n !

m n + O ( m n − − 1 ) {\displaystyle \chi (L^{\otimes m})={d \over n!}m^{n}+O(m^{n-1})} .

2.  If x is a cycle on a complete variety f : X → → Spec ⁡ ⁡ k {\displaystyle f:X\to \operatorname {Spec} k} over a field k , then its degree is f ∗ ∗ ( x ) ∈ ∈ A 0 ( Spec ⁡ ⁡ k ) = Z {\displaystyle f_{*}(x)\in A_{0}(\operatorname {Spec} k)=\mathbb {Z} } .

3.  For the degree of a finite morphism, see morphism of varieties#Degree of a finite morphism .

derived algebraic geometry An approach to algebraic geometry using ( commutative ) ring spectra instead of commutative rings ; see derived algebraic geometry .

divisorial 1.  A divisorial sheaf on a normal variety is a reflexive sheaf of the form O X ( D ) for some Weil divisor D .

2.  A divisorial scheme is a scheme admitting an ample family of invertible sheaves. A scheme admitting an ample invertible sheaf is a basic example.

dominant A morphism f : X → Y is called dominant , if the image f ( X ) is dense . A morphism of affine schemes Spec A → Spec B is dense if and only if the kernel of the corresponding map B → A is contained in the nilradical of B .

dualizing complex See Coherent duality .

dualizing sheaf On a projective Cohen–Macaulay scheme of pure dimension n , the dualizing sheaf is a coherent sheaf ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } on X such that H n − − i ( X , F ∨ ∨ ⊗ ⊗ ω ω ) ≃ ≃ H i ( X , F ) ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle H^{n-i}(X,F^{\vee }\otimes \omega )\simeq H^{i}(X,F)^{*}} holds for any locally free sheaf F on X ; for example, if X is a smooth projective variety, then it is a canonical sheaf .

E [ edit ] Éléments de géométrie algébrique The EGA was an incomplete attempt to lay a foundation of algebraic geometry based on the notion of scheme , a generalization of an algebraic variety.

Séminaire de géométrie algébrique picks up where the EGA left off. Today it is one of the standard references in algebraic geometry.

elliptic curve An elliptic curve is a smooth projective curve of genus one.

essentially of finite type Localization of a finite type scheme.

étale A morphism f : Y → X is étale if it is flat and unramified. There are several other equivalent definitions. In the case of smooth varieties X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} over an algebraically closed field , étale morphisms are precisely those inducing an isomorphism of tangent spaces d f : T y Y → → T f ( y ) X {\displaystyle df:T_{y}Y\rightarrow T_{f(y)}X} , which coincides with the usual notion of étale map in differential geometry.

Étale morphisms form a very important class of morphisms; they are used to build the so-called étale topology and consequently the étale cohomology , which is nowadays one of the cornerstones of algebraic geometry.

Euler sequence The exact sequence of sheaves: 0 → → O P n → → O P n ( 1 ) ⊕ ⊕ ( n + 1 ) → → T P n → → 0 , {\displaystyle 0\to {\mathcal {O}}_{\mathbf {P} ^{n}}\to {\mathcal {O}}_{\mathbf {P} ^{n}}(1)^{\oplus (n+1)}\to T\mathbf {P} ^{n}\to 0,} where P n is the projective space over a field and the last nonzero term is the tangent sheaf , is called the Euler sequence .

[ 7 ] Fano A Fano variety is a smooth projective variety X whose anticanonical sheaf ω ω X − − 1 {\displaystyle \omega _{X}^{-1}} is ample.

fiber Given f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} between schemes, the fiber of f over y is, as a set, the pre-image f − − 1 ( y ) = { x ∈ ∈ X | f ( x ) = y } {\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)=\{x\in X|f(x)=y\}} ; it has the natural structure of a scheme over the residue field of y as the fiber product X × × Y { y } {\displaystyle X\times _{Y}\{y\}} , where { y } {\displaystyle \{y\}} has the natural structure of a scheme over Y as Spec of the residue field of y .

fiber product 1.  Another term for the " pullback " in the category theory.

2.  A stack F × × G H {\displaystyle F\times _{G}H} given for f : F → → G , g : H → → G {\displaystyle f:F\to G,g:H\to G} : an object over B is a triple ( x , y , ψ), x in F ( B ), y in H ( B ), ψ an isomorphism f ( x ) → → ∼ ∼ g ( y ) {\displaystyle f(x){\overset {\sim }{\to }}g(y)} in G ( B ); an arrow from ( x , y , ψ) to ( x' , y ' , ψ') is a pair of morphisms α α : x → → x ′ , β β : y → → y ′ {\displaystyle \alpha :x\to x',\beta :y\to y'} such that ψ ψ ′ ∘ ∘ f ( α α ) = g ( β β ) ∘ ∘ ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi '\circ f(\alpha )=g(\beta )\circ \psi } . The resulting square with obvious projections does not commute; rather, it commutes up to natural isomorphism; i.e., it 2-commutes .

final One of Grothendieck's fundamental ideas is to emphasize relative notions, i.e. conditions on morphisms rather than conditions on schemes themselves. The category of schemes has a final object , the spectrum of the ring Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } of integers; so that any scheme S {\displaystyle S} is over Spec ( Z ) {\displaystyle {\textrm {Spec}}(\mathbb {Z} )} , and in a unique way.

finite The morphism f : Y → X is finite if X {\displaystyle X} may be covered by affine open sets Spec B {\displaystyle {\text{Spec }}B} such that each f − − 1 ( Spec B ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}({\text{Spec }}B)} is affine — say of the form Spec A {\displaystyle {\text{Spec }}A} — and furthermore A {\displaystyle A} is finitely generated as a B {\displaystyle B} -module.  See finite morphism .

Finite morphisms are quasi-finite, but not all morphisms having finite fibers are quasi-finite, and morphisms of finite type are usually not quasi-finite.

finite type (locally) The morphism f : Y → X is locally of finite type if X {\displaystyle X} may be covered by affine open sets Spec B {\displaystyle {\text{Spec }}B} such that each inverse image f − − 1 ( Spec B ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}({\text{Spec }}B)} is covered by affine open sets Spec A {\displaystyle {\text{Spec }}A} where each A {\displaystyle A} is finitely generated as a B {\displaystyle B} -algebra.

The morphism f : Y → X is of finite type if X {\displaystyle X} may be covered by affine open sets Spec B {\displaystyle {\text{Spec }}B} such that each inverse image f − − 1 ( Spec B ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}({\text{Spec }}B)} is covered by finitely many affine open sets Spec A {\displaystyle {\text{Spec }}A} where each A {\displaystyle A} is finitely generated as a B {\displaystyle B} -algebra.

finite fibers The morphism f : Y → X has finite fibers if the fiber over each point x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} is a finite set. A morphism is quasi-finite if it is of finite type and has finite fibers.

finite presentation If y is a point of Y , then the morphism f is of finite presentation at y (or finitely presented at y ) if there is an open affine neighborhood U of f(y) and an open affine neighbourhood V of y such that f ( V ) ⊆ U and O Y ( V ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{Y}(V)} is a finitely presented algebra over O X ( U ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(U)} . The morphism f is locally of finite presentation if it is finitely presented at all points of Y . If X is locally Noetherian, then f is locally of finite presentation if, and only if, it is locally of finite type.

[ 8 ] The morphism f : Y → X is of finite presentation (or Y is finitely presented over X ) if it is locally of finite presentation, quasi-compact, and quasi-separated. If X is locally Noetherian, then f is of finite presentation if, and only if, it is of finite type.

[ 9 ] flag variety The flag variety parametrizes a flag of vector spaces.

flat A morphism f {\displaystyle f} is flat if it gives rise to a flat map on stalks. When viewing a morphism f : Y → X as a family of schemes parametrized by the points of X {\displaystyle X} , the geometric meaning of flatness could roughly be described by saying that the fibers f − − 1 ( x ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}(x)} do not vary too wildly.

formal See formal scheme .

G [ edit ] g r d Given a curve C , a divisor D on it and a vector subspace V ⊂ ⊂ H 0 ( C , O ( D ) ) {\displaystyle V\subset H^{0}(C,{\mathcal {O}}(D))} , one says the linear system P ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} (V)} is a g r d if V has dimension r +1 and D has degree d . One says C has a g r d if there is such a linear system.

Gabriel–Rosenberg reconstruction theorem The Gabriel–Rosenberg reconstruction theorem states a scheme X can be recovered from the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on X .

[ 10 ] The theorem is a starting point for noncommutative algebraic geometry since, taking the theorem as an axiom, defining a noncommutative scheme amounts to defining the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on it. See also https://mathoverflow.net/q/16257 G-bundle A principal G-bundle.

generic point A dense point.

genus See #arithmetic genus , #geometric genus .

genus formula The genus formula for a nodal curve in the projective plane says the genus of the curve is given as g = ( d − − 1 ) ( d − − 2 ) / 2 − − δ δ {\displaystyle g=(d-1)(d-2)/2-\delta } where d is the degree of the curve and δ is the number of nodes (which is zero if the curve is smooth).

geometric genus The geometric genus of a smooth projective variety X of dimension n is dim ⁡ ⁡ Γ Γ ( X , Ω Ω X n ) = dim ⁡ ⁡ H n ⁡ ⁡ ( X , O X ) {\displaystyle \dim \Gamma (X,\Omega _{X}^{n})=\dim \operatorname {H} ^{n}(X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X})} (where the equality is Serre's duality theorem .) geometric point The prime spectrum of an algebraically closed field.

I [ edit ] image If f : Y → X is any morphism of schemes, the scheme-theoretic image of f is the unique closed subscheme i : Z → X which satisfies the following universal property : f factors through i , if j : Z ′ → X is any closed subscheme of X such that f factors through j , then i also factors through j .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] This notion is distinct from that of the usual set-theoretic image of f , f ( Y ). For example, the underlying space of Z always contains (but is not necessarily equal to) the Zariski closure of f ( Y ) in X , so if Y is any open (and not closed) subscheme of X and f is the inclusion map, then Z is different from f ( Y ). When Y is reduced, then Z is the Zariski closure of f ( Y ) endowed with the structure of reduced closed subscheme. But in general, unless f is quasi-compact, the construction of Z is not local on X .

immersion Immersions f : Y → X are maps that factor through isomorphisms with subschemes. Specifically, an open immersion factors through an isomorphism with an open subscheme and a closed immersion factors through an isomorphism with a closed subscheme.

[ 13 ] Equivalently, f is a closed immersion if, and only if, it induces a homeomorphism from the underlying topological space of Y to a closed subset of the underlying topological space of X , and if the morphism f ♯ ♯ : O X → → f ∗ ∗ O Y {\displaystyle f^{\sharp }:{\mathcal {O}}_{X}\to f_{*}{\mathcal {O}}_{Y}} is surjective.

[ 14 ] A composition of immersions is again an immersion.

[ 15 ] Some authors, such as Hartshorne in his book Algebraic Geometry and Q. Liu in his book Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves , define immersions as the composite of an open immersion followed by a closed immersion. These immersions are immersions in the sense above, but the converse is false. Furthermore, under this definition, the composite of two immersions is not necessarily an immersion. However, the two definitions are equivalent when f is quasi-compact.

[ 16 ] Note that an open immersion is completely described by its image in the sense of topological spaces, while a closed immersion is not: Spec ⁡ ⁡ A / I {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} A/I} and Spec ⁡ ⁡ A / J {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} A/J} may be homeomorphic but not isomorphic. This happens, for example, if I is the radical of J but J is not a radical ideal. When specifying a closed subset of a scheme without mentioning the scheme structure, usually the so-called reduced scheme structure is meant, that is, the scheme structure corresponding to the unique radical ideal consisting of all functions vanishing on that closed subset.

ind-scheme An ind-scheme is an inductive limit of closed immersions of schemes.

invertible sheaf A locally free sheaf of a rank one. Equivalently, it is a torsor for the multiplicative group G m {\displaystyle \mathbb {G} _{m}} (i.e., line bundle).

integral A scheme that is both reduced and irreducible is called integral . For locally Noetherian schemes, to be integral is equivalent to being a connected scheme that is covered by the spectra of integral domains . (Strictly speaking, this is not a local property, because the disjoint union of two integral schemes is not integral. However, for irreducible schemes, it is a local property.)

For example, the scheme Spec k [ t ]/ f , f irreducible polynomial is integral, while Spec A × B ( A , B ≠ 0) is not.

irreducible A scheme X is said to be irreducible when (as a topological space) it is not the union of two closed subsets except if one is equal to X . Using the correspondence of prime ideals and points in an affine scheme, this means X is irreducible iff X is connected and the rings A i all have exactly one minimal prime ideal . (Rings possessing exactly one minimal prime ideal are therefore also called irreducible .) Any noetherian scheme can be written uniquely as the union of finitely many maximal irreducible non-empty closed subsets, called its irreducible components .

Affine space and projective space are irreducible, while Spec k [ x,y ]/( xy ) = is not.

local Most important properties of schemes are local in nature , i.e. a scheme X has a certain property P if and only if for any cover of X by open subschemes X i , i.e.

X = ∪ ∪ {\displaystyle \cup } X i , every X i has the property P . It is usually the case that it is enough to check one cover, not all possible ones. One also says that a certain property is Zariski-local , if one needs to distinguish between the Zariski topology and other possible topologies, like the étale topology .

Consider a scheme X and a cover by affine open subschemes Spec A i . Using the dictionary between (commutative) rings and affine schemes local properties are thus properties of the rings A i . A property P is local in the above sense, iff the corresponding property of rings is stable under localization .

For example, we can speak of locally Noetherian schemes, namely those which are covered by the spectra of Noetherian rings . The fact that localizations of a Noetherian ring are still noetherian then means that the property of a scheme of being locally Noetherian is local in the above sense (whence the name). Another example: if a ring is reduced (i.e., has no non-zero nilpotent elements), then so are its localizations.

An example for a non-local property is separatedness (see below for the definition). Any affine scheme is separated, therefore any scheme is locally separated. However, the affine pieces may glue together pathologically to yield a non-separated scheme.

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of local properties of rings, which are applied to schemes. Let X = ∪ ∪ {\displaystyle \cup } Spec A i be a covering of a scheme by open affine subschemes. For definiteness, let k denote a field in the following. Most of the examples also work with the integers Z as a base, though, or even more general bases.

locally of finite type The morphism f : Y → X is locally of finite type if X {\displaystyle X} may be covered by affine open sets Spec B {\displaystyle {\text{Spec }}B} such that each inverse image f − − 1 ( Spec B ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}({\text{Spec }}B)} is covered by affine open sets Spec A {\displaystyle {\text{Spec }}A} where each A {\displaystyle A} is finitely generated as a B {\displaystyle B} -algebra.

locally Noetherian A scheme X covered by Spec A i , where the A i are Noetherian rings. If in addition a finite number of such affine spectra covers X , the scheme is called noetherian . While it is true that the spectrum of a noetherian ring is a noetherian topological space , the converse is false. 
For example, most schemes in finite-dimensional algebraic geometry are locally Noetherian, but G L ∞ ∞ = ∪ ∪ G L n {\displaystyle GL_{\infty }=\cup GL_{n}} is not.

M [ edit ] moduli See for example moduli space .

While much of the early work on moduli, especially since [Mum65], put the emphasis on the construction of fine or coarse moduli spaces, recently the emphasis shifted towards the study of the families of varieties, that is towards moduli functors and moduli stacks. The main task is to understand what kind of objects form "nice" families. Once a good concept of "nice families" is established, the existence of a coarse moduli space should be nearly automatic. The coarse moduli space is not the fundamental object any longer, rather it is only a convenient way to keep track of certain information that is only latent in the moduli functor or moduli stack.

N [ edit ] nef See nef line bundle .

nonsingular An archaic term for "smooth" as in a smooth variety .

normal 1.  An integral scheme is called normal , if the local rings are integrally closed domains . 
For example, all regular schemes are normal, while singular curves are not.

2.  A smooth curve C ⊂ ⊂ P r {\displaystyle C\subset \mathbf {P} ^{r}} is said to be k -normal if the hypersurfaces of degree k cut out the complete linear series | O C ( k ) | {\displaystyle |{\mathcal {O}}_{C}(k)|} . It is projectively normal if it is k -normal for all k > 0. One thus says that "a curve is projectively normal if the linear system that embeds it is complete." The term "linearly normal" is synonymous with 1-normal.

3.  A closed subvariety X ⊂ ⊂ P r {\displaystyle X\subset \mathbf {P} ^{r}} is said to be projectively normal if the affine cover over X is a normal scheme ; i.e., the homogeneous coordinate ring of X is an integrally closed domain. This meaning is consistent with that of 2.

normal 1.  If X is a closed subscheme of a scheme Y with ideal sheaf I , then the normal sheaf to X is ( I / I 2 ) ∗ ∗ = H o m O Y ( I / I 2 , O Y ) {\displaystyle (I/I^{2})^{*}={\mathcal {H}}om_{{\mathcal {O}}_{Y}}(I/I^{2},{\mathcal {O}}_{Y})} . If the embedded of X into Y is regular , it is locally free and is called the normal bundle .

O [ edit ] open 1.  A morphism f : Y → X of schemes is called open ( closed ), if the underlying map of topological spaces is open (closed, respectively), i.e. if open subschemes of Y are mapped to open subschemes of X (and similarly for closed). For example, finitely presented flat morphisms are open and proper maps are closed.

point A scheme S {\displaystyle S} is a locally ringed space , so a fortiori a topological space , but the meanings of point of S {\displaystyle S} are threefold: a point P {\displaystyle P} of the underlying topological space; a T {\displaystyle T} -valued point of S {\displaystyle S} is a morphism from T {\displaystyle T} to S {\displaystyle S} , for any scheme T {\displaystyle T} ; a geometric point , where S {\displaystyle S} is defined over (is equipped with a morphism to) Spec ( K ) {\displaystyle {\textrm {Spec}}(K)} , where K {\displaystyle K} is a field , is a morphism from Spec ( K ¯ ¯ ) {\displaystyle {\textrm {Spec}}({\overline {K}})} to S {\displaystyle S} where K ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {K}}} is an algebraic closure of K {\displaystyle K} .

Geometric points are what in the most classical cases, for example algebraic varieties that are complex manifolds , would be the ordinary-sense points. The points P {\displaystyle P} of the underlying space include analogues of the generic points (in the sense of Zariski , not that of André Weil ), which specialise to ordinary-sense points. The T {\displaystyle T} -valued points are thought of, via Yoneda's lemma , as a way of identifying S {\displaystyle S} with the representable functor h S {\displaystyle h_{S}} it sets up. Historically there was a process by which projective geometry added more points ( e.g.

complex points, line at infinity ) to simplify the geometry by refining the basic objects. The T {\displaystyle T} -valued points were a massive further step.

As part of the predominating Grothendieck approach , there are three corresponding notions of fiber of a morphism: the first being the simple inverse image of a point. The other two are formed by creating fiber products of two morphisms. For example, a geometric fiber of a morphism S ′ ′ → → S {\displaystyle S^{\prime }\to S} is thought of as S ′ ′ × × S Spec ( K ¯ ¯ ) {\displaystyle S^{\prime }\times _{S}{\textrm {Spec}}({\overline {K}})} .
This makes the extension from affine schemes , where it is just the tensor product of R-algebras , to all schemes of the fiber product operation a significant (if technically anodyne) result.

projection formula The projection formula says that, for a morphism f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} of schemes, an O X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}} -module F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} and a locally free O Y {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{Y}} -module E {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}} of finite rank, there is a natural isomorphism f ∗ ∗ ( F ⊗ ⊗ f ∗ ∗ E ) = ( f ∗ ∗ F ) ⊗ ⊗ E {\displaystyle f_{*}(F\otimes f^{*}E)=(f_{*}F)\otimes E} (in short, f ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle f_{*}} is linear with respect to the action of locally free sheaves.) projective 1.  A projective variety is a closed subvariety of a projective space.

2.  A projective scheme over a scheme S is an S -scheme that factors through some projective space P S N → → S {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} _{S}^{N}\to S} as a closed subscheme.

3.  Projective morphisms are defined similarly to affine morphisms: f : Y → X is called projective if it factors as a closed immersion followed by the projection of a projective space P X n := P n × × S p e c Z X {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} _{X}^{n}:=\mathbb {P} ^{n}\times _{\mathrm {Spec} \mathbb {Z} }X} to X {\displaystyle X} .

[ 18 ] Note that this definition is more restrictive than that of EGA , II.5.5.2. The latter defines f {\displaystyle f} to be projective if it is given by the global Proj of a quasi-coherent graded O X -algebra S {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}} such that S 1 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}_{1}} is finitely generated and generates the algebra S {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}} . Both definitions coincide when X {\displaystyle X} is affine or more generally if it is quasi-compact, separated and admits an ample sheaf, [ 19 ] e.g. if X {\displaystyle X} is an open subscheme of a projective space P A n {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} _{A}^{n}} over a ring A {\displaystyle A} .

projective bundle If E is a locally free sheaf on a scheme X , the projective bundle P ( E ) of E is the global Proj of the symmetric algebra of the dual of E : P ( E ) = P r o j ( Sym O X ⁡ ⁡ ( E ∨ ∨ ) ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (E)=\mathbf {Proj} (\operatorname {Sym} _{{\mathcal {O}}_{X}}(E^{\vee })).} Note this definition is standard nowadays (e.g., Fulton's Intersection theory ) but differs from EGA and Hartshorne (they don't take a dual).

projectively normal See #normal .

proper A morphism is proper if it is separated, universally closed (i.e. such that fiber products with it are closed maps), and of finite type. Projective morphisms are proper; but the converse is not in general true. See also complete variety . A deep property of proper morphisms is the existence of a Stein factorization , namely the existence of an intermediate scheme such that a morphism can be expressed as one with connected fibres, followed by a finite morphism.

property P Let P be a property of a scheme that is stable under base change (finite-type, proper, smooth, étale, etc.). Then a representable morphism f : F → → G {\displaystyle f:F\to G} is said to have property P if, for any B → → G {\displaystyle B\to G} with B a scheme, the base change F × × G B → → B {\displaystyle F\times _{G}B\to B} has property P .

quasi-compact A morphism f : Y → X is called quasi-compact , if for some (equivalently: every) open affine cover of X by some U i = Spec B i , the preimages f −1 ( U i ) are quasi-compact .

quasi-finite The morphism f : Y → X has finite fibers if the fiber over each point x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} is a finite set. A morphism is quasi-finite if it is of finite type and has finite fibers.

quasi-projective A quasi-projective variety is a locally closed subvariety of a projective space.

quasi-separated A morphism f : Y → X is called quasi-separated or ( Y is quasi-separated over X ) if the diagonal morphism Y → Y × X Y is quasi-compact. A scheme Y is called quasi-separated if Y is quasi-separated over Spec( Z ).

[ 20 ] quasi-split A reductive group G {\displaystyle G} defined over a field k {\displaystyle k} is quasi-split if and only if it admits a Borel subgroup B ⊆ ⊆ G {\displaystyle B\subseteq G} defined over k {\displaystyle k} . Any quasi-split reductive group is a split-reductive reductive group, but there are quasi-split reductive groups that are not split-reductive.

rational normal curve A rational normal curve is the image of P 1 → → P d , ( s : t ) ↦ ↦ ( s d : s d − − 1 t : ⋯ ⋯ : t d ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ^{1}\to \mathbf {P} ^{d},\,(s:t)\mapsto (s^{d}:s^{d-1}t:\cdots :t^{d})} .
If d = 3, it is also called the twisted cubic .

rational singularities A variety X over a field of characteristic zero has rational singularities if there is a resolution of singularities f : X ′ → → X {\displaystyle f:X'\to X} such that f ∗ ∗ ( O X ′ ) = O X {\displaystyle f_{*}({\mathcal {O}}_{X'})={\mathcal {O}}_{X}} and R i f ∗ ∗ ( O X ′ ) = 0 , i ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle R^{i}f_{*}({\mathcal {O}}_{X'})=0,\,i\geq 1} .

reduced 1.  A commutative ring R {\displaystyle R} is reduced if it has no nonzero nilpotent elements, i.e., its nilradical is the zero ideal, ( 0 ) = ( 0 ) {\displaystyle {\sqrt {(0)}}=(0)} . Equivalently, R {\displaystyle R} is reduced if Spec ⁡ ⁡ ( R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} (R)} is a reduced scheme.

2.  A scheme X is reduced if its stalks O X , x {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X,x}} are reduced rings. Equivalently X is reduced if, for each open subset U ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle U\subset X} , O X ( U ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X}(U)} is a reduced ring, i.e., X {\displaystyle X} has no nonzero nilpotent sections.

reductive A connected linear algebraic group G {\displaystyle G} over a field k {\displaystyle k} is a reductive group if and only if the unipotent radical R u ( G k ¯ ¯ ) {\displaystyle R_{u}(G_{\overline {k}})} of the base change G k ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle G_{\overline {k}}} of G {\displaystyle G} to an algebraic closure k ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {k}}} is trivial.

regular embedding A closed immersion i : X ↪ ↪ Y {\displaystyle i:X\hookrightarrow Y} is a regular embedding if each point of X has an affine neighborhood in Y so that the ideal of X there is generated by a regular sequence . If i is a regular embedding, then the conormal sheaf of i , that is, I / I 2 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}/{\mathcal {I}}^{2}} when I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} is the ideal sheaf of X , is locally free.

regular function A morphism from an algebraic variety to the affine line .

representable morphism A morphism F → → G {\displaystyle F\to G} of stacks such that, for any morphism B → → G {\displaystyle B\to G} from a scheme B , the base change F × × G B {\displaystyle F\times _{G}B} is an algebraic space. If "algebraic space" is replaced by "scheme", then it is said to be strongly representable.

resolution of singularities A resolution of singularities of a scheme X is a proper birational morphism π π : Z → → X {\displaystyle \pi :Z\to X} such that Z is smooth .

Riemann–Hurwitz formula Given a finite separable morphism π π : X → → Y {\displaystyle \pi :X\to Y} between smooth projective curves, if π π {\displaystyle \pi } is tamely ramified (no wild ramification), for example, over a field of characteristic zero, then the Riemann–Hurwitz formula relates the degree of π, the genera of X , Y and the ramification indices : 2 g ( X ) − − 2 = deg ⁡ ⁡ ( π π ) ( 2 g ( Y ) − − 2 ) + ∑ ∑ y ∈ ∈ Y ( e y − − 1 ) {\displaystyle 2g(X)-2=\operatorname {deg} (\pi )(2g(Y)-2)+\sum _{y\in Y}(e_{y}-1)} .
Nowadays, the formula is viewed as a consequence of the more general formula (which is valid even if π is not tame): K X ∼ ∼ π π ∗ ∗ K Y + R {\displaystyle K_{X}\sim \pi ^{*}K_{Y}+R} where ∼ ∼ {\displaystyle \sim } means a linear equivalence and R = ∑ ∑ P ∈ ∈ X length O P ⁡ ⁡ ( Ω Ω X / Y ) P {\displaystyle R=\sum _{P\in X}\operatorname {length} _{{\mathcal {O}}_{P}}(\Omega _{X/Y})P} is the divisor of the relative cotangent sheaf Ω Ω X / Y {\displaystyle \Omega _{X/Y}} (called the different ).

Riemann–Roch formula 1.  If L is a line bundle of degree d on a smooth projective curve of genus g , then the Riemann–Roch formula computes the Euler characteristic of L : χ χ ( L ) = d − − g + 1 {\displaystyle \chi (L)=d-g+1} .
For example, the formula implies the degree of the canonical divisor K is 2 g - 2.

2.  The general version is due to Grothendieck and called the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch formula . It says: if π π : X → → S {\displaystyle \pi :X\to S} is a proper morphism with smooth X , S and if E is a vector bundle on X , then as equality in the rational Chow group ch ⁡ ⁡ ( π π !

E ) ⋅ ⋅ td ⁡ ⁡ ( S ) = π π ∗ ∗ ( ch ⁡ ⁡ ( E ) ⋅ ⋅ td ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {ch} (\pi _{!}E)\cdot \operatorname {td} (S)=\pi _{*}(\operatorname {ch} (E)\cdot \operatorname {td} (X))} where π π !

= ∑ ∑ i ( − − 1 ) i R i π π ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \pi _{!}=\sum _{i}(-1)^{i}R^{i}\pi _{*}} , ch {\displaystyle \operatorname {ch} } means a Chern character and td {\displaystyle \operatorname {td} } a Todd class of the tangent bundle of a space, and, over the complex numbers, π π ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \pi _{*}} is an integration along fibers . For example, if the base S is a point, X is a smooth curve of genus g and E is a line bundle L , then the left-hand side reduces to the Euler characteristic while the right-hand side is π π ∗ ∗ ( e c 1 ( L ) ( 1 − − c 1 ( T ∗ ∗ X ) / 2 ) ) = deg ⁡ ⁡ ( L ) − − g + 1.

{\displaystyle \pi _{*}(e^{c_{1}(L)}(1-c_{1}(T^{*}X)/2))=\operatorname {deg} (L)-g+1.} rigid Every infinitesimal deformation is trivial. For example, the projective space is rigid since H 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( P n , T P n ) = 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {H} ^{1}(\mathbf {P} ^{n},T_{\mathbf {P} ^{n}})=0} (and using the Kodaira–Spencer map ).

rigidify A heuristic term, roughly equivalent to "killing automorphisms". For example, one might say "we introduce level structures resp.

marked points to rigidify the geometric situation." S [ edit ] On Grothendieck's own view there should be almost no history of schemes, but only a history of the resistance to them: ... There is no serious historical question of how Grothendieck found his definition of schemes. It was in the air. Serre has well said that no one invented schemes (conversation 1995). The question is, what made Grothendieck believe he should use this definition to simplify an 80 page paper by Serre into some 1000 pages of Éléments de géométrie algébrique ?

simple 1.  The term "simple point" is an old term for a "smooth point".

2.  A simple normal crossing (snc) divisor is another name for a smooth normal crossing divisor, i.e. a divisor that has only smooth normal crossing singularities. They appear in strong desingularization as well as in stabilization for compactifying moduli problems.

3.  In the context of linear algebraic groups there are semisimple groups and simple groups which are themselves semisimple groups with additional properties. Since all simple groups are reductive, a split simple group is a simple group that is split-reductive.

smooth 1.

Main article: smooth morphism The higher-dimensional analog of étale morphisms are smooth morphisms .  There are many different characterisations of smoothness. The following are equivalent definitions of smoothness of the morphism f : Y → X : for any y ∈ Y , there are open affine neighborhoods V and U of y , x = f ( y ), respectively, such that the restriction of f to V factors as an étale morphism followed by the projection of affine n -space over U .

f is flat, locally of finite presentation, and for every geometric point y ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {y}}} of Y (a morphism from the spectrum of an algebraically closed field k ( y ¯ ¯ ) {\displaystyle k({\bar {y}})} to Y ), the geometric fiber X y ¯ ¯ := X × × Y S p e c ( k ( y ¯ ¯ ) ) {\displaystyle X_{\bar {y}}:=X\times _{Y}\mathrm {Spec} (k({\bar {y}}))} is a smooth n -dimensional variety over k ( y ¯ ¯ ) {\displaystyle k({\bar {y}})} in the sense of classical algebraic geometry.

2.  A smooth scheme over a perfect field k is a scheme X that is locally of finite type and regular over k .

3.  A smooth scheme over a field k is a scheme X that is geometrically smooth: X × × k k ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle X\times _{k}{\overline {k}}} is smooth.

special A divisor D on a smooth curve C is special if h 0 ( O ( K − − D ) ) {\displaystyle h^{0}({\mathcal {O}}(K-D))} , which is called the index of speciality, is positive.

spherical variety A spherical variety is a normal G -variety ( G connected reductive) with an open dense orbit by a Borel subgroup of G .

split 1.  In the context of an algebraic group G {\displaystyle G} for certain properties P {\displaystyle P} there is the derived property split- P {\displaystyle P} . Usually P {\displaystyle P} is a property that is automatic or more common over algebraically closed fields k ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {k}}} . If this property holds already for G {\displaystyle G} defined over a not necessarily algebraically closed field k {\displaystyle k} then G {\displaystyle G} is said to satisfy split- P {\displaystyle P} .

2.  A linear algebraic group G {\displaystyle G} defined over a field k {\displaystyle k} is a torus if only if its base change G k ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle G_{\overline {k}}} to an algebraic closure k ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {k}}} is isomorphic to a product of multiplicative groups G m , k ¯ ¯ n {\displaystyle G_{m,{\overline {k}}}^{n}} .

G {\displaystyle G} is a split torus if and only if it is isomorphic to G m , k n {\displaystyle G_{m,k}^{n}} without any base change.

G {\displaystyle G} is said to split over an intermediate field k ⊆ ⊆ L ⊆ ⊆ k ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle k\subseteq L\subseteq {\overline {k}}} if and only if its base change G L {\displaystyle G_{L}} to L {\displaystyle L} is isomorphic to G m , L n {\displaystyle G_{m,L}^{n}} .

3.  A reductive group G {\displaystyle G} defined over a field k {\displaystyle k} is split-reductive if and only if a maximal torus T ⊆ ⊆ G {\displaystyle T\subseteq G} defined over k {\displaystyle k} is a split torus. Since any simple group is reductive a split simple group means a simple group that is split-reductive.

4.  A connected solvable linear algebraic group G {\displaystyle G} defined over a field k {\displaystyle k} is split if and only if it has composition series B = B 0 ⊃ ⊃ B 1 ⊃ ⊃ … … ⊃ ⊃ B t = { 1 } {\displaystyle B=B_{0}\supset B_{1}\supset \ldots \supset B_{t}=\{1\}} defined over k {\displaystyle k} such that each successive quotient B i / B i + 1 {\displaystyle B_{i}/B_{i+1}} is isomorphic to either the multiplicative group G m , k {\displaystyle G_{m,k}} or the additive group G m , a {\displaystyle G_{m,a}} over k {\displaystyle k} .

5.  A linear algebraic group G {\displaystyle G} defined over a field k {\displaystyle k} is split if and only if it has a Borel subgroup B ⊆ ⊆ G {\displaystyle B\subseteq G} defined over k {\displaystyle k} that is split in the sense of connected solvable linear algebraic groups.

6.  In the classification of real Lie algebras split Lie algebras play an important role. There is a close connection between linear Lie groups, their associated Lie algebras and linear algebraic groups over k = R {\displaystyle k=\mathbb {R} } resp.

C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } . The term split has similar meanings for Lie theory and linear algebraic groups.

strict transform Given a blow-up π π : X ~ ~ → → X {\displaystyle \pi :{\widetilde {X}}\to X} along a closed subscheme Z and a morphism f : Y → → X {\displaystyle f:Y\to X} , the strict transform of Y (also called proper transform) is the blow-up Y ~ ~ → → Y {\displaystyle {\widetilde {Y}}\to Y} of Y along the closed subscheme f − − 1 Z {\displaystyle f^{-1}Z} . If f is a closed immersion, then the induced map Y ~ ~ ↪ ↪ X ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\widetilde {Y}}\hookrightarrow {\widetilde {X}}} is also a closed immersion.

U [ edit ] universal 1.  If a moduli functor F is represented by some scheme or algebraic space M , then a universal object is an element of F ( M ) that corresponds to the identity morphism M → M (which is an M -point of M ). If the values of F are isomorphism classes of curves with extra structure, say, then a universal object is called a universal curve . A tautological bundle would be another example of a universal object.

In literature, the forgetful map π π : C g → → M g {\displaystyle \pi :{\mathcal {C}}_{g}\to {\mathcal {M}}_{g}} is often called a universal curve.

universally A morphism has some property universally if all base changes of the morphism have this property. Examples include universally catenary , universally injective .

Let m {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {m}}} be the maximal ideal of O X , f ( y ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X,f(y)}} , and let n = f # # ( m ) O Y , y {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {n}}=f^{\#}({\mathfrak {m}}){\mathcal {O}}_{Y,y}} be the ideal generated by the image of m {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {m}}} in O Y , y {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{Y,y}} . The morphism f {\displaystyle f} is unramified (resp.

G-unramified ) if it is locally of finite type (resp. locally of finite presentation) and if for all y {\displaystyle y} in Y {\displaystyle Y} , n {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {n}}} is the maximal ideal of O Y , y {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{Y,y}} and the induced map O X , f ( y ) / m → → O Y , y / n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{X,f(y)}/{\mathfrak {m}}\to {\mathcal {O}}_{Y,y}/{\mathfrak {n}}} is a finite separable field extension .
