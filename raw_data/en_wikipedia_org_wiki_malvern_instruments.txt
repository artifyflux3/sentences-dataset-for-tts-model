[ 6 ] The company is a manufacturer and supplier of laboratory analytical instruments .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] It has been influential in the development of the Malvern Correlator, [ 9 ] and it remains notable for its work in the advancement of particle sizing technology.

[ 10 ] The company produces technology for materials analysis and principal instruments designed to measure the size, shape and charge of particles.

[ 11 ] Additional areas of development include equipment for rheology measurements, [ 3 ] [ 12 ] chemical imaging [ 13 ] and chromatography .

[ 14 ] In 2017, they merged with PANalytical to form Malvern Panalytical Ltd.

[ 15 ] History [ edit ] Malvern Instruments Ltd.

was incorporated in 1971.

[ 14 ] In 1977, Malvern Instruments was recognised by the Royal Academy of Engineering , jointly with the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE), for developing the Malvern Correlator.

[ 6 ] [ 16 ] It also received the MacRobert Award for Outstanding Technical Innovation (1977), [ 6 ] the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement (1977), [ 17 ] the Queen's Award for Export Achievement (1981), [ 17 ] and the Queen's Award for Export & Technology (1988).

[ 17 ] In 1992, Burnfield acquired Malvern Instruments from Cray Electronics Holdings, [ 18 ] and, in 1996, there was the acquisition of A3 Water Solutions GmbH, a Stuttgart -based specialist in the design, marketing, and manufacturing of air and liquid particle counters.

[ 19 ] In 1997, Malvern was also acquired by the Fairey Aviation Company , and Insitec Inc from Burnfield PLC.

[ 20 ] The holding company changed its name to Spectris plc in 2001.

[ 4 ] In 2003, they acquired Bohlin Instruments Ltd, a Gloucestershire -based manufacturer of rheology and viscosity instruments.

[ 21 ] They also acquired Spectral Dimensions Inc, a manufacturer of infrared chemical imaging instruments, in 2006.

[ 11 ] Malvern received the 2006 Queen's Award for International Trade.

[ 22 ] Viscotek Corp, manufacturer of chromatographic and laboratory equipment and supplies, was acquired in 2008, [ 10 ] as well as Reologica Instruments AB, a Lund -based manufacturer of rheology and viscometry instrumentation, in 2010.

[ 3 ] Malvern received the 2010 Queen's Award for Innovation.

[ 22 ] The company was also listed as a 2010 winner of the annual Queen's Awards for Enterprise for its work measuring particles in fluids.

[ 2 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] In 2013, they acquired NanoSight , a Wiltshire -based manufacturer of nanoparticle characterization instruments, [ 5 ] and, in 2014, the Northampton -based manufacturer of Thermodynamic analysis instruments, MicroCal Instruments, was acquired from GE Lifesciences.

[ 25 ] In 2017, they merged with PANalytical to form Malvern Panalytical Ltd.

[ 15 ] That same year, Malvern Panalytical released their X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer Epsilon, which was specifically designed for small spot analysis.

[ 26 ] In 2018, Malvern Panalytical unveiled Empyrean, the first fully automated multipurpose x-ray diffractometer ; [ 27 ] Claisse LeDoser-12, an Automatic Dispensing Balance; Morphologi Range, a new morphologically-directed raman spectroscopy system, and Epsilon 4, a benchtop x-ray fluorescence spectrometer.

[ 28 ] Malvern Panalytical launched a new partnership with SCOTT Technology Ltd., a supplier of sample preparation equipment, in 2020.

[ 29 ] Their contract included engineering a fully automated robotic analytical system, incorporating fusion bead sample preparation, implementing X-ray spectrometry instrumentation, and developing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) equipment.

[ 29 ] The company also joined partnership with Concept Life Sciences that year.

[ 30 ] Netzsch acquired Malvern Panalytical’s rheometer product lines in February 2020.

[ 31 ] In this acquisition, Malvern Panalytical extended Netzsch’s product portfolio by providing Kinexus rotational rheometers and Rosand capillary rheometers.

[ 31 ] In September 2020, Malvern Panalytical received the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) type approval, as a “full-protection” X-ray instrument, for its Aeris range of benchtop XRD diffractometers.

[ 32 ] Business model [ edit ] Malvern Instruments began with a focus on particle sizing.

[ 5 ] As it grew, this focus changed toward developing a "broad portfolio of analytical solutions".

[ 5 ] In 2014, the company's CTO expressed the company's focus as "We want to solve analytical bottlenecks".

[ 5 ] In order to maintain agility and currency in product development, the company built an isolated internal division, the Bioscience Development Initiative based in Columbia, Maryland , which has an entrepreneurial character and freedom from corporate management constraints; the unit aims to rapidly develop technologies in partnership with scientists and engineers from the pharmaceutical and other industries and academia.

[ 5 ] This unit focuses on the biopharmaceutical sector, specifically formulation of drug products.

[ 5 ] PANalytical originally began in 1948 as a branch of Philips under the name of Philips Analytical, which developed XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) and XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) equipment.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] In 2002, Philips Analytical was officially renamed to PANalytical after Spectris’ acquisition of this x-ray analytical branch.

[ 34 ] Malvern later merged with PANalytical to become Malvern Panalytical Ltd. in 2017.

[ 15 ] Operations [ edit ] As part of the materials analysis sector, Malvern Panalytical derives most of its revenue through sales of a range of particle and material characterisation instruments.

[ 4 ] These systems have applications across many industries including: pharmaceuticals , life sciences , metallurgy , mining, semiconductors , polymer science , protein science and food production .
