In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") of **rotations about a fixed point in [four-dimensional Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space "Four-dimensional space")** is denoted **SO(4)**. The name comes from the fact that it is the [special orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group") of order 4.

In this article _[rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation\_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)")_ means _rotational displacement_. For the sake of uniqueness, rotation angles are assumed to be in the segment [0, π] except where mentioned or clearly implied by the context otherwise.

A "fixed plane" is a plane for which every vector in the plane is unchanged after the rotation. An "invariant plane" is a plane for which every vector in the plane, although it may be affected by the rotation, remains in the plane after the rotation.

Geometry of 4D rotations
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Geometry of 4D rotations")]

Four-dimensional rotations are of two types: simple rotations and double rotations.

A simple rotation R about a rotation centre O leaves an entire plane A through O (axis-plane) fixed. Every plane B that is [completely orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_orthogonal "Completely orthogonal") to A intersects A in a certain point P. For each such point P is the centre of the 2D rotation induced by R in B. All these 2D rotations have the same rotation angle α.

[Half-lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry) "Ray (geometry)") from O in the axis-plane A are not displaced; half-lines from O orthogonal to A are displaced through α; all other half-lines are displaced through an angle less than α.

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Torus_vectors_oblique.jpg/250px-Torus_vectors_oblique.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Torus_vectors_oblique.jpg)

A 4D [Clifford torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_torus "Clifford torus") stereographically projected into 3D looks like a [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus"), and a double rotation can be seen as a helical path on that torus. For a rotation whose two rotation angles have a rational ratio, the paths will eventually reconnect; while for an irrational ratio they will not. An isoclinic rotation will form a [Villarceau circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villarceau_circle "Villarceau circle") on the torus, while a simple rotation will form a circle parallel or perpendicular to the central axis.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDorst201914%E2%88%92166.2._Isoclinic_Rotations_in_4D-1)

For each rotation R of 4-space (fixing the origin), there is at least one pair of [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality "Orthogonality") 2-planes A and B each of which is invariant and whose direct sum _A_ ⊕ _B_ is all of 4-space. Hence R operating on either of these planes produces an ordinary rotation of that plane. For almost all R (all of the 6-dimensional set of rotations except for a 3-dimensional subset), the rotation angles α in plane A and β in plane B – both assumed to be nonzero – are different. The unequal rotation angles α and β satisfying −π <_α_, _β_< π are almost[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_note-2) uniquely determined by R. Assuming that 4-space is oriented, then the orientations of the 2-planes A and B can be chosen consistent with this orientation in two ways. If the rotation angles are unequal (_α_ ≠ _β_), R is sometimes termed a "double rotation".

In that case of a double rotation, A and B are the only pair of invariant planes, and [half-lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry) "Ray (geometry)") from the origin in A, B are displaced through α and β respectively, and half-lines from the origin not in A or B are displaced through angles strictly between α and β.

#### Isoclinic rotations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Isoclinic rotations")]

If the rotation angles of a double rotation are equal then there are infinitely many [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)") planes instead of just two, and all [half-lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry) "Ray (geometry)") from O are displaced through the same angle. Such rotations are called **isoclinic** or **equiangular rotations**, or **Clifford displacements**. Beware: not all planes through O are invariant under isoclinic rotations; only planes that are spanned by a half-line and the corresponding displaced half-lines are invariant.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKimRote20168%E2%80%9310Relations_to_Clifford_Parallelism-3)

Assuming that a fixed orientation has been chosen for 4-dimensional space, isoclinic 4D rotations may be put into two categories. To see this, consider an isoclinic rotation R, and take an orientation-consistent ordered set _OU_, _OX_, _OY_, _OZ_ of mutually perpendicular half-lines at O (denoted as OUXYZ) such that OU and OX span an invariant plane, and therefore OY and OZ also span an invariant plane. Now assume that only the rotation angle α is specified. Then there are in general four isoclinic rotations in planes OUX and OYZ with rotation angle α, depending on the rotation senses in OUX and OYZ.

We make the convention that the rotation senses from OU to OX and from OY to OZ are reckoned positive. Then we have the four rotations _R_ 1 = (+_α_, +_α_), _R_ 2 = (−_α_, −_α_), _R_ 3 = (+_α_, −_α_) and _R_ 4 = (−_α_, +_α_). _R_ 1 and _R_ 2 are each other's [inverses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function"); so are _R_ 3 and _R_ 4. As long as α lies between 0 and π, these four rotations will be distinct.

Isoclinic rotations with like signs are denoted as _left-isoclinic_; those with opposite signs as _right-isoclinic_. Left- and right-isoclinic rotations are represented respectively by left- and right-multiplication by unit quaternions; see the paragraph "Relation to quaternions" below.

The four rotations are pairwise different except if _α_ = 0 or _α_ = π. The angle _α_ = 0 corresponds to the identity rotation; _α_ = π corresponds to the [central inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_in_a_point "Inversion in a point"), given by the negative of the identity matrix. These two elements of SO(4) are the only ones that are simultaneously left- and right-isoclinic.

Left- and right-isocliny defined as above seem to depend on which specific isoclinic rotation was selected. However, when another isoclinic rotation R′ with its own axes OU′, OX′, OY′, OZ′ is selected, then one can always choose the [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_permutation "Even permutation") of U′, X′, Y′, Z′ such that OUXYZ can be transformed into OU′X′Y′Z′ by a rotation rather than by a rotation-reflection (that is, so that the ordered basis OU′, OX′, OY′, OZ′ is also consistent with the same fixed choice of orientation as OU, OX, OY, OZ). Therefore, once one has selected an orientation (that is, a system OUXYZ of axes that is universally denoted as right-handed), one can determine the left or right character of a specific isoclinic rotation.

### Group structure of SO(4)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Group structure of SO(4)")]

SO(4) is a [noncommutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative "Noncommutative")[compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") 6-[dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#Manifolds "Dimension")[Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group").

Each plane through the rotation centre O is the axis-plane of a [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative "Commutative")[subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup "Subgroup")[isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic "Isomorphic") to SO(2). All these subgroups are mutually [conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugation_of_isometries_in_Euclidean_space "Conjugation of isometries in Euclidean space") in SO(4).

Each pair of completely [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality "Orthogonality") planes through O is the pair of [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)") planes of a commutative subgroup of SO(4) isomorphic to SO(2) × SO(2).

These groups are [maximal tori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_torus "Maximal torus") of SO(4), which are all mutually conjugate in SO(4). See also [Clifford torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_torus "Clifford torus").

All left-isoclinic rotations form a noncommutative subgroup _S_ 3 L of SO(4), which is isomorphic to the [multiplicative group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group "Multiplicative group")_S_ 3 of unit [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion"). All right-isoclinic rotations likewise form a subgroup _S_ 3 R of SO(4) isomorphic to _S_ 3. Both _S_ 3 L and _S_ 3 R are maximal subgroups of SO(4).

Each left-isoclinic rotation [commutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative "Commutative") with each right-isoclinic rotation. This implies that there exists a [direct product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_product_of_groups "Direct product of groups")_S_ 3 L × _S_ 3 R with [normal subgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_subgroup "Normal subgroup")_S_ 3 L and _S_ 3 R; both of the corresponding [factor groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_group "Factor group") are isomorphic to the other factor of the direct product, i.e. isomorphic to _S_ 3. (This is not SO(4) or a subgroup of it, because _S_ 3 L and _S_ 3 R are not disjoint: the identity I and the central inversion −_I_ each belong to both _S_ 3 L and _S_ 3 R.)

Each 4D rotation A is in two ways the product of left- and right-isoclinic rotations _A_ L and _A_ R. _A_ L and _A_ R are together determined up to the central inversion, i.e. when both _A_ L and _A_ R are multiplied by the central inversion their product is A again.

This implies that _S_ 3 L × _S_ 3 R is the [universal covering group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_covering_group "Universal covering group") of SO(4) — its unique [double cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_covering_group "Double covering group") — and that _S_ 3 L and _S_ 3 R are normal subgroups of SO(4). The identity rotation I and the central inversion −_I_ form a group C 2 of order 2, which is the [centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_a_group "Center of a group") of SO(4) and of both _S_ 3 L and _S_ 3 R. The centre of a group is a normal subgroup of that group. The factor group of C 2 in SO(4) is isomorphic to SO(3)×SO(3). The factor groups of _S_ 3 L by C 2 and of _S_ 3 R by C 2 are each isomorphic to SO(3). Similarly, the factor groups of SO(4) by _S_ 3 L and of SO(4) by _S_ 3 R are each isomorphic to SO(3).

The topology of SO(4) is the same as that of the Lie group SO(3) × Spin(3) = SO(3) × SU(2), namely the space ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ^{3}\times \mathbb {S} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7cd76d82b660af056ef59dc61f8c73037a4ec439) where ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7fb80175bc622b3936c7a0438fc690b2ec410b4f) is the [real projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space "Real projective space") of dimension 3 and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9697d2cff6f93d773215ab1e21a4c047f6aab6f4) is the [3-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere "3-sphere"). However, it is noteworthy that, as a Lie group, SO(4) is not a direct product of Lie groups, and so it is not isomorphic to SO(3) × Spin(3) = SO(3) × SU(2).

### Special property of SO(4) among rotation groups in general

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Special property of SO(4) among rotation groups in general")]

The odd-dimensional rotation groups do not contain the central inversion and are [simple groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_group "Simple group").

The even-dimensional rotation groups do contain the central inversion −_I_ and have the group C 2 = {_I_, −_I_} as their [centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_a_group "Center of a group"). For even n ≥ 6, SO(n) is almost simple in that the [factor group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_group "Factor group") SO(n)/C 2 of SO(n) by its centre is a simple group.

SO(4) is different: there is no [conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugation_of_isometries_in_Euclidean_space "Conjugation of isometries in Euclidean space") by any element of SO(4) that transforms left- and right-isoclinic rotations into each other. [Reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)") transform a left-isoclinic rotation into a right-isoclinic one by conjugation, and vice versa. This implies that under the group O(4) of _all_ isometries with fixed point O the distinct subgroups _S_ 3 L and _S_ 3 R are conjugate to each other, and so cannot be normal subgroups of O(4). The 5D rotation group SO(5) and all higher rotation groups contain subgroups isomorphic to O(4). Like SO(4), all even-dimensional rotation groups contain isoclinic rotations. But unlike SO(4), in SO(6) and all higher even-dimensional rotation groups any two isoclinic rotations through the same angle are conjugate. The set of all isoclinic rotations is not even a subgroup of SO(2 _N_), let alone a normal subgroup.

Algebra of 4D rotations
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Algebra of 4D rotations")]

SO(4) is commonly identified with the group of [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(vector_space) "Orientation (vector space)")-preserving [isometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry")[linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear "Linear") mappings of a 4D [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") with [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product") over the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") onto itself.

With respect to an [orthonormal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal "Orthonormal")[basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)") in such a space SO(4) is represented as the group of real 4th-order [orthogonal matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix "Orthogonal matrix") with [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") +1.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKimRote2016%C2%A75_Four_Dimensional_Rotations-4)

### Isoclinic decomposition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Isoclinic decomposition")]

A 4D rotation given by its matrix is decomposed into a left-isoclinic and a right-isoclinic rotation[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_note-5) as follows:

Let

![Image 6: {\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}a_{00}&a_{01}&a_{02}&a_{03}\\a_{10}&a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\a_{20}&a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\a_{30}&a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\\\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c88e553116bc3cee8ee03045c789ffddd25e1078)
be its matrix with respect to an arbitrary [orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis "Orthonormal basis").

Calculate from this the so-called _associate matrix_

![Image 7: {\displaystyle M={\frac {1}{4}}{\begin{pmatrix}a_{00}+a_{11}+a_{22}+a_{33}&+a_{10}-a_{01}-a_{32}+a_{23}&+a_{20}+a_{31}-a_{02}-a_{13}&+a_{30}-a_{21}+a_{12}-a_{03}\\a_{10}-a_{01}+a_{32}-a_{23}&-a_{00}-a_{11}+a_{22}+a_{33}&+a_{30}-a_{21}-a_{12}+a_{03}&-a_{20}-a_{31}-a_{02}-a_{13}\\a_{20}-a_{31}-a_{02}+a_{13}&-a_{30}-a_{21}-a_{12}-a_{03}&-a_{00}+a_{11}-a_{22}+a_{33}&+a_{10}+a_{01}-a_{32}-a_{23}\\a_{30}+a_{21}-a_{12}-a_{03}&+a_{20}-a_{31}+a_{02}-a_{13}&-a_{10}-a_{01}-a_{32}-a_{23}&-a_{00}+a_{11}+a_{22}-a_{33}\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5e4e087bea216624642bd8ef04b065ebf24bca4d)
M has [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra) "Rank (linear algebra)") one and is of unit [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm "Euclidean norm") as a 16D vector if and only if A is indeed a 4D [rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix "Rotation matrix"). In this case there exist real numbers _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ and _p_, _q_, _r_, _s_ such that

![Image 8: {\displaystyle M={\begin{pmatrix}ap&aq&ar&as\\bp&bq&br&bs\\cp&cq&cr&cs\\dp&dq&dr&ds\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41519e555861ef747f850e6491b3dec4f3aa4b85)
and

![Image 9: {\displaystyle (ap)^{2}+\cdots +(ds)^{2}=\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}\right)\left(p^{2}+q^{2}+r^{2}+s^{2}\right)=1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac080b9cab08cfc8f0e1cb7c525538af542965e6)
There are exactly two sets of _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ and _p_, _q_, _r_, _s_ such that _a_ 2 + _b_ 2 + _c_ 2 + _d_ 2 = 1 and _p_ 2 + _q_ 2 + _r_ 2 + _s_ 2 = 1. They are each other's opposites.

The rotation matrix then equals

![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}A&={\begin{pmatrix}ap-bq-cr-ds&-aq-bp+cs-dr&-ar-bs-cp+dq&-as+br-cq-dp\\bp+aq-dr+cs&-bq+ap+ds+cr&-br+as-dp-cq&-bs-ar-dq+cp\\cp+dq+ar-bs&-cq+dp-as-br&-cr+ds+ap+bq&-cs-dr+aq-bp\\dp-cq+br+as&-dq-cp-bs+ar&-dr-cs+bp-aq&-ds+cr+bq+ap\end{pmatrix}}\\&={\begin{pmatrix}a&-b&-c&-d\\b&\;\,\,a&-d&\;\,\,c\\c&\;\,\,d&\;\,\,a&-b\\d&-c&\;\,\,b&\;\,\,a\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}p&-q&-r&-s\\q&\;\,\,p&\;\,\,s&-r\\r&-s&\;\,\,p&\;\,\,q\\s&\;\,\,r&-q&\;\,\,p\end{pmatrix}}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d8e127331a00ab81ff5fcea6d082d63e70fa1a1c)
This formula is due to Van Elfrinkhof (1897).

The first factor in this decomposition represents a left-isoclinic rotation, the second factor a right-isoclinic rotation. The factors are determined up to the negative 4th-order [identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix"), i.e. the central inversion.

### Relation to quaternions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Relation to quaternions")]

A point in 4-dimensional space with [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates")(_u_, _x_, _y_, _z_) may be represented by a [quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion")_P_ = _u_ + _xi_ + _yj_ + _zk_.

A left-isoclinic rotation is represented by left-multiplication by a unit quaternion _Q_ L = _a_ + _bi_ + _cj_ + _dk_. In matrix-vector language this is

![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}u'\\x'\\y'\\z'\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}a&-b&-c&-d\\b&\;\,\,a&-d&\;\,\,c\\c&\;\,\,d&\;\,\,a&-b\\d&-c&\;\,\,b&\;\,\,a\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}u\\x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2fd6c3b8aadd3555935b837fdc5c1081f7cec0fe)
Likewise, a right-isoclinic rotation is represented by right-multiplication by a unit quaternion _Q_ R = _p_ + _qi_ + _rj_ + _sk_, which is in matrix-vector form

![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}u'\\x'\\y'\\z'\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}p&-q&-r&-s\\q&\;\,\,p&\;\,\,s&-r\\r&-s&\;\,\,p&\;\,\,q\\s&\;\,\,r&-q&\;\,\,p\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}u\\x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dcaf135cdf08f3c455223c644a540c9aef032e59)
In the preceding section ([isoclinic decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#Isoclinic_decomposition)) it is shown how a general 4D rotation is split into left- and right-isoclinic factors.

In quaternion language Van Elfrinkhof's formula reads

![Image 13: {\displaystyle u'+x'i+y'j+z'k=(a+bi+cj+dk)(u+xi+yj+zk)(p+qi+rj+sk),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d6fb3edfc262d1932dd3cffb60c16c905a4b58e)
or, in symbolic form,

![Image 14: {\displaystyle P'=Q_{\mathrm {L} }PQ_{\mathrm {R} }.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b4b683403342c9158001d8c5f2590d6f571f48)
According to the German mathematician [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein") this formula was already known to Cayley in 1854.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_note-6)

Quaternion multiplication is [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative "Associative"). Therefore,

![Image 15: {\displaystyle P'=\left(Q_{\mathrm {L} }P\right)Q_{\mathrm {R} }=Q_{\mathrm {L} }\left(PQ_{\mathrm {R} }\right),\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff5bb3a38cae4561ed9726c4b0bb9126d5c61f9b)
which shows that left-isoclinic and right-isoclinic rotations commute.

### The eigenvalues of 4D rotation matrices

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: The eigenvalues of 4D rotation matrices")]

The four [eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue "Eigenvalue") of a 4D rotation matrix generally occur as two conjugate pairs of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers") of unit magnitude. If an eigenvalue is real, it must be ±1, since a rotation leaves the magnitude of a vector unchanged. The conjugate of that eigenvalue is also unity, yielding a pair of eigenvectors which define a fixed plane, and so the rotation is simple. In quaternion notation, a proper (i.e., non-inverting) rotation in SO(4) is a proper simple rotation [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") the real parts of the unit quaternions _Q_ L and _Q_ R are equal in magnitude and have the same sign.[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_note-7) If they are both zero, all eigenvalues of the rotation are unity, and the rotation is the null rotation. If the real parts of _Q_ L and _Q_ R are not equal then all eigenvalues are complex, and the rotation is a double rotation.

### The Euler–Rodrigues formula for 3D rotations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: The Euler–Rodrigues formula for 3D rotations")]

Our ordinary 3D space is conveniently treated as the subspace with coordinate system 0XYZ of the 4D space with coordinate system UXYZ. Its [rotation group SO(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_group_SO(3) "Rotation group SO(3)") is identified with the subgroup of SO(4) consisting of the matrices

![Image 16: {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&\,\,0&\,\,0&\,\,0\\0&a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\0&a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\0&a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\end{pmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9bff252b2c151750e08bd21307a66c54d0f12d38)
In Van Elfrinkhof's formula in the preceding subsection this restriction to three dimensions leads to _p_ = _a_, _q_ = −_b_, _r_ = −_c_, _s_ = −_d_, or in quaternion representation: _Q_ _R_ = _Q_ _L_′ = _Q_ _L_−1. The 3D rotation matrix then becomes the [Euler–Rodrigues formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Rodrigues_formula "Euler–Rodrigues formula") for 3D rotations

![Image 17: {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}-d^{2}&2(bc-ad)&2(bd+ac)\\2(bc+ad)&a^{2}-b^{2}+c^{2}-d^{2}&2(cd-ab)\\2(bd-ac)&2(cd+ab)&a^{2}-b^{2}-c^{2}+d^{2}\end{pmatrix}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/273b8db3f4a37d876215cab48448687d347204e3)
which is the representation of the 3D rotation by its [Euler–Rodrigues parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Rodrigues_parameters "Euler–Rodrigues parameters"): _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_.

The corresponding quaternion formula _P′_ = _QPQ_−1, where _Q_ = _Q_ L, or, in expanded form:

![Image 18: {\displaystyle x'i+y'j+z'k=(a+bi+cj+dk)(xi+yj+zk)(a-bi-cj-dk)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d9d916eb6ade7ffb5fd64b14e48a57f76a71309b)
is known as the [Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton")–[Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley "Arthur Cayley") formula.

Rotations in 3D space are made mathematically much more tractable by the use of [spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspherical_coordinates "Hyperspherical coordinates"). Any rotation in 3D can be characterized by a fixed axis of rotation and an invariant plane perpendicular to that axis. Without loss of generality, we can take the xy-plane as the invariant plane and the z-axis as the fixed axis. Since radial distances are not affected by rotation, we can characterize a rotation by its effect on the unit sphere (2-sphere) by [spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinates "Spherical coordinates") referred to the fixed axis and invariant plane:

![Image 19: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=\sin \theta \cos \phi \\y&=\sin \theta \sin \phi \\z&=\cos \theta \end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5094078fcd3239776450c5e1ee2cc61eb3d5f469)
Because _x_ 2 + _y_ 2 + _z_ 2 = 1, the points (_x_,_y_,_z_) lie on the unit 2-sphere. A point with angles {_θ_ 0, _φ_ 0}, rotated by an angle φ about the z-axis, becomes the point with angles {_θ_ 0, _φ_ 0 + _φ_}. While [hyperspherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspherical_coordinates "Hyperspherical coordinates") are also useful in dealing with 4D rotations, an even more useful coordinate system for 4D is provided by [Hopf coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_coordinates "Hopf coordinates"){_ξ_ 1, _η_, _ξ_ 2},[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_note-Karcher-8) which are a set of three angular coordinates specifying a position on the 3-sphere. For example:

![Image 20: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}u&=\cos \xi _{1}\sin \eta \\z&=\sin \xi _{1}\sin \eta \\x&=\cos \xi _{2}\cos \eta \\y&=\sin \xi _{2}\cos \eta \end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a7b4c43d1dae7528fb79a21151a3e8a753066eb3)
Because _u_ 2 + _x_ 2 + _y_ 2 + _z_ 2 = 1, the points lie on the 3-sphere.

In 4D space, every rotation about the origin has two invariant planes which are completely orthogonal to each other and intersect at the origin, and are rotated by two independent angles _ξ_ 1 and _ξ_ 2. Without loss of generality, we can choose, respectively, the uz- and xy-planes as these invariant planes. A rotation in 4D of a point {_ξ_ 10, _η_ 0, _ξ_ 20} through angles _ξ_ 1 and _ξ_ 2 is then simply expressed in Hopf coordinates as {_ξ_ 10 + _ξ_ 1, _η_ 0, _ξ_ 20 + _ξ_ 2}.

Visualization of 4D rotations
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Visualization of 4D rotations")]

[![Image 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/4DRotationTrajectories.jpg/500px-4DRotationTrajectories.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:4DRotationTrajectories.jpg)

Trajectories of a point on the Clifford Torus:

Fig.1: simple rotations (black) and left and right isoclinic rotations (red and blue)

 Fig.2: a general rotation with angular displacements in a ratio of 1:5

 Fig.3: a general rotation with angular displacements in a ratio of 5:1

 All images are [stereographic projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection "Stereographic projection").

Every rotation in 3D space has a fixed axis unchanged by rotation. The rotation is completely specified by specifying the axis of rotation and the angle of rotation about that axis. Without loss of generality, this axis may be chosen as the z-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system, allowing a simpler visualization of the rotation.

In 3D space, the [spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinates "Spherical coordinates"){_θ_, _φ_} may be seen as a parametric expression of the 2-sphere. For fixed θ they describe circles on the 2-sphere which are perpendicular to the z-axis and these circles may be viewed as trajectories of a point on the sphere. A point {_θ_ 0, _φ_ 0} on the sphere, under a rotation about the z-axis, will follow a trajectory {_θ_ 0, _φ_ 0 + _φ_} as the angle φ varies. The trajectory may be viewed as a rotation parametric in time, where the angle of rotation is linear in time: _φ_ = _ωt_, with ω being an "[angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity")".

Analogous to the 3D case, every rotation in 4D space has at least two invariant axis-planes which are left invariant by the rotation and are completely orthogonal (i.e. they intersect at a point). The rotation is completely specified by specifying the axis planes and the angles of rotation about them. Without loss of generality, these axis planes may be chosen to be the uz- and xy-planes of a Cartesian coordinate system, allowing a simpler visualization of the rotation.

In 4D space, the Hopf angles {_ξ_ 1, _η_, _ξ_ 2} parameterize the 3-sphere. For fixed η they describe a torus parameterized by _ξ_ 1 and _ξ_ 2, with _η_ = ⁠π/4⁠ being the special case of the [Clifford torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_torus "Clifford torus") in the xy- and uz-planes. These tori are not the usual tori found in 3D-space. While they are still 2D surfaces, they are embedded in the 3-sphere. The 3-sphere can be [stereographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection "Stereographic projection") projected onto the whole Euclidean 3D-space, and these tori are then seen as the usual tori of revolution. It can be seen that a point specified by {_ξ_ 10, _η_ 0, _ξ_ 20} undergoing a rotation with the uz- and xy-planes invariant will remain on the torus specified by _η_ 0.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_note-Pinkall-9) The trajectory of a point can be written as a function of time as {_ξ_ 10 + _ω_ 1 _t_, _η_ 0, _ξ_ 20 + _ω_ 2 _t_} and stereographically projected onto its associated torus, as in the figures below.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_note-Banchoff-10) In these figures, the initial point is taken to be {0, ⁠π/4⁠, 0}, i.e. on the Clifford torus. In Fig. 1, two simple rotation trajectories are shown in black, while a left and a right isoclinic trajectory is shown in red and blue respectively. In Fig. 2, a general rotation in which _ω_ 1 = 1 and _ω_ 2 = 5 is shown, while in Fig. 3, a general rotation in which _ω_ 1 = 5 and _ω_ 2 = 1 is shown.

Generating 4D rotation matrices
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Generating 4D rotation matrices")]

Four-dimensional rotations can be derived from [Rodrigues' rotation formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigues%27_rotation_formula "Rodrigues' rotation formula") and the Cayley formula. Let A be a 4×4 [skew-symmetric matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew-symmetric_matrix "Skew-symmetric matrix"). The skew-symmetric matrix A can be uniquely decomposed as

![Image 22: {\displaystyle A=\theta _{1}A_{1}+\theta _{2}A_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa178f784e168bcd84c240e11a444a951b438644)
into two skew-symmetric matrices _A_ 1 and _A_ 2 satisfying the properties _A_ 1 _A_ 2 = 0, _A_ 1 3 = −_A_ 1 and _A_ 2 3 = −_A_ 2, where ∓_θ_ 1 _i_ and ∓_θ_ 2 _i_ are the eigenvalues of A. Then, the 4D rotation matrices can be obtained from the skew-symmetric matrices _A_ 1 and _A_ 2 by Rodrigues' rotation formula and the Cayley formula.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_note-11)

Let A be a 4×4 nonzero skew-symmetric matrix with the set of eigenvalues

![Image 23: {\displaystyle \left\{\theta _{1}i,-\theta _{1}i,\theta _{2}i,-\theta _{2}i:{\theta _{1}}^{2}+{\theta _{2}}^{2}>0\right\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7743c0feb642574f712ff424a821ed778fe0183)
Then A can be decomposed as

![Image 24: {\displaystyle A=\theta _{1}A_{1}+\theta _{2}A_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa178f784e168bcd84c240e11a444a951b438644)
where _A_ 1 and _A_ 2 are skew-symmetric matrices satisfying the properties

![Image 25: {\displaystyle A_{1}A_{2}=A_{2}A_{1}=0,\qquad {A_{1}}^{3}=-A_{1},\quad {\text{and}}\quad {A_{2}}^{3}=-A_{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/541b5ad130430740b1981b706debe19a02c292d1)
Moreover, the skew-symmetric matrices _A_ 1 and _A_ 2 are uniquely obtained as

![Image 26: {\displaystyle A_{1}={\frac {{\theta _{2}}^{2}A+A^{3}}{\theta _{1}\left({\theta _{2}}^{2}-{\theta _{1}}^{2}\right)}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ebe3328c7455a6b0d1ca8c4b9efd11f8f0f5fe4e)
and

Then,

![Image 28: {\displaystyle R=e^{A}=I+\sin \theta _{1}A_{1}+\left(1-\cos \theta _{1}\right){A_{1}}^{2}+\sin \theta _{2}A_{2}+\left(1-\cos \theta _{2}\right){A_{2}}^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6292b1053077e571024b7db19458ebe336c6ad5b)
is a rotation matrix in **E**4, which is generated by Rodrigues' rotation formula, with the set of eigenvalues

![Image 29: {\displaystyle \left\{e^{\theta _{1}i},e^{-\theta _{1}i},e^{\theta _{2}i},e^{-\theta _{2}i}\right\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db663d05fa9d4367f2a7bd1d44d77b7dc86a545b)
Also,

![Image 30: {\displaystyle R=(I+A)(I-A)^{-1}=I+{\frac {2\theta _{1}}{1+{\theta _{1}}^{2}}}A_{1}+{\frac {2{\theta _{1}}^{2}}{1+{\theta _{1}}^{2}}}{A_{1}}^{2}+{\frac {2\theta _{2}}{1+{\theta _{2}}^{2}}}A_{2}+{\frac {2{\theta _{2}}^{2}}{1+{\theta _{2}}^{2}}}{A_{2}}^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9dae1f2a9d9f949829ff83b62db78d83b5401e0)
is a rotation matrix in **E**4, which is generated by Cayley's rotation formula, such that the set of eigenvalues of R is,

![Image 31: {\displaystyle \left\{{\frac {\left(1+\theta _{1}i\right)^{2}}{1+{\theta _{1}}^{2}}},{\frac {\left(1-\theta _{1}i\right)^{2}}{1+{\theta _{1}}^{2}}},{\frac {\left(1+\theta _{2}i\right)^{2}}{1+{\theta _{2}}^{2}}},{\frac {\left(1-\theta _{2}i\right)^{2}}{1+{\theta _{2}}^{2}}}\right\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35f5f0b0674089fb5c9dbfd9d7b1b654109f5527)
The generating rotation matrix can be classified with respect to the values _θ_ 1 and _θ_ 2 as follows:

1.   If _θ_ 1 = 0 and _θ_ 2 ≠ 0 or vice versa, then the formulae generate simple rotations;
2.   If _θ_ 1 and _θ_ 2 are nonzero and _θ_ 1 ≠ _θ_ 2, then the formulae generate double rotations;
3.   If _θ_ 1 and _θ_ 2 are nonzero and _θ_ 1 = _θ_ 2, then the formulae generate isoclinic rotations.

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#cite_ref-2)**Assuming that 4-space is oriented, then an orientation for each of the 2-planes A and B can be chosen to be consistent with this orientation of 4-space in two equally valid ways. If the angles from one such choice of orientations of A and B are {_α_, _β_}, then the angles from the other choice are {−_α_, −_β_}. (In order to measure a rotation angle in a 2-plane, it is necessary to specify an orientation on that 2-plane. A rotation angle of −π is the same as one of +π. If the orientation of 4-space is reversed, the resulting angles would be either {_α_, −_β_} or {−_α_, _β_}. Hence the absolute values of the angles are well-defined completely independently of any choices.)
