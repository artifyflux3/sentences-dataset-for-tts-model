It usually lasts for less than 20 seconds, briefer than a squall , which lasts minutes. A gust is followed by a lull (or slackening) in the wind speed.

[ 1 ] Generally, winds are least gusty over large water surfaces and most gusty over rough land and near high buildings.

[ 2 ] Definition [ edit ] The wind is measured using an anemometer or estimated with a windsock . The average value of wind speed is generally measured over a period of 2 minutes before the meteorological observation according to the World Meteorological Organization . Any significant variation at this mean wind during the ten minutes preceding the observation are noted as gusts in messages such as METAR .

[ 3 ] It is generally reported in METAR when the peak wind speed reaches at least 16 knots (30 km/h; 18 mph) and the variation in wind speed between the peaks and average wind is at least 9 to 10 knots (17 to 19 km/h; 10 to 12 mph).

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] In marine meteorology , the top speed of a burst is expressed in meters per second (m/s) or in knots, while the Beaufort scale is used for reporting the mean speed. When the maximum speed exceeds the average speed by 10 to 15 knots (19 to 28 km/h; 12 to 17 mph), the term gusts is used while strong gusts is used for departure of 15 to 25 knots (28 to 46 km/h; 17 to 29 mph), and violent gusts when it exceeds 25 knots (46 km/h; 29 mph).
