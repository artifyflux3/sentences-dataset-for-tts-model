Enrico Fermi with four of the _Via Panisperna boys_ in the courtyard of Rome University's Physics Institute in Via Panisperna, about 1934. From left to right: [Oscar D'Agostino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_D%27Agostino "Oscar D'Agostino"), [Emilio Segrè](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Segr%C3%A8 "Emilio Segrè"), [Edoardo Amaldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edoardo_Amaldi "Edoardo Amaldi"), [Franco Rasetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Rasetti "Franco Rasetti") and [Enrico Fermi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi "Enrico Fermi")

**Via Panisperna boys** ([Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"): _i ragazzi di Via Panisperna_) is the name given to a group of young [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") scientists led by [Enrico Fermi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi "Enrico Fermi"), who worked at the Royal Physics Institute of the [University of Rome La Sapienza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Rome_La_Sapienza "University of Rome La Sapienza") and made the famous discovery of [slow neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_neutron "Slow neutron") in 1934. This later enabled development of the [nuclear reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor "Nuclear reactor") and construction of the first [atomic bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bomb "Atomic bomb").

The members of the group were Enrico Fermi, [Edoardo Amaldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edoardo_Amaldi "Edoardo Amaldi"), [Oscar D'Agostino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_D%27Agostino "Oscar D'Agostino"), [Ettore Majorana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Majorana "Ettore Majorana"), [Bruno Pontecorvo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Pontecorvo "Bruno Pontecorvo"), [Franco Rasetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Rasetti "Franco Rasetti") and [Emilio Segrè](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Segr%C3%A8 "Emilio Segrè"). All were physicists, except for D'Agostino, who was a chemist. Their collective nickname comes from the address of the Royal Physics Institute, located in a street of [Rione Monti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monti_(rione_of_Rome) "Monti (rione of Rome)") in the city centre named in turn after a nearby monastery, [San Lorenzo in Panisperna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Lorenzo_in_Panisperna "San Lorenzo in Panisperna").

The group grew under the supervision of the physicist, minister, senator and director of the Institute of Physics [Orso Mario Corbino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orso_Mario_Corbino "Orso Mario Corbino"). Corbino recognized the qualities of Enrico Fermi and led the commission which appointed him in 1926 to one of the first three professorships in [Theoretical Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_Physics "Theoretical Physics") in Italy.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-se45-1) From 1929, Fermi and Corbino dedicated themselves to the transformation of the institute into a modern research centre.

Franco Rasetti and Fermi were contemporaries, who had met as undergraduates at [Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa "Pisa"), and worked together in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 24, 43  The first of the Boys to join them was Emilio Segrè, who had been studying engineering. Segrè had got to know Rasetti through mountaineering and been drawn into physics by their gatecrashing the 1927 [Como Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Como_Conference "Como Conference") together.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 66

As a schoolboy, Edoardo Amaldi had known Fermi through his [father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Amaldi_(mathematician) "Ugo Amaldi (mathematician)"), a mathematician; the families had hiked together in the [Dolomites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomites "Dolomites"). Later the director Corbino encouraged Amaldi as a young engineering student to switch to physics.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 67  Ettore Majorana had also been an engineering student; he switched to physics after his mathematical ability was recognised by Segrè, who helped him gain an interview with Fermi.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 69  Oscar D'Agostino became involved because he was a chemist; he had been the assistant to Giulio Trabacchi, with whom the group collaborated because he had a supply of radium.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 95,97  Pontecorvo joined the group later (1934); he came to Rome as a postgraduate to work with Rasetti, a family friend.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 102

The first version of their research laboratory was dedicated chiefly to atomic and molecular [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy "Spectroscopy"). Later they moved towards experimental studies of the [atomic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"). Research included the bombarding of various [elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element") with [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrons "Neutrons"), generated by irradiating [beryllium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium "Beryllium") with [alpha particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle "Alpha particle") emitted by the [radioactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive "Radioactive") gas [radon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon "Radon"), obtained from [radium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium "Radium").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-3) The neutrons induced [reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reaction "Nuclear reaction") in the target's nuclei, resulting in the generation of other elements, often radioactive [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes "Isotopes").

A key discovery, partly by chance, was that neutrons slowed down by hydrogen nuclei were far more likely to be captured by the nuclei.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 103  Five of the Boys patented this idea, which was crucial in harnessing nuclear power. Their long-delayed financial reward was modest.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 104, 286  On the theoretical side, the work of Ettore Majorana and Fermi advanced the understanding of the structure of the atomic nucleus and the forces acting within it.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-4) In 1933 and 1934 they published the fundamental theory of [beta decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay "Beta decay").

The work on neutron-induced radioactivity involved a degree of cooperation unusual at the time, and the later papers had five authors. The roles were not strictly delineated, but D'Agostino was the specialist chemist, Amaldi was responsible for the electronics, and Segrè obtained the elements to be irradiated.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 97  The working atmosphere involved a camaraderie and playfulness exemplified by the nicknames bestowed on one another. Fermi was "Il Papa" (the Pope), because of his infallibility. Rasetti, his right-hand man, was "Cardinal Vicario". Even higher in this ecclesiastical hierarchy, the nickname of Corbino was "Padreterno" (God Almighty), for his ability to miraculously generate funds and positions. Majorana was "Il Gran Inquisitore" (The Grand Inquisitor), because of his critical manner. Segrè's judgemental disposition earned him the nickname "Basilisco" after the legendary [Basilisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilisk "Basilisk"). Amaldi was "Fanciulletto" (young boy) because of his cherubic face. Pontecorvo was "Cucciolo" (puppy dog).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 68, 102  Another key component of the collaborative atmosphere was the masterful impromptu talks that Fermi delivered every afternoon on topics of interest to their research.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 67

The group disperses
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Via_Panisperna_boys&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: The group disperses")]

By 1935 the group had dispersed and only Fermi and Amaldi continued work together: Rasetti was away for a year in the U.S.; Segrè had a professorship in [Palermo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo "Palermo"), D'Agostino had a job elsewhere in Rome, Pontecorvo was in Paris.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 107,108  Majorana had become reclusive and in 1938 would disappear in unexplained circumstances.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 117

Subsequently, the [Italian racial laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_racial_laws "Italian racial laws") that targeted people of Jewish descent caused further emigration. (Segrè and Pontecorvo were Jewish, as was [Fermi's wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Fermi "Laura Fermi").) On 6 December 1938, Fermi left Rome with his family for Stockholm to receive the [Nobel Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize "Nobel Prize"). From there, they emigrated permanently to the U.S.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 122  D'Agostino and Amaldi were the only ones who remained in Italy.

After the war, Fermi's and Segrè's involvement in the [development of the atomic bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project "Manhattan Project") may have caused some strain in their relations with Rasetti, who had refused to participate.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 248  They were limited in discussing nuclear physics with their former colleagues because the new discoveries often remained classified.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Panisperna_boys#cite_note-SegHoer16-2): 280

The [film director](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director "Film director")[Gianni Amelio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Amelio "Gianni Amelio") told their story in a TV movie which was enlarged as a film, _[I ragazzi di via Panisperna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I\_ragazzi\_di\_via\_Panisperna "I ragazzi di via Panisperna")_ (1989).

The building in Via Panisperna, situated on the [Viminale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viminale "Viminale") hill, is within the complex of the Ministry of the Interior. It now houses the [Enrico Fermi Museum (CREF)](https://museum.cref.it/) devoted to the history of nuclear physics.
