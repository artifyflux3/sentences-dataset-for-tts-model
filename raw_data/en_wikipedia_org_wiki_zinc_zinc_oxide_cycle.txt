[ 3 ] Process description [ edit ] The thermochemical two-step water splitting process uses redox systems: [ 4 ] Dissociation : ZnO → Zn + 1/2 O 2 Hydrolysis : Zn + H 2 O → ZnO + H 2 For the first endothermic step concentrating solar power is used in which zinc oxide is thermally dissociated at 1,900 °C (3,450 °F) into zinc and oxygen. In the second non-solar exothermic step zinc reacts at 427 °C (801 °F) with water and produces hydrogen and zinc oxide. The temperature level is realized by using a solar power tower and a set of heliostats to collect the solar thermal energy .
