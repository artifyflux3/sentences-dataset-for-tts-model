Education University of Maryland Notable work The Great Reckoning , Sovereign Individual James Dale Davidson is an American private investor and investment writer, co-writer of the newsletter Strategic Investment , [ 1 ] and co-author with William Rees-Mogg of Blood in the Streets: Investment Profits in a World Gone Mad (1987), [ 2 ] The Great Reckoning (1991), [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and The Sovereign Individual (1997). He wrote The Plague of the Black Debt - How to Survive the Coming Depression in 1993 in which he predicted that as part of a "deep depression...Clinton is going to be a one-term president...I am as sure of this as I am that the sun will rise tomorrow" and that the US national debt would increase by a trillion dollars during Clinton's "one-term" presidency. He further wrote in the book that Boris Yeltsin , President of the Russian Federation, would lose his job and that Russia will come under the control of a nationalist, militarist regime . He has been credited with predicting the U.S.

subprime mortgage crisis , though much earlier than it actually occurred.

Davidson was the founder and former head of the National Taxpayers Union .

[ 5 ] On his website, Davidson claims to be a "famous economist", [ 6 ] despite the fact that he has not received any university degree in economics or published in any peer-reviewed journal.

In his books and his monthly newsletter, Strategic Investment , Davidson has promoted conspiracy theories claimed to link the Clinton administration to the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster .

[ 7 ] Foster's death was deemed a suicide by five official or governmental investigations.

Davidson is an original investor and board member of the conservative news site Newsmax Media . In February 2010, he posted a video on the website AftershockProfits.com claiming that "supposed improvements" in the US economy during the Clinton administration were "faked by the government" and a "hoax."
