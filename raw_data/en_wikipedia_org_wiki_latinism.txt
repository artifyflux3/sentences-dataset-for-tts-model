A Latinism (from Medieval Latin : Latinismus ) is a word, idiom , or structure in a language other than Latin that is derived from, or suggestive of, the Latin language.

[ 1 ] The Term Latinism refers to those loan words that are borrowed into another language directly from Latin (especially frequent among inkhorn terms ); English has many of these , as well. There are many Latinisms in English , and other (especially European ) languages.

Lexical Latinism [ edit ] Further information: Latinisation of names On the basic level of particular words and lexemes , creation and adoption of Latinisms has a long history, dating back to the ancient times. Early lexical Latinisms are attested in various languages that came into contact with Latin language during the expansion of ancient Roman culture . The same process continued during the Middle Ages, and acquired new forms in modern times under the influence of scientific terminology, largely based on the Scientific Latin . As a particular subgroup of lexical Latinisms, various onomastic Latinisms are formed through Latinisation of proper names , including personal names and toponyms .

Syntactical Latinism [ edit ] Further information: Latin syntax Renewed interest in Classical Latin literature during the Renaissance period resulted in the emergence of various forms of syntactical Latinisms, manifested by a tendency of renaissance and later authors to shape the syntax of their sentences according to rhetorical style used by Classical Latin authors, like Cicero and Caesar .

[ 2 ] Idiomatic Latinism [ edit ] Further information: Latin phrases Idiomatic Latinisms are phrases or idioms that are adopted from Latin language, or modeled according to Latin phraseology.
