He is a mathematician at Max Planck Institute for Mathematics (MPIM) at Bonn and is known for his research on the geometric Langlands program .

Life and career [ edit ] Born in Chișinău (now in Moldova ) he grew up in Tajikistan , before studying at Tel Aviv University under Joseph Bernstein (1990–1996).  He received his doctorate in 1997 for a thesis entitled "Automorphic Sheaves and Eisenstein Series". He has been awarded a Harvard Junior Fellowship , a Clay Research Fellowship , and the prize of the European Mathematical Society for his work.

His work in geometric Langlands culminated in a joint 2002 paper with Edward Frenkel and Kari Vilonen , [ 1 ] establishing the conjecture for finite fields, and a separate 2004 paper, [ 2 ] generalizing the proof to include the field of complex numbers as well.

Prior to his current appointment at MPIM Bonn, he was a professor of mathematics at Harvard and an associate professor at the University of Chicago from 2001–2005.

Honors and awards [ edit ] In 2025, he received the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics .
