More precisely, the Plücker map embeds G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Gr} (k,V)} into the projectivization P ( ⋀ ⋀ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ({\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V)} of the k {\displaystyle k} -th exterior power of V {\displaystyle V} . The image is algebraic, consisting of the intersection of a number of quadrics defined by the § Plücker relations (see below).

The Plücker embedding was first defined by Julius Plücker in the case k = 2 , n = 4 {\displaystyle k=2,n=4} as a way of describing the lines in three-dimensional space (which, as projective lines in real projective space, correspond to two-dimensional subspaces of a four-dimensional vector space). The image of that embedding is the Klein quadric in RP 5 .

Hermann Grassmann generalized Plücker's embedding to arbitrary k and n . The homogeneous coordinates of the image of the Grassmannian G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Gr} (k,V)} under the Plücker embedding, relative to the basis in the exterior space ⋀ ⋀ k V {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V} corresponding to the natural basis in V = K n {\displaystyle V=K^{n}} (where K {\displaystyle K} is the base field ) are called Plücker coordinates .

Definition [ edit ] Denoting by V = K n {\displaystyle V=K^{n}} the n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional vector space over the field K {\displaystyle K} , and by G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Gr} (k,V)} the Grassmannian of k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspaces of V {\displaystyle V} , the Plücker embedding is the map ι defined by ι ι : G r ( k , V ) ⟶ ⟶ P ( ⋀ ⋀ k V ) , W := Span ⁡ ⁡ ( w 1 , … … , w k ) ⟼ ⟼ [ w 1 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ w k ] , {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{cccc}\iota :\ &\mathrm {Gr} (k,V)&\longrightarrow &\mathbb {P} ({\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V),\\&{W}:=\operatorname {Span} (w_{1},\ldots ,w_{k})&\longmapsto &[w_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge w_{k}],\end{array}}} where ( w 1 , … … , w k ) {\displaystyle (w_{1},\dots ,w_{k})} is a basis for the element W ∈ ∈ G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle {W}\in \mathrm {Gr} (k,V)} and [ w 1 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ w k ] {\displaystyle [w_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge w_{k}]} is the projective equivalence class of the element w 1 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ w k ∈ ∈ ⋀ ⋀ k V {\displaystyle w_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge w_{k}\in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V} of the k {\displaystyle k} th exterior power of V {\displaystyle V} .

This is an embedding of the Grassmannian into the projectivization P ( ⋀ ⋀ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ({\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V)} . The image can be completely characterized as the intersection of a number of quadrics, the Plücker quadrics (see below), which are expressed by homogeneous quadratic relations on the  Plücker coordinates (see below) that derive from linear algebra .

The bracket ring appears as the ring of polynomial functions on ⋀ ⋀ k V {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V} .

[ 1 ] Plücker relations [ edit ] The image under the Plücker embedding satisfies a simple set of homogeneous quadratic relations, usually called the Plücker relations , or Grassmann–Plücker relations , defining the intersection of a number of quadrics in P ( ⋀ ⋀ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ({\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V)} .  This shows that the Grassmannian embeds as an algebraic subvariety of P ( ⋀ ⋀ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ({\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V)} and gives another method of constructing the Grassmannian. To state the Grassmann–Plücker relations, let W ∈ ∈ G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle {W}\in \mathrm {Gr} (k,V)} be the k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspace spanned by the basis represented by column vectors w 1 , … … , w k {\displaystyle w_{1},\dots ,w_{k}} . 
Let [ W ] {\displaystyle [W]} be the n × × k {\displaystyle n\times k} matrix whose columns are w 1 , … … , w k {\displaystyle w_{1},\dots ,w_{k}} ; the matrix of W {\displaystyle W} with respect to a different basis is then [ W ] A {\displaystyle [W]A} for any invertible k × × k {\displaystyle k\times k} matrix A {\displaystyle A} . For any ordered sequence 1 ≤ ≤ i 1 < ⋯ ⋯ < i k ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle 1\leq i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}\leq n} of k {\displaystyle k} integers, let Δ Δ i 1 , … … , i k {\displaystyle \Delta _{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} be the determinant of the k × × k {\displaystyle k\times k} submatrix of [ W ] {\displaystyle [W]} on the rows ( i 1 , … … i k ) {\displaystyle (i_{1},\dots i_{k})} ; this determinant is called a minor . Then { Δ Δ i 1 , … … , i k } {\displaystyle \{\Delta _{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}\}} are the Plücker coordinates of the element W ∈ ∈ G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle {W}\in \mathrm {Gr} (k,V)} , the linear coordinates of the image ι ι ( W ) ∈ ∈ P ( ⋀ ⋀ k V ) {\displaystyle \iota ({W})\in \mathbb {P} ({\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V)} relative to the standard basis { e i 1 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ e i k } {\displaystyle \{e_{i_{1}}\wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_{k}}\}} of ⋀ ⋀ k V {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V} . Changing the basis of W {\displaystyle W} just changes the Plücker coordinates by a nonzero factor det ( A ) {\displaystyle \det(A)} , the determinant of the change of basis matrix,
giving the same point in P ( ⋀ ⋀ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ({\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V)} .

For any two ordered sequences: i 1 < i 2 < ⋯ ⋯ < i k − − 1 , j 1 < j 2 < ⋯ ⋯ < j k + 1 {\displaystyle i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdots <i_{k-1},\quad j_{1}<j_{2}<\cdots <j_{k+1}} of positive integers 1 ≤ ≤ i l , j m ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle 1\leq i_{l},j_{m}\leq n} , the following homogeneous equations are valid, and determine the image of W {\displaystyle W} under the Plücker map: [ 2 ] ∑ ∑ l = 1 k + 1 ( − − 1 ) l Δ Δ i 1 , … … , i k − − 1 , j l Δ Δ j 1 , … … , j ^ ^ l , … … j k + 1 = 0 , {\displaystyle \sum _{l=1}^{k+1}(-1)^{l}\Delta _{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k-1},j_{l}}\Delta _{j_{1},\dots ,{\hat {j}}_{l},\dots j_{k+1}}=0,} where j 1 , … … , j ^ ^ l , … … j k + 1 {\displaystyle j_{1},\dots ,{\hat {j}}_{l},\dots j_{k+1}} denotes that the term j l {\displaystyle j_{l}} is omitted. These are the Plücker relations .

When dim( V ) = 4 and k = 2 , we get G r ( 2 , V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Gr} (2,V)} , the simplest Grassmannian which is not a projective space, and the above reduces to a single equation. Denoting the coordinates of ⋀ ⋀ 2 V {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{2}V} by Δ Δ i j = − − Δ Δ j i , 1 ≤ ≤ i , j ≤ ≤ 4 , {\displaystyle \Delta _{ij}=-\Delta _{ji},\quad 1\leq i,j\leq 4,} the image of G r ( 2 , V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Gr} (2,V)} under the Plücker map is defined by the single equation Δ Δ 12 Δ Δ 34 − − Δ Δ 13 Δ Δ 24 + Δ Δ 14 Δ Δ 23 = 0.

{\displaystyle \Delta _{12}\Delta _{34}-\Delta _{13}\Delta _{24}+\Delta _{14}\Delta _{23}=0.} In general, many more equations are needed to define the image of the Plücker embedding, as in  ( 1 ), 
but these are not, in general, algebraically independent . The maximal number of algebraically independent relations (on Zariski open sets)
is given by the difference of dimension between P ( ⋀ ⋀ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ({\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}V)} and G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Gr} (k,V)} , which is ( n k ) − − k ( n − − k ) − − 1.
