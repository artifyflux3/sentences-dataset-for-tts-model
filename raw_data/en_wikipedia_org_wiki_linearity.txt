Not to be confused with [Lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_(disambiguation) "Lineage (disambiguation)").

In mathematics, the term _**linear**_ is used in two distinct senses for two different properties:

*   linearity of a _[function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function\_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")_ (or _[mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping\_(mathematics) "Mapping (mathematics)")_);
*   linearity of a _[polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial")_.

An example of a linear function is the function defined by ![Image 1: {\displaystyle f(x)=(ax,bx)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab83755bcaeef69cce2e5a8e0cc8d2bb110e78ac) that maps the real line to a line in the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane")**R**2 that passes through the origin. An example of a linear polynomial in the variables ![Image 2: {\displaystyle X,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/09ba32eeb405f7f5f2bac1eb12987c47d2fd42df)![Image 3: {\displaystyle Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/961d67d6b454b4df2301ac571808a3538b3a6d3f) and ![Image 4: {\displaystyle Z}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cc6b75e09a8aa3f04d8584b11db534f88fb56bd) is ![Image 5: {\displaystyle aX+bY+cZ+d.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef862db1aff4bf344263610586bbd74d041bbb33)

Linearity of a mapping is closely related to _[proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality\_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)")_. Examples in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") include the linear relationship of [voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage") and [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") in an [electrical conductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor "Electrical conductor") ([Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law "Ohm's law")), and the relationship of [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") and [weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight "Weight"). By contrast, more complicated relationships, such as between [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") and [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy"), are _[nonlinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear\_system "Nonlinear system")_.

Generalized for functions in more than one [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(mathematics) "Dimension (mathematics)"), linearity means the property of a function of being compatible with [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition") and [scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_analysis_(mathematics) "Scale analysis (mathematics)"), also known as the [superposition principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle "Superposition principle").

Linearity of a polynomial means that its [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial "Degree of a polynomial") is less than two. The use of the term for polynomials stems from the fact that the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of a polynomial in one variable is a straight [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"). In the term "[linear equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation")", the word refers to the linearity of the polynomials involved.

Because a function such as ![Image 6: {\displaystyle f(x)=ax+b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/75c655df4be41082c4bba924beab2c1dc27d019c) is defined by a linear polynomial in its argument, it is sometimes also referred to as being a "linear function", and the relationship between the argument and the function value may be referred to as a "linear relationship". This is potentially confusing, but usually the intended meaning will be clear from the context.

The word **linear** comes from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin")_linearis_, "pertaining to or resembling a line".

In mathematics, a [linear map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map") or [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function "Linear function")_f_(_x_) is a function that satisfies the two properties:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity#cite_note-1)

*   [Additivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_map "Additive map"): _f_(_x_ + _y_) = _f_(_x_) + _f_(_y_).
*   [Homogeneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_function "Homogeneous function") of degree 1: _f_(α _x_) = α _f_(_x_) for all α.

These properties are known as the [superposition principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle "Superposition principle"). In this definition, _x_ is not necessarily a [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), but can in general be an [element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(mathematics) "Element (mathematics)") of any [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"). A more special definition of [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function#As_a_polynomial_function "Linear function"), not coinciding with the definition of linear map, is used in elementary mathematics (see below).

Additivity alone implies homogeneity for [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") α, since ![Image 7: {\displaystyle f(x+x)=f(x)+f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10d3dd9de43b022b06f98fbd23c5988a5f16ac9c) implies ![Image 8: {\displaystyle f(nx)=nf(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe1988372667eb7701fdcdc77faab40926315db1) for any [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number")_n_ by [mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction"), and then ![Image 9: {\displaystyle nf(x)=f(nx)=f(m{\tfrac {n}{m}}x)=mf({\tfrac {n}{m}}x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1aafc4698cd3399c0703d5e3a3f1954c9cd4db00) implies ![Image 10: {\displaystyle f({\tfrac {n}{m}}x)={\tfrac {n}{m}}f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/869f6951f49015aeee8481360af71e154511dae1). The [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_set "Dense set") of the rational numbers in the reals implies that any additive [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") is homogeneous for any real number α, and is therefore linear.

The concept of linearity can be extended to linear [operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics) "Operator (mathematics)"). Important examples of linear operators include the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") considered as a [differential operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator "Differential operator"), and other operators constructed from it, such as [del](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del "Del") and the [Laplacian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian "Laplacian"). When a [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") can be expressed in linear form, it can generally be solved by breaking the equation up into smaller pieces, solving each of those pieces, and summing the solutions.

In a different usage to the above definition, a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") of degree 1 is said to be linear, because the [graph of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of that form is a straight line.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity#cite_note-2)

Over the reals, a simple example of a [linear equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation") is given by ![Image 11: {\displaystyle y=mx+b,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/753facd3de6ab64fa1cefd9a176437ed977e2979) where _m_ is often called the [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") or [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient"), and _b_ the [_y_-intercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-intercept "Y-intercept"), which gives the point of intersection between the graph of the function and the _y_ axis.

Note that this usage of the term _linear_ is not the same as in the section above, because linear polynomials over the real numbers do not in general satisfy either additivity or homogeneity. In fact, they do so [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") the [constant term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_term "Constant term")– _b_ in the example– equals 0. If _b_ ≠ 0, the function is called an **affine function** (see in greater generality [affine transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation")).

[Linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") is the branch of mathematics concerned with systems of linear equations.

Hasse diagram of a linear Boolean function

In [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(logic) "Boolean algebra (logic)"), a linear function is a function ![Image 13: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) for which there exist ![Image 14: {\displaystyle a_{0},a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}\in \{0,1\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f2ac49c0c13f2673abc93bcc3a9f6c5971a4c5d) such that

![Image 15: {\displaystyle f(b_{1},\ldots ,b_{n})=a_{0}\oplus (a_{1}\land b_{1})\oplus \cdots \oplus (a_{n}\land b_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/602b2a363cad0729aaa1fe75ddb605cdb643bb13), where ![Image 16: {\displaystyle b_{1},\ldots ,b_{n}\in \{0,1\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba2ae645f396d30a8d80bf7f7611dbd95973c43e)
Note that if ![Image 17: {\displaystyle a_{0}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e3873789cb6451e25f63b4d11572ac5c69d7873b), the above function is considered affine in linear algebra (i.e. not linear).

A Boolean function is linear if one of the following holds for the function's [truth table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table "Truth table"):

1.   In every row in which the truth value of the function is [T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value#Classical_logic "Truth value"), there are an odd number of Ts assigned to the arguments, and in every row in which the function is [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value#Classical_logic "Truth value") there is an even number of Ts assigned to arguments. Specifically, _f_(F, F, ..., F) = F, and these functions correspond to [linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map") over the Boolean vector space.
2.   In every row in which the value of the function is T, there is an even number of Ts assigned to the arguments of the function; and in every row in which the [truth value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value "Truth value") of the function is F, there are an odd number of Ts assigned to arguments. In this case, _f_(F, F, ..., F) = T.

Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the [truth value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value "Truth value") of the operation or it never makes a difference.

[Negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation "Negation"), [Logical biconditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_biconditional "Logical biconditional"), [exclusive or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or "Exclusive or"), [tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic) "Tautology (logic)"), and [contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction "Contradiction") are linear functions.

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), _linearity_ is a property of the [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") governing many systems; for instance, the [Maxwell equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_equations "Maxwell equations") or the [diffusion equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_equation "Diffusion equation").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity#cite_note-3)

Linearity of a [homogeneous differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_differential_equation "Homogeneous differential equation") means that if two functions _f_ and _g_ are solutions of the equation, then any [linear combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination "Linear combination")_af_ + _bg_ is, too.

In instrumentation, linearity means that a given change in an input variable gives the same change in the output of the measurement apparatus: this is highly desirable in scientific work. In general, instruments are close to linear over a certain range, and most useful within that range. In contrast, human senses are highly nonlinear: for instance, the brain completely ignores incoming light unless it exceeds a certain [absolute threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold "Absolute threshold") number of photons.

[Linear motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_motion "Linear motion") traces a straight line trajectory.

In [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"), the linear operating region of a device, for example a [transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor "Transistor"), is where an output [dependent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_variable "Dependent variable") (such as the transistor collector [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current")) is directly [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)") to an input dependent variable (such as the base current). This ensures that an analog output is an accurate representation of an input, typically with higher amplitude (amplified). A typical example of linear equipment is a [high fidelity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fidelity "High fidelity")[audio amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier "Audio amplifier"), which must amplify a signal without changing its waveform. Others are [linear filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_filter "Linear filter"), and [linear amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_amplifier "Linear amplifier") in general.

In most [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and [technological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"), as distinct from mathematical, applications, something may be described as linear if the characteristic is approximately but not exactly a straight line; and linearity may be valid only within a certain operating region—for example, a high-fidelity amplifier may distort a small signal, but sufficiently little to be acceptable (acceptable but imperfect linearity); and may distort very badly if the input exceeds a certain value.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity#cite_note-Whitaker-4)

For an electronic device (or other physical device) that converts a quantity to another quantity, Bertram S. Kolts writes:[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity#cite_note-6)

> There are three basic definitions for integral linearity in common use: independent linearity, zero-based linearity, and terminal, or end-point, linearity. In each case, linearity defines how well the device's actual performance across a specified operating range approximates a straight line. Linearity is usually measured in terms of a deviation, or non-linearity, from an ideal straight line and it is typically expressed in terms of percent of [full scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_scale "Full scale"), or in ppm (parts per million) of full scale. Typically, the straight line is obtained by performing a least-squares fit of the data. The three definitions vary in the manner in which the straight line is positioned relative to the actual device's performance. Also, all three of these definitions ignore any gain, or offset errors that may be present in the actual device's performance characteristics.
