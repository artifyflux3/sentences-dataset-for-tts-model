Find sources: "Eugene Salamin" mathematician – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2008 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Eugene Salamin is a mathematician who discovered (independently with Richard Brent ) the Salamin–Brent algorithm , used in high-precision calculation of pi .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Eugene Salamin worked on alternatives to increase accuracy and minimize computational processes through the use of quaternions .
Benefits may include: the design of spatio-temporal databases ; numerical mathematical methods that traditionally prove unsuccessful due to the buildup of computational errors; therefore, may be applied to applications involving genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation , in general.
