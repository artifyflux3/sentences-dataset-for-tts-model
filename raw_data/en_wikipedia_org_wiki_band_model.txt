The band model is a conformal model of the hyperbolic plane . The band model employs a portion of the Euclidean plane between two parallel lines.

[ 1 ] Distance is preserved along one line through the middle of the band. Assuming the band is given by { z ∈ ∈ C : | Im ⁡ ⁡ z | < π π / 2 } {\displaystyle \{z\in \mathbb {C} :\left|\operatorname {Im} z\right|<\pi /2\}} , the metric is given by | d z | sec ⁡ ⁡ ( Im ⁡ ⁡ z ) {\displaystyle |dz|\sec(\operatorname {Im} z)} .

Geodesics shown in a portion of the band model .

Geodesics include the line along the middle of the band, and any open line segment perpendicular to boundaries of the band connecting the sides of the band. Every end of a geodesic either meets a boundary of the band at a right angle or is asymptotic to the midline; the midline itself is the only geodesic that does not meet a boundary.

[ 2 ] Lines parallel to the boundaries of the band within the band are hypercycles whose common axis is the line through the middle of the band.
