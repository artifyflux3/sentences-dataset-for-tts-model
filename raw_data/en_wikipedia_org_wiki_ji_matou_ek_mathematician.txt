Jiří Matoušek Jiří Matoušek at the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach , 2005 Born ( 1963-03-10 ) 10 March 1963 Prague , Czechoslovakia Died 9 March 2015 (2015-03-09) (aged 51) Alma mater Charles University Scientific career Fields Mathematics Institutions Charles University ETH Zurich Jiří (Jirka) Matoušek (10 March 1963 – 9 March 2015) was a Czech mathematician working in computational geometry and algebraic topology . He was a professor at Charles University in Prague and the author of several textbooks and research monographs.

Biography [ edit ] Matoušek was born in Prague. In 1986, he received his Master's degree at Charles University under Miroslav Katětov .

[ 1 ] From 1986 until his death he was employed at the Department of Applied Mathematics of Charles University, holding a professor position since 2000. He was also a visiting and later full professor at ETH Zurich .

[ 2 ] In 1996, he won the European Mathematical Society prize [ 3 ] and in 2000 he won the Scientist award of the Learned Society of the Czech Republic .

[ 4 ] In 1998 he was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.

[ 5 ] He became a fellow of the Learned Society of the Czech Republic in 2005.

[ 6 ] Matoušek's paper on computational aspects of algebraic topology won the Best Paper award at the 2012 ACM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms .

[ 7 ] Aside from his own academic writing, he has translated the popularization book Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction by Timothy Gowers into Czech.

[ 8 ] He was a supporter and signatory of the Cost of Knowledge protest.

[ 9 ] Matoušek died in 2015, aged 51.

[ 2 ] [ 10 ] In 2021, a lecture hall at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University , was named after him.

I've been practicing this for many years, with some exceptions (journals with few good alternatives, requests for reports from people I didn't want to disappoint). I hope this initiative will not die out.
