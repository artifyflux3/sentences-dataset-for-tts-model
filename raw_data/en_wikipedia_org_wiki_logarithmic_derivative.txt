[ 1 ] Intuitively, this is the infinitesimal relative change in f ; that is, the infinitesimal absolute change in f , namely f′ scaled by the current value of f .

When f is a function f ( x ) of a real variable x , and takes real , strictly positive values, this is equal to the derivative of ln f ( x ) , or the natural logarithm of f . This follows directly from the chain rule : [ 1 ] d d x ln ⁡ ⁡ f ( x ) = 1 f ( x ) d f ( x ) d x {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\ln f(x)={\frac {1}{f(x)}}{\frac {df(x)}{dx}}} Basic properties [ edit ] Many properties of the real logarithm also apply to the logarithmic derivative, even when the function does not take values in the positive reals. For example, since the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors, we have ( log ⁡ ⁡ u v ) ′ = ( log ⁡ ⁡ u + log ⁡ ⁡ v ) ′ = ( log ⁡ ⁡ u ) ′ + ( log ⁡ ⁡ v ) ′ .

{\displaystyle (\log uv)'=(\log u+\log v)'=(\log u)'+(\log v)'.} So for positive-real-valued functions, the logarithmic derivative of a product is the sum of the logarithmic derivatives of the factors. But we can also use the Leibniz law for the derivative of a product to get ( u v ) ′ u v = u ′ v + u v ′ u v = u ′ u + v ′ v .

{\displaystyle {\frac {(uv)'}{uv}}={\frac {u'v+uv'}{uv}}={\frac {u'}{u}}+{\frac {v'}{v}}.} Thus, it is true for any function that the logarithmic derivative of a product is the sum of the logarithmic derivatives of the factors (when they are defined).

A corollary to this is that the logarithmic derivative of the reciprocal of a function is the negation of the logarithmic derivative of the function: ( 1 / u ) ′ 1 / u = − − u ′ / u 2 1 / u = − − u ′ u , {\displaystyle {\frac {(1/u)'}{1/u}}={\frac {-u'/u^{2}}{1/u}}=-{\frac {u'}{u}},} just as the logarithm of the reciprocal of a positive real number is the negation of the logarithm of the number.

[ citation needed ] More generally, the logarithmic derivative of a quotient is the difference of the logarithmic derivatives of the dividend and the divisor: ( u / v ) ′ u / v = ( u ′ v − − u v ′ ) / v 2 u / v = u ′ u − − v ′ v , {\displaystyle {\frac {(u/v)'}{u/v}}={\frac {(u'v-uv')/v^{2}}{u/v}}={\frac {u'}{u}}-{\frac {v'}{v}},} just as the logarithm of a quotient is the difference of the logarithms of the dividend and the divisor.

Generalising in another direction, the logarithmic derivative of a power (with constant real exponent) is the product of the exponent and the logarithmic derivative of the base: ( u k ) ′ u k = k u k − − 1 u ′ u k = k u ′ u , {\displaystyle {\frac {(u^{k})'}{u^{k}}}={\frac {ku^{k-1}u'}{u^{k}}}=k{\frac {u'}{u}},} just as the logarithm of a power is the product of the exponent and the logarithm of the base.

In summary, both derivatives and logarithms have a product rule , a reciprocal rule , a quotient rule , and a power rule (compare the list of logarithmic identities ); each pair of rules is related through the logarithmic derivative.

Computing ordinary derivatives using logarithmic derivatives [ edit ] Main article: Logarithmic differentiation Logarithmic derivatives can simplify the computation of derivatives requiring the product rule while producing the same result.  The procedure is as follows: Suppose that f ( x ) = u ( x ) v ( x ) and that we wish to compute f′ ( x ) .  Instead of computing it directly as f′ = u′v + v′u , we compute its logarithmic derivative.  That is, we compute: f ′ f = u ′ u + v ′ v .

{\displaystyle {\frac {f'}{f}}={\frac {u'}{u}}+{\frac {v'}{v}}.} Multiplying through by f computes f′ : f ′ = f ⋅ ⋅ ( u ′ u + v ′ v ) .

{\displaystyle f'=f\cdot \left({\frac {u'}{u}}+{\frac {v'}{v}}\right).} This technique is most useful when f is a product of a large number of factors.  This technique makes it possible to compute f′ by computing the logarithmic derivative of each factor, summing, and multiplying by f .

For example, we can compute the logarithmic derivative of e x 2 ( x − − 2 ) 3 ( x − − 3 ) ( x − − 1 ) − − 1 {\displaystyle e^{x^{2}}(x-2)^{3}(x-3)(x-1)^{-1}} to be 2 x + 3 x − − 2 + 1 x − − 3 − − 1 x − − 1 .

{\displaystyle 2x+{\frac {3}{x-2}}+{\frac {1}{x-3}}-{\frac {1}{x-1}}.} Integrating factors [ edit ] The logarithmic derivative idea is closely connected to the integrating factor method for first-order differential equations . In operator terms, write D = d d x {\displaystyle D={\frac {d}{dx}}} and let M denote the operator of multiplication by some given function G ( x ). Then M − − 1 D M {\displaystyle M^{-1}DM} can be written (by the product rule ) as D + M ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle D+M^{*}} where M ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle M^{*}} now denotes the multiplication operator by the logarithmic derivative G ′ G {\displaystyle {\frac {G'}{G}}} In practice we are given an operator such as D + F = L {\displaystyle D+F=L} and wish to solve equations L ( h ) = f {\displaystyle L(h)=f} for the function h , given f . This then reduces to solving G ′ G = F {\displaystyle {\frac {G'}{G}}=F} which has as solution exp ( ∫ ∫ F ) {\displaystyle \exp \textstyle (\int F)} with any indefinite integral of F .

[ citation needed ] Complex analysis [ edit ] See also: Argument principle The formula as given can be applied more widely; for example if f ( z ) is a meromorphic function , it makes sense at all complex values of z at which f has neither a zero nor a pole . Further, at a zero or a pole the logarithmic derivative behaves in a way that is easily analysed in terms of the particular case z n with n an integer, n ≠ 0 . The logarithmic derivative is then n / z {\displaystyle n/z} and one can draw the general conclusion that for f meromorphic, the singularities of the logarithmic derivative of f are all simple poles, with residue n from a zero of order n , residue − n from a pole of order n . See argument principle . This information is often exploited in contour integration .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ verification needed ] In the field of Nevanlinna theory , an important lemma states that the proximity function of a logarithmic derivative is small with respect to the Nevanlinna characteristic of the original function, for instance m ( r , h ′ / h ) = S ( r , h ) = o ( T ( r , h ) ) {\displaystyle m(r,h'/h)=S(r,h)=o(T(r,h))} .

[ 4 ] [ verification needed ] The multiplicative group [ edit ] Behind the use of the logarithmic derivative lie two basic facts about GL 1 , that is, the multiplicative group of real numbers or other field . The differential operator X d d X {\displaystyle X{\frac {d}{dX}}} is invariant under dilation (replacing X by aX for a constant). And the differential form d x X {\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{X}}} is likewise invariant. For functions F into GL 1 , the formula d F F {\displaystyle {\frac {dF}{F}}} is therefore a pullback of the invariant form.
