Founded in 1636 as New College , and later named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard , it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.

[ 10 ] Harvard was founded and authorized by the Massachusetts General Court , the governing legislature of colonial -era Massachusetts Bay Colony .

[ 11 ] While never formally affiliated with any denomination , Harvard trained Congregational clergy until its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized in the 18th century.

By the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Following the American Civil War , under Harvard president Charles William Eliot 's long tenure from 1869 to 1909, Harvard developed multiple professional schools, which transformed it into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities .

[ 14 ] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.

The university has ten academic faculties and a faculty attached to Harvard Radcliffe Institute . The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines , and other faculties offer graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three campuses: [ 15 ] the main campus, a 209-acre (85 ha) in Cambridge centered on Harvard Yard ; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston ; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area .

[ 16 ] Harvard's endowment , valued at $53.2 billion , makes it the wealthiest academic institution in the world.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Harvard Library , with more than 20 million volumes, is the world's largest academic library .

Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers include 188 living billionaires , 8 U.S. presidents , 24 heads of state and 31 heads of government , founders of notable companies, Nobel laureates , Fields Medalists , members of Congress , MacArthur Fellows , Rhodes Scholars , Marshall Scholars , Turing Award Recipients , Pulitzer Prize recipients, and Fulbright Scholars ; by most metrics, Harvard University ranks among the top universities in the world in each of these categories.

[ Notes 1 ] Harvard students and alumni have also collectively won 10 Academy Awards and 110 Olympic medals , including 46 gold medals.

History Main article: History of Harvard University Colonial era See also: John Harvard (clergyman) , Nathaniel Eaton , and Increase Mather A 1767 engraving of Harvard College by Paul Revere Harvard was founded in 1636 by a vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony . Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton , took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired English North America 's first known printing press .

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] The same year, on his deathbed, John Harvard , a Puritan clergyman who had emigrated to the colony from England, bequeathed the emerging college £780 and his library of some 320 volumes; [ 21 ] the following year, it was named Harvard College .

In 1643, a Harvard publication defined the college's purpose: "[to] advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust." [ 22 ] In its early years, the college trained many Puritan ministers [ 23 ] and offered a classical curriculum based on the English university model exemplified by the University of Cambridge , where many colonial Massachusetts leaders had studied prior to emigrating to the colony. Harvard College never formally affiliated with any particular Protestant denomination, but its curriculum conformed to the tenets of Puritanism.

[ 24 ] In 1650, the charter for Harvard Corporation , the college's governing body, was granted.

From 1681 to 1701, Increase Mather , a Puritan clergyman, served as Harvard's sixth president . In 1708, John Leverett became Harvard's seventh president and the first president who was not also a clergyman.

[ 25 ] Harvard faculty and students largely supported the Patriot cause during the American Revolution .

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] The earliest known official seal of Harvard University, commonly referred to as the Seal of 1650 or the In Christi Gloriam seal, features a square shield bearing three open books arranged around a central chevron. This design symbolizes the pursuit of learning under divine guidance. The motto IN CHRISTI GLORIAM ("To the glory of Christ") appears prominently on the seal, which is encircled by the Latin inscription SIGILL COL HARVARD CANTAB NOV ANGL 1650, meaning "Seal of Harvard College, Cambridge, New England, 1650." This seal reflects the original religious mission of the institution.

In 1885, the Harvard Corporation adopted a revised design known as the Appleton Seal, based on an earlier version created by President Josiah Quincy in 1843. Designed by William Sumner Appleton (Harvard AB 1860), the seal features a triangular shield bearing three open books with the motto VERITAS ("Truth"). Surrounding the shield is the motto CHRISTO ET ECCLESIÆ ("For Christ and the Church"), and the outer border bears the inscription SIGILLVM ACADEMIÆ HARVARDINÆ IN NOV. ANG. ("Seal of Harvard College in New England"). This version of the seal sought to harmonize the university's intellectual pursuits with its ecclesiastical roots.

[ 28 ] 19th century See also: Charles William Eliot and Samuel Webber The John Harvard statue in Harvard Yard In the 19th century, Harvard was influenced by Enlightenment Age ideas, including reason and free will, which were widespread among Congregational ministers and which placed these ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist pastors and clergies.

[ 29 ] : 1–4 Following the death of Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan in 1803 and that of Joseph Willard , Harvard's eleventh president, the following year, a struggle broke out over their replacements. In 1805, Henry Ware was elected to replace Tappan as Hollis chair. Two years later, in 1807, liberal Samuel Webber was appointed as Harvard's 13th president, representing a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to more liberal and Arminian ideas.

[ 29 ] : 4–5 [ 30 ] : 24 In 1816, Harvard University launched new language programs in the study of French and Spanish , and appointed George Ticknor the university's first professor for these language programs.

From 1869 to 1909, Charles William Eliot , Harvard University's 21st president, decreased the historically favored position of Christianity in the curriculum, opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of U.S. higher education, he was motivated primarily by Transcendentalist and Unitarian convictions influenced by William Ellery Channing , Ralph Waldo Emerson , and others, rather than secularism. In the late 19th century, Harvard University's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers.

[ 31 ] 20th century See also: A. Lawrence Lowell and James B. Conant A 1906 aerial watercolor portrait of Harvard University [ 32 ] In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities .

[ 14 ] For the first few decades of the 20th century, the Harvard student body was predominantly "old-stock, high-status Protestants , especially Episcopalians , Congregationalists , and Presbyterians ," according to sociologist and author Jerome Karabel .

[ 33 ] Over the 20th century, as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with it, Harvard University's reputation as one of the world's most prestigious universities grew notably. The university's enrollment also underwent substantial growth, a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college .

Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools in the nation for women.

In 1923, a year after the proportion of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, A. Lawrence Lowell , the university's 22nd president, unsuccessfully proposed capping the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories , writing that, "We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial." [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Between 1933 and 1953, Harvard University was led by James B. Conant , the university's 23rd president, who reinvigorated the university's creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, and devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1945, under Conant's leadership, an influential 268-page report, General Education in a Free Society , was published by Harvard faculty, which remains one of the most important works in curriculum studies , [ 38 ] and women were first admitted to the medical school .

[ 39 ] Between 1945 and 1960, admissions were standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students. Following the end of World War II , for example, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.

[ 40 ] No longer drawing mostly from prestigious prep schools in New England , the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians remained underrepresented.

[ 41 ] Over the second half of the 20th century, however, the university became incrementally more diverse.

[ 42 ] Between 1971 and 1999, Harvard controlled undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe's women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard University.

[ 43 ] 21st century See also: Drew Gilpin Faust , Lawrence Bacow , Claudine Gay , and Alan Garber An aerial view of Harvard University at night in 2017 On July 1, 2007, Drew Gilpin Faust , dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute , was appointed Harvard's 28th and the university's first female president.

[ 44 ] On July 1, 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of Goldman Sachs , and Lawrence Bacow became Harvard's 29th president .

[ 45 ] In February 2023, approximately 6,000 Harvard workers attempted to organize a union.

[ 46 ] Bacow retired in June 2023, and on July 1 Claudine Gay , a Harvard professor in the Government and African American Studies departments and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences , became Harvard's 30th president. In January 2024, just six months into her presidency, Gay resigned following allegations of antisemitism and plagiarism .

[ 47 ] Gay was succeeded by Alan Garber , the university's provost, who was appointed interim president. In August 2024, the university announced that Garber would be appointed Harvard's 31st president through the end of the 2026–27 academic year.

Second presidency of Donald Trump See also: Education policy of the second Donald Trump administration § Actions against universities In February 2025, Leo Terrell , the head of the Trump administration's Task Force to Combat Antisemitism , announced that he would investigate Harvard University as part of the Department of Justice's broader investigation into antisemitism on college campuses .

[ 48 ] In April 2025, the United States federal government under President Donald Trump threatened to withhold nearly $9 billion in government funds from the university unless the university complied with government demands to modify many of its policies. This threat was part of a broader battle over universities' autonomy following contentious student protests against the Gaza war , and followed similar demands made of Columbia University .

[ 49 ] The university's leadership resisted the government's demands, claiming that they were an unlawful overreach of government authority.

[ 50 ] In response, the US Department of Education announced they were freezing $2.3 billion in federal funds to Harvard.

[ 51 ] The Department of Homeland Security subsequently threatened to revoke Harvard's eligibility to host international students .

[ 49 ] Harvard responded by filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration in the District Court of Massachusetts , arguing that the freezing of funds was unconstitutional.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] In May 2025, education secretary Linda McMahon informed Harvard president Garber that the federal government would no longer provide grant funding until the university complied with the Trump administration's demands.

[ 55 ] The following week, the Trump administration cut an additional $450 million in grants to the school.

[ 56 ] Decertification Letter sent by Kristi Noem on May 22, 2025 Later that same month, Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem announced that Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification had been revoked, barring Harvard from hosting international students.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] The following day, Harvard sued the Trump administration for banning them from enrolling international students and U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs granted a temporary restraining order stopping the ban.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] On June 16, 2025, Burroughs postponed a ruling after hearing arguments from lawyers on both sides, leaving the temporary block in place for another week.

[ 63 ] On May 30, 2025, the State Department ordered all US embassies and consulates to conduct "comprehensive and thorough vetting" of the online presence of anyone seeking to visit Harvard from abroad.

[ 64 ] On June 4, 2025, Trump issued a proclamation restricting international students from studying at Harvard, and directing the State Department to consider revoking the visas of current international students studying at that university.

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] The following day, Harvard filed a legal challenge, amending their existing federal complaint against the administration.

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] On June 20, Harvard was granted an injunction allowing it to continue hosting international students as litigation continues.

[ 70 ] On June 30, a Trump administration investigation found Harvard violated federal civil rights law by failing to protect Jewish students, faculty, and staff.

The Yard houses several Harvard buildings, including four of the university's libraries, Houghton , Lamont , Pusey , and Widener . Also on Harvard Yard are Massachusetts Hall , built between 1718 and 1720 and the university's oldest still standing building, Memorial Church , and University Hall .

Harvard Yard and adjacent areas include the main academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences , including Sever Hall , Harvard Hall , and freshman dormitories . Upperclassmen live in the twelve residential houses , located south of Harvard Yard near the Charles River and on Radcliffe Quadrangle , which formerly housed Radcliffe College students. Each house is a community of undergraduates, faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities.

[ 73 ] Also on the main campus in Cambridge are the Law , Divinity (theology), Engineering and Applied Science , Design (architecture), Education , Kennedy (public policy), and Extension schools, and Harvard Radcliffe Institute in Radcliffe Yard.

[ 74 ] Harvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] Allston Main article: Harvard University's expansion in Allston, Massachusetts Harvard Business School , Harvard Innovation Labs , and many athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium , are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus in the Allston section of Boston across the John W. Weeks Bridge , which crosses the Charles River and connects the Allston and Cambridge campuses.

[ 77 ] The university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge.

[ 78 ] Plans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.

[ 79 ] In 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences expanded into the new Allston-based Science and Engineering Complex (SEC), which is more than 500,000 square feet in size.

[ 80 ] SEC is adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and Harvard Innovation Labs, and designed to encourage technology- and life science-focused startups and collaborations with mature companies.

[ 81 ] Longwood Main article: Longwood Medical and Academic Area Harvard Medical School in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston The university's schools of Medicine , Dental Medicine , and Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston , about 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.

[ 16 ] Several Harvard-affiliated hospitals and research institutes are also in Longwood, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Boston Children's Hospital , Brigham and Women's Hospital , Dana–Farber Cancer Institute , Joslin Diabetes Center , and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering . Additional affiliates, including Massachusetts General Hospital , are located throughout Greater Boston .

Other Harvard owns Dumbarton Oaks , a research library in Washington, D.C., Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts , Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts , [ 82 ] the Villa I Tatti research center in Florence , Italy, [ 83 ] and the Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece. The Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai , China, [ 84 ] and Arnold Arboretum in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.

Organization and administration Governance See also: Harvard Board of Overseers , President and Fellows of Harvard College , and President of Harvard University Harvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College , which is also known as the Harvard Corporation. These two bodies, in turn, appoint the President of Harvard University .

[ 85 ] There are 16,000 staff and faculty, [ 86 ] including 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors.

[ 87 ] As of 2025, Harvard differs radically from its peer universities in two important ways. First, Harvard does not make its governing statutes publicly available, meaning that members of the Harvard community interested in reform must first persuade the university to give them a copy of those documents. Second, Harvard does not have an academic senate like most of its peers, although it is currently attempting to create one.

[ 88 ] Endowment Main article: Harvard University endowment Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] During the recession of 2007–2009 , it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.

[ 89 ] The endowment has since recovered.

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] About $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.

[ 94 ] Harvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences .

[ 95 ] Endowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.

[ 96 ] Divestment Since the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated divesting Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in South Africa during apartheid , Sudan during the Darfur genocide , and tobacco , fossil fuel , and private prison industries.

[ 97 ] [ 98 ] In the late 1980s, during the disinvestment from South Africa movement, student activists erected a symbolic shanty town on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.

[ 99 ] [ 100 ] In response to pressure, the university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million out of a total of $400 million between 1986 and 1987.

[ 105 ] During the 2018–2019 academic year, Harvard granted 1,665 baccalaureate degrees, 1,013 graduate degrees, and 5,695 professional degrees.

[ 105 ] Harvard College , the four-year, full-time undergraduate program, has a liberal arts and sciences focus.

[ 102 ] [ 103 ] To graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.

[ 106 ] In most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis.

[ 107 ] Though some introductory courses have large enrollments, the median class size is 12 students.

[ 108 ] The Faculty of Arts and Sciences , with an academic staff of 1,211 as of 2019, is the largest Harvard faculty, and has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College , the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) , and the Division of Continuing Education , which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School . There are nine other graduate and professional faculties and a faculty attached to the Harvard Radcliffe Institute .

There are four Harvard joint programs with MIT , which include the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology , the Broad Institute , The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX .

Professional schools The university maintains 12 schools, which include: School Founded Enrollment [ 109 ] [ failed verification ] Medicine 1782 660 Divinity 1816 377 Law 1817 1,990 Dental Medicine 1867 280 Graduate Arts and Sciences 1872 4,824 Business 1908 2,011 Extension 1910 3,428 Design 1914 878 Education 1920 876 Public Health 1922 1,412 Government 1936 1,100 Engineering 2007 1,750 (including undergraduates) Research Harvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities [ 110 ] and a preeminent research university with "very high" research activity (R1) and comprehensive doctoral programs across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine, according to the Carnegie Classification .

[ 102 ] The medical school consistently ranks first among medical schools for research, [ 111 ] and biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty and 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school and its 15 affiliated hospitals and research institutes.

[ 112 ] In 2019, the medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health , more than twice that of any other university.

[ 113 ] Libraries Main article: Harvard Library Widener Library , the anchor of Harvard Library , the largest academic library in the world with more than 20 million holdings Harvard Library , the largest academic library in the world with 20.4 million holdings, is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard . It includes 25 individual Harvard libraries around the world with a combined staff of more than 800 librarians and personnel.

[ 114 ] Houghton Library , the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. The nation's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases is stored in Pusey Library on Harvard Yard , which is open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in Harvard-Yenching Library .
