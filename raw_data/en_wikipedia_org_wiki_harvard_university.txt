**Harvard University** is a [private](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_university "Private university")[Ivy League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League "Ivy League")[research university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_university "Research university") in [Cambridge, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts "Cambridge, Massachusetts"), United States. Founded in 1636 as **New College**, and later named for its first benefactor, the [Puritan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Puritans_in_North_America "History of the Puritans in North America") clergyman [John Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvard_(clergyman) "John Harvard (clergyman)"), it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-10)

Harvard was founded and authorized by the [Massachusetts General Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Court "Massachusetts General Court"), the governing legislature of [colonial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States "Colonial history of the United States")-era [Massachusetts Bay Colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony "Massachusetts Bay Colony").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-11) While never formally affiliated with any [denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_denomination "Religious denomination"), Harvard trained [Congregational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregationalism_in_the_United_States "Congregationalism in the United States") clergy until its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized in the 18th century.

By the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the [Boston elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Brahmin "Boston Brahmin").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-13) Following the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"), under [Harvard president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Harvard_University "President of Harvard University")[Charles William Eliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_William_Eliot "Charles William Eliot")'s long tenure from 1869 to 1909, Harvard developed multiple professional schools, which transformed it into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the [Association of American Universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities "Association of American Universities").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-AAU-14)[James B. Conant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_B._Conant "James B. Conant") led the university through the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.

The university has ten academic faculties and a faculty attached to [Harvard Radcliffe Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Radcliffe_Institute "Harvard Radcliffe Institute"). The [Faculty of Arts and Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Faculty_of_Arts_and_Sciences "Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences") offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate [academic disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline "Academic discipline"), and other faculties offer graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three campuses:[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-15) the main campus, a 209-acre (85 ha) in Cambridge centered on [Harvard Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Yard "Harvard Yard"); an adjoining campus immediately across [Charles River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_River "Charles River") in the [Allston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allston "Allston") neighborhood of [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston"); and the medical campus in Boston's [Longwood Medical Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longwood_Medical_and_Academic_Area "Longwood Medical and Academic Area").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-Campus-16)[Harvard's endowment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University_endowment "Harvard University endowment"), valued at $53.2 billion, makes it the [wealthiest academic institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_the_United_States_by_endowment "List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment") in the world.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-BGendow-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-HFRendow-18)[Harvard Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Library "Harvard Library"), with more than 20 million volumes, is the world's largest [academic library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_library "Academic library").

Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers include [188 living billionaires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_by_number_of_billionaire_alumni "List of universities by number of billionaire alumni"), [8 U.S. presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_education "List of presidents of the United States by education"), [24 heads of state and 31 heads of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harvard_University_politicians "List of Harvard University politicians"), founders of notable companies, [Nobel laureates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_university_affiliation "List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation"), [Fields Medalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal "Fields Medal"), [members of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress"), [MacArthur Fellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur_Fellows_Program "MacArthur Fellows Program"), [Rhodes Scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarship "Rhodes Scholarship"), [Marshall Scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Scholarship "Marshall Scholarship"), [Turing Award Recipients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award "Turing Award"), [Pulitzer Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize "Pulitzer Prize") recipients, and [Fulbright Scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright_Program "Fulbright Program"); by most metrics, Harvard University ranks among the top universities in the world in each of these categories.[[Notes 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-laureates-19) Harvard students and alumni have also collectively won 10 [Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards") and [110 Olympic medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_universities_with_Olympic_medalist_students_and_alumni "List of American universities with Olympic medalist students and alumni"), including 46 gold medals.

### Colonial era

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/A_Westerly_View_of_the_Colledges_in_Cambridge_New_England_by_Paul_Revere.jpeg/250px-A_Westerly_View_of_the_Colledges_in_Cambridge_New_England_by_Paul_Revere.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_Westerly_View_of_the_Colledges_in_Cambridge_New_England_by_Paul_Revere.jpeg)

A 1767 engraving of [Harvard College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College "Harvard College") by [Paul Revere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Revere "Paul Revere")

Harvard was founded in 1636 by a vote of the [Great and General Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Court "Massachusetts General Court") of the [Massachusetts Bay Colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony "Massachusetts Bay Colony"). Its first headmaster, [Nathaniel Eaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Eaton "Nathaniel Eaton"), took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired [English North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_North_America "British North America")'s first known [printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press "Printing press").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-20)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-21) The same year, on his deathbed, [John Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvard_(clergyman) "John Harvard (clergyman)"), a [Puritan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans "Puritans") clergyman who had emigrated to the colony from England, bequeathed the emerging college £780 and his library of some 320 volumes;[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-22) the following year, it was named [Harvard College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College "Harvard College").

In 1643, a Harvard publication defined the college's purpose: "[to] advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust."[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-23)

In its early years, the college trained many Puritan ministers[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-24) and offered a [classical curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_education "Classical education") based on the English university model exemplified by the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge"), where many colonial Massachusetts leaders had studied prior to emigrating to the colony. Harvard College never formally affiliated with any particular [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism "Protestantism") denomination, but its curriculum conformed to the tenets of Puritanism.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-25) In 1650, the charter for [Harvard Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_and_Fellows_of_Harvard_College "President and Fellows of Harvard College"), the college's governing body, was granted.

From 1681 to 1701, [Increase Mather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increase_Mather "Increase Mather"), a Puritan clergyman, served as Harvard's sixth [president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Harvard_University "President of Harvard University"). In 1708, [John Leverett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Leverett_the_Younger "John Leverett the Younger") became Harvard's seventh president and the first president who was not also a clergyman.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-26) Harvard faculty and students largely supported the [Patriot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution) "Patriot (American Revolution)") cause during the [American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-27)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-28)

The earliest known official seal of Harvard University, commonly referred to as the Seal of 1650 or the In Christi Gloriam seal, features a square shield bearing three open books arranged around a central chevron. This design symbolizes the pursuit of learning under divine guidance. The motto IN CHRISTI GLORIAM ("To the glory of Christ") appears prominently on the seal, which is encircled by the Latin inscription SIGILL COL HARVARD CANTAB NOV ANGL 1650, meaning "Seal of Harvard College, Cambridge, New England, 1650." This seal reflects the original religious mission of the institution.

In 1885, the Harvard Corporation adopted a revised design known as the Appleton Seal, based on an earlier version created by President Josiah Quincy in 1843. Designed by William Sumner Appleton (Harvard AB 1860), the seal features a triangular shield bearing three open books with the motto VERITAS ("Truth"). Surrounding the shield is the motto CHRISTO ET ECCLESIÆ ("For Christ and the Church"), and the outer border bears the inscription SIGILLVM ACADEMIÆ HARVARDINÆ IN NOV. ANG. ("Seal of Harvard College in New England"). This version of the seal sought to harmonize the university's intellectual pursuits with its ecclesiastical roots.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-29)

### 19th century

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/John_Harvard_statue.jpg/250px-John_Harvard_statue.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Harvard_statue.jpg)

The [John Harvard statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvard_statue "John Harvard statue") in [Harvard Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Yard "Harvard Yard")

In the 19th century, Harvard was influenced by [Enlightenment Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") ideas, including reason and free will, which were widespread among [Congregational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregationalism_in_the_United_States "Congregationalism in the United States") ministers and which placed these ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_Christianity "Reformed Christianity") pastors and clergies.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-Dorrien-30): 1–4  Following the death of [Hollis Professor of Divinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollis_Professor_of_Divinity "Hollis Professor of Divinity")[David Tappan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tappan "David Tappan") in 1803 and that of [Joseph Willard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Willard "Joseph Willard"), Harvard's eleventh president, the following year, a struggle broke out over their replacements. In 1805, [Henry Ware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ware_(Unitarian) "Henry Ware (Unitarian)") was elected to replace Tappan as Hollis chair. Two years later, in 1807, liberal [Samuel Webber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Webber "Samuel Webber") was appointed as Harvard's 13th president, representing a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to more liberal and [Arminian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminianism "Arminianism") ideas.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-Dorrien-30): 4–5 [[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-31): 24

In 1816, Harvard University launched new language programs in the study of [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") and [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language"), and appointed [George Ticknor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ticknor "George Ticknor") the university's first professor for these language programs.

From 1869 to 1909, [Charles William Eliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_William_Eliot "Charles William Eliot"), Harvard University's 21st president, decreased the historically favored position of [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") in the curriculum, opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of U.S. higher education, he was motivated primarily by [Transcendentalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism "Transcendentalism") and [Unitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarianism "Unitarianism") convictions influenced by [William Ellery Channing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ellery_Channing "William Ellery Channing"), [Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson "Ralph Waldo Emerson"), and others, rather than secularism. In the late 19th century, Harvard University's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-32)

### 20th century

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Rummell%2C_Richard_Harvard_University.jpg/250px-Rummell%2C_Richard_Harvard_University.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rummell,_Richard_Harvard_University.jpg)

A 1906 aerial watercolor portrait of Harvard University[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-33)

In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the [Association of American Universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities "Association of American Universities").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-AAU-14) For the first few decades of the 20th century, the Harvard student body was predominantly "old-stock, high-status [Protestants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism "Protestantism"), especially [Episcopalians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States) "Episcopal Church (United States)"), [Congregationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregational_church "Congregational church"), and [Presbyterians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterianism "Presbyterianism")," according to sociologist and author [Jerome Karabel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Karabel "Jerome Karabel").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-34)

Over the 20th century, as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with it, Harvard University's reputation as one of the world's most prestigious universities grew notably. The university's enrollment also underwent substantial growth, a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the [undergraduate college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College "Harvard College"). [Radcliffe College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_College "Radcliffe College") emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools in the nation for women.

In 1923, a year after the proportion of [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews") students at Harvard reached 20%, [A. Lawrence Lowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Lawrence_Lowell "A. Lawrence Lowell"), the university's 22nd president, unsuccessfully proposed capping the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's [freshman dormitories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harvard_College_freshman_dormitories "List of Harvard College freshman dormitories"), writing that, "We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial."[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-35)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-36)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-37)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-38)

Between 1933 and 1953, Harvard University was led by [James B. Conant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_B._Conant "James B. Conant"), the university's 23rd president, who reinvigorated the university's creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, and devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1945, under Conant's leadership, an influential 268-page report, _[General Education in a Free Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General\_Education\_in\_a\_Free\_Society "General Education in a Free Society")_, was published by Harvard faculty, which remains one of the most important works in [curriculum studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_studies "Curriculum studies"),[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-39) and women were first admitted to the [medical school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School "Harvard Medical School").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-40)

Between 1945 and 1960, admissions were standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students. Following the end of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), for example, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-41) No longer drawing mostly from prestigious [prep schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College-preparatory_school "College-preparatory school") in [New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England "New England"), the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians remained underrepresented.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-42) Over the second half of the 20th century, however, the university became incrementally more diverse.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-43)

Between 1971 and 1999, Harvard controlled undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe's women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard University.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-44)

On July 1, 2007, [Drew Gilpin Faust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Gilpin_Faust "Drew Gilpin Faust"), dean of [Harvard Radcliffe Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Radcliffe_Institute "Harvard Radcliffe Institute"), was appointed Harvard's 28th and the university's first female president.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-45) On July 1, 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of [Goldman Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs "Goldman Sachs"), and [Lawrence Bacow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Bacow "Lawrence Bacow") became Harvard's [29th president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Harvard_University "President of Harvard University").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-46)

In February 2023, approximately 6,000 Harvard workers attempted to organize a union.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-47)

Bacow retired in June 2023, and on July 1 [Claudine Gay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudine_Gay "Claudine Gay"), a Harvard professor in the Government and African American Studies departments and Dean of the [Faculty of Arts and Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Faculty_of_Arts_and_Sciences "Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences"), became Harvard's 30th president. In January 2024, just six months into her presidency, Gay resigned following [allegations of antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudine_Gay#Congressional_hearing_on_antisemitism "Claudine Gay") and [plagiarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudine_Gay#Plagiarism_investigations "Claudine Gay").[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-48) Gay was succeeded by [Alan Garber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Garber "Alan Garber"), the university's provost, who was appointed interim president. In August 2024, the university announced that Garber would be appointed Harvard's 31st president through the end of the 2026–27 academic year.

#### Second presidency of Donald Trump

In February 2025, [Leo Terrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Terrell "Leo Terrell"), the head of the Trump administration's [Task Force to Combat Antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_the_United_States#Efforts_to_combat_antisemitism "Antisemitism in the United States"), announced that he would investigate Harvard University as part of the Department of Justice's broader investigation into [antisemitism on college campuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_US_higher_education "Antisemitism in US higher education").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-49)

In April 2025, the United States federal government under President [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") threatened to withhold nearly $9 billion in government funds from the university unless the university complied with government demands to modify many of its policies. This threat was part of a broader battle over universities' autonomy following contentious [student protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_pro-Palestinian_protests_on_university_campuses "2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses") against the [Gaza war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war"), and followed [similar demands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_policy_of_the_second_Donald_Trump_administration#Actions_against_universities "Education policy of the second Donald Trump administration") made of [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-:0-50) The university's leadership resisted the government's demands, claiming that they were an unlawful overreach of government authority.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-51) In response, the [US Department of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Department_of_Education "US Department of Education") announced they were freezing $2.3 billion in federal funds to Harvard.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-guard-14apr2025-52) The [Department of Homeland Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security "United States Department of Homeland Security") subsequently threatened to revoke Harvard's eligibility to host [international students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_student "International student").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-:0-50) Harvard responded by filing [a lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_and_Fellows_of_Harvard_College_v._Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services "President and Fellows of Harvard College v. Department of Health and Human Services") against the Trump administration in the [District Court of Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Massachusetts "United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts"), arguing that the freezing of funds was unconstitutional.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-guard-21apr2025-53)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-nbc-21apr2025-54)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-guard-21jul2025-55)

In May 2025, education secretary [Linda McMahon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_McMahon "Linda McMahon") informed Harvard president Garber that the federal government would no longer provide grant funding until the university complied with the Trump administration's demands.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-guard-5may2025-56) The following week, the Trump administration cut an additional $450 million in grants to the school.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-ap-13may2025-57)

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Exhibit_25._May_22%2C_2025_DHS_Decertification_Letter.pdf/page1-250px-Exhibit_25._May_22%2C_2025_DHS_Decertification_Letter.pdf.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Exhibit_25._May_22,_2025_DHS_Decertification_Letter.pdf)

Decertification Letter sent by Kristi Noem on May 22, 2025

Later that same month, Department of Homeland Security secretary [Kristi Noem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem "Kristi Noem") announced that Harvard's [Student and Exchange Visitor Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_and_Exchange_Visitor_Program "Student and Exchange Visitor Program") certification had been revoked, barring Harvard from hosting international students.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-guard-22may2025-58)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-dhs-22may2025-59) The following day, Harvard sued the Trump administration for banning them from enrolling international students and U.S. District Judge [Allison Burroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allison_D._Burroughs "Allison D. Burroughs") granted a temporary restraining order stopping the ban.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-guard-23may2025-1-60)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-guard-23may2025-2-61)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-harvard-suit-23may2025-62)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-63) On June 16, 2025, Burroughs postponed a ruling after hearing arguments from lawyers on both sides, leaving the temporary block in place for another week.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-npr-16jun2025-64)

On May 30, 2025, the [State Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State") ordered all US embassies and consulates to conduct "comprehensive and thorough vetting" of the online presence of anyone seeking to visit Harvard from abroad.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-guard-30may2025-65)

On June 4, 2025, Trump issued a proclamation restricting international students from studying at Harvard, and directing the State Department to consider revoking the visas of current international students studying at that university.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-guard-5jun2025-66)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-wh-proc-4jun2025-67) The following day, Harvard filed a legal challenge, amending their existing federal complaint against the administration.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-nbc-5jun2025-68)[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-guard2-5jun2025-69)[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-cl-5jun2025-70)

On June 20, Harvard was granted an injunction allowing it to continue hosting international students as litigation continues.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-71) On June 30, a Trump administration investigation found Harvard violated federal civil rights law by failing to protect Jewish students, faculty, and staff.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-72)

The Harvard Shanghai Center in [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai "Shanghai"), China,[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-85) and [Arnold Arboretum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Arboretum "Arnold Arboretum") in the [Jamaica Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Plain "Jamaica Plain") neighborhood of Boston.

Organization and administration
-------------------------------

### Governance

Harvard is governed by a combination of its [Board of Overseers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Board_of_Overseers "Harvard Board of Overseers") and the [President and Fellows of Harvard College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_and_Fellows_of_Harvard_College "President and Fellows of Harvard College"), which is also known as the Harvard Corporation. These two bodies, in turn, appoint the [President of Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Harvard_University "President of Harvard University").[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-86)

There are 16,000 staff and faculty,[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-87) including 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-88)

As of 2025, Harvard differs radically from its peer universities in two important ways. First, Harvard does not make its governing statutes publicly available, meaning that members of the Harvard community interested in reform must first persuade the university to give them a copy of those documents. Second, Harvard does not have an [academic senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_senate "Academic senate") like most of its peers, although it is currently attempting to create one.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-Heller-89)

### Endowment

Harvard has the largest [university endowment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_the_United_States_by_endowment "List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment") in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-BGendow-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-HFRendow-18)

During the [recession of 2007–2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession "Great Recession"), it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-90) The endowment has since recovered.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-91)[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-92)[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-93)[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-94)

About $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-95) Harvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the [Faculty of Arts and Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Faculty_of_Arts_and_Sciences "Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences").[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-96) Endowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-97)

#### Divestment

Since the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated [divesting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divestment "Divestment") Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa") during [apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid "Apartheid"), [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan "Sudan") during the [Darfur genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur_genocide "Darfur genocide"), and [tobacco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry "Tobacco industry"), [fossil fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel "Fossil fuel"), and [private prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison "Private prison") industries.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-98)[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-99)

In the late 1980s, during the [disinvestment from South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinvestment_from_South_Africa "Disinvestment from South Africa") movement, student activists erected a symbolic [shanty town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanty_town "Shanty town") on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-GeorgeKaufman2012-100)[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-101)

In response to pressure, the university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million out of a total of $400 million between 1986 and 1987.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-GeorgeKaufman2012-100)[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#cite_note-102)
