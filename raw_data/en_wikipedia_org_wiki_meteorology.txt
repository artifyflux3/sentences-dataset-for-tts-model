**Meteorology** is the scientific study of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")'s [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") and short-term atmospheric phenomena (i.e., [weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather "Weather")), with a focus on [weather forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting "Weather forecasting").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-1) It has applications in the [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military "Military"), [aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation "Aviation"), [energy production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_production "Energy production"), [transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport "Transport"), [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture"), [construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction "Construction"), [weather warnings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_warnings "Weather warnings"), and [disaster management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_management "Disaster management").

Along with [climatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology "Climatology"), [atmospheric physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_physics "Atmospheric physics"), and [atmospheric chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_chemistry "Atmospheric chemistry"), meteorology forms the broader field of the [atmospheric sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_sciences "Atmospheric sciences"). The interactions between Earth's atmosphere and its [oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean "Ocean") (notably [El Niño](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o "El Niño") and [La Niña](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni%C3%B1a "La Niña")) are studied in the interdisciplinary field of [hydrometeorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrometeorology "Hydrometeorology"). Other interdisciplinary areas include [biometeorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometeorology "Biometeorology"), [space weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather "Space weather"), and planetary meteorology. [Marine weather forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_weather_forecasting "Marine weather forecasting") relates meteorology to maritime and coastal safety, based on atmospheric interactions with large bodies of water.

Meteorologists study [meteorological phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_meteorological_phenomena "List of meteorological phenomena") driven by [solar radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation "Solar radiation"), [Earth's rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation"), [ocean currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current "Ocean current"), and other factors. These include everyday weather like [clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud "Cloud"), [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation "Precipitation"), and [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind "Wind") patterns, as well as [severe weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather "Severe weather") events such as [tropical cyclones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclones "Tropical cyclones") and severe [winter storms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_storm "Winter storm"). Such phenomena are quantified using variables like [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_temperature "Air temperature"), [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure "Air pressure"), and [humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity "Humidity"), which are then used to forecast weather at local ([microscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscale_meteorology "Microscale meteorology")), regional ([mesoscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoscale_meteorology "Mesoscale meteorology") and [synoptic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synoptic_meteorology "Synoptic meteorology")), and global [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(spatial) "Scale (spatial)"). Meteorologists collect data using basic instruments like [thermometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer "Thermometer"), [barometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer "Barometer"), and [weather vanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_vane "Weather vane") (for surface-level measurements), alongside advanced tools like [weather satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_satellite "Weather satellite"), [balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_balloon "Weather balloon"), [reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_reconnaissance "Weather reconnaissance") aircraft, [buoys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_buoy "Weather buoy"), and [radars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_radar "Weather radar"). The [World Meteorological Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization "World Meteorological Organization") (WMO) ensures international standardization of meteorological research.

The study of meteorology dates back [millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium "Millennium"). Ancient civilizations tried to predict weather through [folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore "Folklore"), [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology"), and [religious rituals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_ritual "Religious ritual"). [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s treatise _[Meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology\_(Aristotle) "Meteorology (Aristotle)")_ sums up early observations of the field, which advanced little during early medieval times but experienced a resurgence during the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance"), when [Alhazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen "Alhazen") and [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") challenged Aristotelian theories, emphasizing [scientific methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method"). In the 18th century, accurate measurement tools (e.g., barometer and thermometer) were developed, and the first meteorological society was founded. In the 19th century, [telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph "Telegraph")-based weather observation networks were formed across broad regions.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-2) In the 20th century, [numerical weather prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction "Numerical weather prediction") (NWP), coupled with advanced satellite and radar technology, introduced sophisticated forecasting models.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-3) Later, [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") revolutionized forecasting by processing vast datasets in real time and automatically solving modeling equations. 21st-century meteorology is highly accurate and driven by [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data "Big data") and [supercomputing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputing "Supercomputing"). It is adopting innovations like [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning"), [ensemble forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_forecasting "Ensemble forecasting"), and high-resolution global climate modeling.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-4)[Climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change")–induced [extreme weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather "Extreme weather") poses new challenges for forecasting and research,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-5) while inherent uncertainty remains because of the atmosphere's [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") nature (see [butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect "Butterfly effect")).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-6)

The word _[meteorology](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meteorology "wikt:meteorology")_ is from the Ancient Greek [μετέωρος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%AD%CF%89%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82 "wikt:μετέωρος")_metéōros_ (_meteor_) and [-λογία](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%B1 "wikt:-λογία")_-logia_ (_[-(o)logy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-logy "wikt:-logy")_), meaning "the study of things high in the air".[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Ancient meteorology up to the time of Aristotle

[Parhelion (sundog)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parhelion "Parhelion") in [Savoie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoie "Savoie")

Early attempts at predicting weather were often related to prophecy and [divining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divining "Divining"), and were sometimes based on astrological ideas. [Ancient religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_religion#Origin "History of religion") believed meteorological phenomena to be under the control of the gods.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-:1-7) The ability to predict [rains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain "Rain") and [floods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood "Flood") based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier. Early approaches to predicting weather were based on [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology") and were practiced by priests. The [Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") had [rain-making rituals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainmaking_(ritual) "Rainmaking (ritual)") as early as 3500 BC.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-:1-7)

Ancient Indian [Upanishads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads "Upanishads") contain mentions of clouds and [seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-imd-8) The Samaveda mentions sacrifices to be performed when certain phenomena were noticed.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-:0-9)[Varāhamihira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Var%C4%81hamihira "Varāhamihira")'s classical work _Brihatsamhita_, written about 500 AD,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-imd-8) provides evidence of weather observation.

[Cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform "Cuneiform") inscriptions on [Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon "Babylon") tablets included associations between thunder and rain. The [Chaldeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon "Babylon") differentiated the [22°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22%C2%B0_halo "22° halo") and [46° halos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46%C2%B0_halo "46° halo").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-:0-9)

The [ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") were the first to make theories about the weather. Many [natural philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy "Natural philosophy") studied the weather. However, as [meteorological instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorological_instrumentation "Meteorological instrumentation") did not exist, the inquiry was largely qualitative, and could only be judged by more general theoretical speculations.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-10)[Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus "Herodotus") states that [Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus "Thales of Miletus") predicted the [solar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse "Solar eclipse") of 585 BC. He studied Babylonian equinox tables.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-11) According to [Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger "Seneca the Younger"), he explained that the cause of the [Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile "Nile")'s annual floods was due to northerly winds hindering its descent by the sea.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-12)[Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander") and [Anaximenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximenes_of_Miletus "Anaximenes of Miletus") thought that thunder and lightning was caused by air smashing against the cloud, thus kindling the flame. Early meteorological theories generally considered that there was a fire-like substance in the atmosphere. Anaximander defined wind as a flowing of air, but this was not generally accepted for centuries.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-13) A theory to explain summer hail was first proposed by [Anaxagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaxagoras "Anaxagoras"). He observed that air temperature decreased with increasing height and that clouds contain moisture. He also noted that heat caused objects to rise, and therefore the heat on a summer day would drive clouds to an altitude where the moisture would freeze.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-14)[Empedocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empedocles "Empedocles") theorized on the change of the seasons. He believed that fire and water opposed each other in the atmosphere, and when fire gained the upper hand, the result was summer, and when water did, it was winter. [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus") also wrote about the flooding of the Nile. He said that snow in northern parts of the world melted during the summer solstice. This would cause vapors to form clouds, which would cause storms when driven to the Nile by northerly winds, thus filling the lakes and the Nile.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-15)[Hippocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates "Hippocrates") inquired into the effect of weather on health. [Eudoxus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus "Eudoxus of Cnidus") claimed that bad weather followed four-year periods, according to Pliny.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-16)

### Aristotelian meteorology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Aristotelian meteorology")]

These early observations would form the basis for [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s _[Meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology\_(Aristotle) "Meteorology (Aristotle)")_, written in 350 BC.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-18) Aristotle is considered the founder of meteorology.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-19) One of the most impressive achievements described in the _Meteorology_ is the description of what is now known as the [hydrologic cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Cycle "Water Cycle"). His work would remain an authority on meteorology for nearly 2,000 years.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-Aristotle-20)

The treatise _[On the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On\_the\_Universe "On the Universe")_ (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC) noted:[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-1908DeMundo-21)

> If the flashing body is set on fire and rushes violently to the earth it is called a thunderbolt; if it be only half of fire, but violent also and massive, it is called a meteor; if it is entirely free from fire, it is called a smoking bolt. They are all called 'swooping bolts', because they swoop down upon the earth. Lightning is sometimes smoky, and is then called 'smouldering lightning'; sometimes it darts quickly along, and is then said to be 'vivid'; at other times it travels in crooked lines, and is called 'forked lightning'; when it swoops down upon some object it is called 'swooping lightning'.

After Aristotle, progress in meteorology stalled for a long time. [Theophrastus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus "Theophrastus") compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the _Book of Signs_, as well as _On Winds_. He gave hundreds of signs for weather phenomena for a period up to a year.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-22) His system was based on dividing the year by the setting and the rising of the Pleiad, halves into solstices and equinoxes, and the continuity of the weather for those periods. He also divided months into the new moon, fourth day, eighth day and full moon, in likelihood of a change in the weather occurring. The day was divided into sunrise, mid-morning, noon, mid-afternoon and sunset, with corresponding divisions of the night, with change being likely at one of these divisions.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-23) Applying the divisions and a principle of balance in the yearly weather, he came up with forecasts like that if a lot of rain falls in the winter, the spring is usually dry. Rules based on actions of animals are also present in his work, like that if a dog rolls on the ground, it is a sign of a storm. Shooting stars and the Moon were also considered significant. However, he made no attempt to explain these phenomena, referring only to the Aristotelian method.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-24) The work of Theophrastus remained a dominant influence in weather forecasting for nearly 2,000 years.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-25)

### Meteorology after Aristotle

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Meteorology after Aristotle")]

Meteorology continued to be studied and developed over the centuries, but it was not until the Renaissance in the 14th to 17th centuries that significant advancements were made in the field. Scientists such as Galileo and Descartes introduced new methods and ideas, leading to the scientific revolution in meteorology.

Speculation on the cause of the flooding of the Nile ended when [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes "Eratosthenes"), according to [Proclus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclus "Proclus"), stated that it was known that man had gone to the sources of the Nile and observed the rains, although interest in its implications continued.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-26)

During the era of [Roman Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece_in_the_Roman_era "Greece in the Roman era") and Europe, scientific interest in meteorology waned. In the 1st century BC, most natural philosophers claimed that the clouds and winds extended up to 111 miles, but [Posidonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonius "Posidonius") thought that they reached up to five miles, after which the air is clear, liquid and luminous. He closely followed Aristotle's theories. By the end of the second century BC, the center of science shifted from Athens to [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Alexandria#Roman_era "History of Alexandria"), home to the ancient [Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria "Library of Alexandria"). In the 2nd century AD, [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy")'s [Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest") dealt with meteorology, because it was considered a subset of astronomy. He gave several astrological weather predictions.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-27) He constructed a map of the world divided into climatic zones by their illumination, in which the length of the Summer solstice increased by half an hour per zone between the equator and the Arctic.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-28) Ptolemy wrote on the [atmospheric refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction "Atmospheric refraction") of light in the context of astronomical observations.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-29)

In 25 AD, [Pomponius Mela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomponius_Mela "Pomponius Mela"), a Roman geographer, formalized the climatic zone system.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-30) In 63–64 AD, [Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger "Seneca the Younger") wrote _[Naturales quaestiones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturales\_quaestiones "Naturales quaestiones")_. It was a compilation and synthesis of ancient Greek theories. However, theology was of foremost importance to Seneca, and he believed that phenomena such as lightning were tied to fate.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-31) The second book (chapter) of [Pliny the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder "Pliny the Elder")'s _[Natural History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\_History\_(Pliny) "Natural History (Pliny)")_ covers meteorology. He states that more than twenty ancient Greek authors studied meteorology. He did not make any personal contributions, and the value of his work is in preserving earlier speculation, much like Seneca's work.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-32)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Golden_Gate_Bridge_as_seen_at_twilight_from_Baker_Beach.jpg/250px-Golden_Gate_Bridge_as_seen_at_twilight_from_Baker_Beach.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Golden_Gate_Bridge_as_seen_at_twilight_from_Baker_Beach.jpg)

Twilight at [Baker Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Beach "Baker Beach")

From 400 to 1100, scientific learning in Europe was preserved by the clergy. [Isidore of Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville "Isidore of Seville") devoted a considerable attention to meteorology in _[Etymologiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymologiae "Etymologiae")_, _De ordine creaturum_ and _De natura rerum_. [Bede the Venerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede "Bede") was the first Englishman to write about the weather in _[De natura rerum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_natura\_rerum\_(Bede) "De natura rerum (Bede)")_ in 703. The work was a summary of then extant classical sources. However, Aristotle's works were largely lost until the 12th century, including _Meteorologica_. Isidore and Bede were scientifically minded, but [they adhered to the letter of Scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_religion_and_science#Middle_Ages_and_Renaissance "Relationship between religion and science").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-33)

[Islamic civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age") translated many ancient works into Arabic which were [transmitted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_of_the_Greek_Classics "Transmission of the Greek Classics") and translated in western Europe to Latin.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-34)

In the 9th century, [Al-Dinawari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Dinawari "Al-Dinawari") wrote the _Kitab al-Nabat_ (Book of Plants), in which he deals with the application of meteorology to [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture") during the [Arab Agricultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Agricultural_Revolution "Arab Agricultural Revolution"). He describes the meteorological character of the sky, the [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") and [constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation "Constellation"), the [sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") and [moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), the [lunar phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase "Lunar phase") indicating [seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season") and rain, the _anwa_ ([heavenly bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") of rain), and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-Fahd-815-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-36)

In 1021, [Alhazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen "Alhazen") showed that atmospheric refraction is also responsible for [twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight "Twilight") in _[Opticae thesaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")_; he estimated that twilight begins when the sun is 19 degrees below the [horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon "Horizon"), and also used a geometric determination based on this to estimate the maximum possible height of the [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") as 52,000 _passim_ (about 49 miles, or 79 km).[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-37)

[Adelard of Bath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelard_of_Bath "Adelard of Bath") was one of the early translators of the classics. He also discussed meteorological topics in his _Quaestiones naturales_. He thought dense air produced propulsion in the form of wind. He explained thunder by saying that it was due to ice colliding in clouds, and in Summer it melted. In the 13th century, Aristotelian theories reestablished dominance in meteorology. For the next four centuries, meteorological work by and large was mostly [commentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentaries_on_Aristotle "Commentaries on Aristotle"). It has been estimated over 156 commentaries on the _Meteorologica_ were written before 1650.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-38)

Experimental evidence was less important than appeal to the classics and authority in medieval thought. In the 13th century, [Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon "Roger Bacon") advocated experimentation and the mathematical approach. In his _[Opus majus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus\_Majus "Opus Majus")_, he followed Aristotle's theory on the atmosphere being composed of water, air, and fire, supplemented by optics and geometric proofs. He noted that Ptolemy's climatic zones had to be adjusted for [topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography "Topography").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-39)

[Albertus Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_Magnus "Albertus Magnus") was the first to propose that each drop of falling rain had the form of a small sphere, and that this form meant that the rainbow was produced by light interacting with each raindrop.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-40)[Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon "Roger Bacon") was the first to calculate the angular size of the rainbow. He stated that a rainbow summit cannot appear higher than 42 degrees above the horizon.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-41)

In the late 13th century and early 14th century, [Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kam%C4%81l_al-D%C4%ABn_al-F%C4%81ris%C4%AB "Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī") and [Theodoric of Freiberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoric_of_Freiberg "Theodoric of Freiberg") were the first to give the correct explanations for the primary [rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow "Rainbow") phenomenon. Theodoric went further and also explained the secondary rainbow.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-42)

By the middle of the 16th century, meteorology had developed along two lines: theoretical science based on _Meteorologica_, and astrological weather forecasting. The pseudoscientific prediction by natural signs became popular and enjoyed protection of the church and princes. This was supported by scientists like [Regiomontanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiomontanus "Regiomontanus"), [Leonard Digges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Digges_(scientist) "Leonard Digges (scientist)"), and [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler"). However, there were skeptics. In the 14th century, [Nicole Oresme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme "Nicole Oresme") believed that weather forecasting was possible, but that the rules for it were unknown at the time. Astrological influence in meteorology persisted until the 18th century.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-43)

[Gerolamo Cardano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano "Gerolamo Cardano")'s _De Subilitate_ (1550) was the first work to challenge fundamental aspects of Aristotelian theory. Cardano maintained that there were only three basic elements- earth, air, and water. He discounted fire because it needed material to spread and produced nothing. Cardano thought there were two kinds of air: free air and enclosed air. The former destroyed inanimate things and preserved animate things, while the latter had the opposite effect.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-44)

[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes")'s _[Discourse on the Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse\_on\_the\_Method "Discourse on the Method")_ (1637) typifies the beginning of the [scientific revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution") in meteorology. His scientific method had four principles: to never accept anything unless one clearly knew it to be true; to divide every difficult problem into small problems to tackle; to proceed from the simple to the complex, always seeking relationships; to be as complete and thorough as possible with no prejudice.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-45)

In the appendix _Les Meteores_, he applied these principles to meteorology. He discussed terrestrial bodies and vapors which arise from them, proceeding to explain the formation of clouds from drops of water, and winds, clouds then dissolving into rain, hail and snow. He also discussed the effects of light on the rainbow. Descartes hypothesized that all bodies were composed of [small particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism#Atomist_renaissance "Atomism") of different shapes and interwovenness. All of his theories were based on this hypothesis. He explained the rain as caused by clouds becoming too large for the air to hold, and that clouds became snow if the air was not warm enough to melt them, or hail if they met colder wind. Like his predecessors, Descartes's method was deductive, as [meteorological instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorological_instrumentation "Meteorological instrumentation") were not developed and extensively used yet. He introduced the [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") to meteorology and stressed the importance of mathematics in natural science. His work established meteorology as a legitimate branch of physics.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-46)

In the 18th century, the invention of the thermometer and barometer allowed for more accurate measurements of temperature and pressure, leading to a better understanding of atmospheric processes. This century also saw the birth of the first meteorological society, the Societas Meteorologica Palatina in 1780.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-B%C3%B6rngen-47)

In the 19th century, advances in technology such as the telegraph and photography led to the creation of weather observing networks and the ability to track storms. Additionally, scientists began to use mathematical models to make predictions about the weather. The 20th century saw the development of radar and satellite technology, which greatly improved the ability to observe and track weather systems. In addition, meteorologists and atmospheric scientists started to create the first weather forecasts and temperature predictions.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-48)

In the 20th and 21st centuries, with the advent of computer models and big data, meteorology has become increasingly dependent on numerical methods and computer simulations. This has greatly improved weather forecasting and climate predictions. Additionally, meteorology has expanded to include other areas such as air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and climatology. The advancement in observational, theoretical and computational technologies has enabled ever more accurate weather predictions and understanding of weather pattern and air pollution. In current time, with the advancement in weather forecasting and satellite technology, meteorology has become an integral part of everyday life, and is used for many purposes such as aviation, agriculture, and disaster management.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In 1441, [King Sejong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_the_Great_of_Joseon "Sejong the Great of Joseon")'s son, Prince Munjong of Korea, invented the first standardized [rain gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_gauge "Rain gauge").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-49) These were sent throughout the [Joseon dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon_dynasty "Joseon dynasty") of [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea "Korea") as an official tool to assess land taxes based upon a farmer's potential harvest. In 1450, [Leone Battista Alberti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leone_Battista_Alberti "Leone Battista Alberti") developed a swinging-plate [anemometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemometer "Anemometer"), and was known as the first _anemometer_.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-Jacobson-50) In 1607, [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") constructed a [thermoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_thermometer "Galileo thermometer"). In 1611, [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") wrote the first scientific treatise on snow crystals: "Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow)".[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-51) In 1643, [Evangelista Torricelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelista_Torricelli "Evangelista Torricelli") invented the [mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element) "Mercury (element)")[barometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer "Barometer").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-Jacobson-50) In 1662, Sir [Christopher Wren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren "Christopher Wren") invented the mechanical, self-emptying, tipping bucket rain gauge. In 1714, [Gabriel Fahrenheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Fahrenheit "Gabriel Fahrenheit") created a reliable scale for measuring temperature with a mercury-type [thermometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer "Thermometer").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-52) In 1742, [Anders Celsius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Celsius "Anders Celsius"), a Swedish astronomer, proposed the "centigrade" temperature scale, the predecessor of the current [Celsius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius "Celsius") scale.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-53) In 1783, the first hair [hygrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygrometer "Hygrometer") was demonstrated by [Horace-Bénédict de Saussure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace-B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dict_de_Saussure "Horace-Bénédict de Saussure"). In 1802–1803, [Luke Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Howard_(meteorologist) "Luke Howard (meteorologist)") wrote _On the Modification of Clouds_, in which he assigns [cloud types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cloud_types "List of cloud types") Latin names.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-54) In 1806, [Francis Beaufort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Beaufort "Francis Beaufort") introduced his [system for classifying wind speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale "Beaufort scale").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-55) Near the end of the 19th century the first [cloud atlases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_atlas "Cloud atlas") were published, including the _[International Cloud Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_Cloud\_Atlas "International Cloud Atlas")_, which has remained in print ever since. The April 1960 launch of the first successful [weather satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_satellite "Weather satellite"), [TIROS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIROS-1 "TIROS-1"), marked the beginning of the age where weather information became available globally.

### Atmospheric composition research

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Atmospheric composition research")]

In 1648, [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal "Blaise Pascal") rediscovered that [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure") decreases with height, and deduced that there is a vacuum above the atmosphere.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-56) In 1738, [Daniel Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli "Daniel Bernoulli") published _Hydrodynamics_, initiating the [kinetic theory of gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases "Kinetic theory of gases") and established the basic laws for the theory of gases.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-57) In 1761, [Joseph Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Black "Joseph Black") discovered that ice absorbs heat without changing its temperature when melting. In 1772, Black's student [Daniel Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Rutherford "Daniel Rutherford") discovered [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen"), which he called _phlogisticated air_, and together they developed the [phlogiston theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory "Phlogiston theory").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-58) In 1777, [Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier "Antoine Lavoisier") discovered [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") and developed an explanation for combustion.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-59) In 1783, in Lavoisier's essay "Reflexions sur le phlogistique",[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-60) he deprecates the phlogiston theory and proposes a [caloric theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory "Caloric theory").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-61)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-62) In 1804, [John Leslie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Leslie_(physicist) "John Leslie (physicist)") observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation "Black-body radiation"). In 1808, [John Dalton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton "John Dalton") defended caloric theory in _A New System of Chemistry_ and described how it combines with matter, especially gases; he proposed that the [heat capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity "Heat capacity") of gases varies inversely with [atomic weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_weight "Atomic weight"). In 1824, [Sadi Carnot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_L%C3%A9onard_Sadi_Carnot "Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot") analyzed the efficiency of [steam engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine") using caloric theory; he developed the notion of a [reversible process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_process_(thermodynamics) "Reversible process (thermodynamics)") and, in postulating that no such thing exists in nature, laid the foundation for the [second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics "Second law of thermodynamics"). In 1716, [Edmond Halley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley "Edmond Halley") suggested that [aurorae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora "Aurora") are caused by "magnetic effluvia" moving along the [Earth's magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field") lines.

### Research into cyclones and air flow

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Research into cyclones and air flow")]

General circulation of the Earth's atmosphere: The westerlies and trade winds are part of the Earth's atmospheric circulation.

In 1494, [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") experienced a tropical cyclone, which led to the first written European account of a hurricane.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-63) In 1686, [Edmond Halley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley "Edmond Halley") presented a systematic study of the [trade winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_winds "Trade winds") and [monsoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon "Monsoon") and identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-64) In 1735, an _ideal_ explanation of [global circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation "Atmospheric circulation") through study of the [trade winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_winds "Trade winds") was written by [George Hadley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hadley "George Hadley").[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-65) In 1743, when [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin") was prevented from seeing a lunar eclipse by a [hurricane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone"), he decided that cyclones move in a contrary manner to the winds at their periphery.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-Dorst-66) Understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the Earth affects airflow was partial at first. Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis published a paper in 1835 on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts, such as waterwheels.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-corps-67) In 1856, [William Ferrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ferrel "William Ferrel") proposed the existence of a [circulation cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrel_cell "Ferrel cell") in the mid-latitudes, and the air within deflected by the Coriolis force resulting in the prevailing westerly winds.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-68) Late in the 19th century, the motion of air masses along [isobars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isobar_(meteorology) "Isobar (meteorology)") was understood to be the result of the large-scale interaction of the [pressure gradient force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient_force "Pressure gradient force") and the deflecting force. By 1912, this deflecting force was named the Coriolis effect.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-69) Just after World War I, a group of meteorologists in Norway led by [Vilhelm Bjerknes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilhelm_Bjerknes "Vilhelm Bjerknes") developed the [Norwegian cyclone model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_cyclone_model "Norwegian cyclone model") that explains the generation, intensification and ultimate decay (the life cycle) of [mid-latitude cyclones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone "Extratropical cyclone"), and introduced the idea of [fronts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_(meteorology) "Front (meteorology)"), that is, sharply defined boundaries between [air masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass "Air mass").[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-NorCycMod-70) The group included [Carl-Gustaf Rossby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl-Gustaf_Rossby "Carl-Gustaf Rossby") (who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics")), [Tor Bergeron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_Bergeron "Tor Bergeron") (who first determined how rain forms) and [Jacob Bjerknes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bjerknes "Jacob Bjerknes").

### Observation networks and weather forecasting

This "Hyetographic or Rain Map of the World" was first published 1848 by [Alexander Keith Johnston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Keith_Johnston_(1804%E2%80%931871) "Alexander Keith Johnston (1804–1871)").

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/Hyetographic_or_Rain_Map_of_Europe_1848_Alexander_Keith_Johnston.png/500px-Hyetographic_or_Rain_Map_of_Europe_1848_Alexander_Keith_Johnston.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hyetographic_or_Rain_Map_of_Europe_1848_Alexander_Keith_Johnston.png)

This "Hyetographic or Rain Map of Europe" was also published in 1848 as part of "The Physical Atlas".

In the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century a range of meteorological instruments were invented – the [thermometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer "Thermometer"), [barometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer "Barometer"), [hydrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrometer "Hydrometer"), as well as wind and rain gauges. In the 1650s natural philosophers started using these instruments to systematically record weather observations. Scientific academies established weather diaries and organised observational networks.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-ModScience-71) In 1654, [Ferdinando II de Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinando_II_de_Medici "Ferdinando II de Medici") established the first _weather observing_ network, that consisted of meteorological stations in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence"), [Cutigliano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutigliano "Cutigliano"), [Vallombrosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallombrosa "Vallombrosa"), [Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna "Bologna"), [Parma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parma "Parma"), [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan "Milan"), [Innsbruck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innsbruck "Innsbruck"), [Osnabrück](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osnabr%C3%BCck "Osnabrück"), Paris and [Warsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw "Warsaw"). The collected data were sent to Florence at regular time intervals.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-72) In the 1660s [Robert Hooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke "Robert Hooke") of the [Royal Society of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_of_London "Royal Society of London") sponsored networks of weather observers. [Hippocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates "Hippocrates")'s treatise _Airs, Waters, and Places_ had linked weather to disease. Thus early meteorologists attempted to correlate weather patterns with epidemic outbreaks, and the climate with public health.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-ModScience-71)

During the [Age of Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") meteorology tried to rationalise traditional weather lore, including astrological meteorology. But there were also attempts to establish a theoretical understanding of weather phenomena. [Edmond Halley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley "Edmond Halley") and [George Hadley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hadley "George Hadley") tried to explain [trade winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_winds "Trade winds"). They reasoned that the rising mass of heated equator air is replaced by an inflow of cooler air from high latitudes. A flow of warm air at high altitude from equator to poles in turn established an early picture of circulation. Frustration with the lack of discipline among weather observers, and the poor quality of the instruments, led the early modern [nation states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_states "Nation states") to organise large observation networks. Thus, by the end of the 18th century, meteorologists had access to large quantities of reliable weather data.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-ModScience-71) In 1832, an electromagnetic telegraph was created by [Baron Schilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Schilling "Baron Schilling").[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-73) The arrival of the [electrical telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_telegraph "Electrical telegraph") in 1837 afforded, for the first time, a practical method for quickly gathering [surface weather observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_weather_observation "Surface weather observation") from a wide area.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-74)

This data could be used to produce maps of the state of the atmosphere for a region near the Earth's surface and to study how these states evolved through time. To make frequent weather forecasts based on these data required a reliable network of observations, but it was not until 1849 that the [Smithsonian Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution "Smithsonian Institution") began to establish an observation network across the United States under the leadership of [Joseph Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry "Joseph Henry").[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-75) Similar observation networks were established in Europe at this time. The Reverend [William Clement Ley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Clement_Ley "William Clement Ley") was key in understanding of cirrus clouds and early understandings of [jet streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream "Jet stream").[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-76)[Charles Kenneth Mackinnon Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Kenneth_Mackinnon_Douglas&action=edit&redlink=1 "Charles Kenneth Mackinnon Douglas (page does not exist)"), known as 'CKM' Douglas, read Ley's papers after his death and carried on the early study of weather systems.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-77) 19th-century researchers in meteorology were drawn from military or medical backgrounds, rather than trained as dedicated scientists.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-78) In 1854, the United Kingdom government appointed [Robert FitzRoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_FitzRoy "Robert FitzRoy") to the new office of _Meteorological Statist to the Board of Trade_ with the task of gathering weather observations at sea. FitzRoy's office became the [United Kingdom Meteorological Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office "Met Office") in 1854, the second oldest national meteorological service in the world (the [Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Institution_for_Meteorology_and_Geodynamics "Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics") (ZAMG) in Austria was founded in 1851 and is the oldest weather service in the world). The first daily weather forecasts made by FitzRoy's Office were published in _[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Times "The Times")_ newspaper in 1860. The following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at principal ports when a gale was expected.

FitzRoy coined the term "weather forecast" and tried to separate scientific approaches from prophetic ones.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-79)

Over the next 50 years, many countries established national meteorological services. The [India Meteorological Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Meteorological_Department "India Meteorological Department") (1875) was established to follow tropical cyclone and [monsoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon "Monsoon").[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-80) The Finnish Meteorological Central Office (1881) was formed from part of Magnetic Observatory of [Helsinki University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_University "Helsinki University").[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-81) Japan's Tokyo Meteorological Observatory, the forerunner of the [Japan Meteorological Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency "Japan Meteorological Agency"), began constructing surface weather maps in 1883.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-82) The [United States Weather Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Weather_Bureau "United States Weather Bureau") (1890) was established under the [United States Department of Agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture "United States Department of Agriculture"). The [Australian Bureau of Meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology "Bureau of Meteorology") (1906) was established by a Meteorology Act to unify existing state meteorological services.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-ABC-83)[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-84)

### Numerical weather prediction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Numerical weather prediction")]

A meteorologist at the console of the IBM 7090 in the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit, c. 1965

In 1904, Norwegian scientist [Vilhelm Bjerknes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilhelm_Bjerknes "Vilhelm Bjerknes") first argued in his paper _Weather Forecasting as a Problem in Mechanics and Physics_ that it should be possible to forecast weather from calculations based upon [natural laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law").[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-85)[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-86)

It was not until later in the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern [numerical weather prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction "Numerical weather prediction"). In 1922, [Lewis Fry Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Fry_Richardson "Lewis Fry Richardson") published "Weather Prediction By Numerical Process",[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-87) after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations that govern atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a numerical calculation scheme that could be devised to allow predictions. Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to complete without electronic computers, and the size of the grid and time steps used in the calculations led to unrealistic results. Though numerical analysis later found that this was due to [numerical instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_instability "Numerical instability").

Starting in the 1950s, [numerical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number") forecasts with computers became feasible.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-88) The first [weather forecasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecast "Weather forecast") derived this way used [barotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barotropic "Barotropic") (single-vertical-level) models, and could successfully predict the large-scale movement of midlatitude [Rossby waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossby_wave "Rossby wave"), that is, the pattern of [atmospheric lows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area "Low-pressure area") and [highs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pressure_area "High-pressure area").[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-89) In 1959, the UK Meteorological Office received its first computer, a [Ferranti Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mercury "Ferranti Mercury").[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-90)

In the 1960s, the [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") nature of the atmosphere was first observed and mathematically described by [Edward Lorenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lorenz "Edward Lorenz"), founding the field of [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory").[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-91) These advances have led to the current use of [ensemble forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_forecasting "Ensemble forecasting") in most major forecasting centers, to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-HPCens-92) Mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the Earth ([climate models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_model "Climate model")), have been developed that have a resolution today that are as coarse as the older weather prediction models. These climate models are used to investigate long-term [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate") shifts, such as what effects might be caused by human emission of [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas "Greenhouse gas").

**Meteorologists** are scientists who study and work in the field of meteorology.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-93) The American Meteorological Society publishes and continually updates an authoritative electronic _Meteorology Glossary_.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-94) Meteorologists work in [government agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency "Government agency"), private consulting and [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research "Research") services, industrial enterprises, utilities, radio and [television stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_stations "Television stations"), and in [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education"). In the United States, meteorologists held about 10,000 jobs in 2018.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-BLS-95)

Although weather forecasts and warnings are the best known products of meteorologists for the public, [weather presenters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_presenter "Weather presenter") on radio and television are not necessarily professional meteorologists. They are most often [reporters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters "Reporters") with little formal meteorological training, using unregulated titles such as _weather specialist_ or _weatherman_. The [American Meteorological Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Meteorological_Society "American Meteorological Society") and [National Weather Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Association "National Weather Association") issue "Seals of Approval" to weather broadcasters who meet certain requirements but this is not mandatory to be hired by the media.

Each science has its own unique sets of laboratory equipment. In the atmosphere, there are many things or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured. Rain, which can be observed, or seen anywhere and anytime was one of the first atmospheric qualities measured historically. Also, two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity. Neither of these can be seen but can be felt. The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the [rain gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_gauge "Rain gauge"), the anemometer, and the hygrometer. Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables. Many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable. Even [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air.

Sets of surface measurements are important data to meteorologists. They give a snapshot of a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a [weather station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_station "Weather station"), a ship or a [weather buoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_buoy "Weather buoy"). The measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables. Usually, temperature, [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure"), wind measurements, and [humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity "Humidity") are the variables that are measured by a thermometer, barometer, anemometer, and hygrometer, respectively.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-96) Professional stations may also include air quality sensors ([carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide"), [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"), [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane"), [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone "Ozone"), [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust "Dust"), and [smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke "Smoke")), [ceilometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceilometer "Ceilometer") (cloud ceiling), falling precipitation sensor, [flood sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_sensor "Level sensor"), [lightning sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"), [microphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone "Microphone") ([explosions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosion "Explosion"), [sonic booms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_boom "Sonic boom"), [thunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder "Thunder")), [pyranometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyranometer "Pyranometer")/[pyrheliometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrheliometer "Pyrheliometer")/[spectroradiometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroradiometer "Spectroradiometer") (IR/Vis/UV [photodiodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodiodes "Photodiodes")), [rain gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_gauge "Rain gauge")/[snow gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_gauge "Snow gauge"), [scintillation counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillation_counter "Scintillation counter") ([background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_radiation "Background radiation"), [fallout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout "Fallout"), [radon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon "Radon")), [seismometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer "Seismometer") ([earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake "Earthquake") and tremors), [transmissometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissometer "Transmissometer") (visibility), and a [GPS clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_clock "GPS clock") for [data logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_logging "Data logging"). Upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting. The most widely used technique is launches of [radiosondes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosonde "Radiosonde"). Supplementing the radiosondes a [network of aircraft collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Meteorological_Data_Relay "Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay") is organized by the [World Meteorological Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization "World Meteorological Organization").

[Remote sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing "Remote sensing"), as used in meteorology, is the concept of collecting data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information. The common types of remote sensing are [Radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar"), [Lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar "Lidar"), and [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") (or [photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry "Photogrammetry")). Each collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and, usually, stores the data where the instrument is located. Radar and Lidar are not passive because both use [EM radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EM_radiation "EM radiation") to illuminate a specific portion of the atmosphere.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-97) Weather satellites along with more general-purpose Earth-observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to [El Niño](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o "El Niño").

The study of the atmosphere can be divided into distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales. At one extreme of this scale is climatology. In the timescales of hours to days, meteorology separates into micro-, meso-, and synoptic scale meteorology. Respectively, the [geospatial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial "Geospatial") size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale.

Other subclassifications are used to describe the unique, local, or broad effects within those subclasses.

**Scales of Atmospheric Motion Systems**[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-intro-to-dynamic-meteorology-98)| Type of motion | Horizontal scale (meter) |
| --- | --- |
| Molecular mean free path | 10−7 |
| Minute turbulent eddies | 10−2 – 10−1 |
| Small eddies | 10−1 – 1 |
| Dust devils | 1–10 |
| Gusts | 10 – 10 2 |
| Tornadoes | 10 2 |
| Cumulonimbus clouds | 10 3 |
| Fronts, squall lines | 10 4 – 10 5 |
| Hurricanes | 10 5 |
| Synoptic Cyclones | 10 6 |
| Planetary waves | 10 7 |

Microscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena on a scale of about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) or less. Individual thunderstorms, clouds, and local turbulence caused by buildings and other obstacles (such as individual hills) are modeled on this scale.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-99)[Misoscale meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoscale_meteorology "Misoscale meteorology") is an informal subdivision.

Mesoscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from 1 km to 1000 km and a vertical scale that starts at the Earth's surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer, troposphere, [tropopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause "Tropopause"), and the lower section of the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere"). The terms meso-alpha, meso-beta, and meso-gamma to classify the horizontal scales of atmospheric processes were introduced to the field of mesoscale meteorology by [Isidoro Orlanski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidoro_Orlanski "Isidoro Orlanski").[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-100) Mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to multiple weeks. The events typically of interest are [thunderstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm "Thunderstorm"), [squall lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squall_line "Squall line"), [fronts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_front "Weather front"), [precipitation bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbands "Rainbands") in [tropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone") and [extratropical cyclones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone "Extratropical cyclone"), and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and [sea and land breezes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_breeze "Sea breeze").[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-101)

[NOAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA "NOAA"): Synoptic scale weather analysis

Synoptic scale meteorology predicts atmospheric changes at scales up to 1000 km and 10 5 sec ~ (2.8 days), in time and space. At the synoptic scale, the [Coriolis acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_acceleration "Coriolis acceleration") acting on moving air masses (outside of the tropics) plays a dominant role in predictions. The phenomena typically described by [synoptic meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synoptic_meteorology "Synoptic meteorology") include events such as extratropical cyclones, baroclinic troughs and ridges, [frontal zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_front "Weather front"), and to some extent [jet streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream "Jet stream"). All of these are typically given on [weather maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_map "Weather map") for a specific time. The minimum horizontal scale of synoptic phenomena is limited to the spacing between [surface observation stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_station "Weather station").[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-102)

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Annual_mean_sea_surface_temperature_%28World_Ocean_Atlas_2009%29.png/500px-Annual_mean_sea_surface_temperature_%28World_Ocean_Atlas_2009%29.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Annual_mean_sea_surface_temperature_(World_Ocean_Atlas_2009).png)

Annual mean sea surface temperatures

Global scale meteorology is the study of weather patterns related to the transport of heat from the [tropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics "Tropics") to the [poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_pole "Geographical pole"). Very large scale oscillations are of importance at this scale. These oscillations have time periods typically on the order of months, such as the [Madden–Julian oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden%E2%80%93Julian_oscillation "Madden–Julian oscillation"), or years, such as the [El Niño–Southern Oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation "El Niño–Southern Oscillation") and the [Pacific decadal oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_decadal_oscillation "Pacific decadal oscillation"). Global scale meteorology pushes into the range of climatology. The traditional definition of climate is pushed into larger timescales and with the understanding of the longer time scale global oscillations, their effect on climate and weather disturbances can be included in the synoptic and mesoscale timescales predictions.

Numerical Weather Prediction is a main focus in understanding air–sea interaction, tropical meteorology, atmospheric predictability, and tropospheric/stratospheric processes.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-103) The [Naval Research Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Research_Laboratory "Naval Research Laboratory") in Monterey, California, developed a global atmospheric model called [Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Operational_Global_Atmospheric_Prediction_System "Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System") (NOGAPS). NOGAPS is run operationally at [Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Numerical_Meteorology_and_Oceanography_Center "Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center") for the United States Military. Many other global atmospheric models are run by national meteorological agencies.

Branches of meteorology
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Branches of meteorology")]

### Based on methodological approach

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Based on methodological approach")]

#### Physical meteorology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Physical meteorology")]

Physical meteorology studies the atmosphere's physical properties, processes, and phenomena. It covers the fundamental principles of atmospheric thermodynamics and energy transfer, including solar and terrestrial radiation (absorption, reflection, and scattering). Cloud physics is another key area of investigation, alongside the study of aerosols, precipitation formation, and atmospheric moist processes. The field further examines optical, electrical, and acoustical effects within the atmosphere. Near-surface processes like mixing, turbulence, and friction, and understanding their connection to the atmosphere's physical characteristics also fall within its scope.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-104)[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-105)[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-106)

#### Dynamic meteorology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Dynamic meteorology")]

Dynamic meteorology is the study of atmospheric motions and the physical laws that govern them, using principles drawn from [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"), [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") and [mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics")[motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion "Motion"). It aims to explain why the atmosphere moves and how its state evolves. Here, the fundamental analytical unit of atmospheric behavior is an _[air parcel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air\_parcel "Air parcel")_, defined as an infinitesimally small region in the fluid [continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(physics) "Continuum (physics)") of the atmosphere. This key conceptual tool allows for abstraction from the atmosphere's discrete molecular and chemical nature. Temperature, density, pressure, etc. are considered key physical quantities with unique values within this atmospheric continuum. These characterize the state of the atmosphere.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-intro-to-dynamic-meteorology-98)

#### Synoptic meteorology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Synoptic meteorology")]

Synoptic meteorology focuses on diagnosing the conditions of the atmosphere at a given moment across large regions. This branch involves the preparation of various weather maps displaying meteorological conditions observed simultaneously (hence the term "synoptic," meaning "viewed together"). Examples of such maps include upper-air charts, aerological diagrams, and satellite imagery of cloud movement. Through detailed analysis of these charts, meteorologists aim to understand large-scale wind and pressure systems, as well as the complex relationship between atmospheric circulation and the regional surface environment. The primary objective of the field is to predict atmospheric changes from these initial conditions, typically for a few hours to a few days ahead. The ultimate goal is to help produce regional or station-based forecasts.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-107)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-108)[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-109)

#### Boundary layer meteorology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Boundary layer meteorology")]

[Boundary layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_layer "Boundary layer") meteorology is the study of processes in the air layer directly above Earth's surface, known as the [atmospheric boundary layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundary_layer "Planetary boundary layer") (ABL). The effects of the surface– heating, cooling, and [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction")– cause [turbulent mixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence") within the air layer. Significant movement of [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensible_heat "Sensible heat"), [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), or [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") on time scales of less than a day are caused by turbulent motions.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-110) Boundary layer meteorology includes the study of all types of surface–atmosphere boundary, including ocean, lake, urban land and non-urban land for the study of meteorology.

### Weather forecasting

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Weather forecasting")]

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Day5pressureforecast.png/500px-Day5pressureforecast.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Day5pressureforecast.png)

Forecast of surface pressures five days into the future for the north Pacific, North America, and north Atlantic Ocean

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") at a future time and given location. Humans have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since at least the 19th century.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-111)[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-112) Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data") about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-113)

Once an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in [barometric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure"), current weather conditions, and sky condition,[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-114)[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-115)[forecast models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction "Numerical weather prediction") are now used to determine future conditions. Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, [teleconnections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleconnection "Teleconnection"), knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the _range_ of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-Klaus-116)[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-TBK-117)[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-118)

There are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-119) Forecasts based on temperature and [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology) "Precipitation (meteorology)") are important to agriculture,[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-120)[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-121)[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-122)[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-123) and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-124)[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-125)[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-126) On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow, and [wind chill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_chill "Wind chill"), forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.

### Aviation meteorology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Aviation meteorology")]

Aviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on [air traffic management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control "Air traffic control").[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-127) It is important for air crews to understand the implications of weather on their flight plan as well as their aircraft, as noted by the _[Aeronautical Information Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical\_Information\_Manual "Aeronautical Information Manual")_:[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-128)

> The effects of ice on aircraft are cumulative—thrust is reduced, drag increases, lift lessens, and weight increases. The results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance. In extreme cases, 2 to 3 inches of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes. It takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-129)

### Agricultural meteorology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Agricultural meteorology")]

Meteorologists, [soil scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_science "Soil science"), agricultural hydrologists, and [agronomists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agronomy "Agronomy") are people concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution, [crop yield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield "Crop yield"), water-use efficiency, [phenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenology "Phenology") of plant and animal development, and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems. Conversely, they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and weather.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-130)

[Hydrometeorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrometeorology "Hydrometeorology") is the branch of meteorology that deals with the [hydrologic cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrologic_cycle "Hydrologic cycle"), the water budget, and the rainfall statistics of [storms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm "Storm").[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-131) A hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating (quantitative) precipitation, heavy rain, heavy snow, and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding. Typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology, mesoscale and synoptic meteorology, and other geosciences.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-132)

The multidisciplinary nature of the branch can result in technical challenges, since tools and solutions from each of the individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently, be optimized for different hard- and software platforms and use different data formats. There are some initiatives – such as the DRIHM project[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-133) – that are trying to address this issue.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-134)

### Nuclear meteorology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Nuclear meteorology")]

Nuclear meteorology investigates the distribution of [radioactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive "Radioactive")[aerosols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol "Aerosol") and [gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas") in the atmosphere.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology#cite_note-135)

### Maritime meteorology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Maritime meteorology")]

Maritime meteorology deals with air and wave forecasts for ships operating at sea. Organizations such as the [Ocean Prediction Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Prediction_Center "Ocean Prediction Center"), Honolulu [National Weather Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service "National Weather Service") forecast office, United Kingdom [Met Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office "Met Office"), [KNMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Netherlands_Meteorological_Institute "Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute") and [JMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency "Japan Meteorological Agency") prepare high seas forecasts for the world's oceans.

### Military meteorology

Military meteorology is the research and application of meteorology for [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military "Military") purposes. In the United States, the [United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy")'s [Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander,_Naval_Meteorology_and_Oceanography_Command "Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command") oversees meteorological efforts for the Navy and [Marine Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps "United States Marine Corps") while the [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force")'s [Air Force Weather Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Weather_Agency "Air Force Weather Agency") is responsible for the Air Force and [Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "United States Army").

### Environmental meteorology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteorology&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Environmental meteorology")]

Environmental meteorology mainly analyzes industrial pollution dispersion physically and chemically based on meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind, and various weather conditions.

Meteorology applications in renewable energy includes basic research, "exploration", and potential mapping of wind power and solar radiation for wind and solar energy.
