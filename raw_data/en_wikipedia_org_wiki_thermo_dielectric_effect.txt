This interesting effect was discovered by Joaquim da Costa Ribeiro in 1944. The Brazilian physicist observed that solidification and melting of many dielectrics are accompanied by charge separation. A thermo-dielectric effect was demonstrated with carnauba wax , naphthalene and paraffin .

Charge separation in ice was also expected. This effect was observed during water freezing period, electrical storm effects can be caused by this strange phenomenon . Effect was measured by many researches - Bernhard Gross , Armando Dias Tavares , Sergio Mascarenhas etc.

César Lattes (co-discoverer of the pion ) supposed that this was the only effect ever to be discovered entirely in Brazil .
