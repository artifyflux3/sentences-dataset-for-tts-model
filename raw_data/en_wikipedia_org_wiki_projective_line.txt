The statement and the proof of many theorems of geometry are simplified by the resulting elimination of special cases; for example, two distinct projective lines in a projective plane meet in exactly one point (there is no "parallel" case).

There are many equivalent ways to formally define a projective line; one of the most common is to define a projective line over a field K , commonly denoted P 1 ( K ), as the set of one-dimensional subspaces of a two-dimensional K - vector space . This definition is a special instance of the general definition of a projective space .

The projective line over the reals is a manifold ; see Real projective line for details.

Homogeneous coordinates [ edit ] An arbitrary point in the projective line P 1 ( K ) may be represented by an equivalence class of homogeneous coordinates , which take the form of a pair [ x 1 : x 2 ] {\displaystyle [x_{1}:x_{2}]} of elements of K that are not both zero. Two such pairs are equivalent if they differ by an overall nonzero factor λ : [ x 1 : x 2 ] ∼ ∼ [ λ λ x 1 : λ λ x 2 ] .

{\displaystyle [x_{1}:x_{2}]\sim [\lambda x_{1}:\lambda x_{2}].} Line extended by a point at infinity [ edit ] The projective line may be identified with the line K extended by a point at infinity . More precisely,
the line K may be identified with the subset of P 1 ( K ) given by { [ x : 1 ] ∈ ∈ P 1 ( K ) ∣ ∣ x ∈ ∈ K } .

{\displaystyle \left\{[x:1]\in \mathbf {P} ^{1}(K)\mid x\in K\right\}.} This subset covers all points in P 1 ( K ) except one, which is called the point at infinity : ∞ ∞ = [ 1 : 0 ] .

{\displaystyle \infty =[1:0].} This allows to extend the arithmetic on K to P 1 ( K ) by the formulas 1 0 = ∞ ∞ , 1 ∞ ∞ = 0 , {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{0}}=\infty ,\qquad {\frac {1}{\infty }}=0,} x ⋅ ⋅ ∞ ∞ = ∞ ∞ if x ≠ 0 {\displaystyle x\cdot \infty =\infty \quad {\text{if}}\quad x\not =0} x + ∞ ∞ = ∞ ∞ if x ≠ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle x+\infty =\infty \quad {\text{if}}\quad x\not =\infty } Translating this arithmetic in terms of homogeneous coordinates gives, when [0 : 0] does not occur: [ x 1 : x 2 ] + [ y 1 : y 2 ] = [ ( x 1 y 2 + y 1 x 2 ) : x 2 y 2 ] , {\displaystyle [x_{1}:x_{2}]+[y_{1}:y_{2}]=[(x_{1}y_{2}+y_{1}x_{2}):x_{2}y_{2}],} [ x 1 : x 2 ] ⋅ ⋅ [ y 1 : y 2 ] = [ x 1 y 1 : x 2 y 2 ] , {\displaystyle [x_{1}:x_{2}]\cdot [y_{1}:y_{2}]=[x_{1}y_{1}:x_{2}y_{2}],} [ x 1 : x 2 ] − − 1 = [ x 2 : x 1 ] .

{\displaystyle [x_{1}:x_{2}]^{-1}=[x_{2}:x_{1}].} Examples [ edit ] Real projective line [ edit ] Main article: Real projective line The projective line over the real numbers is called the real projective line .  It may also be thought of as the line K together with an idealised point at infinity ∞; the point connects to both ends of K creating a closed loop or topological circle.

An example is obtained by projecting points in R 2 onto the unit circle and then identifying diametrically opposite points. In terms of group theory we can take the quotient by the subgroup {1, −1} under multiplication.

Compare the extended real number line , which distinguishes ∞ and −∞.

Complex projective line: the Riemann sphere [ edit ] Adding a point at infinity to the complex plane results in a space that is topologically a sphere . Hence the complex projective line is also known as the Riemann sphere (or sometimes the Gauss sphere ). It is in constant use in complex analysis , algebraic geometry and complex manifold theory, as the simplest example of a compact Riemann surface .

For a finite field [ edit ] The projective line over a finite field F q of q elements has q + 1 points. In all other respects it is no different from projective lines defined over other types of fields. In the terms of homogeneous coordinates [ x : y ] , q of these points have the form: [ a : 1] for each a in F q , and the remaining point at infinity may be represented as [1 : 0] .

Symmetry group [ edit ] Quite generally, the group of homographies with coefficients in K acts on the projective line P 1 ( K ). This group action is transitive , so that P 1 ( K ) is a homogeneous space for the group, often written PGL 2 ( K ) to emphasise the projective nature of these transformations.

Transitivity says that there exists a homography that will transform any point Q to any other point R . The point at infinity on P 1 ( K ) is therefore an artifact of choice of coordinates: homogeneous coordinates [ X : Y ] ∼ ∼ [ λ λ X : λ λ Y ] {\displaystyle [X:Y]\sim [\lambda X:\lambda Y]} express a one-dimensional subspace by a single non-zero point ( X , Y ) lying in it, but the symmetries of the projective line can move the point ∞ = [1 : 0] to any other, and it is in no way distinguished.

Much more is true, in that some transformation can take any given distinct points Q i for i = 1, 2, 3 to any other 3-tuple R i of distinct points ( triple transitivity ). This amount of specification 'uses up' the three dimensions of PGL 2 ( K ); in other words, the group action is sharply 3-transitive . The computational aspect of this is the cross-ratio . Indeed, a generalized converse is true: a sharply 3-transitive group action is always (isomorphic to) a generalized form of a PGL 2 ( K ) action on a projective line, replacing "field" by "KT-field" (generalizing the inverse to a weaker kind of involution), and "PGL" by a corresponding generalization of projective linear maps.

[ 1 ] As algebraic curve [ edit ] The projective line is a fundamental example of an algebraic curve . From the point of view of algebraic geometry, P 1 ( K ) is a non-singular curve of genus 0. If K is algebraically closed , it is the unique such curve over K , up to rational equivalence . In general a (non-singular) curve of genus 0 is rationally equivalent over K to a conic C , which is itself birationally equivalent to projective line if and only if C has a point defined over K ; geometrically such a point P can be used as origin to make explicit the birational equivalence.

The function field of the projective line is the field K ( T ) of rational functions over K , in a single indeterminate T . The field automorphisms of K ( T ) over K are precisely  the group PGL 2 ( K ) discussed above.

Any function field K ( V ) of an algebraic variety V over K , other than a single point, has a subfield isomorphic with K ( T ). From the point of view of birational geometry , this means that there will be a rational map from V to P 1 ( K ), that is not constant. The image will omit only finitely many points of P 1 ( K ), and the inverse image of a typical point P will be of dimension dim V − 1 . This is the beginning of methods in algebraic geometry that are inductive on dimension. The rational maps play a role analogous to the meromorphic functions of complex analysis , and indeed in the case of compact Riemann surfaces the two concepts coincide.

If V is now taken to be of dimension 1, we get a picture of a typical algebraic curve C presented 'over' P 1 ( K ). Assuming C is non-singular (which is no loss of generality starting with K ( C )), it can be shown that such a rational map from C to P 1 ( K ) will in fact be everywhere defined. (That is not the case if there are singularities, since for example a double point where a curve crosses itself may give an indeterminate result after a rational map.) This gives a picture in which the main geometric feature is ramification .

Many curves, for example hyperelliptic curves , may be presented abstractly, as ramified covers of the projective line. According to the Riemann–Hurwitz formula , the genus then depends only on the type of ramification.

A rational curve is a curve that is birationally equivalent to a projective line (see rational variety ); its genus is 0. A rational normal curve in projective space P n is a rational curve that lies in no proper linear subspace; it is known that there is only one example (up to projective equivalence), [ 2 ] given parametrically in homogeneous coordinates as [1 : t : t 2 : ... : t n ].

See Twisted cubic for the first interesting case.
