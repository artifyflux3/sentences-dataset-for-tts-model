A part of an infinite sequence of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") (in blue), indexed by a natural number ![Image 2: {\textstyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cc6e1f880981346a604257ebcacdef24c0aca2d6). This sequence is neither increasing, decreasing, convergent, nor [Cauchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence "Cauchy sequence"). It is, however, bounded (by red dashed lines).

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **sequence** is an enumerated collection of [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") in which repetitions are allowed and [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory "Order theory") matters. Like a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)"), it contains [members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(mathematics) "Element (mathematics)") (also called _elements_, or _terms_). The number of elements (possibly [infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_number "Infinite number")) is called the _length_ of the sequence. Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and unlike a set, the order does matter. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") from [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") (the positions of elements in the sequence) to the elements at each position. The notion of a sequence can be generalized to an [indexed family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_family "Indexed family"), defined as a function from an _arbitrary_ index set.

For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter "M" first and "Y" last. This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence. Sequences can be _[finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite\_set "Finite set")_, as in these examples, or _[infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite\_set "Infinite set")_, such as the sequence of all [even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_and_odd_numbers "Even and odd numbers")[positive integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_integer "Positive integer") (2, 4, 6, ...).

The position of an element in a sequence is its _rank_ or _index_; it is the natural number for which the element is the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)"). The first element has index 0 or 1, depending on the context or a specific convention. In [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"), a sequence is often denoted by letters in the form of ![Image 3: {\displaystyle a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790f9209748c2dca7ed7b81932c37c02af1dbc31), ![Image 4: {\displaystyle b_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/28e2d72f6dd9375c8f1f59f1effd9b4e5492ac97) and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle c_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9b7e944bcb1be88e9a6a940638f2adce0ec4211a), where the subscript _n_ refers to the _n_ th element of the sequence; for example, the _n_ th element of the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence "Fibonacci sequence")_![Image 6: {\displaystyle F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57)_ is generally denoted as _![Image 7: {\displaystyle F\_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/76cdf519c21deec43f984815e57e15d2dd3575d7)_.

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), finite sequences are usually called _[strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String\_(computer\_science) "String (computer science)")_, _[words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word\_(formal\_language\_theory) "Word (formal language theory)")_ or _[lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_(computer\_science) "List (computer science)"),_ with the specific technical term chosen depending on the type of object the sequence enumerates and the different ways to represent the sequence in [computer memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory "Computer memory"). Infinite sequences are called _[streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream\_(computing) "Stream (computing)")_.

The empty sequence() is included in most notions of sequence. It may be excluded depending on the context.

Examples and notation
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sequence&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Examples and notation")]

A sequence can be thought of as a list of elements with a particular order.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-:0-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-2) Sequences are useful in a number of mathematical disciplines for studying [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)"), [spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)"), and other mathematical structures using the [convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#Limits_and_convergence) properties of sequences. In particular, sequences are the basis for [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics) "Series (mathematics)"), which are important in [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equations "Differential equations") and [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_(mathematics) "Analysis (mathematics)"). Sequences are also of interest in their own right, and can be studied as patterns or puzzles, such as in the study of [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number").

There are a number of ways to denote a sequence, some of which are more useful for specific types of sequences. One way to specify a sequence is to list all its elements. For example, the first four odd numbers form the sequence (1, 3, 5, 7). This notation is used for infinite sequences as well. For instance, the infinite sequence of positive odd integers is written as (1, 3, 5, 7, ...). Because notating sequences with [ellipsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis "Ellipsis") leads to ambiguity, listing is most useful for customary infinite sequences which can be easily recognized from their first few elements. Other ways of denoting a sequence are discussed after the examples.

A [tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation "Tessellation") with squares whose sides are successive Fibonacci numbers in length.

The [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number") are the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_numbers "Natural numbers") greater than 1 that have no [divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor "Divisor") but 1 and themselves. Taking these in their natural order gives the sequence (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...). The prime numbers are widely used in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), particularly in [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory") where many results related to them exist.

The [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_numbers "Fibonacci numbers") comprise the integer sequence in which each element is the sum of the previous two elements. The first two elements are either 0 and 1 or 1 and 1 so that the sequence is (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-:0-1)

Other examples of sequences include those made up of [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_numbers "Rational numbers"), [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") and [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers"). The sequence (.9, .99, .999, .9999, ...), for instance, approaches the number 1. In fact, every real number can be written as the [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence "Limit of a sequence") of a sequence of rational numbers (e.g. via its [decimal expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_expansion "Decimal expansion"), also see _[completeness of the real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness\_of\_the\_real\_numbers "Completeness of the real numbers")_). As another example, [π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi") is the limit of the sequence (3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ...), which is increasing. A related sequence is the sequence of decimal digits of π, that is, (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, ...). Unlike the preceding sequence, this sequence does not have any pattern that is easily discernible by inspection.

Other examples are sequences of [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)"), whose elements are functions instead of numbers.

The [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences") comprises a large list of examples of integer sequences.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-3)

Other notations can be useful for sequences whose pattern cannot be easily guessed or for sequences that do not have a pattern such as the digits of [π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi"). One such notation is to write down a general formula for computing the _n_ th term as a function of _n_, enclose it in parentheses, and include a subscript indicating the set of values that _n_ can take. For example, in this notation the sequence of even numbers could be written as ![Image 9: {\textstyle (2n)_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3c3eebc7a123a0c426f026b6e67ee27a1e70024e). The sequence of squares could be written as ![Image 10: {\textstyle (n^{2})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/82a392698af06bc8c45da771d3d1fe81fc6e438c). The variable _n_ is called an [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_family "Indexed family"), and the set of values that it can take is called the [index set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_set "Index set").

It is often useful to combine this notation with the technique of treating the elements of a sequence as individual variables. This yields expressions like ![Image 11: {\textstyle (a_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba8554caa13233f6d842e24c82e18fcdecb70744), which denotes a sequence whose _n_ th element is given by the variable ![Image 12: {\displaystyle a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790f9209748c2dca7ed7b81932c37c02af1dbc31). For example:

![Image 13: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{1}&=1{\text{st element of }}(a_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }\\a_{2}&=2{\text{nd element }}\\a_{3}&=3{\text{rd element }}\\&\;\;\vdots \\a_{n-1}&=(n-1){\text{th element}}\\a_{n}&=n{\text{th element}}\\a_{n+1}&=(n+1){\text{th element}}\\&\;\;\vdots \end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3dad98687c7a96c387bab84f4f098de10309d83f)
One can consider multiple sequences at the same time by using different variables; e.g. ![Image 14: {\textstyle (b_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c6c22c52c5a297513aff229e5721a5e3c21abde4) could be a different sequence than ![Image 15: {\textstyle (a_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba8554caa13233f6d842e24c82e18fcdecb70744). One can even consider a sequence of sequences: ![Image 16: {\textstyle ((a_{m,n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} })_{m\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72c1c5b828fdadcdfee43297b252dc4442f52b19) denotes a sequence whose _m_ th term is the sequence ![Image 17: {\textstyle (a_{m,n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/be76a6d48e7d0bdef578bd436f4adb439f3dcd2a).

An alternative to writing the domain of a sequence in the subscript is to indicate the range of values that the index can take by listing its highest and lowest legal values. For example, the notation ![Image 18: {\textstyle (k^{2}){\vphantom {)}}_{k=1}^{10}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a86e837550fcb548d9c5f5d631e9b65d12ff95e4) denotes the ten-term sequence of squares ![Image 19: {\displaystyle (1,4,9,\ldots ,100)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f5167f90148aea4f063dec37189c0cffd71bcc5). The limits ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21) and ![Image 21: {\displaystyle -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1) are allowed, but they do not represent valid values for the index, only the [supremum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremum "Supremum") or [infimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum "Infimum") of such values, respectively. For example, the sequence ![Image 22: {\textstyle {(a_{n})}_{n=1}^{\infty }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f29610f135bde65faf22368b136917a8bdcdf7d) is the same as the sequence ![Image 23: {\textstyle (a_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba8554caa13233f6d842e24c82e18fcdecb70744), and does not contain an additional term "at infinity". The sequence ![Image 24: {\textstyle {(a_{n})}_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6919d3cfe60ad52c41a1cdd35dcc97a9cca33d97) is a **bi-infinite sequence**, and can also be written as ![Image 25: {\textstyle (\ldots ,a_{-1},a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49e26827c279c4c02d239f4ca60f062f94e0820f).

In cases where the set of indexing numbers is understood, the subscripts and superscripts are often left off. That is, one simply writes ![Image 26: {\textstyle (a_{k})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02a65d101d1f29269756914f179a2256c17a597e) for an arbitrary sequence. Often, the index _k_ is understood to run from 1 to ∞. However, sequences are frequently indexed starting from zero, as in

![Image 27: {\displaystyle {(a_{k})}_{k=0}^{\infty }=(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e0670ab12a46d72a02b2645112b4547eda11baf)
In some cases, the elements of the sequence are related naturally to a sequence of integers whose pattern can be easily inferred. In these cases, the index set may be implied by a listing of the first few abstract elements. For instance, the sequence of squares of [odd numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_number "Odd number") could be denoted in any of the following ways.

*   ![Image 28: {\displaystyle (1,9,25,\ldots )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2dd81efaaf605779aacc5d7092172a8f4d90d61d)
*   ![Image 29: {\displaystyle (a_{1},a_{3},a_{5},\ldots ),\qquad a_{k}=k^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f3fb56a26e33b4528469ae545b02fc1ab57765e)
*   ![Image 30: {\displaystyle {(a_{2k-1})}_{k=1}^{\infty },\qquad a_{k}=k^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac14b074b535f5580edcd15776155b62adbd96b4)
*   ![Image 31: {\displaystyle {(a_{k})}_{k=1}^{\infty },\qquad a_{k}=(2k-1)^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/500c6f9fdda9625ff0481341a071e08eb638af1a)
*   ![Image 32: {\displaystyle {\bigl (}(2k-1)^{2}{\bigr )}_{k=1}^{\infty }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/55e335a2285e6dc7e424dbfcec64654442f2c92a)

Moreover, the subscripts and superscripts could have been left off in the third, fourth, and fifth notations, if the indexing set was understood to be the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_numbers "Natural numbers"). In the second and third bullets, there is a well-defined sequence ![Image 33: {\textstyle {(a_{k})}_{k=1}^{\infty }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6a4e4e6623e420a10dc138de5ed9e1b298b3efe8), but it is not the same as the sequence denoted by the expression.

### Defining a sequence by recursion

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sequence&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Defining a sequence by recursion")]

Sequences whose elements are related to the previous elements in a straightforward way are often defined using [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_definition "Recursive definition"). This is in contrast to the definition of sequences of elements as functions of their positions.

To define a sequence by recursion, one needs a rule, called _recurrence relation_ to construct each element in terms of the ones before it. In addition, enough initial elements must be provided so that all subsequent elements of the sequence can be computed by successive applications of the recurrence relation.

The [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence "Fibonacci sequence") is a simple classical example, defined by the recurrence relation

![Image 34: {\displaystyle a_{n}=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/575cf7950bcf359b0f03a0f73e15412f598fafbe)
with initial terms ![Image 35: {\displaystyle a_{0}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e8f3589226b1f07bd27b7c82d8f470a4685fffe2) and ![Image 36: {\displaystyle a_{1}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f6489d2bc20b48a0f4acb8d102124ef02af3531). From this, a simple computation shows that the first ten terms of this sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.

A complicated example of a sequence defined by a recurrence relation is [Recamán's sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recam%C3%A1n%27s_sequence "Recamán's sequence"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-4) defined by the recurrence relation

![Image 37: {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}a_{n}=a_{n-1}-n,\quad {\text{if the result is positive and not already in the previous terms,}}\\a_{n}=a_{n-1}+n,\quad {\text{otherwise}},\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/142ecbe05b2aa661860ef9b49a4c3370e8118592)
with initial term ![Image 38: {\displaystyle a_{0}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b45a44bd4a44dc8764dcf1bab5dec0045c8ed8a1)

A _linear recurrence with constant coefficients_ is a recurrence relation of the form

![Image 39: {\displaystyle a_{n}=c_{0}+c_{1}a_{n-1}+\dots +c_{k}a_{n-k},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/122cecc8a7fbd2e502a71ca0fad0843e5f0b2886)
where ![Image 40: {\displaystyle c_{0},\dots ,c_{k}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3e1e7c27815ec2e03d2be0a20685c752bee3cc68) are [constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(mathematics) "Constant (mathematics)"). There is a general method for expressing the general term ![Image 41: {\displaystyle a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790f9209748c2dca7ed7b81932c37c02af1dbc31) of such a sequence as a function of n; see [Linear recurrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_recurrence "Linear recurrence"). In the case of the Fibonacci sequence, one has ![Image 42: {\displaystyle c_{0}=0,c_{1}=c_{2}=1,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b3cd8d170b2baebe9532833c9d3e1fd534d899f6) and the resulting function of n is given by [Binet's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binet%27s_formula "Binet's formula").

A [holonomic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic_sequence "Holonomic sequence") is a sequence defined by a recurrence relation of the form

![Image 43: {\displaystyle a_{n}=c_{1}a_{n-1}+\dots +c_{k}a_{n-k},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/478b4e2ffc5ebcfb40f646d5dabe88ebd00d441c)
where ![Image 44: {\displaystyle c_{1},\dots ,c_{k}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49f09f81e670d56b1b385db27d36a6574d1dd72c) are [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") in n. For most holonomic sequences, there is no explicit formula for expressing ![Image 45: {\displaystyle a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790f9209748c2dca7ed7b81932c37c02af1dbc31) as a function of n. Nevertheless, holonomic sequences play an important role in various areas of mathematics. For example, many [special functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_functions "Special functions") have a [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series "Taylor series") whose sequence of coefficients is holonomic. The use of the recurrence relation allows a fast computation of values of such special functions.

Not all sequences can be specified by a recurrence relation. An example is the sequence of [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number") in their natural order (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...).

Formal definition and basic properties
--------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sequence&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Formal definition and basic properties")]

There are many different notions of sequences in mathematics, some of which (_e.g._, [exact sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_sequence "Exact sequence")) are not covered by the definitions and notations introduced below.

In this article, a sequence is formally defined as a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") whose [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function "Domain of a function") is an [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") of [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers "Integers"). This definition covers several different uses of the word "sequence", including one-sided infinite sequences, bi-infinite sequences, and finite sequences (see below for definitions of these kinds of sequences). However, many authors use a narrower definition by requiring the domain of a sequence to be the set of [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_numbers "Natural numbers"). This narrower definition has the disadvantage that it rules out finite sequences and bi-infinite sequences, both of which are usually called sequences in standard mathematical practice. Another disadvantage is that, if one removes the first terms of a sequence, one needs reindexing the remainder terms for fitting this definition. In some contexts, to shorten exposition, the [codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain "Codomain") of the sequence is fixed by context, for example by requiring it to be the set ![Image 46: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) of real numbers,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-Gaughan-5) the set ![Image 47: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7) of complex numbers,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-Saff-6) or a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-Munkres-7)

Although sequences are a type of function, they are usually distinguished notationally from functions in that the input is written as a subscript rather than in parentheses, that is, _a n_ rather than _a_(_n_). There are terminological differences as well: the value of a sequence at the lowest input (often 1) is called the "first element" of the sequence, the value at the second smallest input (often 2) is called the "second element", etc. Also, while a function abstracted from its input is usually denoted by a single letter, e.g. _f_, a sequence abstracted from its input is usually written by a notation such as ![Image 48: {\textstyle (a_{n})_{n\in A}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b99e7bc8f60fbc520be4c91234eebb1818c1725), or just as ![Image 49: {\textstyle (a_{n}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe57bfaae383d2d91ccd5dfdab504738de82dd55) Here _A_ is the domain, or index set, of the sequence.

Sequences and their limits (see below) are important concepts for studying topological spaces. An important generalization of sequences is the concept of [nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(mathematics) "Net (mathematics)"). A **net** is a function from a (possibly [uncountable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable "Uncountable")) [directed set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_set "Directed set") to a topological space. The notational conventions for sequences normally apply to nets as well.

### Finite and infinite

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sequence&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Finite and infinite")]

The **length** of a sequence is defined as the number of terms in the sequence.

A sequence of a finite length is a **finite sequence**. A finite sequence of length _n_ is also called an [_n_-tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-tuple "N-tuple"). Finite sequences include the **empty sequence**, denoted (), that has no elements.

Normally, the term _infinite sequence_ refers to a sequence that is infinite in one direction, and finite in the other; such a sequence has a first element, but no final element, and are called **singly infinite sequence** or a **one-sided infinite sequence** when disambiguation is needed. In contrast, a sequence that is infinite in both directions—i.e. that has neither a first nor a final element—is called a **bi-infinite sequence**, **two-way infinite sequence**, or **doubly infinite sequence**. A function from the set **Z** of _all_[integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers "Integers") into a set, such as for instance the sequence of all even integers ( ..., −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... ), is bi-infinite. This sequence could be denoted ![Image 50: {\textstyle {(2n)}_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f1d4414952cd82fe190386861179f21221ee6305).

### Increasing and decreasing

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sequence&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Increasing and decreasing")]

A sequence is said to be _monotonically increasing_ if each term is greater than or equal to the one before it. For example, the sequence ![Image 51: {\textstyle {(a_{n})}_{n=1}^{\infty }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f29610f135bde65faf22368b136917a8bdcdf7d) is monotonically increasing if and only if ![Image 52: {\textstyle a_{n+1}\geq a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ee65e9b4bae3bf8d85bed38fb770feaaf66ecb0) for all ![Image 53: {\displaystyle n\in \mathbf {N} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cc8bc5331e84c17aa658e89eba112a11e671d84a) If each consecutive term is strictly greater than (>) the previous term then the sequence is called **strictly monotonically increasing**. A sequence is **monotonically decreasing** if each consecutive term is less than or equal to the previous one, and is **strictly monotonically decreasing** if each is strictly less than the previous. If a sequence is either increasing or decreasing it is called a **monotone** sequence. This is a special case of the more general notion of a [monotonic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function "Monotonic function").

The terms **nondecreasing** and **nonincreasing** are often used in place of _increasing_ and _decreasing_ in order to avoid any possible confusion with _strictly increasing_ and _strictly decreasing_, respectively.

If the sequence of real numbers (_a n_) is such that all the terms are less than some real number _M_, then the sequence is said to be **bounded from above**. In other words, this means that there exists _M_ such that for all _n_, _a n_ ≤ _M_. Any such _M_ is called an _upper bound_. Likewise, if, for some real _m_, _a n_ ≥ _m_ for all _n_ greater than some _N_, then the sequence is **bounded from below** and any such _m_ is called a _lower bound_. If a sequence is both bounded from above and bounded from below, then the sequence is said to be **bounded**.

A **[subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence "Subsequence")** of a given sequence is a sequence formed from the given sequence by deleting some of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. For instance, the sequence of positive even integers (2, 4, 6, ...) is a subsequence of the positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...). The positions of some elements change when other elements are deleted. However, the relative positions are preserved.

Formally, a subsequence of the sequence ![Image 54: {\displaystyle (a_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70f0c27000fbc03d920b5b678949a0043ad269bd) is any sequence of the form ![Image 55: {\textstyle (a_{n_{k}})_{k\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e724316410e8cd4ca71ac1b6dc395d1ce938fae1), where ![Image 56: {\displaystyle (n_{k})_{k\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/800b612131446f0c7286979e24de30ce30dd1ec1) is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers.

### Other types of sequences

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sequence&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Other types of sequences")]

Some other types of sequences that are easy to define include:

*   An **[integer sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_sequence "Integer sequence")** is a sequence whose terms are integers.
*   A **[polynomial sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_sequence "Polynomial sequence")** is a sequence whose terms are polynomials.
*   A positive integer sequence is sometimes called **multiplicative**, if _a_ _nm_ = _a_ _n_ _a_ _m_ for all pairs _n_, _m_ such that _n_ and _m_ are [coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime "Coprime").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-8) In other instances, sequences are often called _multiplicative_, if _a_ _n_ = _na_ 1 for all _n_. Moreover, a _multiplicative_ Fibonacci sequence[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-9) satisfies the recursion relation _a_ _n_ = _a_ _n_−1 _a_ _n_−2.
*   A [binary sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_sequence "Binary sequence") is a sequence whose terms have one of two discrete values, e.g. [base 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_2 "Base 2") values (0,1,1,0, ...), a series of coin tosses (Heads/Tails) H,T,H,H,T, ..., the answers to a set of True or False questions (T, F, T, T, ...), and so on.

Limits and convergence
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sequence&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Limits and convergence")]

[![Image 57](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Converging_Sequence_example.svg/330px-Converging_Sequence_example.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Converging_Sequence_example.svg)

The plot of a convergent sequence (_a n_) is shown in blue. From the graph we can see that the sequence is converging to the limit zero as _n_ increases.

An important property of a sequence is _convergence_. If a sequence converges, it converges to a particular value known as the _limit_. If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is **convergent**. A sequence that does not converge is **divergent**.

Informally, a sequence has a limit if the elements of the sequence become closer and closer to some value ![Image 58: {\displaystyle L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8) (called the limit of the sequence), and they become and remain _arbitrarily_ close to ![Image 59: {\displaystyle L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8), meaning that given a real number ![Image 60: {\displaystyle d}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab) greater than zero, all but a finite number of the elements of the sequence have a distance from ![Image 61: {\displaystyle L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8) less than ![Image 62: {\displaystyle d}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab).

For example, the sequence ![Image 63: {\textstyle a_{n}={\frac {n+1}{2n^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a10b786e4f8ba61fd6ca8604e2f538155a807c57) shown to the right converges to the value 0. On the other hand, the sequences ![Image 64: {\textstyle b_{n}=n^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ad8bdc176bda9b6d02addccffefe1655050972d) (which begins 1, 8, 27, ...) and ![Image 65: {\displaystyle c_{n}=(-1)^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9b03240d43b19c214eda0d5f0947749a9d27a479) (which begins −1, 1, −1, 1, ...) are both divergent.

If a sequence converges, then the value it converges to is unique. This value is called the **limit** of the sequence. The limit of a convergent sequence ![Image 66: {\displaystyle (a_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18bc33c7c35d82b00f88d3a9103ed4738cde41f9) is normally denoted ![Image 67: {\textstyle \lim _{n\to \infty }a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3886d813df09cb056ba182f1b71907821d7bb49e). If ![Image 68: {\displaystyle (a_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18bc33c7c35d82b00f88d3a9103ed4738cde41f9) is a divergent sequence, then the expression ![Image 69: {\textstyle \lim _{n\to \infty }a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3886d813df09cb056ba182f1b71907821d7bb49e) is meaningless.

### Formal definition of convergence

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sequence&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Formal definition of convergence")]

A sequence of real numbers ![Image 70: {\displaystyle (a_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18bc33c7c35d82b00f88d3a9103ed4738cde41f9)**converges to** a real number ![Image 71: {\displaystyle L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8) if, for all ![Image 72: {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e04ec3670b50384a3ce48aca42e7cc5131a06b12), there exists a natural number ![Image 73: {\displaystyle N}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3) such that for all ![Image 74: {\displaystyle n\geq N}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b67a4f8e2ce89617f08316bfdcc6f33887b5629) we have[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-Gaughan-5)

![Image 75: {\displaystyle |a_{n}-L|<\varepsilon .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cb31ea1110cdc1d2ab0b0e36eecca4b2c29b97d0)
If ![Image 76: {\displaystyle (a_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18bc33c7c35d82b00f88d3a9103ed4738cde41f9) is a sequence of complex numbers rather than a sequence of real numbers, this last formula can still be used to define convergence, with the provision that ![Image 77: {\displaystyle |\cdot |}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4570d0a1c9fb8f2f413f0b73ce846dd1eb1dca3f) denotes the complex modulus, i.e. ![Image 78: {\displaystyle |z|={\sqrt {z^{*}z}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f51870c3943b951e5f5f35708fd1e319366a50d6). If ![Image 79: {\displaystyle (a_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18bc33c7c35d82b00f88d3a9103ed4738cde41f9) is a sequence of points in a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"), then the formula can be used to define convergence, if the expression ![Image 80: {\displaystyle |a_{n}-L|}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f4205ffa043954427846825cc5c8e74f2f6a29f6) is replaced by the expression ![Image 81: {\displaystyle \operatorname {dist} (a_{n},L)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d802d42a705cc4296599793014e07b930d29d6a8), which denotes the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)") between ![Image 82: {\displaystyle a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790f9209748c2dca7ed7b81932c37c02af1dbc31) and ![Image 83: {\displaystyle L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8).

### Applications and important results

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sequence&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Applications and important results")]

If ![Image 84: {\displaystyle (a_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18bc33c7c35d82b00f88d3a9103ed4738cde41f9) and ![Image 85: {\displaystyle (b_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ca3872ee8054312f21ff267bc6831745e42b9c9) are convergent sequences, then the following limits exist, and can be computed as follows:[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-Gaughan-5)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-Dawkins-10)

Moreover:

[![Image 86](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Cauchy_sequence_illustration.svg/350px-Cauchy_sequence_illustration.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cauchy_sequence_illustration.svg)

 The plot of a Cauchy sequence (_X n_), shown in blue, as _X n_ versus _n_. In the graph the sequence appears to be converging to a limit as the distance between consecutive terms in the sequence gets smaller as _n_ increases. In the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") every Cauchy sequence converges to some limit.

A Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms become arbitrarily close together as n gets very large. The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_spaces "Metric spaces"), and, in particular, in [real analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis "Real analysis"). One particularly important result in real analysis is _Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences_:

A sequence of real numbers is convergent (in the reals) if and only if it is Cauchy.
In contrast, there are Cauchy sequences of [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_numbers "Rational numbers") that are not convergent in the rationals, e.g. the sequence defined by ![Image 87: {\displaystyle x_{1}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68209597f05acea5c148021527eb7fe21bd77a55) and ![Image 88: {\displaystyle x_{n+1}={\tfrac {1}{2}}{\bigl (}x_{n}+{\tfrac {2}{x_{n}}}{\bigr )}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a7a166323b4bbb69a14e40c97df20f73cbc21b81) is Cauchy, but has no rational limit (cf. [Cauchy sequence §Non-example: rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence#Non-example:_rational_numbers "Cauchy sequence")). More generally, any sequence of rational numbers that converges to an [irrational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number "Irrational number") is Cauchy, but not convergent when interpreted as a sequence in the set of rational numbers.

Metric spaces that satisfy the Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences are called [complete metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric_space "Complete metric space") and are particularly nice for analysis.

In calculus, it is common to define notation for sequences which do not converge in the sense discussed above, but which instead become and remain arbitrarily large, or become and remain arbitrarily negative. If ![Image 89: {\displaystyle a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790f9209748c2dca7ed7b81932c37c02af1dbc31) becomes arbitrarily large as ![Image 90: {\displaystyle n\to \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a0d55d9b32f6fa8fab6a84ea444a6b5a24bb45e1), we write

![Image 91: {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }a_{n}=\infty .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/721e78fd32f0b06ed72c74e6712c1a3f94b39f48)
In this case we say that the sequence **diverges**, or that it **converges to infinity**. An example of such a sequence is _a_ _n_ = _n_.

If ![Image 92: {\displaystyle a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790f9209748c2dca7ed7b81932c37c02af1dbc31) becomes arbitrarily negative (i.e. negative and large in magnitude) as ![Image 93: {\displaystyle n\to \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a0d55d9b32f6fa8fab6a84ea444a6b5a24bb45e1), we write

![Image 94: {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }a_{n}=-\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f3ac619f5f8b70cf39037f1cc6c6701aabbcd4ae)
and say that the sequence **diverges** or **converges to negative infinity**.

A **series** is, informally speaking, the sum of the terms of a sequence. That is, it is an expression of the form ![Image 95: {\textstyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9d23408336e23cb0903bc2984727f12114ca58b) or ![Image 96: {\displaystyle a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/17873956e57130ebc58b0653801bfa31707292dd), where ![Image 97: {\displaystyle (a_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18bc33c7c35d82b00f88d3a9103ed4738cde41f9) is a sequence of real or complex numbers. The **partial sums** of a series are the expressions resulting from replacing the infinity symbol with a finite number, i.e. the _N_ th partial sum of the series ![Image 98: {\textstyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9d23408336e23cb0903bc2984727f12114ca58b) is the number

![Image 99: {\displaystyle S_{N}=\sum _{n=1}^{N}a_{n}=a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots +a_{N}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b356346bae67fd23c98b2f2fd63cef3ed82e9d9b)
The partial sums themselves form a sequence ![Image 100: {\displaystyle (S_{N})_{N\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5cc5d76bffa97a678f4d7942fff2063e75f9901f), which is called the **sequence of partial sums** of the series ![Image 101: {\textstyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9d23408336e23cb0903bc2984727f12114ca58b). If the sequence of partial sums converges, then we say that the series ![Image 102: {\textstyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9d23408336e23cb0903bc2984727f12114ca58b) is **convergent**, and the limit ![Image 103: {\textstyle \lim _{N\to \infty }S_{N}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66024e65c4208f994051d06621cff947a6cef7ea) is called the **value** of the series. The same notation is used to denote a series and its value, i.e. we write ![Image 104: {\textstyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}=\lim _{N\to \infty }S_{N}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/89d6d2d023b1039716ef4174a185506d52e356c0).

Use in other fields of mathematics
----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sequence&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Use in other fields of mathematics")]

Sequences play an important role in topology, especially in the study of [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_spaces "Metric spaces"). For instance:

*   A [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") is [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") exactly when it is [sequentially compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_compactness "Sequential compactness").
*   A function from a metric space to another metric space is [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") exactly when it takes convergent sequences to convergent sequences.
*   A metric space is a [connected space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") if and only if, whenever the space is partitioned into two sets, one of the two sets contains a sequence converging to a point in the other set.
*   A [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") is [separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_space "Separable space") exactly when there is a dense sequence of points.

Sequences can be generalized to [nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(mathematics) "Net (mathematics)") or [filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(set_theory) "Filter (set theory)"). These generalizations allow one to extend some of the above theorems to spaces without metrics.

The [topological product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology "Product topology") of a sequence of topological spaces is the [cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product") of those spaces, equipped with a [natural topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_topology "Natural topology") called the [product topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology "Product topology").

More formally, given a sequence of spaces ![Image 105: {\displaystyle (X_{i})_{i\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/372a15e47338aef4a640d99de451813c52f79b03), the product space

![Image 106: {\displaystyle X:=\prod _{i\in \mathbb {N} }X_{i},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/69742b11096ae5aeafef371f17fa2b6d7824b1b9)
is defined as the set of all sequences ![Image 107: {\displaystyle (x_{i})_{i\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a7b467539a8a95273842a51d4f6b392b2a0568fa) such that for each _i_, ![Image 108: {\displaystyle x_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e87000dd6142b81d041896a30fe58f0c3acb2158) is an element of ![Image 109: {\displaystyle X_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af4a0955af42beb5f85aa05fb8c07abedc13990d). The **[canonical projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(set_theory) "Projection (set theory)")** are the maps _p i_: _X_ → _X i_ defined by the equation ![Image 110: {\displaystyle p_{i}((x_{j})_{j\in \mathbb {N} })=x_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0534e4cf2a79f073a4ea1cd1bd03edc45a97d9b0). Then the **product topology** on _X_ is defined to be the [coarsest topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarsest_topology "Coarsest topology") (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections _p i_ are [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_(topology) "Continuous (topology)"). The product topology is sometimes called the **Tychonoff topology**.

When discussing sequences in [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"), one will generally consider sequences of the form

![Image 111: {\displaystyle (x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\dots ){\text{ or }}(x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},\dots )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70e777f8baf6836f57bc0376d9f4f4794d74c6c4)
which is to say, infinite sequences of elements indexed by [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number").

A sequence may start with an index different from 1 or 0. For example, the sequence defined by _x n_ = 1/[log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm "Logarithm")(_n_) would be defined only for _n_ ≥ 2. When talking about such infinite sequences, it is usually sufficient (and does not change much for most considerations) to assume that the members of the sequence are defined at least for all indices [large enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_enough "Large enough"), that is, greater than some given _N_.

The most elementary type of sequences are numerical ones, that is, sequences of [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") or [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") numbers. This type can be generalized to sequences of elements of some [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"). In analysis, the vector spaces considered are often [function spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space"). Even more generally, one can study sequences with elements in some [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space").

A [sequence space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_space "Sequence space") is a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") whose elements are infinite sequences of [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") or [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") numbers. Equivalently, it is a [function space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space") whose elements are functions from the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_numbers "Natural numbers") to the [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")_K_, where _K_ is either the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. The set of all such functions is naturally identified with the set of all possible infinite sequences with elements in _K_, and can be turned into a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") under the operations of [pointwise addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_addition "Pointwise addition") of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication. All sequence spaces are [linear subspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace") of this space. Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) "Norm (mathematics)"), or at least the structure of a [topological vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space "Topological vector space").

The most important sequences spaces in analysis are the ℓ _p_ spaces, consisting of the _p_-power summable sequences, with the _p_-norm. These are special cases of [L _p_ spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space "Lp space") for the [counting measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_measure "Counting measure") on the set of natural numbers. Other important classes of sequences like convergent sequences or [null sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_space#c,_c0_and_c00 "Sequence space") form sequence spaces, respectively denoted _c_ and _c_ 0, with the sup norm. Any sequence space can also be equipped with the [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") of [pointwise convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_convergence "Pointwise convergence"), under which it becomes a special kind of [Fréchet space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_space "Fréchet space") called an [FK-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FK-space "FK-space").

Sequences over a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") may also be viewed as [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)") in a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"). Specifically, the set of _F_-valued sequences (where _F_ is a field) is a [function space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space") (in fact, a [product space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_space "Product space")) of _F_-valued functions over the set of natural numbers.

Abstract algebra employs several types of sequences, including sequences of mathematical objects such as groups or rings.

If _A_ is a set, the [free monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_monoid "Free monoid") over _A_ (denoted _A_*, also called [Kleene star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star "Kleene star") of _A_) is a [monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid "Monoid") containing all the finite sequences (or strings) of zero or more elements of _A_, with the binary operation of concatenation. The [free semigroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_semigroup "Free semigroup")_A_+ is the subsemigroup of _A_* containing all elements except the empty sequence.

In the context of [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory"), a sequence

![Image 112: {\displaystyle G_{0}\;{\overset {f_{1}}{\longrightarrow }}\;G_{1}\;{\overset {f_{2}}{\longrightarrow }}\;G_{2}\;{\overset {f_{3}}{\longrightarrow }}\;\cdots \;{\overset {f_{n}}{\longrightarrow }}\;G_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c8a6daa29eafee68c71ca29e5130cd7087c3ce29)
of [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") and [group homomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homomorphism "Group homomorphism") is called **exact**, if the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)") (or [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_a_function "Range of a function")) of each homomorphism is equal to the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(algebra) "Kernel (algebra)") of the next:

![Image 113: {\displaystyle \mathrm {im} (f_{k})=\mathrm {ker} (f_{k+1})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f729490978b45de1373f5251176025d6fb2af61)
The sequence of groups and homomorphisms may be either finite or infinite.

A similar definition can be made for certain other [algebraic structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure "Algebraic structure"). For example, one could have an exact sequence of [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") and [linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map"), or of [modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics) "Module (mathematics)") and [module homomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_homomorphism "Module homomorphism").

In [homological algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_algebra "Homological algebra") and [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology"), a **spectral sequence** is a means of computing homology groups by taking successive approximations. Spectral sequences are a generalization of [exact sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_sequence "Exact sequence"), and since their introduction by [Jean Leray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Leray "Jean Leray")([1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#CITEREFLeray1946)), they have become an important research tool, particularly in [homotopy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_theory "Homotopy theory").

An [ordinal-indexed sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_topology#Ordinal-indexed_sequences "Order topology") is a generalization of a sequence. If α is a [limit ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_ordinal "Limit ordinal") and _X_ is a set, an α-indexed sequence of elements of _X_ is a function from α to _X_. In this terminology an ω-indexed sequence is an ordinary sequence.

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), finite sequences are called [lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(computer_science) "List (computer science)"). Potentially infinite sequences are called [streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_(computer_science) "Stream (computer science)"). Finite sequences of characters or digits are called [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)").

Infinite sequences of [digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit "Numerical digit") (or [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)")) drawn from a [finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set")[alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_(computer_science) "Alphabet (computer science)") are of particular interest in [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science "Theoretical computer science"). They are often referred to simply as _sequences_ or _[streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream\_(computing) "Stream (computing)")_, as opposed to finite _[strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String\_(computer\_science)#Formal\_theory "String (computer science)")_. Infinite binary sequences, for instance, are infinite sequences of [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit") (characters drawn from the alphabet {0, 1}). The set _C_ = {0, 1}∞ of all infinite binary sequences is sometimes called the [Cantor space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_space "Cantor space").

An infinite binary sequence can represent a [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language") (a set of strings) by setting the _n_ th bit of the sequence to 1 if and only if the _n_ th string (in [shortlex order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortlex_order "Shortlex order")) is in the language. This representation is useful in the [diagonalization method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument "Cantor's diagonal argument") for proofs.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence#cite_note-Oflazer2011-12)
