Line art drawing of parallel lines and curves.

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), **parallel lines** are [coplanar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coplanar "Coplanar") infinite straight [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") that do not [intersect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersecting_lines "Intersecting lines") at any point. **Parallel planes** are infinite flat [planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") in the same [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") that never meet. In three-dimensional Euclidean space, a line and a plane that do not share a point are also said to be parallel. However, two noncoplanar lines are called _[skew lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew\_lines "Skew lines")_. [Line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") and [Euclidean vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vectors "Euclidean vectors") are parallel if they have the same [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_(geometry) "Direction (geometry)") or [opposite direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposite_direction_(geometry) "Opposite direction (geometry)") (not necessarily the same length).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-HMCS-1)

Parallel lines are the subject of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-2) Parallelism is primarily a property of [affine geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry") and [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") is a special instance of this type of geometry. In some other geometries, such as [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"), lines can have analogous properties that are referred to as parallelism. The concept can also be generalized non-straight _[parallel curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel\_curve "Parallel curve")_ and non-flat _parallel surfaces_, which keep a fixed minimum distance and do not [touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent") each other or intersect.

The parallel symbol is ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \parallel }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66ed42f2e3eab99383c61f27773eba258aefeaac).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-Kersey_1673-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-Cajori_1928-4) For example, ![Image 3: {\displaystyle AB\parallel CD}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4604e0c72f8efbce903322cf4cb947e89e11257e) indicates that line _AB_ is parallel to line _CD_.

In the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") character set, the "parallel" and "not parallel" signs have codepoints U+2225 (∥) and U+2226 (∦), respectively. In addition, U+22D5 (⋕) represents the relation "equal and parallel to".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-5)

### Two lines in a plane

#### Conditions for parallelism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parallel_(geometry)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Conditions for parallelism")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Parallel_transversal.svg/330px-Parallel_transversal.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parallel_transversal.svg)

As shown by the tick marks, lines _a_ and _b_ are parallel. This can be proved because the transversal _t_ produces congruent corresponding angles ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af), shown here both to the right of the transversal, one above and adjacent to line _a_ and the other above and adjacent to line _b_.

Given parallel straight lines _l_ and _m_ in [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), the following properties are equivalent:

1.   Every point on line _m_ is located at exactly the same (minimum) distance from line _l_ (_[equidistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidistant "Equidistant") lines_).
2.   Line _m_ is in the same plane as line _l_ but does not intersect _l_ (recall that lines extend to [infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity") in either direction).
3.   When lines _m_ and _l_ are both intersected by a third straight line (a [transversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversal_(geometry) "Transversal (geometry)")) in the same plane, the [corresponding angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corresponding_angles "Corresponding angles") of intersection with the transversal are [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)").

Since these are equivalent properties, any one of them could be taken as the definition of parallel lines in Euclidean space, but the first and third properties involve measurement, and so, are "more complicated" than the second. Thus, the second property is the one usually chosen as the defining property of parallel lines in Euclidean geometry.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-6) The other properties are then consequences of [Euclid's Parallel Postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Fifth_Axiom "Euclid's Fifth Axiom").

The definition of parallel lines as a pair of straight lines in a plane which do not meet appears as Definition 23 in Book I of [Euclid's Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-Euclid-7) Alternative definitions were discussed by other Greeks, often as part of an attempt to prove the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate"). [Proclus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclus "Proclus") attributes a definition of parallel lines as equidistant lines to [Posidonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonius "Posidonius") and quotes [Geminus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminus "Geminus") in a similar vein. [Simplicius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicius_of_Cilicia "Simplicius of Cilicia") also mentions Posidonius' definition as well as its modification by the philosopher Aganis.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-Euclid-7)

At the end of the nineteenth century, in England, Euclid's Elements was still the standard textbook in secondary schools. The traditional treatment of geometry was being pressured to change by the new developments in [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry") and [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"), so several new textbooks for the teaching of geometry were written at this time. A major difference between these reform texts, both between themselves and between them and Euclid, is the treatment of parallel lines.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-8) These reform texts were not without their critics and one of them, Charles Dodgson (a.k.a. [Lewis Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll "Lewis Carroll")), wrote a play, _Euclid and His Modern Rivals_, in which these texts are lambasted.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-9)

One of the early reform textbooks was James Maurice Wilson's _Elementary Geometry_ of 1868.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-10) Wilson based his definition of parallel lines on the [primitive notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion "Primitive notion") of _direction_. According to [Wilhelm Killing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Killing "Wilhelm Killing")[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-11) the idea may be traced back to [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-12) Wilson, without defining direction since it is a primitive, uses the term in other definitions such as his sixth definition, "Two straight lines that meet one another have different directions, and the difference of their directions is the _angle_ between them." [Wilson (1868](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#CITEREFWilson1868), p. 2) In definition 15 he introduces parallel lines in this way; "Straight lines which have the _same direction_, but are not parts of the same straight line, are called _parallel lines_." [Wilson (1868](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#CITEREFWilson1868), p. 12) [Augustus De Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_De_Morgan "Augustus De Morgan") reviewed this text and declared it a failure, primarily on the basis of this definition and the way Wilson used it to prove things about parallel lines. Dodgson also devotes a large section of his play (Act II, Scene VI § 1) to denouncing Wilson's treatment of parallels. Wilson edited this concept out of the third and higher editions of his text.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-13)

Other properties, proposed by other reformers, used as replacements for the definition of parallel lines, did not fare much better. The main difficulty, as pointed out by Dodgson, was that to use them in this way required additional axioms to be added to the system. The equidistant line definition of Posidonius, expounded by Francis Cuthbertson in his 1874 text _Euclidean Geometry_ suffers from the problem that the points that are found at a fixed given distance on one side of a straight line must be shown to form a straight line. This can not be proved and must be assumed to be true.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-14) The corresponding angles formed by a transversal property, used by W. D. Cooley in his 1860 text, _The Elements of Geometry, simplified and explained_ requires a proof of the fact that if one transversal meets a pair of lines in congruent corresponding angles then all transversals must do so. Again, a new axiom is needed to justify this statement.

The three properties above lead to three different methods of construction[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-15) of parallel lines.

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Par-prob.png/250px-Par-prob.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Par-prob.png)

Property 1: Line _m_ has everywhere the same distance to line _l_.

Property 2: Take a random line through _a_ that intersects _l_ in _x_. Move point _x_ to infinity.

*   [![Image 9: Property 3: Both l and m share a transversal line through a that intersect them at 90°.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Par-perp.png/250px-Par-perp.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Par-perp.png "Property 3: Both l and m share a transversal line through a that intersect them at 90°.")

Property 3: Both _l_ and _m_ share a transversal line through _a_ that intersect them at 90°.

#### Distance between two parallel lines

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parallel_(geometry)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Distance between two parallel lines")]

Because parallel lines in a Euclidean plane are [equidistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidistant "Equidistant") there is a unique distance between the two parallel lines. Given the equations of two non-vertical, non-horizontal parallel lines,

![Image 10: {\displaystyle y=mx+b_{1}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35b689641493203ec74490249169faa2c00f5078)![Image 11: {\displaystyle y=mx+b_{2}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d9f3c58eaf4c850159dab236f19945844cf0679)
the distance between the two lines can be found by locating two points (one on each line) that lie on a common perpendicular to the parallel lines and calculating the distance between them. Since the lines have slope _m_, a common perpendicular would have slope −1/_m_ and we can take the line with equation _y_ = −_x_/_m_ as a common perpendicular. Solve the linear systems

![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}y=mx+b_{1}\\y=-x/m\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7f42d0562ac1d8b33fa4c2a97424e238cd78599)
and

![Image 13: {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}y=mx+b_{2}\\y=-x/m\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b62df81d6f0cc8f9c3119c75b986f589cd09b37d)
to get the coordinates of the points. The solutions to the linear systems are the points

![Image 14: {\displaystyle \left(x_{1},y_{1}\right)\ =\left({\frac {-b_{1}m}{m^{2}+1}},{\frac {b_{1}}{m^{2}+1}}\right)\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9322bb1bc703f209c09823de2570842b5d8a5103)
and

![Image 15: {\displaystyle \left(x_{2},y_{2}\right)\ =\left({\frac {-b_{2}m}{m^{2}+1}},{\frac {b_{2}}{m^{2}+1}}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b321e156620ac02fb39a7739384057852ed2ab4)
These formulas still give the correct point coordinates even if the parallel lines are horizontal (i.e., _m_ = 0). The distance between the points is

![Image 16: {\displaystyle d={\sqrt {\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}}}={\sqrt {\left({\frac {b_{1}m-b_{2}m}{m^{2}+1}}\right)^{2}+\left({\frac {b_{2}-b_{1}}{m^{2}+1}}\right)^{2}}}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1fb3a1586f9c227af9e0584fe0ff4abc3cc2d571)
which reduces to

![Image 17: {\displaystyle d={\frac {|b_{2}-b_{1}|}{\sqrt {m^{2}+1}}}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/976dfcbb79c4d09396b2b65277135bf1324085b9)
When the lines are given by the general form of the equation of a line (horizontal and vertical lines are included):

![Image 18: {\displaystyle ax+by+c_{1}=0\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/78ef38afd17d0cc35cd6db3028391d84cad524e2)![Image 19: {\displaystyle ax+by+c_{2}=0,\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e5e16a81812ecbb18dcd3f209a9e1aa656ed6def)
their distance can be expressed as

![Image 20: {\displaystyle d={\frac {|c_{2}-c_{1}|}{\sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/accd1aa172d44c7b35228ed52f4c99db274104ca)

### Two lines in three-dimensional space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parallel_(geometry)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Two lines in three-dimensional space")]

Two lines in the same [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") that do not intersect need not be parallel. Only if they are in a common plane are they called parallel; otherwise they are called [skew lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_lines "Skew lines").

Two distinct lines _l_ and _m_ in three-dimensional space are parallel [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") the distance from a point _P_ on line _m_ to the nearest point on line _l_ is independent of the location of _P_ on line _m_. This never holds for skew lines.

A line _m_ and a plane _q_ in three-dimensional space, the line not lying in that plane, are parallel if and only if they do not intersect.

Equivalently, they are parallel if and only if the distance from a point _P_ on line _m_ to the nearest point in plane _q_ is independent of the location of _P_ on line _m_.

Similar to the fact that parallel lines must be located in the same plane, parallel planes must be situated in the same three-dimensional space and contain no point in common.

Two distinct planes _q_ and _r_ are parallel if and only if the distance from a point _P_ in plane _q_ to the nearest point in plane _r_ is independent of the location of _P_ in plane _q_. This will never hold if the two planes are not in the same three-dimensional space.

In non-Euclidean geometry
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parallel_(geometry)&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: In non-Euclidean geometry")]

In [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"), the concept of a straight line is replaced by the more general concept of a [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic"), a curve which is [locally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_property "Local property") straight with respect to the [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") (definition of distance) on a [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold"), a surface (or higher-dimensional space) which may itself be curved. In [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), particles not under the influence of external forces follow geodesics in [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), a four-dimensional manifold with 3 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-16)

In non-Euclidean geometry ([elliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry") or [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry")) the three Euclidean properties mentioned above are not equivalent and only the second one (Line m is in the same plane as line l but does not intersect l) is useful in non-Euclidean geometries, since it involves no measurements. In general geometry the three properties above give three different types of curves, **equidistant curves**, **parallel geodesics** and **geodesics sharing a common perpendicular**, respectively.

### Hyperbolic geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parallel_(geometry)&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Hyperbolic geometry")]

[![Image 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/HyperParallel.png/330px-HyperParallel.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HyperParallel.png)

**Intersecting**, **parallel** and **ultra parallel** lines through _a_ with respect to _l_ in the hyperbolic plane. The parallel lines appear to intersect _l_ just off the image. This is just an artifact of the visualisation. On a real hyperbolic plane the lines will get closer to each other and 'meet' in infinity.

While in Euclidean geometry two geodesics can either intersect or be parallel, in hyperbolic geometry, there are three possibilities. Two geodesics belonging to the same plane can either be:

1.   **intersecting**, if they intersect in a common point in the plane,
2.   **parallel**, if they do not intersect in the plane, but converge to a common limit point at infinity ([ideal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_point "Ideal point")), or
3.   **ultra parallel**, if they do not have a common limit point at infinity.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-17)

In the literature _ultra parallel_ geodesics are often called _non-intersecting_. _Geodesics intersecting at infinity_ are called _[limiting parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting\_parallel "Limiting parallel")_.

As in the illustration through a point _a_ not on line _l_ there are two [limiting parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_parallel "Limiting parallel") lines, one for each direction [ideal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_point "Ideal point") of line l. They separate the lines intersecting line l and those that are ultra parallel to line _l_.

Ultra parallel lines have single common perpendicular ([ultraparallel theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraparallel_theorem "Ultraparallel theorem")), and diverge on both sides of this common perpendicular.

### Spherical or elliptic geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parallel_(geometry)&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Spherical or elliptic geometry")]

[![Image 22](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/SphereParallel.png/330px-SphereParallel.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SphereParallel.png)

On the [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") there is no such thing as a parallel line. Line _a_ is a [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle"), the equivalent of a straight line in spherical geometry. Line _c_ is equidistant to line _a_ but is not a great circle. It is a parallel of latitude. Line _b_ is another geodesic which intersects _a_ in two antipodal points. They share two common perpendiculars (one shown in blue).

In [spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry"), all geodesics are [great circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circles "Great circles"). Great circles divide the sphere in two equal [hemispheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") and all great circles intersect each other. Thus, there are no parallel geodesics to a given geodesic, as all geodesics intersect. Equidistant curves on the sphere are called **parallels of latitude** analogous to the [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") lines on a globe. Parallels of latitude can be generated by the intersection of the sphere with a plane parallel to a plane through the center of the sphere.

If _l, m, n_ are three distinct lines, then ![Image 23: {\displaystyle l\parallel m\ \land \ m\parallel n\ \implies \ l\parallel n.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/69c5be6db1f6bdaa60a8110750d6bf5d3f693942)

In this case, parallelism is a [transitive relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation "Transitive relation"). However, in case _l_ = _n_, the superimposed lines are _not_ considered parallel in Euclidean geometry. The [binary relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation "Binary relation") between parallel lines is evidently a [symmetric relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation "Symmetric relation"). According to Euclid's tenets, parallelism is _not_ a [reflexive relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation "Reflexive relation") and thus _fails_ to be an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation"). Nevertheless, in [affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry") a [pencil of parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil_of_parallel_lines "Pencil of parallel lines") is taken as an [equivalence class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") in the set of lines where parallelism is an equivalence relation.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-20)

To this end, [Emil Artin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Artin "Emil Artin") (1957) adopted a definition of parallelism where two lines are parallel if they have all or none of their points in common.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines#cite_note-21) Then a line _is_ parallel to itself so that the reflexive and transitive properties belong to this type of parallelism, creating an equivalence relation on the set of lines. In the study of [incidence geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry "Incidence geometry"), this variant of parallelism is used in the [affine plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane_(incidence_geometry) "Affine plane (incidence geometry)").
