"Agency" here refers to the organization under whose auspices the EVA was conducted (so a Swiss or Japanese astronaut would be listed under NASA if they wore NASA suits and were controlled by Mission Control Houston).

For details, see lists of spacewalks from 1965–1999 , 2000–2014 , and 2015-present .
