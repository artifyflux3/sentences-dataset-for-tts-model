Hyperspace travel is sometimes depicted as a starfield that streaks toward the viewer. A visual effect like this was first used in the 1974 film _[Dark Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark\_Star\_(film) "Dark Star (film)")_, and it became a popular cinematic depiction, with a similar effect being used in the _Star Wars_ franchise.

In [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction"), **hyperspace** (also known as **nulspace**, **subspace**, **overspace**, **jumpspace** and similar terms) is a concept relating to [higher dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#Additional_dimensions "Dimension") as well as [parallel universes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universes_in_fiction "Parallel universes in fiction") and a [faster-than-light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light "Faster-than-light") (FTL) method of [interstellar travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel "Interstellar travel"). In its original meaning, the term _hyperspace_ was simply a synonym for [higher-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-dimensional_space "Higher-dimensional space"). This usage was most common in 19th-century textbooks[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Westfahl2005-1): 404 [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:9-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:10-3): 94  and is still occasionally found in academic and [popular science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_science "Popular science") texts, for example, _[Hyperspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace\_(book) "Hyperspace (book)")_ (1994)._[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite\_note-:1-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite\_note-Stableford20063-5): 238–239 [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite\_note-6)_ Its science fiction usage originated in the magazine _[Amazing Stories Quarterly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing\_Stories\_Quarterly "Amazing Stories Quarterly")_ in 1931 and within several decades it became one of the most popular [tropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature) "Trope (literature)") of science fiction, popularized by its use in the works of authors such as [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov "Isaac Asimov") and [E. C. Tubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Charles_Tubb "Edwin Charles Tubb"), and media franchises such as _[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Wars "Star Wars")_.

One of the main reasons for the concept's popularity in science fiction is the impossibility of faster-than-light travel in ordinary _[physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_space "Physical space")_, which hyperspace allows writers to bypass. In most works, hyperspace is described as a higher dimension through which the shape of [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") can be distorted to bring distant points close to each other, similar to the concept of a [wormhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole "Wormhole"); or a shortcut-enabling [parallel universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universes_in_fiction "Parallel universes in fiction") that can be travelled through. Usually it can be traversed – the process often known as "jumping" – through a gadget known as a "hyperdrive"; [rubber science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_science "Rubber science") is sometimes used to explain it. Many works rely on hyperspace as a convenient background tool enabling FTL travel necessary for the plot, with a small minority making it a central element in their storytelling. While most often used in the context of interstellar travel, a minority of works focus on other plot points, such as the inhabitants of hyperspace, hyperspace as an energy source, or even hyperspace as the [afterlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife "Afterlife").

A piece of paper crumpled into a ball, representing a two-dimensional object distorted in the third dimension, making points that are far apart on its surface come close to each other or even touch

The basic premise of hyperspace is that vast distances through space can be traversed quickly by taking a kind of shortcut. There are two common models used to explain this shortcut: folding and mapping. In the folding model, hyperspace is a place of higher dimension through which the shape of our [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") can be distorted to bring distant points close to each other; a common analogy popularized by [Robert A. Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein "Robert A. Heinlein")'s _[Starman Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starman\_Jones "Starman Jones")_ (1953) is that of crumpling two-dimensional paper or cloth in the third dimension, thus bringing points on its surface into contact. In the mapping model, hyperspace is a [parallel universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universes_in_fiction "Parallel universes in fiction") much smaller than ours (but not necessarily the same shape), which can be entered at a point corresponding to one location in ordinary space and exited at a different point corresponding to another location after travelling a much shorter distance than would be necessary in ordinary space. _[The Science in Science Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Science\_in\_Science\_Fiction "The Science in Science Fiction")_ compares it to being able to step onto a [world map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_map "World map") at one's current location, walking across the map to a different continent, and then stepping off the map to find oneself at the new location—noting that the hyperspace "map" could have a significantly more complicated shape, as in [Bob Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Shaw "Bob Shaw")'s _[Night Walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night\_Walk\_(novel) "Night Walk (novel)")_ (1967).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:1-4)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:3-7): 72–73 [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:8-8): 175 [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Westfahl2005-1): 404

Hyperspace is generally seen as a fictional concept not compatible with present-day scientific theories, particularly the [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity")[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-9)).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:1-4)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:3-7): 72–73  Some science fiction writers attempted quasi-scientific [rubber science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_science "Rubber science") explanations of this concept. For others, however, it is just a convenient [MacGuffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin "MacGuffin") enabling faster-than-light travel necessary for their story without violating the prohibitions against FTL travel in ordinary space imposed by known laws of physics.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-visual-10): 74–76 [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:1-4)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:3-7): 72–73 [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Westfahl2005-1): 404 [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:6-11)

The means of accessing hyperspace is often called a "hyperdrive",[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:2-12)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:0-13)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:10-3): 94  and navigating hyperspace is typically referred to as "jumping" (as in "the ship will now jump through hyperspace").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:6-11)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-visual-10): 75

A number of related terms (such as imaginary space, Jarnell intersplit, jumpspace, megaflow, N-Space, nulspace, slipstream, overspace, Q-space, subspace, and tau-space) have been used by various writers, although none have gained recognition to rival that of hyperspace.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:6-11)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Stableford20063-5): 238–239 [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-visual-10): 75 [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:2-12)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Westfahl2005-1): 404 [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-15): 156  Some works use multiple synonyms; for example, in the _[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Trek "Star Trek")_ franchise, the term hyperspace itself is only used briefly in a single 1988 episode ("[Coming of Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_Age_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation) "Coming of Age (Star Trek: The Next Generation)")") of _[Star Trek: The Next Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Trek:\_The\_Next\_Generation "Star Trek: The Next Generation")_,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-16): 353  while a related set of terms – such as subspace, transwarp, and proto-warp – are employed much more often, and most of the travel takes place through the use of a [warp drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_drive "Warp drive").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Stableford20063-5): 238–239 [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:2-12)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-17) Hyperspace travel has also been discussed in the context of [wormholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole "Wormhole") and [teleportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation "Teleportation"), which some writers consider to be similar whereas others view them as separate concepts.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:11-18): 85 [[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-19): 2 [[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-20)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-21): 265–266

The earliest references to hyperspace in fiction appeared in publications such as _[Amazing Stories Quarterly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing\_Stories\_Quarterly "Amazing Stories Quarterly")_ (shown here is the Spring 1931 issue featuring [John Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Campbell "John W. Campbell")'s _[Islands of Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islands\_of\_Space "Islands of Space")_).

Emerging in the early 20th century, within several decades hyperspace became a common element of [interstellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel "Interstellar travel")[space travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_travel_in_science_fiction "Space travel in science fiction") stories in science fiction.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:6-11)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:1-4)[Kirk Meadowcroft](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kirk_Meadowcroft&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kirk Meadowcroft (page does not exist)")'s "The Invisible Bubble" (1928) and [John Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Campbell "John W. Campbell")'s _[Islands of Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islands\_of\_Space "Islands of Space")_ (1931) feature the earliest known references to hyperspace, with Campbell, whose story was published in the [science fiction magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_magazine "Science fiction magazine")_[Amazing Stories Quarterly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing\_Stories\_Quarterly "Amazing Stories Quarterly")_, likely being the first writer to use this term in the context of space travel.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:1-4)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:3-7): 72–73 [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Stableford20063-5): 238–239 [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:9-2) According to the [Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Dictionary_of_Science_Fiction "Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction"), the earliest known use of the word "hyper-drive" comes from a preview of [Murray Leinster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Leinster "Murray Leinster")'s story "The Manless Worlds" in _[Thrilling Wonder Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrilling\_Wonder\_Stories "Thrilling Wonder Stories")_ 1946.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:0-13)

Another early work featuring hyperspace was [Nelson Bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Bond "Nelson Bond")'s _[The Scientific Pioneer Returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The\_Scientific\_Pioneer\_Returns&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Scientific Pioneer Returns (page does not exist)")_ (1940).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Stableford20063-5): 238–239 [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov "Isaac Asimov")'s [_Foundation_ series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(book_series) "Foundation (book series)"), first published in _[Astounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astounding "Astounding")_ starting in 1942, featured a [Galactic Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Asimov) "Galactic Empire (Asimov)") traversed through hyperspace through the use of a "hyperatomic drive".[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:7-22): 100 [[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-23) In _[Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation\_(Asimov\_novel) "Foundation (Asimov novel)")_ (1951), hyperspace is described as an "...unimaginable region that was neither space nor time, matter nor energy, something nor nothing, one could traverse the length of the Galaxy in the interval between two neighboring instants of time."[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-24): 5 [E. C. Tubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Charles_Tubb "Edwin Charles Tubb") has been credited with playing an important role in the development of hyperspace lore; writing a number of [space operas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera "Space opera") in the early 1950s in which space travel occurs through that medium. He was also one of the first writers to treat hyperspace as a central part of the plot rather than a convenient background gadget that just enables the faster-than-light space travel.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:6-11)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-visual-10): 75

In 1963, [Philip Harbottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Harbottle "Philip Harbottle") called the concept of hyperspace "a fixture" of the science fiction genre,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:6-11) and in 1977 [Brian Ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Ash_(bibliographer) "Brian Ash (bibliographer)") wrote in _[The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Visual\_Encyclopedia\_of\_Science\_Fiction "The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction")_ that it had become the most popular of all faster-than-light methods of travel.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-visual-10): 75  The concept would subsequently be further popularized through its use in the _[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Wars "Star Wars")_ franchise.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:2-12)

In the 1974 film _[Dark Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark\_Star\_(film) "Dark Star (film)")_, special effects designer [Dan O'Bannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_O%27Bannon "Dan O'Bannon") created a visual effect to depict going into hyperspace wherein the stars in space appear to move rapidly toward the camera. This is considered to be the first depiction in cinema history of a ship making the jump into hyperspace. The same effect was later employed in _[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Wars\_(film) "Star Wars (film)")_ (1977) and the "star streaks" are considered one of the visual "staples" of the _Star Wars_ franchise.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-25): 115 [[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-26)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-27): 189

Hyperspace is typically described as chaotic and confusing to human senses; often at least unpleasant – transitions to or from hyperspace can cause symptoms such as [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea "Nausea"), for example – and in some cases even [hypnotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotic "Hypnotic") or dangerous to one's sanity.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:6-11)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Stableford20063-5): 238–239 [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Westfahl2005-1): 405  Visually, hyperspace is often left to the reader's imagination, or depicted as "a swirling gray mist".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-visual-10): 75 [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:6-11) In some works, it is dark.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Westfahl2005-1): 405  Exceptions exist; for example, [John Russel Fearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Russell_Fearn "John Russell Fearn")'s _Waters of Eternity_ (1953) features hyperspace that allows observation of regular space from within.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:6-11)

Many stories feature hyperspace as a dangerous, treacherous place where straying from a preset course can be disastrous. In [Frederick Pohl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Pohl "Frederick Pohl")'s _[The Mapmakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The\_Mapmakers\_(novel)&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Mapmakers (novel) (page does not exist)")_ (1955), navigational errors and the perils of hyperspace are one of the main plot-driving elements,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:3-7): 72–73 [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-visual-10): 75  and in [K. Houston Brunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brunner_(novelist) "John Brunner (novelist)")'s _[Fiery Pillar](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fiery\_Pillar&action=edit&redlink=1 "Fiery Pillar (page does not exist)")_ (1955), a ship re-emerges within Earth, causing a catastrophic explosion.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-visual-10): 75  In some works, travelling or navigating hyperspace requires not only specialized equipment, but physical or psychological modifications of passengers or at least navigators, as seen in [Frank Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert "Frank Herbert")'s _[Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune\_(novel) "Dune (novel)")_ (1965), [Michael Moorcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moorcock "Michael Moorcock")'s _[The Sundered Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The\_Sundered\_Worlds&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Sundered Worlds (page does not exist)")_ (1966), [Vonda McIntyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vonda_N._McIntyre "Vonda N. McIntyre")'s _[Aztecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aztecs\_(novel)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Aztecs (novel) (page does not exist)")_ (1977), and [David Brin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brin "David Brin")'s _[The Warm Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The\_Warm\_Space&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Warm Space (page does not exist)")_ (1985).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Stableford20063-5)

While generally associated with science fiction, hyperspace-like concepts exist in some works of [fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy "Fantasy"), particularly ones which involve movement between different worlds or dimensions. Such travel, usually done through portals rather than vehicles, is usually explained through the existence of [magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural) "Magic (supernatural)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Westfahl2005-1): 405

While mainly designed as means of fast space travel, occasionally, some writers have used the hyperspace concept in more imaginative ways, or as a central element of the story.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:3-7): 72–73  In [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke "Arthur C. Clarke")'s "[Technical Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Error "Technical Error")" (1950), a man is laterally reversed by a brief accidental encounter with "hyperspace".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:8-8): 177  In Robert A. Heinlein's _[Glory Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory\_Road "Glory Road")_ (1963) and [Robert Silverberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Silverberg "Robert Silverberg")'s "[Nightwings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwings_(novella) "Nightwings (novella)")" (1968), it is used for storage.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Westfahl2005-1): 405  In [George R.R. Martin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin "George R. R. Martin")_[FTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=FTA\_(novel)&action=edit&redlink=1 "FTA (novel) (page does not exist)")_ (1974) hyperspace travel takes longer than in regular space, and in [John E.

In many stories, a starship cannot enter or leave hyperspace too close to a large concentration of mass, such as a planet or [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"); this means that hyperspace can only be used after a starship gets to the outside [edge of a solar system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_system "Planetary system"), so that it must use [other means of propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion "Spacecraft propulsion") to get to and from planets.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-visual-10): 76  Other stories require a very large expenditure of energy in order to open a link (sometimes called a _jump point_) between hyperspace and regular space; this effectively limits access to hyperspace to very large starships, or to large stationary _jump gates_ that can open jump points for smaller vessels. Examples include the "jump" technology in _[Babylon 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon\_5 "Babylon 5")_ and the star gate in Arthur C. Clarke's _[2001: A Space Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:\_A\_Space\_Odyssey\_(novel) "2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)")_ (1968).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-Westfahl2005-1): 404 [[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:4-28) Just like with the very concept of hyperspace, the reasons given for such restrictions are usually [technobabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technobabble "Technobabble"), but their existence can be an important [plot device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_device "Plot device").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-visual-10): 74–76 [[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:5-29): 554  Science fiction author [Larry Niven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Niven "Larry Niven") published his opinions to that effect in _[N-Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Space\_(short\_story\_collection) "N-Space (short story collection)")_. According to him, an unrestricted FTL technology would give no limits to what heroes and villains could do.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:5-29): 554  Limiting the places a ship can appear in, or making them more predictable, means that they will meet each other most often around contested planets or space stations, allowing for narratively satisfying battles or other encounters. On the other hand, a less restricted hyperdrive may also allow for dramatic escapes as the pilot "jumps" to hyperspace in the midst of battle to avoid destruction.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:5-29): 557  In 1999 science fiction author [James P. Hogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._Hogan_(writer) "James P. Hogan (writer)") wrote that hyperspace is often treated as a plot-enabling gadget rather than as a fascinating, world-changing item, and that there are next to no works that discuss how hyperspace has been discovered and how such discovery subsequently changed the world.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-30): 107–108

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_ref-9)**The theory of relativity prohibits the principle of [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics) "Causality (physics)") being broken by the reversal of cause and effect, which the very concept of FTL travel breaks as the arrival of an object using FTL means of travel, such as hyperspace, might be witnessed by observers elsewhere in the Universe as preceding the take-off.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace#cite_note-:1-4)
