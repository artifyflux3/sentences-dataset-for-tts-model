Examples [ edit ] Examples of function series include ordinary power series , Laurent series , Fourier series , Liouville-Neumann series , formal power series , and Puiseux series .

Convergence [ edit ] There exist many types of convergence for a function series, such as uniform convergence , pointwise convergence , and convergence almost everywhere . Each type of convergence corresponds to a different metric for the space of functions that are added together in the series, and thus a different type of limit .

The Weierstrass M-test is a useful result in studying convergence of function series.
