[ 2 ] Little is known of Gardizi personally. He was probably from Gardiz in the region of Zamindawar , as his nisba implies.

[ 3 ] His father's name was Zahhak, a name that was seemingly popular in the region.

[ 1 ] Gardizi started his career as an official of the Ghaznavid monarch Mahmud of Ghazni ( r.

998–1030 ), and was an eyewitness to many of the events that occurred under the latter.

[ 2 ] In his Zayn al-akbar , Gardizi took a dispassionate view of history which was fairly remarkable for its time.

[ 1 ] It consisted of a history of the pre-Islamic kings of Iran, Muhammad and the Caliphs until the year 1032. Included is a history of the Arab conquest of Khorasan , which it is believed Gardizi was using al-Sallami as a source. His history concerning the Turks was written using Ibn Khordadbeh , Jayhani and Ibn al-Muqaffa' as sources.

[ 4 ] He may have been a student of al-Biruni , since the Zayn al-akbar contains information concerning Indian festivals.
