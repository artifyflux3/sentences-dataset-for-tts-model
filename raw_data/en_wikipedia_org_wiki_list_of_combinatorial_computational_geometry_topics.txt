See List of numerical computational geometry topics for another flavor of computational geometry that deals with geometric objects as continuous entities and applies methods and algorithms of nature characteristic to numerical analysis .

Construction/representation [ edit ] Boolean operations on polygons Convex hull Hyperplane arrangement Polygon decomposition Polygon triangulation Minimal convex decomposition Minimal convex cover problem ( NP-hard ) Minimal rectangular decomposition Tessellation problems Shape dissection problems Straight skeleton Stabbing line problem Triangulation Delaunay triangulation Point-set triangulation Polygon triangulation Voronoi diagram Extremal shapes [ edit ] Minimum bounding box ( Smallest enclosing box , Smallest bounding box ) 2-D case: Smallest bounding rectangle ( Smallest enclosing rectangle ) There are two common variants of this problem.

In many areas of computer graphics, the bounding box (often abbreviated to bbox) is understood to be the smallest box delimited by sides parallel to coordinate axes which encloses the objects in question.

In other applications, such as packaging , the problem is to find the smallest box the object (or objects) may fit in ("packaged"). Here the box may assume an arbitrary orientation with respect to the "packaged" objects.
