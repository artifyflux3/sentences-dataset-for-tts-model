P. Goldberg (interim) [ 1 ] Location Cambridge , Massachusetts , US Enrollment 1,990 (2019) [ 2 ] Faculty 135 [ 3 ] USNWR ranking 6th (tie) (2025) [ 4 ] Bar pass rate 99.4% (2021) [ 5 ] Website hls .harvard .edu ABA profile Standard 509 Report Harvard Law School ( HLS ) is the law school of Harvard University , a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts . Founded in 1817, Harvard Law School is the oldest law school in continuous operation in the United States.

Each class in the three-year JD program has approximately 560 students, which is among the largest of the top 150 ranked law schools in the United States.

[ 6 ] The first-year class is broken into seven sections of approximately 80 students, who take most first-year classes together. Aside from the JD program, Harvard also awards both LLM and SJD degrees.

HLS is home to the world's largest academic law library .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The school has an estimated 115 full-time faculty members.

[ 3 ] According to Harvard Law's 2020 ABA -required disclosures, 99% of 2019 graduates passed the bar exam.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] The school's graduates accounted for more than one-quarter of all Supreme Court clerks between 2000 and 2010, more than any other law school in the United States.

[ 12 ] History [ edit ] Founding [ edit ] Harvard Law School's founding is traced to the establishment of a 'law department' at Harvard in 1819.

[ 13 ] Dating the founding to the year of the creation of the law department makes Harvard Law School the oldest continuously operating law school in the United States.

William & Mary Law School opened first in 1779, but it closed due to the American Civil War , reopening in 1920.

[ 14 ] The University of Maryland School of Law was chartered in 1816 but did not begin classes until 1824, and it also closed during the Civil War.

[ 15 ] Portrait of Isaac Royall Jr.

, painted in 1769 by J.S. Copley The founding of the law department came two years after the establishment of Harvard's first endowed professorship in law, funded by a bequest from the estate of wealthy slave-owner Isaac Royall Jr.

, in 1817.

[ 13 ] Royall left roughly 1,000 acres of land in Massachusetts to Harvard when he died in exile in Nova Scotia, where he fled to as a Loyalist during the American Revolution , in 1781, "to be appropriated towards the endowing a Professor of Laws ... or a Professor of Physick and Anatomy, whichever the said overseers and Corporation [of the college] shall judge to be best." [ 13 ] The value of the land, when fully liquidated in 1809, was $2,938; the Harvard Corporation allocated $400 from the income generated by those funds to create the Royall Professorship of Law in 1815.

[ 13 ] The Royalls were so involved in the slave trade, that "the labor of slaves underwrote the teaching of law in Cambridge." [ 16 ] The dean of the law school traditionally held the Royall chair; deans Elena Kagan and Martha Minow declined the Royall chair due to its origins in the proceeds of slavery.

The Royall family's coat of arms , which shows three stacked wheat sheaves on a blue background, was adopted as part of the law school's arms in 1936, topped with the university's motto ( Veritas , Latin for 'truth').

[ 17 ] Until the school began investigating its connections with slavery in the 2010s, most alumni and faculty at the time were unaware of the origins of the arms.

[ 18 ] In March 2016, following requests by students, the school decided to remove the emblem because of its association with slavery.

[ 19 ] In November 2019, Harvard announced that a working group had been tasked to develop a new emblem.

[ 20 ] In August 2021, the new Harvard Law School emblem was introduced.

[ 21 ] Royall's Medford estate, the Isaac Royall House , is now a museum which features the only remaining slave quarters in the northeast United States. In 2019, the government of Antigua and Barbuda requested reparations from Harvard Law School on the grounds that it benefitted from Royall's enslavement of people in the country.

[ 22 ] Growth [ edit ] By 1827, the school, with one faculty member, was struggling.

Nathan Dane , a prominent alumnus of the college, then endowed the Dane Professorship of Law, insisting that it be given to then Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story . For a while, the school was called "Dane Law School." [ 23 ] In 1829, John H. Ashmun, son of Eli Porter Ashmun and brother of George Ashmun , accepted a professorship and closed his Northampton Law School , with many of his students following him to Harvard.

[ 24 ] Story's belief in the need for an elite law school based on merit and dedicated to public service helped build the school's reputation at the time, although the contours of these beliefs have not been consistent throughout its history. Enrollment remained low through the 19th century as university legal education was considered to be of little added benefit to apprenticeships in legal practice. After first trying lowered admissions standards, in 1848 HLS eliminated admissions requirements.

[ 25 ] In 1869, HLS also eliminated examination requirements.

[ 25 ] In the 1870s, under Dean Christopher Columbus Langdell , HLS introduced what has become the standard first-year curriculum for American law schools – including classes in contracts , property , torts , criminal law , and civil procedure . At Harvard, Langdell also developed the case method of teaching law, now the dominant pedagogical model at U.S. law schools. Langdell's notion that law could be studied as a "science" gave university legal education a reason for being distinct from vocational preparation. Critics at first defended the old lecture method because it was faster and cheaper and made fewer demands on faculty and students. Advocates said the case method had a sounder theoretical basis in scientific research and the inductive method. Langdell's graduates became leading professors at other law schools where they introduced the case method. The method was facilitated by casebooks. From its founding in 1900, the Association of American Law Schools promoted the case method in law schools that sought accreditation .

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] 20th century [ edit ] Langdell Hall During the 20th century, Harvard Law School was known for its competitiveness. For example, Bob Berring called it "a samurai ring where you can test your swordsmanship against the swordsmanship of the strongest intellectual warriors from around the nation." [ 28 ] When Langdell developed the original law school curriculum, Harvard President Charles Eliot told him to make it "hard and long." [ 29 ] [ 30 ] An urban legend holds that incoming students are told to "Look to your left, look to your right, because one of you won't be here by the end of the year." [ 31 ] Scott Turow 's memoir One L and John Jay Osborn 's novel The Paper Chase describe such an environment. Trailing many of its peers, Harvard Law did not admit women as students until 1950, for the class of 1953.

[ 32 ] Eleanor Kerlow's book Poisoned Ivy: How Egos, Ideology, and Power Politics Almost Ruined Harvard Law School criticized the school for a 1980s political dispute between newer and older faculty members over accusations of insensitivity to minority and feminist issues. Divisiveness over such issues as political correctness lent the school the title "Beirut on the Charles." [ 33 ] In Broken Contract: A Memoir of Harvard Law School , Richard Kahlenberg criticized the school for driving students away from public interest and toward work in high-paying law firms. Kahlenberg's criticisms are supported by Granfield and Koenig's study, which found that "students [are directed] toward service in the most prestigious law firms, both because they learn that such positions are their destiny and because the recruitment network that results from collective eminence makes these jobs extremely easy to obtain." [ 34 ] The school has also been criticized for its large first year class sizes (at one point there were 140 students per classroom; in 2001 there were 80), a cold and aloof administration, [ 35 ] and an inaccessible faculty. The latter stereotype is a central plot element of The Paper Chase and appears in Legally Blonde .

In response to the above criticisms, HLS eventually implemented the once-criticized [ 30 ] but now dominant approach pioneered by Dean Robert Hutchins at Yale Law School , of shifting the competitiveness to the admissions process while making law school itself a more cooperative experience. Robert Granfield and Thomas Koenig's 1992 study of Harvard Law students that appeared in The Sociological Quarterly found that students "learn to cooperate with rather than compete against classmates," and that contrary to "less eminent" law schools, students "learn that professional success is available for all who attend, and that therefore, only neurotic 'gunners' try to outdo peers." [ 34 ] 21st century [ edit ] Martha Minow , dean, 2009–2017 Under Kagan, the second half of the 2000s saw significant academic changes since the implementation of the Langdell curriculum. In 2006, the faculty voted unanimously to approve a new first-year curriculum, placing greater emphasis on problem-solving, administrative law, and international law. The new curriculum was implemented in stages over the next several years, [ 36 ] [ 37 ] with the last new course, a first-year practice-oriented problem-solving workshop, being instituted in January 2010. In late 2008, the faculty decided that the school should move to an Honors/Pass/Low Pass/Fail (H/P/LP/F) grading system, much like those in place at Yale and at Stanford Law School . The system applied to half the courses taken by students in the Class of 2010 and fully started with the Class of 2011.

[ 38 ] In 2009, Kagan was appointed solicitor general of the United States by President Barack Obama and resigned the deanship. On June 11, 2009, Harvard University president, Drew Gilpin Faust named Martha Minow as the new dean. She assumed the position on July 1, 2009. On January 3, 2017, Minow announced that she would conclude her tenure as dean at the end of the academic year.

[ 39 ] In June 2017, John F. Manning was named as the new dean, effective as of July 1, 2017.

[ 40 ] In September 2017, the school unveiled a plaque acknowledging the indirect role played by slavery in its history: In honor of the enslaved whose labor created wealth that made possible the founding of Harvard Law School May we pursue the highest ideals of law and justice in their memory .

[ 41 ] In 2025, an original copy of the Magna Carta was found, kept in Harvard's library for nearly 80 years.

[ 42 ] Coat of arms [ edit ] The coat of arms of Harvard Law School which was retired in 2016 The governing body of the university voted to retire the law school's coat of arms . The school's shield incorporated the three garbs of wheat from the armorial bearings of Isaac Royall Jr.

, a university benefactor who had endowed the first professorship in the law school. The shield had become a source of contention among a group of law school students, who objected to the Royall family's history of slave ownership.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] The president of the university and dean of the law school, acting upon the recommendation of a committee formed to study the issue, ultimately agreed with its majority decision, [ 45 ] that the shield was inconsistent with the values of both the university and the law school. Their recommendation was ultimately adopted by the Harvard Corporation and on March 15, 2016, the shield was ordered retired.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] On August 23, 2021, it was announced that a new emblem was approved by the Harvard Corporation. The new design features Harvard's traditional motto, Veritas ( Latin for 'truth'), resting above the Latin phrase Lex et Iustitia , meaning 'law and justice'. According to the HLS Shield Working Group's final report, the expanding or diverging lines, some with no obvious beginning or end, are meant to convey a sense of broad scope or great distance — the limitlessness of the school's work and mission. The radial lines also allude to the latitudinal and longitudinal lines that define the arc of the earth, conveying the global reach of the Law School's community and impact. The multifaceted, radiating form — a form inspired by architectural details found in both Austin Hall and Hauser Hall — seeks to convey dynamism, complexity, inclusiveness, connectivity, and strength.

[ 49 ] Rankings [ edit ] HLS was ranked tied for sixth best law school in the United States by U.S. News & World Report in its 2023 rankings.

[ 50 ] HLS was ranked first in the world by QS World University Rankings in 2023.

[ 51 ] It is ranked first in the world by the 2019 Academic Ranking of World Universities.

[ 52 ] In November 2022, the law school made a joint decision along with Yale Law School to withdraw from the U.S. News & World Report Best Law Schools rankings, citing the system's "flawed methodology." [ 53 ] Student life [ edit ] Student organizations [ edit ] Harvard Law School has more than 90 student organizations that are active on campus.

[ 54 ] These organizations include the student-edited journals, Harvard Law Record , and the HLS Drama Society, which organizes the annual Harvard Law School Parody , the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau as well as other political, social, service, and athletic groups.

HLS Student Government is the primary governing, advocacy, and representative body for Law School students. In addition, students are represented at the university level by the Harvard Graduate Council .
