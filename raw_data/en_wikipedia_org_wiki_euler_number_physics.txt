For the mathematical constant, see Euler's number .

The Euler number ( Eu ) is a dimensionless number used in fluid flow calculations. It expresses the relationship between a local pressure drop caused by a restriction and the kinetic energy per volume of the flow, and is used to characterize energy losses in the flow, where a perfect frictionless flow corresponds to an Euler number of 0.  The inverse of the Euler number is referred to as the Ruark Number with the symbol Ru .

The Euler number is defined as E u = pressure forces inertial forces = ( pressure ) ( area ) ( mass ) ( acceleration ) = ( p u − − p d ) L 2 ( ρ ρ L 3 ) ( v 2 / L ) = p u − − p d ρ ρ v 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {Eu} ={\frac {\text{pressure forces}}{\text{inertial forces}}}={\frac {({\text{pressure}})({\text{area}})}{({\text{mass}})({\text{acceleration}})}}={\frac {(p_{u}-p_{d})\,L^{2}}{(\rho L^{3})(v^{2}/L)}}={\frac {p_{u}-p_{d}}{\rho v^{2}}}} where ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is the density of the fluid.

p u {\displaystyle p_{u}} is the upstream pressure.

p d {\displaystyle p_{d}} is the downstream pressure.

v {\displaystyle v} is a characteristic velocity of the flow.

An alternative definition of the Euler number is given by Shah and Sekulic [ 1 ] E u = pressure drop dynamic head = Δ Δ p ρ ρ v 2 / 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {Eu} ={\frac {\text{pressure drop}}{\text{dynamic head}}}={\frac {\Delta p}{\rho v^{2}/2}}} where Δ Δ p {\displaystyle \Delta p} is the pressure drop = p u − − p d {\displaystyle =p_{u}-p_{d}} See also [ edit ] Darcy–Weisbach equation is a different way of interpreting the Euler number Reynolds number for use in flow analysis and similarity of flows Cavitation number a similarly formulated number with different meaning References [ edit ] ^ Shah and Sekulic, Fundamentals of Heat Exchanger Design, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 2003 Further reading [ edit ] Batchelor, G.
