Named after the physicist and mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton , a Hamiltonian vector field is a geometric manifestation of Hamilton's equations in classical mechanics . The integral curves of a Hamiltonian vector field represent solutions to the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian form. The diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold arising from the flow of a Hamiltonian vector field are known as canonical transformations in physics and (Hamiltonian) symplectomorphisms in mathematics.

[ 1 ] Hamiltonian vector fields can be defined more generally on an arbitrary Poisson manifold . The Lie bracket of two Hamiltonian vector fields corresponding to functions f {\displaystyle f} and g {\displaystyle g} on the manifold is itself a Hamiltonian vector field, with the Hamiltonian given by the Poisson bracket of f {\displaystyle f} and g {\displaystyle g} .

Definition [ edit ] Suppose that ( M , ω ω ) {\displaystyle (M,\omega )} is a symplectic manifold . Since the symplectic form ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is nondegenerate, it sets up a fiberwise-linear isomorphism ω ω : T M → → T ∗ ∗ M , {\displaystyle \omega :TM\to T^{*}M,} between the tangent bundle T M {\displaystyle TM} and the cotangent bundle T ∗ ∗ M {\displaystyle T^{*}M} , with the inverse Ω Ω : T ∗ ∗ M → → T M , Ω Ω = ω ω − − 1 .

{\displaystyle \Omega :T^{*}M\to TM,\quad \Omega =\omega ^{-1}.} Therefore, one-forms on a symplectic manifold M {\displaystyle M} may be identified with vector fields and every differentiable function H : M → → R {\displaystyle H:M\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } determines a unique vector field X H {\displaystyle X_{H}} , called the Hamiltonian vector field with the Hamiltonian H {\displaystyle H} , by defining for every vector field Y {\displaystyle Y} on M {\displaystyle M} , d H ( Y ) = ω ω ( X H , Y ) .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} H(Y)=\omega (X_{H},Y).} Note : Some authors define the Hamiltonian vector field with the opposite sign. One has to be mindful of varying conventions in physical and mathematical literature.

Examples [ edit ] Suppose that M {\displaystyle M} is a 2 n {\displaystyle 2n} -dimensional symplectic manifold. Then locally, one may choose canonical coordinates ( q 1 , ⋯ ⋯ , q n , p 1 , ⋯ ⋯ , p n ) {\displaystyle (q^{1},\cdots ,q^{n},p_{1},\cdots ,p_{n})} on M {\displaystyle M} , in which the symplectic form is expressed as: [ 2 ] ω ω = ∑ ∑ i d q i ∧ ∧ d p i , {\displaystyle \omega =\sum _{i}\mathrm {d} q^{i}\wedge \mathrm {d} p_{i},} where d {\displaystyle \operatorname {d} } denotes the exterior derivative and ∧ ∧ {\displaystyle \wedge } denotes the exterior product . Then the Hamiltonian vector field with Hamiltonian H {\displaystyle H} takes the form: [ 1 ] X H = ( ∂ ∂ H ∂ ∂ p i , − − ∂ ∂ H ∂ ∂ q i ) = Ω Ω d H , {\displaystyle \mathrm {X} _{H}=\left({\frac {\partial H}{\partial p_{i}}},-{\frac {\partial H}{\partial q^{i}}}\right)=\Omega \,\mathrm {d} H,} where Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is a 2 n × × 2 n {\displaystyle 2n\times 2n} square matrix Ω Ω = [ 0 I n − − I n 0 ] , {\displaystyle \Omega ={\begin{bmatrix}0&I_{n}\\-I_{n}&0\\\end{bmatrix}},} and d H = [ ∂ ∂ H ∂ ∂ q i ∂ ∂ H ∂ ∂ p i ] .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} H={\begin{bmatrix}{\frac {\partial H}{\partial q^{i}}}\\{\frac {\partial H}{\partial p_{i}}}\end{bmatrix}}.} The matrix Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is frequently denoted with J {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} } .

Suppose that M = R 2 n {\displaystyle M=\mathbb {R} ^{2n}} is the 2 n {\displaystyle 2n} -dimensional symplectic vector space with (global) canonical coordinates.

If H = p i {\displaystyle H=p_{i}} then X H = ∂ ∂ / ∂ ∂ q i ; {\displaystyle X_{H}=\partial /\partial q^{i};} if H = q i {\displaystyle H=q_{i}} then X H = − − ∂ ∂ / ∂ ∂ p i ; {\displaystyle X_{H}=-\partial /\partial p^{i};} if H = 1 2 ∑ ∑ ( p i ) 2 {\textstyle H={\frac {1}{2}}\sum (p_{i})^{2}} then X H = ∑ ∑ p i ∂ ∂ / ∂ ∂ q i ; {\textstyle X_{H}=\sum p_{i}\partial /\partial q^{i};} if H = 1 2 ∑ ∑ a i j q i q j , a i j = a j i {\textstyle H={\frac {1}{2}}\sum a_{ij}q^{i}q^{j},a_{ij}=a_{ji}} then X H = − − ∑ ∑ a i j q i ∂ ∂ / ∂ ∂ p j .

{\textstyle X_{H}=-\sum a_{ij}q_{i}\partial /\partial p^{j}.} Properties [ edit ] The assignment f ↦ ↦ X f {\displaystyle f\mapsto X_{f}} is linear , so that the sum of two Hamiltonian functions transforms into the sum of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector fields.

Suppose that ( q 1 , ⋯ ⋯ , q n , p 1 , ⋯ ⋯ , p n ) {\displaystyle (q^{1},\cdots ,q^{n},p_{1},\cdots ,p_{n})} are canonical coordinates on M {\displaystyle M} (see above). Then a curve γ γ ( t ) = ( q ( t ) , p ( t ) ) {\displaystyle \gamma (t)=(q(t),p(t))} is an integral curve of the Hamiltonian vector field X H {\displaystyle X_{H}} if and only if it is a solution of Hamilton's equations : [ 1 ] q ˙ ˙ i = ∂ ∂ H ∂ ∂ p i p ˙ ˙ i = − − ∂ ∂ H ∂ ∂ q i .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\dot {q}}^{i}&={\frac {\partial H}{\partial p_{i}}}\\{\dot {p}}_{i}&=-{\frac {\partial H}{\partial q^{i}}}.\end{aligned}}} The Hamiltonian H {\displaystyle H} is constant along the integral curves, because ⟨ ⟨ d H , γ γ ˙ ˙ ⟩ ⟩ = ω ω ( X H ( γ γ ) , X H ( γ γ ) ) = 0 {\displaystyle \langle dH,{\dot {\gamma }}\rangle =\omega (X_{H}(\gamma ),X_{H}(\gamma ))=0} . That is, H ( γ γ ( t ) ) {\displaystyle H(\gamma (t))} is actually independent of t {\displaystyle t} . This property corresponds to the conservation of energy in Hamiltonian mechanics .

More generally, if two functions F {\displaystyle F} and H {\displaystyle H} have a zero Poisson bracket (cf. below), then F {\displaystyle F} is constant along the integral curves of H {\displaystyle H} , and similarly, H {\displaystyle H} is constant along the integral curves of F {\displaystyle F} . This fact is the abstract mathematical principle behind Noether's theorem .

[ nb 1 ] The symplectic form ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is preserved by the Hamiltonian flow. Equivalently, the Lie derivative L X H ω ω = 0 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X_{H}}\omega =0} .

Poisson bracket [ edit ] The notion of a Hamiltonian vector field leads to a skew-symmetric bilinear operation on the differentiable functions on a symplectic manifold M {\displaystyle M} , the Poisson bracket , defined by the formula { f , g } = ω ω ( X g , X f ) = d g ( X f ) = L X f g {\displaystyle \{f,g\}=\omega (X_{g},X_{f})=dg(X_{f})={\mathcal {L}}_{X_{f}}g} where L X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X}} denotes the Lie derivative along a vector field X {\displaystyle X} . Moreover, one can check that the following identity holds: [ 1 ] X { f , g } = − − [ X f , X g ] {\displaystyle X_{\{f,g\}}=-[X_{f},X_{g}]} , where the right hand side represents the Lie bracket of the Hamiltonian vector fields with Hamiltonians f {\displaystyle f} and g {\displaystyle g} . As a consequence (a proof at Poisson bracket ), the Poisson bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity : [ 1 ] { { f , g } , h } + { { g , h } , f } + { { h , f } , g } = 0 {\displaystyle \{\{f,g\},h\}+\{\{g,h\},f\}+\{\{h,f\},g\}=0} , which means that the vector space of differentiable functions on M {\displaystyle M} , endowed with the Poisson bracket, has the structure of a Lie algebra over R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } , and the assignment f ↦ ↦ X f {\displaystyle f\mapsto X_{f}} is a Lie algebra homomorphism , whose kernel consists of the locally constant functions (constant functions if M {\displaystyle M} is connected).
