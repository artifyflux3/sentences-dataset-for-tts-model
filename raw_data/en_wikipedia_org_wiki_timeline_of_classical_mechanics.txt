He therefore tests the equivalence principle 1021 – Al-Biruni uses three orthogonal coordinates to describe point in space [ 4 ] 1100–1138 – Avempace develops the concept of a fatigue, which according to Shlomo Pines is precursor to Leibnizian idea of force [ 5 ] 1100–1165 – Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi discovers that force is proportional to acceleration rather than speed, a fundamental law in classical mechanics [ 6 ] 1340–1358 – Jean Buridan develops the theory of impetus 14th century – Oxford Calculators and French collaborators prove the mean speed theorem 14th century – Nicole Oresme derives the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change.

[ 10 ] 16th century – Domingo de Soto suggests that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium are uniformly accelerated.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Soto, however, did not anticipate many of the qualifications and refinements contained in Galileo's theory of falling bodies. He did not, for instance, recognise, as Galileo did, that a body would fall with a strictly uniform acceleration only in a vacuum, and that it would otherwise eventually reach a uniform terminal velocity 1581 – Galileo Galilei notices the timekeeping property of the pendulum 1589 – Galileo Galilei uses balls rolling on inclined planes to show that different weights fall with the same acceleration 1638 – Galileo Galilei publishes Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences (which were materials science and kinematics ) where he develops, amongst other things, Galilean transformation 1644 – René Descartes suggests an early form of the law of conservation of momentum 1645 – Ismaël Bullialdus argues that "gravity" weakens as the inverse square of the distance [ 13 ] 1651 – Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi discover the Coriolis effect 1658 – Christiaan Huygens experimentally discovers that balls placed anywhere inside an inverted cycloid reach the lowest point of the 	cycloid in the same time and thereby experimentally shows that the cycloid is the tautochrone 1668 – John Wallis suggests the law of conservation of momentum 1673 – Christiaan Huygens publishes his Horologium Oscillatorium .

In this, he summarized and extended the work of his predecessors 1803 – Louis Poinsot develops idea of angular momentum conservation (this result was previously known only in the case of conservation of areal velocity ) 1813 – Peter Ewart supports the idea of the conservation of energy in his paper "On the measure of moving force" 1821 – William Hamilton begins his analysis of Hamilton's characteristic function and Hamilton–Jacobi equation 1829 – Carl Friedrich Gauss introduces Gauss's principle of least constraint 1834 – Carl Jacobi discovers his uniformly rotating self-gravitating ellipsoids 1834 – Louis Poinsot notes an instance of the intermediate axis theorem [ 16 ] 1835 – William Hamilton states Hamilton's canonical equations of motion 1838 – Liouville begins work on Liouville's theorem 1841 – Julius von Mayer , an amateur scientist, writes a paper on the conservation of energy but his lack of academic training leads to a priority dispute .

, "Al-Biruni" , MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive , University of St Andrews : "One of the most important of al-Biruni's many texts is Shadows which he is thought to have written around 1021. [...] Shadows is an extremely important source for our knowledge of the history of mathematics, astronomy, and physics. It also contains important ideas such as the idea that acceleration is connected with non-uniform motion, using three rectangular coordinates to define a point in 3-space, and ideas that some see as anticipating the introduction of polar coordinates." ^ Shlomo Pines (1964), "La dynamique d’Ibn Bajja", in Mélanges Alexandre Koyré , I, 442–468 [462, 468], Paris.
