Diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon: pure forms of the same element that differ in crystalline structure.

Allotropy or allotropism (from Ancient Greek ἄλλος (allos) ' other ' and τρόπος (tropos) ' manner, form ' ) is the property of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical state , known as allotropes of the elements. Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element: the atoms of the element are bonded together in different manners.

[ 1 ] For example, the allotropes of carbon include diamond (the carbon atoms are bonded together to form a cubic lattice of tetrahedra ), graphite (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a hexagonal lattice ), graphene (single sheets of graphite), and fullerenes (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations).

The term allotropy is used for elements only, not for compounds . The more general term, used for any compound, is polymorphism , although its use is usually restricted to solid materials such as crystals. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same physical phase (the state of matter, such as a solid , liquid or gas ). The differences between these states of matter would not alone constitute examples of allotropy. Allotropes of chemical elements are frequently referred to as polymorphs or as phases of the element.

For some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae or different crystalline structures, as well as a difference in physical phase; for example, two allotropes of oxygen ( dioxygen , O 2 , and ozone , O 3 ) can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Other elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different physical phases; for example, phosphorus has numerous solid allotropes , which all revert to the same P 4 form when melted to the liquid state.

History [ edit ] The concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1840 by the Swedish scientist Baron Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The term is derived from Greek άλλοτροπἱα (allotropia) ' variability, changeableness ' .

[ 4 ] After the acceptance of Avogadro's hypothesis in 1860, it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules, and two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as O 2 and O 3 .

[ 3 ] In the early 20th century, it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure.

By 1912, Ostwald noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of polymorphism known for compounds, and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism.

[ 5 ] [ 3 ] Although many other chemists have repeated this advice, IUPAC and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only.

[ 6 ] Differences in properties of an element's allotropes [ edit ] Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e., pressure , light , and temperature . Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, iron changes from a body-centered cubic structure ( ferrite ) to a face-centered cubic structure ( austenite ) above 906 °C, and tin undergoes a modification known as tin pest from a metallic form to a semimetallic form below 13.2 °C (55.8 °F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O 3 ) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O 2 ).

List of allotropes [ edit ] Typically, elements capable of variable coordination number and/or oxidation states tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms. Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to catenate .

Examples of allotropes include: Non-metals [ edit ] Element Allotropes Carbon Diamond – an extremely hard, transparent crystal, with the carbon atoms arranged in a tetrahedral lattice. A poor electrical conductor. An excellent thermal conductor.

Lonsdaleite – also called hexagonal diamond.

Graphene – is the basic structural element of other allotropes, nanotubes, charcoal, and fullerenes.

Q-carbon – a ferromagnetic, tough, and brilliant crystal structure that is harder and brighter than diamonds.

[ dubious – discuss ] Graphite – a semimetallic, soft, black, flaky solid, a good electrical conductor. The C atoms are bonded in flat hexagonal lattices ( graphene ), which are then layered in sheets.

Linear acetylenic carbon (carbyne) Amorphous carbon Fullerenes , including buckminsterfullerene , also known as "buckyballs", such as C 60 .

Carbon nanotubes – allotropes having a cylindrical nanostructure.

Schwarzites Cyclocarbon Glassy carbon Superdense carbon allotropes – proposed allotropes Nitrogen Dinitrogen – by far the most common and stable form of nitrogen, found in the air.

Hexazine Hexanitrogen Octaazacubane Tetranitrogen Trinitrogen Solid nitrogen Phosphorus White phosphorus – crystalline solid of tetraphosphorus (P 4 ) molecules Red phosphorus – amorphous polymeric solid Scarlet phosphorus Violet phosphorus with monoclinic crystalline structure Black phosphorus – semiconductor, analogous to graphite Diphosphorus – gaseous form composed of P 2 molecules, stable between 1200 °C and 2000 °C; created e.g. by dissociation of P 4 molecules of white phosphorus at around 827 °C Oxygen Dioxygen , O 2 – colorless (faint blue liquid and solid) Ozone , O 3 – blue Tetraoxygen , O 4 – metastable Octaoxygen , O 8 – red Sulfur Cyclo-Pentasulfur, Cyclo-S 5 Cyclo-Hexasulfur, Cyclo-S 6 Cyclo-Heptasulfur, Cyclo-S 7 Cyclo-Octasulfur, Cyclo-S 8 Selenium "Red selenium", cyclo-Se 8 Gray selenium, polymeric Se Black selenium, irregular polymeric rings up to 1000 atoms long Monoclinic selenium, dark red transparent crystals Spin isomers of hydrogen Orthohydrogen, H 2 with nuclear spins aligned parallel Parahydrogen, H 2 with nuclear spins aligned antiparallel These nuclear spin isomers have sometimes been described as allotropes, notably by the committee which awarded the 1932 Nobel prize to Werner Heisenberg for quantum mechanics and singled out the "allotropic forms of hydrogen" as its most notable application.

Lanthanides and actinides [ edit ] Phase diagram of the actinide elements.

Cerium , samarium , dysprosium and ytterbium have three allotropes.

Praseodymium , neodymium , gadolinium and terbium have two allotropes.

Plutonium has six distinct solid allotropes under "normal" pressures. Their densities vary within a ratio of some 4:3, which vastly complicates all kinds of work with the metal (particularly casting, machining, and storage). A seventh plutonium allotrope exists at very high pressures. The transuranium metals Np, Am, and Cm are also allotropic.

Promethium , americium , berkelium and californium have three allotropes each.

[ 20 ] Nanoallotropes [ edit ] In 2017, the concept of nanoallotropy was proposed.

[ 21 ] Nanoallotropes, or allotropes of nanomaterials , are nanoporous materials that have the same chemical composition (e.g., Au), but differ in their architecture at the nanoscale (that is, on a scale 10 to 100 times the dimensions of individual atoms).

[ 22 ] Such nanoallotropes may help create ultra-small electronic devices and find other industrial applications.

[ 22 ] The different nanoscale architectures translate into different properties, as was demonstrated for surface-enhanced Raman scattering performed on several different nanoallotropes of gold.

[ 21 ] A two-step method for generating nanoallotropes was also created.

From p. 14: "Om det ock passar väl för att uttrycka förhållandet emellan myrsyrad ethyloxid och ättiksyrad methyloxid, så är det icke passande för de olika tillstånd hos de enkla kropparne, hvari dessa blifva af skiljaktiga egenskaper, och torde för dem böra ersättas af en bättre vald benämning, t. ex.

Allotropi (af αλλότροπος , som betyder:  af olika beskaffenhet) eller allotropiskt tillstånd ." (If it [i.e., the word isomer ] is also well suited to express the relation between formic acid ethyl oxide [i.e., ethyl formate] and acetic acid methyloxide [i.e., methyl acetate], then it [i.e., the word isomers ] is not suitable for different conditions of simple substances, where these [substances] transform to have different properties, and [therefore the word isomers ] should be replaced, in their case, by a better chosen name; for example, Allotropy (from αλλότροπος , which means: of different nature) or allotropic condition .)

From p. 13: "Wenn es sich auch noch gut eignet, um das Verhältniss zwischen ameisensaurem Äthyloxyd und essigsaurem Methyloxyd auszudrücken, so ist es nicht passend für ungleiche Zustände bei Körpern, in welchen diese verschiedene Eigenschaften annehmen, und dürfte für diese durch eine besser gewählte Benennung zu ersetzen sein, z. B. durch Allotropie (von αλλότροπος , welches bedeutet:  von ungleicher Beschaffenheit), oder durch allotropischen Zustand ." (Even if it [i.e., the word isomer ] is still well suited to express the relation between ethyl formate and methyl acetate, then it is not appropriate for the distinct conditions in the case of substances where these [substances] assume different properties, and for these, [the word isomer ] may be replaced with a better chosen designation, e.g., with Allotropy (from αλλότροπος , which means: of distinct character), or with allotropic condition .)

From p. 104:  "Substances are known which exist not only in two, but even in three, four or five different solid forms; no limitation to the number is known to exist.  Such substances are called polymorphous.  The name allotropy is commonly employed in the same connexion, especially when the substance is an element.  There is no real reason for making this distinction, and it is preferable to allow the second less common name to die out." ^ Jensen 2006, citing Addison, W. E.
