[ 5 ] AUB is governed by a private, autonomous board of trustees and offers programs leading to bachelor's , master's , MD , and PhD degrees.

AUB has an operating budget of $423 million [ 6 ] with an endowment of approximately $768 million.

[ 5 ] The campus is composed of 64 buildings, including the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC, formerly known as AUH – American University Hospital) [ 7 ] (420 beds), four libraries, three museums and seven dormitories. Almost one-fifth of AUB's students attended secondary school or university outside Lebanon before coming to AUB. AUB graduates reside in more than 120 countries worldwide. The language of instruction is English . Degrees awarded at the university are officially registered with the New York Board of Regents .

History [ edit ] Daniel L. Bliss, who helped found Syrian Protestant College (American University of Beirut) and was its first president Buildings of American University, Beirut, between 1898 and 1914 On January 23, 1862, W. M. Thomson proposed to a meeting of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions that a college of higher learning, that would include medical training, should be established in Beirut with Dr.

Daniel Bliss as its president.

[ 8 ] On April 24, 1863, while Bliss was raising money for the new college in the United States and England, the State of New York granted a charter for the Syrian Protestant College. The college, which was renamed the American University of Beirut in 1920, opened with a class of 16 students on December 3, 1866. Bliss served as its first president, from 1866 until 1902.

[ 9 ] In the beginning Arabic was used as the language of instruction because it was the common language of the ethnic groups of the region, and prospective students needed to be fluent in Ottoman Turkish or in French as well as in English. In 1887 the language of instruction became English.

[ 10 ] AUB alumni have had an impact on the region and the world for many years. For example, 20 AUB alumni were delegates to the signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945—more than any other university in the world. AUB graduates continue to serve in leadership positions as presidents of their countries, prime ministers, members of parliament, ambassadors, governors of central banks, presidents and deans of colleges and universities, academics, business people, scientists, engineers, doctors, teachers, and nurses. They work in governments, the private sector, and in nongovernmental organizations.

[ citation needed ] During the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) AUB pursued various means to preserve the continuity of studies, including enrollment agreements with universities in the United States. In 1982 acting president David S. Dodge was kidnapped on campus by pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim extremists.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] On January 18, 1984, AUB President Malcolm H. Kerr was murdered outside his office by members of Islamic Jihad , which preceded the Hezbollah .

[ 13 ] In 1984 and 1985 a number of university staff were kidnapped, including electrical engineering professor Frank Regier, professor J. Leigh Douglas, professor Philip Padfield, professor Joseph Cicippio, dean of the faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences Thomas Sutherland (held captive from 1985 to 1991), director David Jacobsen, and librarian Peter Kilburn (killed by his captors).

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] In all, 30 university-connected people were kidnapped during the war.

[ 11 ] On 8 November 1991 a car-bomb demolished the main administrative building, killing one member of staff.

[ 16 ] The New York Times reported that it was believed to have been set off by pro-Iranian Muslim fundamentalists.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Another source states that Hassan Abd al-Nabih, a senior intelligence officer in the South Lebanon Army was accused of being responsible.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] The university of Beirut (AUB) established a new campus, AUB Mediterraneo, in Paphos , Cyprus, in 2024. The official inauguration took place on September 4, 2024.

It also features works by Haidar Hamaoui (b. 1937), Chucrallah Fattouh (b. 1956), and Robert Khoury (b. 1923).
