Early life and education
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michio_Kaku&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and education")]

Kaku was born in 1947 in [San Jose, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California "San Jose, California").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-4) His parents were both [second-generation Japanese-Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisei "Nisei").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-5) According to Kaku, his grandfather came to the United States to participate in the cleanup operation after the [1906 San Francisco earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake "1906 San Francisco earthquake"), and his father and mother were both born in California.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-6) Both his parents were [interned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans "Internment of Japanese Americans") in the [Tule Lake War Relocation Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tule_Lake_War_Relocation_Center "Tule Lake War Relocation Center") during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), where they met and where his elder brother was born.

According to Kaku, he was inspired to pursue a career in physics after seeing a photograph of [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s desk at the time of his death. Kaku was fascinated to learn that Einstein had been unable to complete his [unified field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory "Unified field theory") and resolved to dedicate his life to solving this theory.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-7) For a high school science fair, Kaku built a 2.3 MeV "atom smasher" in his parents' garage. Using scrap metal and 22 miles (35 km) of wire, the device was powerful enough to produce [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter "Antimatter").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-8) It was at this National Science Fair in [Albuquerque, New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico "Albuquerque, New Mexico"), that he attracted the attention of physicist [Edward Teller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller "Edward Teller"), who took Kaku as a protégé, awarding him the Hertz [Engineering Scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_scholarships "Engineering scholarships").

Kaku attended [Harvard College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College "Harvard College"), where he was a resident of [Leverett House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverett_House "Leverett House"), and graduated _[summa cum laude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa\_cum\_laude "Summa cum laude")_ in 1968 as the first in his physics class.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-10) He attended the [Berkeley Radiation Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Radiation_Laboratory "Berkeley Radiation Laboratory") at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley"), receiving a [PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy "Doctor of Philosophy") and holding a lectureship at [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University") in 1972.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-11)

In 1968, during the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"), Kaku, who was about to be drafted, joined the [United States Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "United States Army"), remaining until 1970. He completed his [basic training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Basic_Training "United States Army Basic Training") at [Fort Benning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Benning "Fort Benning"), [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(US_state) "Georgia (US state)"), and advanced infantry training at [Fort Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lewis_(Washington) "Fort Lewis (Washington)"), [Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state) "Washington (state)").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-12) However, he was never deployed to Vietnam.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-13)

As part of the research program in 1975 and 1977 at the department of physics at the [City College of the City University of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York "City College of New York"), Kaku worked on research on [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-15) He was a Visitor and Member (1973 and 1990) at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study "Institute for Advanced Study") in [Princeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton,_New_Jersey "Princeton, New Jersey") and [New York University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University "New York University"). As of 2024, he holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-16)

Between 1970 and 2000, Kaku had papers published in physics journals covering topics such as [superstring theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory "Superstring theory"), [supergravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergravity "Supergravity"), [supersymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry"), and [hadronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron "Hadron") physics.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-17) In 1974, Kaku and Prof. [Keiji Kikkawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiji_Kikkawa "Keiji Kikkawa") of [Osaka University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka_University "Osaka University") co-authored the first papers describing [string theory in a field form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_field_theory "String field theory").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-18)

Kaku is the author of several textbooks on [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory") and [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). An explicit description of the second-quantization of the light-cone string was given by Kaku and [Keiji Kikkawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiji_Kikkawa "Keiji Kikkawa").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-20)

Kaku is most widely known as a popularizer of science[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-bare_url-21) and [physics outreach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_outreach "Physics outreach") specialist. He has written books and appeared on many television programs as well as film. He also hosts a weekly radio program.

Kaku is the host of the weekly one-hour radio program _Exploration_, produced by the Pacifica Foundation's [WBAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBAI "WBAI") in New York. _Exploration_ is syndicated to community and independent radio stations and makes previous broadcasts available on the program's website. Kaku defines the show as dealing with the general topics of science, war, peace, and the environment.

In April 2006, Kaku began broadcasting _Science Fantastic_ on 90 commercial radio stations in the United States. It is syndicated by [Talk Radio Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_Radio_Network "Talk Radio Network") and now reaches 130 radio stations and [America's Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Talk "America's Talk") on [XM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XM_Satellite_Radio "XM Satellite Radio") and was the only nationally syndicated science radio program. When Kaku is busy filming for television, _Science Fantastic_ goes on hiatus, sometimes for several months.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Kaku is also a frequent guest on many programs. As a guest on the program _[Coast to Coast AM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast\_to\_Coast\_AM "Coast to Coast AM")_ on November 30, 2007, he reaffirmed his belief that the existence of extraterrestrial life is a certainty.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-22)[_[non-primary source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No\_original\_research#Primary,\_secondary\_and\_tertiary\_sources "Wikipedia:No original research")_]

Kaku, protesting at Cape Canaveral demonstration, 1987

Kaku has publicly stated his concerns over matters including people denying the [anthropogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment "Human impact on the environment") cause of [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming"), [nuclear armament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_armament "Nuclear armament"), [nuclear power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power "Nuclear power"), and what he believes to be the general misuse of science.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-24) He was critical of the [Cassini–Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens "Cassini–Huygens")[space probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe "Space probe") because of the 72 pounds (33 kg) of [plutonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium "Plutonium") contained in the craft for use by its [radioisotope thermoelectric generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator "Radioisotope thermoelectric generator"). Conscious of the possibility of casualties if the probe's fuel were dispersed into the environment during a malfunction and crash as the probe was making a ["sling-shot" maneuver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist "Gravity assist") around [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), Kaku publicly criticized NASA's risk assessment.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-25) He has spoken on the [dangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome "Kessler syndrome") of [space junk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") and called for more and better monitoring. Kaku is generally a vigorous supporter of the [exploration of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_space "Exploration of space"), believing that the ultimate destiny of the human race may lie in [extrasolar planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet "Extrasolar planet"), but he is critical of some of the cost-ineffective missions and methods of [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Kaku credits his anti–[nuclear war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_war "Nuclear war") position to information he learned via programs he heard on the [Pacifica Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifica_Radio "Pacifica Radio") network during his student years in California. It was during this period that he made the decision to turn away from a career developing the next generation of [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons "Nuclear weapons") in association with his mentor, [Edward Teller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller "Edward Teller"), and instead focused on research, teaching, writing, and accepting media opportunities to educate.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Kaku was a board member of [Peace Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Action "Peace Action") and of radio station [WBAI-FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBAI-FM "WBAI-FM") in New York City, where he originated his long-running program, _Exploration_, that focuses on the issues of science, war, peace, and the environment.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

His remark from an interview in support of [SETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI "SETI"), "We could be in the middle of an intergalactic conversation... and we wouldn't even _know_", is used in the third [Symphony of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_of_Science "Symphony of Science") installment "[Our Place in the Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_of_Science#Our_Place_in_the_Cosmos "Symphony of Science")". Kaku is also a member of the [CuriosityStream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CuriosityStream "CuriosityStream") advisory board.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-26)

Kaku has been married twice.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-27) He has two daughters. He is currently married to Shizue Kaku.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-29)

He enjoys [figure skating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating "Figure skating") as a recreational hobby.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku#cite_note-30)

"Then, by '69, '70, the war was beginning to wind down, and then my doctor found that I had too much sugar in my blood – I said, why didn't you find that before? So I wrote a letter to my draft board saying that I'm 'not fit' to be part of the infantry because there's too much sugar in my blood, I'm borderline, not really diabetic. All of a sudden, it was as if a voice up there said, 'I'm going to give you back your life. You were destined to die on some unnamed hill in Vietnam; unsung, just buried in mud, forgotten by everybody. That was your destiny.' But something happened; somebody up there changed their mind."
