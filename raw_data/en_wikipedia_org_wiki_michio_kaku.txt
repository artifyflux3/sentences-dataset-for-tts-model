He is a professor of theoretical physics at the City College of New York and the CUNY Graduate Center . Kaku is the author of several books about physics and related topics and has made frequent appearances on radio, television, and film. He is also a regular contributor to his own blog, as well as other popular media outlets. For his efforts to bridge science and science fiction, he is a 2021 Sir Arthur Clarke Lifetime Achievement Awardee.

[ 1 ] His books Physics of the Impossible (2008), Physics of the Future (2011), The Future of the Mind (2014), and The God Equation: The Quest for a Theory of Everything (2021) became New York Times best sellers . Kaku has hosted several television specials for the BBC , the Discovery Channel , the History Channel , and the Science Channel .

Early life and education [ edit ] Kaku was born in 1947 in San Jose, California .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] His parents were both second-generation Japanese-Americans .

[ 5 ] According to Kaku, his grandfather came to the United States to participate in the cleanup operation after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , and his father and mother were both born in California.

[ 6 ] Both his parents were interned in the Tule Lake War Relocation Center during World War II , where they met and where his elder brother was born.

According to Kaku, he was inspired to pursue a career in physics after seeing a photograph of Albert Einstein 's desk at the time of his death. Kaku was fascinated to learn that Einstein had been unable to complete his unified field theory and resolved to dedicate his life to solving this theory.

[ 7 ] For a high school science fair, Kaku built a 2.3 MeV "atom smasher" in his parents' garage. Using scrap metal and 22 miles (35 km) of wire, the device was powerful enough to produce antimatter .

[ 8 ] It was at this National Science Fair in Albuquerque, New Mexico , that he attracted the attention of physicist Edward Teller , who took Kaku as a protégé, awarding him the Hertz Engineering Scholarship .

Kaku attended Harvard College , where he was a resident of Leverett House , and graduated summa cum laude in 1968 as the first in his physics class.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] He attended the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley , receiving a PhD and holding a lectureship at Princeton University in 1972.

[ 11 ] In 1968, during the Vietnam War , Kaku, who was about to be drafted, joined the United States Army , remaining until 1970. He completed his basic training at Fort Benning , Georgia , and advanced infantry training at Fort Lewis , Washington .

[ 12 ] However, he was never deployed to Vietnam.

[ 13 ] Academic career [ edit ] Kaku at the USA science and engineering festival 2014 at Walter E Washington Convention Center, DC As part of the research program in 1975 and 1977 at the department of physics at the City College of the City University of New York , Kaku worked on research on quantum mechanics .

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] He was a Visitor and Member (1973 and 1990)  at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and New York University .  As of 2024, he holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York.

[ 16 ] Between 1970 and 2000, Kaku had papers published in physics journals covering topics such as superstring theory , supergravity , supersymmetry , and hadronic physics.

[ 17 ] In 1974, Kaku and Prof.

Keiji Kikkawa of Osaka University co-authored the first papers describing string theory in a field form .

[ 18 ] Kaku is the author of several textbooks on string theory and quantum field theory . An explicit description of the second-quantization of the light-cone string was given by Kaku and Keiji Kikkawa .

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Popular science [ edit ] Kaku is most widely known as a popularizer of science [ 21 ] and physics outreach specialist. He has written books and appeared on many television programs as well as film. He also hosts a weekly radio program.

Kaku with his book Physics of the Impossible Radio [ edit ] Kaku at a public event "Campus Party Brazil" Kaku is the host of the weekly one-hour radio program Exploration , produced by the Pacifica Foundation's WBAI in New York.

Exploration is syndicated to community and independent radio stations and makes previous broadcasts available on the program's website. Kaku defines the show as dealing with the general topics of science, war, peace, and the environment.

In April 2006, Kaku began broadcasting Science Fantastic on 90 commercial radio stations in the United States. It is syndicated by Talk Radio Network and now reaches 130 radio stations and America's Talk on XM and was the only nationally syndicated science radio program. When Kaku is busy filming for television, Science Fantastic goes on hiatus, sometimes for several months.

[ citation needed ] Kaku is also a frequent guest on many programs. As a guest on the program Coast to Coast AM on November 30, 2007, he reaffirmed his belief that the existence of extraterrestrial life is a certainty.

Find sources: "Michio Kaku" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Kaku, protesting at Cape Canaveral demonstration, 1987 Kaku has publicly stated his concerns over matters including people denying the anthropogenic cause of global warming , nuclear armament , nuclear power , and what he believes to be the general misuse of science.

[ 24 ] He was critical of the Cassini–Huygens space probe because of the 72 pounds (33 kg) of plutonium contained in the craft for use by its radioisotope thermoelectric generator . Conscious of the possibility of casualties if the probe's fuel were dispersed into the environment during a malfunction and crash as the probe was making a "sling-shot" maneuver around Earth , Kaku publicly criticized NASA's risk assessment.

[ 25 ] He has spoken on the dangers of space junk and called for more and better monitoring. Kaku is generally a vigorous supporter of the exploration of space , believing that the ultimate destiny of the human race may lie in extrasolar planets , but he is critical of some of the cost-ineffective missions and methods of NASA .

[ citation needed ] Kaku credits his anti– nuclear war position to information he learned via programs he heard on the Pacifica Radio network during his student years in California. It was during this period that he made the decision to turn away from a career developing the next generation of nuclear weapons in association with his mentor, Edward Teller , and instead focused on research, teaching, writing, and accepting media opportunities to educate.

[ citation needed ] Kaku was a board member of Peace Action and of radio station WBAI-FM in New York City, where he originated his long-running program, Exploration , that focuses on the issues of science, war, peace, and the environment.

[ citation needed ] His remark from an interview in support of SETI , "We could be in the middle of an intergalactic conversation... and we wouldn't even know ", is used in the third Symphony of Science installment " Our Place in the Cosmos ". Kaku is also a member of the CuriosityStream advisory board.

[ 26 ] Personal life [ edit ] Kaku has been married twice.

[ 27 ] He has two daughters. He is currently married to Shizue Kaku.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] He enjoys figure skating as a recreational hobby.

^ Physicist Dr. Michio Kaku captivates student audience BY SANDHIYA KANNAN / March 27, 2014. "Then, by '69, '70, the war was beginning to wind down, and then my doctor found that I had too much sugar in my blood – I said, why didn't you find that before? So I wrote a letter to my draft board saying that I'm 'not fit' to be part of the infantry because there's too much sugar in my blood, I'm borderline, not really diabetic. All of a sudden, it was as if a voice up there said, 'I'm going to give you back your life. You were destined to die on some unnamed hill in Vietnam; unsung, just buried in mud, forgotten by everybody. That was your destiny.' But something happened; somebody up there changed their mind." ^ Kaku, Michio. "Ghost-free formulation of quantum gravity in the light-cone gauge." Nuclear Physics B 91.1 (1975): 99–108.
