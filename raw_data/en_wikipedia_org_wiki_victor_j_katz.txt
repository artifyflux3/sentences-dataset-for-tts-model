Biography [ edit ] Katz received in 1963 from Princeton University a bachelor's degree and in 1968  from Brandeis University a Ph.D. in mathematics under Maurice Auslander with thesis The Brauer group of a regular local ring .

[ 2 ] He became at Federal City College an assistant professor and then in 1973 an associate professor and, after the merger of Federal City College into the University of the District of Columbia in 1977, a full professor there in 1980. He retired there as professor emeritus in 2005.

As a mathematician Katz specializes in algebra, but he is mainly known for his work on the history of mathematics and its uses in teaching. He wrote a textbook History of Mathematics: An Introduction (1993), for which he won in 1995 the Watson Davis and Helen Miles Davis Prize . He organized workshops and congresses for the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics . The MAA published a collection of teaching materials by Katz as a compact disk with the title Historical Modules for the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics . With Frank Swetz, he was a founding editor of a free online journal on the history of mathematics under the aegis of the MAA; the journal is called Convergence: Where Mathematics, History, and Teaching Interact .

[ 3 ] In the journal Convergence , Katz and Swetz published a series Mathematical Treasures .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] For a study of the possibilities for using mathematical history in schools, Katz received a grant from the National Science Foundation.

Personal [ edit ] He has been married since 1969 to Phyllis Katz (née Friedman), a science educator who developed and directed the U.S. national nonprofit organization Hands On Science Outreach, Inc.

(HOSO). The couple have three children.
