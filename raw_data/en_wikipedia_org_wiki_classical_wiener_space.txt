Classical Wiener space is useful in the study of stochastic processes whose sample paths are continuous functions. It is named after the American mathematician Norbert Wiener .

Definition [ edit ] Consider E ⊆ ⊆ R n {\displaystyle E\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and a metric space ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} . The classical Wiener space C ( E , M ) {\displaystyle C(E,M)} is the space of all continuous functions f : E → → M .

{\displaystyle f:E\to M.} That is, for every fixed t ∈ ∈ E , {\displaystyle t\in E,} d ( f ( s ) , f ( t ) ) → → 0 {\displaystyle d(f(s),f(t))\to 0} as | s − − t | → → 0.

{\displaystyle |s-t|\to 0.} In almost all applications, one takes E = [ 0 , T ] {\displaystyle E=[0,T]} or E = R + = [ 0 , + ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle E=\mathbb {R} _{+}=[0,+\infty )} and M = R n {\displaystyle M=\mathbb {R} ^{n}} for some n ∈ ∈ N .

{\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} .} For brevity, write C {\displaystyle C} for C ( [ 0 , T ] ) ; {\displaystyle C([0,T]);} this is a vector space . Write C 0 {\displaystyle C_{0}} for the linear subspace consisting only of those functions that take the value zero at the infimum of the set E .

{\displaystyle E.} Many authors refer to C 0 {\displaystyle C_{0}} as "classical Wiener space".

Properties of classical Wiener space [ edit ] Uniform topology [ edit ] The vector space C {\displaystyle C} can be equipped with the uniform norm ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ := sup t ∈ ∈ [ 0 , T ] | f ( t ) | {\displaystyle \|f\|:=\sup _{t\in [0,\,T]}|f(t)|} turning it into a normed vector space (in fact a Banach space since [ 0 , T ] {\displaystyle [0,T]} is compact). This norm induces a metric on C {\displaystyle C} in the usual way: d ( f , g ) := ‖ ‖ f − − g ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle d(f,g):=\|f-g\|} . The topology generated by the open sets in this metric is the topology of uniform convergence on [ 0 , T ] , {\displaystyle [0,T],} or the uniform topology .

Thinking of the domain [ 0 , T ] {\displaystyle [0,T]} as "time" and the range R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} as "space", an intuitive view of the uniform topology is that two functions are "close" if we can "wiggle space slightly" and get the graph of f {\displaystyle f} to lie on top of the graph of g {\displaystyle g} , while leaving time fixed. Contrast this with the Skorokhod topology , which allows us to "wiggle" both space and time.

If one looks at the more general domain R + {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{+}} with ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ := sup t ≥ ≥ 0 | f ( t ) | , {\displaystyle \|f\|:=\sup _{t\geq 0}|f(t)|,} then the Wiener space is no longer a Banach space, however it can be made into one if the Wiener space is defined under the additional constraint lim s → → ∞ ∞ s − − 1 | f ( s ) | = 0.

{\displaystyle \lim \limits _{s\to \infty }s^{-1}|f(s)|=0.} Separability and completeness [ edit ] With respect to the uniform metric, C {\displaystyle C} is both a separable and a complete space : Separability is a consequence of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem ; Completeness is a consequence of the fact that the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is itself continuous.

Since it is both separable and complete, C {\displaystyle C} is a Polish space .

Tightness in classical Wiener space [ edit ] Recall that the modulus of continuity for a function f : [ 0 , T ] → → R n {\displaystyle f:[0,T]\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is defined by ω ω f ( δ δ ) := sup { | f ( s ) − − f ( t ) | : s , t ∈ ∈ [ 0 , T ] , | s − − t | ≤ ≤ δ δ } .

{\displaystyle \omega _{f}(\delta ):=\sup \left\{|f(s)-f(t)|:s,t\in [0,T],\,|s-t|\leq \delta \right\}.} This definition makes sense even if f {\displaystyle f} is not continuous, and it can be shown that f {\displaystyle f} is continuous if and only if its modulus of continuity tends to zero as δ δ → → 0 : {\displaystyle \delta \to 0:} f ∈ ∈ C ⟺ ⟺ ω ω f ( δ δ ) → → 0 as δ δ → → 0 {\displaystyle f\in C\iff \omega _{f}(\delta )\to 0{\text{ as }}\delta \to 0} .

By an application of the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem , one can show that a sequence ( μ μ n ) n = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle (\mu _{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }} of probability measures on classical Wiener space C {\displaystyle C} is tight if and only if both the following conditions are met: lim a → → ∞ ∞ lim sup n → → ∞ ∞ μ μ n { f ∈ ∈ C : | f ( 0 ) | ≥ ≥ a } = 0 , {\displaystyle \lim _{a\to \infty }\limsup _{n\to \infty }\mu _{n}\{f\in C:|f(0)|\geq a\}=0,} and lim δ δ → → 0 lim sup n → → ∞ ∞ μ μ n { f ∈ ∈ C : ω ω f ( δ δ ) ≥ ≥ ε ε } = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{\delta \to 0}\limsup _{n\to \infty }\mu _{n}\{f\in C:\omega _{f}(\delta )\geq \varepsilon \}=0} for all ε ε > 0.

{\displaystyle \varepsilon >0.} Classical Wiener measure [ edit ] There is a "standard" measure on C 0 , {\displaystyle C_{0},} known as classical Wiener measure (or simply Wiener measure ). Wiener measure has (at least) two equivalent characterizations: If one defines Brownian motion to be a Markov stochastic process B : [ 0 , T ] × × Ω Ω → → R n , {\displaystyle B:[0,T]\times \Omega \to \mathbb {R} ^{n},} starting at the origin, with almost surely continuous paths and independent increments B t − − B s ∼ ∼ N o r m a l ( 0 , | t − − s | ) , {\displaystyle B_{t}-B_{s}\sim \,\mathrm {Normal} \left(0,|t-s|\right),} then classical Wiener measure γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is the law of the process B .

{\displaystyle B.} Alternatively, one may use the abstract Wiener space construction, in which classical Wiener measure γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is the radonification of the canonical Gaussian cylinder set measure on the Cameron-Martin Hilbert space corresponding to C 0 .

{\displaystyle C_{0}.} Classical Wiener measure is a Gaussian measure : in particular, it is a strictly positive probability measure.

Given classical Wiener measure γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } on C 0 , {\displaystyle C_{0},} the product measure γ γ n × × γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma ^{n}\times \gamma } is a probability measure on C {\displaystyle C} , where γ γ n {\displaystyle \gamma ^{n}} denotes the standard Gaussian measure on R n .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.} Coordinate maps for the Wiener measure [ edit ] For a stochastic process { X t , t ∈ ∈ [ 0 , T ] } : ( Ω Ω , F , P ) → → ( M , B ) {\displaystyle \{X_{t},t\in [0,T]\}:(\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},P)\to (M,{\mathcal {B}})} and the function space M E ≡ ≡ { E → → M } {\displaystyle M^{E}\equiv \{E\to M\}} of all functions from E {\displaystyle E} to M {\displaystyle M} , one looks at the map φ φ : Ω Ω → → M E {\displaystyle \varphi :\Omega \to M^{E}} . One can then define the coordinate maps or canonical versions Y t : M E → → M {\displaystyle Y_{t}:M^{E}\to M} defined by Y t ( ω ω ) = ω ω ( t ) {\displaystyle Y_{t}(\omega )=\omega (t)} . The { Y t , t ∈ ∈ E } {\displaystyle \{Y_{t},t\in E\}} form another process. For M = R {\displaystyle M=\mathbb {R} } and E = R + {\displaystyle E=\mathbb {R} _{+}} , the Wiener measure is then the unique measure on C 0 ( R + , R ) {\displaystyle C_{0}(\mathbb {R} _{+},\mathbb {R} )} such that the coordinate process is a Brownian motion.

[ 1 ] Subspaces of the Wiener space [ edit ] Let H ⊂ ⊂ C 0 ( [ 0 , R ] ) {\displaystyle H\subset C_{0}([0,R])} be a Hilbert space that is continuously embbeded and let γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } be the Wiener measure then γ γ ( H ) = 0 {\displaystyle \gamma (H)=0} . This was proven in 1973 by Smolyanov and Uglanov and in the same year independently by Guerquin.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] However, there exists a Hilbert space H ⊂ ⊂ C 0 ( [ 0 , R ] ) {\displaystyle H\subset C_{0}([0,R])} with weaker topology such that γ γ ( H ) = 1 {\displaystyle \gamma (H)=1} which was proven in 1993 by Uglanov.
