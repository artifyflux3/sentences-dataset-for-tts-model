Find sources: "Vacuum cementing" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Vacuum cementing or vacuum welding is the natural process of solidifying small objects in a hard vacuum .

[ clarification needed ] The most notable example is dust on the surface of the Moon .

This effect was reported to be a problem with the first American and Soviet satellites, as small moving parts would seize together.

[ citation needed ] In 2009 the European Space Agency published a peer-reviewed paper detailing why cold welding is a significant issue that spacecraft designers need to carefully consider. The paper also cites a documented example from 1991 with the Galileo spacecraft high-gain antenna .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] One source of difficulty is that vacuum welding does not exclude relative motion between the surfaces that are to be joined. This allows the broadly defined notions of galling , fretting , sticking, stiction and adhesion to overlap in some instances. For example, it is possible for a joint to be the result of both vacuum welding and galling (and/or fretting and/or impact). Galling and vacuum welding, therefore, are not mutually exclusive.
