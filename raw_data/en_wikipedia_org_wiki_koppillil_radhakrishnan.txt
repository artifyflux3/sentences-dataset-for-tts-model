[ citation needed ] While he was the director,  RRSSCs came to prominence in the national remote sensing application missions including the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD)  aimed at generation of spatial database of natural resources and action plans for sustainable development of land and water resources.

[ citation needed ] Later, Radhakrishnan succeeded as the mission director of IMSD and moved to National Remote Sensing Agency in Hyderabad.  IMSD was considered as largest remote sensing application experiment ever done in the world using a meticulous participatory approach.

[ 21 ] ISRO completed two joint satellite missions ( Megha Tropiques and SARAL ) with the French National Space Agency [ 22 ] and inked another agreement with NASA to jointly build an advanced Radar Imaging Satellite.

[ 23 ] India's standing in the global space market was enhanced as PSLV launched 18 commercial satellites for 11 countries.

[ 24 ] Through an inclusive organisational process, Radhakrishnan charted out clear programmatic directions and nurtured younger generation of leaders for carrying forward the legacy of ISRO.

[ 7 ] Re-defining the Chandrayaan-2 mission with Indigenous lander and rover [ 25 ] and extending the application of space technologies and tools to all central ministries are highlights of his leadership regime at ISRO.

This marked the beginning of the successful series of GSLV with Indian Cryogenic Upper Stage.
