Computer simulation of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")'s field in a period of normal polarity between reversals.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-selfconsistent-1) The lines represent magnetic field lines, blue when the field points towards the center and yellow when away. The rotation axis of Earth is centered and vertical. The dense clusters of lines are within Earth's core.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Glatzmaier-2)

**Earth's magnetic field**, also known as the **geomagnetic field**, is the [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") that extends from [Earth's interior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_Earth "Structure of Earth") out into space, where it interacts with the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind"), a stream of [charged particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle "Charged particle") emanating from the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"). The magnetic field is generated by [electric currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") due to the motion of [convection currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_current "Convection current") of a mixture of molten [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron") and [nickel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel "Nickel") in [Earth's outer core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_outer_core "Earth's outer core"): these convection currents are caused by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a [geodynamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodynamo "Geodynamo").

The magnitude of Earth's magnetic field at its surface ranges from 25 to 65 μT (0.25 to 0.65 G).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-GeomagneticReferenceField-3) As an approximation, it is represented by a field of a [magnetic dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole "Magnetic dipole") currently tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to [Earth's rotational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") axis, as if there were an enormous [bar magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_magnet "Bar magnet") placed at that angle through the center of Earth. The [North geomagnetic pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_geomagnetic_pole "North geomagnetic pole") ([Ellesmere Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellesmere_Island "Ellesmere Island"), [Nunavut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut "Nunavut"), Canada) actually represents the South pole of Earth's magnetic field, and conversely the [South geomagnetic pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_geomagnetic_pole "South geomagnetic pole") corresponds to the north pole of Earth's magnetic field (because opposite magnetic poles attract and the north end of a magnet, like a compass needle, points toward Earth's South magnetic field.)

While the North and South [magnetic poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles_of_astronomical_bodies "Poles of astronomical bodies") are usually located near the geographic poles, they slowly and continuously move over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary [compasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass "Compass") to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, [Earth's field reverses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal "Geomagnetic reversal") and the [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole "North Magnetic Pole") and [South Magnetic Poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Magnetic_Pole "South Magnetic Pole") abruptly switch places. These reversals of the [geomagnetic poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_pole "Geomagnetic pole") leave a record in rocks that are of value to [paleomagnetists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleomagnetism "Paleomagnetism") in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors. The [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere") is defined by the extent of Earth's magnetic field in space or [geospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospace "Geospace"). It extends above the [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere "Ionosphere"), several tens of thousands of kilometres into [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"), protecting Earth from the charged particles of the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") and [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays "Cosmic rays") that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer "Ozone layer") that protects Earth from [harmful ultraviolet radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet#Harmful_effects "Ultraviolet").

Earth's magnetic field deflects most of the solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-4) One stripping mechanism is for gas to be caught in bubbles of the magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-5) Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars"), resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss [of its atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars "Atmosphere of Mars").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-7)

The study of the past magnetic field of the Earth is known as paleomagnetism.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-McElhinny2000-8) The polarity of the Earth's magnetic field is recorded in [igneous rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock "Igneous rock"), and [reversals of the field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversals "Geomagnetic reversals") are thus detectable as "stripes" centered on [mid-ocean ridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge "Mid-ocean ridge") where the [sea floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading "Seafloor spreading") is spreading, while the stability of the geomagnetic poles between reversals has allowed paleomagnetism to track the past motion of continents. Reversals also provide the basis for [magnetostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostratigraphy "Magnetostratigraphy"), a way of [dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochronology "Geochronology") rocks and sediments.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-9) The field also magnetizes the crust, and [magnetic anomalies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_anomalies "Magnetic anomalies") can be used to search for deposits of metal [ores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ores "Ores").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-10)

Humans have used compasses for direction finding since the 11th century A.D. and for navigation since the 12th century.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-11) Although the [magnetic declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_declination "Magnetic declination") does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass can remain useful for navigation. Using [magnetoreception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoreception "Magnetoreception"), various other organisms, ranging from some types of bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-12)

At any location, the Earth's magnetic field can be represented by a three-dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the _declination_ (D) or _variation_. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the _inclination_ (I) or _[magnetic dip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic\_dip "Magnetic dip")_. The _intensity_ (F) of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in X (North), Y (East) and Z (Down) coordinates.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch2-13)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/XYZ-DIS_magnetic_field_coordinates.svg/500px-XYZ-DIS_magnetic_field_coordinates.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:XYZ-DIS_magnetic_field_coordinates.svg)

Common coordinate systems used for representing the Earth's magnetic field

The intensity of the field is often measured in [gauss (G)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_(unit) "Gauss (unit)"), but is generally reported in [microteslas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit) "Tesla (unit)") (μT), with 1 G = 100 μT. A nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma (γ). The Earth's field ranges between approximately 22 and 67 μT (0.22 and 0.67 G).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-14) By comparison, a strong [refrigerator magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator_magnet "Refrigerator magnet") has a field of about 10,000 μT (100 G).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-15)

A map of intensity contours is called an _isodynamic chart_. As the [World Magnetic Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#Geographical_variation) shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the [South Atlantic Anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Atlantic_Anomaly "South Atlantic Anomaly") over South America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of Antarctica south of Australia.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-renamed_from_2010_on_20131022170733-16)

The intensity of the magnetic field is subject to change over time. A 2021 paleomagnetic study from the [University of Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Liverpool "University of Liverpool") contributed to a growing body of evidence that the Earth's magnetic field cycles with intensity every 200 million years. The lead author stated that "Our findings, when considered alongside the existing datasets, support the existence of an approximately 200-million-year-long cycle in the strength of the Earth's magnetic field related to deep Earth processes."[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-17)

The inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between −90° (up) to 90° (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the [North Magnetic Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole "North Magnetic Pole") and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0°) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a [dip circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dip_circle "Dip circle").

An _isoclinic chart_ (map of inclination contours) for the Earth's magnetic field is shown [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#Geographical_variation).

Declination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north–south heading on a compass with the direction of a [celestial pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_pole "Celestial pole"). Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).

### Dipolar approximation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth%27s_magnetic_field&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Dipolar approximation")]

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Geographical_and_Magnetic_Poles.png/250px-Geographical_and_Magnetic_Poles.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geographical_and_Magnetic_Poles.png)

Relationship between Earth's poles. A1 and A2 are the geographic poles; B1 and B2 are the geomagnetic poles; C1 (south) and C2 (north) are the magnetic poles.

Near the surface of the Earth, its magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-NGDC-18) The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet "Magnet"), with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-19) This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch2-13)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Magnetic_North_Pole_Positions_2015.svg/330px-Magnetic_North_Pole_Positions_2015.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic_North_Pole_Positions_2015.svg)

The movement of Earth's North Magnetic Pole across the Canadian arctic

Historically, the north and south poles of a magnet were first defined by the Earth's magnetic field, not vice versa, since one of the first uses for a magnet was as a compass needle. A magnet's North pole is defined as the pole that is attracted by the Earth's North Magnetic Pole, in the arctic region, when the magnet is suspended so it can turn freely. Since opposite poles attract, the North Magnetic Pole of the Earth is really the south pole of its magnetic field (the place where the field is directed downward into the Earth).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Serway-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Emiliani-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Manners-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Hyperphysics-23)

The positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways: locally or globally.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-24) The local definition is the point where the magnetic field is vertical.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-25) This can be determined by measuring the inclination. The inclination of the Earth's field is 90° (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and –90° (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe. Movements of up to 40 kilometres (25 mi) per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the [Boothia Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boothia_Peninsula "Boothia Peninsula") in 1831 to 600 kilometres (370 mi) from [Resolute Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_Bay "Resolute Bay") in 2001.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-inconstant-26) The _magnetic equator_ is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).

The global definition of the Earth's field is based on a mathematical model. If a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant [non-dipolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipole_expansion "Multipole expansion") contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Magnetosphere_Levels.svg/250px-Magnetosphere_Levels.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetosphere_Levels.svg)

Earth's magnetic field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted further out by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the [Sun's corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_corona "Solar corona") and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000 kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the [interplanetary magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_magnetic_field "Interplanetary magnetic field") (IMF).[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MerrillMagnetosphere-27)

The solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth's atmosphere it would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth's magnetic field. The [magnetopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetopause "Magnetopause"), the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10[Earth radii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius "Earth radius") out but with the other side stretching out in a [magnetotail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotail "Magnetotail") that extends beyond 200 Earth radii.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-ParksIntro-28) Sunward of the magnetopause is the [bow shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_shock "Bow shock"), the area where the solar wind slows abruptly.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MerrillMagnetosphere-27)

Inside the magnetosphere is the [plasmasphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmasphere "Plasmasphere"), a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)"). This region begins at a height of 60 km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-ParksIntro-28) There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the [Van Allen radiation belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt "Van Allen radiation belt"), with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10[MeV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt "Electronvolt")). The inner belt is 1–2 Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4–7 Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-29)

As well as deflecting the solar wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray"), high-energy charged particles that are mostly from outside the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"). Many cosmic rays are kept out of the Solar System by the Sun's magnetosphere, or [heliosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere "Heliosphere").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-30) By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MerrillMagnetosphere-27)

Some of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a [ring current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_current "Ring current"). This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MerrillMagnetosphere-27) Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the [aurorae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy) "Aurora (astronomy)") while also emitting [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-rays "X-rays").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-ParksIntro-28)

The varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as [space weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather "Space weather"), are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called [geomagnetic storms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm "Geomagnetic storm"), can occur when a [coronal mass ejection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection "Coronal mass ejection") erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; [the "Halloween" storm of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_solar_storms,_2003 "Halloween solar storms, 2003") damaged more than a third of NASA's satellites. The largest documented storm, the [Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event "Carrington Event"), occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to disrupt telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MerrillMagnetosphere-27)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-31)

### Short-term variations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth%27s_magnetic_field&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Short-term variations")]

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Magnetic_Storm_Oct_2003.jpg/250px-Magnetic_Storm_Oct_2003.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic_Storm_Oct_2003.jpg)

**Background**: a set of traces from magnetic observatories showing a [magnetic storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_storm "Magnetic storm") in 2000.

**Globe**: map showing locations of observatories and contour lines giving horizontal magnetic intensity in [μ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro- "Micro-")[T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit) "Tesla (unit)").

The geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere ([ionospheric dynamo region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionospheric_dynamo_region "Ionospheric dynamo region")) and magnetosphere, and some changes can be traced to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the [Earth's interior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_interior "Earth's interior"), particularly the iron-rich [core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth "Structure of the Earth").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch2-13)

Frequently, the Earth's magnetosphere is hit by [solar flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare "Solar flare") causing geomagnetic storms, provoking displays of aurorae. The short-term instability of the magnetic field is measured with the [K-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-index "K-index").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-32)

Data from [THEMIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THEMIS "THEMIS") show that the magnetic field, which interacts with the solar wind, is reduced when the magnetic orientation is aligned between Sun and Earth – opposite to the previous hypothesis. During forthcoming solar storms, this could result in [blackouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage "Power outage") and disruptions in [artificial satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite "Artificial satellite").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-33)

Strength of the axial dipole component of Earth's magnetic field from 1600 to 2020

Changes in Earth's magnetic field on a time scale of a year or more are referred to as _secular variation_. Over hundreds of years, magnetic declination is observed to vary over tens of degrees.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch2-13) The animation shows how global declinations have changed over the last few centuries.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-declination-34)

The direction and intensity of the dipole change over time. Over the last two centuries the dipole strength has been decreasing at a rate of about 6.3% per century.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch2-13) At this rate of decrease, the field would be negligible in about 1600 years.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-GSC-35) However, this strength is about average for the last 7 thousand years, and the current rate of change is not unusual.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Constable_dipole-36)

A prominent feature in the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a _westward drift_ at a rate of about 0.2° per year.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-GSC-35) This drift is not the same everywhere and has varied over time. The globally averaged drift has been westward since about 1400 AD but eastward between about 1000 AD and 1400 AD.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Dumberry-37)

Changes that predate magnetic observatories are recorded in archaeological and geological materials. Such changes are referred to as _paleomagnetic secular variation_ or _paleosecular variation (PSV)_. The records typically include long periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting [geomagnetic excursions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_excursion "Geomagnetic excursion") and reversals.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-TauxeCh1-38)

A 1995 study of lava flows on [Steens Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steens_Mountain "Steens Mountain"), Oregon appeared to suggest the magnetic field once shifted at a rate of up to 6° per day at some time in Earth's history, a surprising result.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-nature.com-39) However, in 2014 one of the original authors published a new study which found the results were actually due to the continuous thermal demagnetization of the lava, not to a shift in the magnetic field.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-epsl.com-40)

In July 2020 scientists report that analysis of simulations and a recent observational field model show that maximum rates of directional change of Earth's magnetic field reached ~10° per year – almost 100 times faster than current changes and 10 times faster than previously thought.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-42)

### Magnetic field reversals

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth%27s_magnetic_field&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Magnetic field reversals")]

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Geomagnetic_polarity_late_Cenozoic.svg/250px-Geomagnetic_polarity_late_Cenozoic.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geomagnetic_polarity_late_Cenozoic.svg)

Geomagnetic polarity during the late [Cenozoic Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic_Era "Cenozoic Era"). Dark areas denote periods where the polarity matches today's polarity, light areas denote periods where that polarity is reversed.

Although generally Earth's field is approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly aligned with the rotational axis, occasionally the North and South [geomagnetic poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_poles "Geomagnetic poles") trade places. Evidence for these _geomagnetic reversals_ can be found in [basalts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt "Basalt"), sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-43) Reversals occur nearly [randomly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution "Poisson distribution") in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the [Brunhes–Matuyama reversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunhes%E2%80%93Matuyama_reversal "Brunhes–Matuyama reversal"), occurred about 780,000 years ago.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-inconstant-26)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch5-44) A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic _excursion_, takes the dipole axis across the equator and then back to the original polarity.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMexcursion-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-46) The [Laschamp event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laschamp_event "Laschamp event") is an example of an excursion, occurring during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).

The past magnetic field is recorded mostly by [strongly magnetic minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_mineralogy#Strongly_magnetic_minerals "Magnetic mineralogy"), particularly [iron oxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_oxides "Iron oxides") such as [magnetite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite "Magnetite"), that can carry a permanent magnetic moment. This [remanent magnetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remanent_magnetization "Remanent magnetization"), or _remanence_, can be acquired in more than one way. In [lava flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_flow "Lava flow"), the direction of the field is "frozen" in small minerals as they cool, giving rise to a [thermoremanent magnetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoremanent_magnetization "Thermoremanent magnetization"). In sediments, the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the magnetic field as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This is called _detrital remanent magnetization_.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-McElhinny2000-8)

Thermoremanent magnetization is the main source of the magnetic anomalies around mid-ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, [magma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma "Magma") wells up from the [mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology) "Mantle (geology)"), cools to form new basaltic crust on both sides of the ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-McElhinny2000-8)

[Radiometric dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating "Radiometric dating") of lava flows has been used to establish a _geomagnetic polarity time scale_, part of which is shown in the image. This forms the basis of [magnetostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostratigraphy "Magnetostratigraphy"), a geophysical correlation technique that can be used to date both sedimentary and volcanic sequences as well as the seafloor magnetic anomalies.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-McElhinny2000-8)

### Earliest appearance

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth%27s_magnetic_field&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Earliest appearance")]

Paleomagnetic studies of [Paleoarchean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoarchean "Paleoarchean") lava in Australia and [conglomerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(geology) "Conglomerate (geology)") in South Africa have concluded that the magnetic field has been present since at least about [3,450](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=3,450)million years ago.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Tarduno2009-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-49) In 2024 researchers published evidence from Greenland for the existence of the magnetic field as early as 3,700 million years ago.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-50)

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Brunhes_geomagnetism_western_US.png/250px-Brunhes_geomagnetism_western_US.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brunhes_geomagnetism_western_US.png)

Variations in virtual axial dipole moment since the last reversal

Starting in the late 1800s and throughout the 1900s and later, the overall geomagnetic field has become weaker; the present strong deterioration corresponds to a 10–15% decline and has accelerated since 2000; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value, from circa year 1 AD. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation, as shown by the record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.

The nature of Earth's magnetic field is one of [heteroscedastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedastic "Heteroscedastic") (seemingly random) fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone up and down in the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.

The Earth's magnetic north pole is drifting from northern [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") towards [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia "Siberia") with a presently accelerating rate—10 kilometres (6.2 mi) per year at the beginning of the 1900s, up to 40 kilometres (25 mi) per year in 2003,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-inconstant-26) and since then has only accelerated.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-51)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-52)

### Earth's core and the geodynamo

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth%27s_magnetic_field&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Earth's core and the geodynamo")]

The Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by electric currents in the conductive iron alloys of its core, created by convection currents due to heat escaping from the core.

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Dynamo_Theory_-_Outer_core_convection_and_magnetic_field_generation.svg/250px-Dynamo_Theory_-_Outer_core_convection_and_magnetic_field_generation.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dynamo_Theory_-_Outer_core_convection_and_magnetic_field_generation.svg)

A schematic illustrating the relationship between motion of conducting fluid, organized into rolls by the Coriolis force, and the magnetic field the motion generates.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-53)

The Earth and most of the planets in the Solar System, as well as the Sun and other stars, all generate magnetic fields through the motion of electrically [conducting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor "Electrical conductor") fluids.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Weiss-54) The Earth's field originates in its core. This is a region of iron alloys extending to about 3400 km (the radius of the Earth is 6370 km). It is divided into a solid [inner core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_inner_core "Earth's inner core"), with a radius of 1220 km, and a liquid [outer core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_outer_core "Earth's outer core").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-55) The motion of the liquid in the outer core is driven by heat flow from the inner core, which is about 6,000 K (5,730°C; 10,340°F), to the [core-mantle boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core-mantle_boundary "Core-mantle boundary"), which is about 3,800 K (3,530°C; 6,380°F).[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-56) The heat is generated by potential energy released by heavier materials sinking toward the core ([planetary differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_differentiation "Planetary differentiation"), the [iron catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_catastrophe "Iron catastrophe")) as well as decay of [radioactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive "Radioactive") elements in the interior. The pattern of flow is organized by the rotation of the Earth and the presence of the solid inner core.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Buffett2000-57)

The mechanism by which the Earth generates a magnetic field is known as a [geodynamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodynamo "Geodynamo").[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Weiss-54) The magnetic field is generated by a feedback loop: current loops generate magnetic fields ([Ampère's circuital law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law "Ampère's circuital law")); a changing magnetic field generates an electric field ([Faraday's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction "Faraday's law of induction")); and the electric and magnetic fields exert a force on the charges that are flowing in currents (the [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force "Lorentz force")).[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-58) These effects can be combined in a [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation") for the magnetic field called the _magnetic induction equation_,

![Image 15: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}=\eta \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {B} +\nabla \times (\mathbf {u} \times \mathbf {B} ),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f3a1294285c5cfc391c41dfc2ffe97520180644)

where **u** is the velocity of the fluid; **B** is the magnetic B-field; and _η_ = 1/_σμ_ is the [magnetic diffusivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_diffusivity "Magnetic diffusivity"), which is the [reciprocal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") of the product of the [electrical conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity "Electrical conductivity")σ and the [permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism) "Permeability (electromagnetism)")μ .[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch8-59) The term ∂**B**/∂_t_ is the [partial derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative") of the field with respect to time; ∇2 is the [Laplace operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator "Laplace operator"), ∇× is the [curl operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics) "Curl (mathematics)"), and × is the [vector product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_product "Vector product").

The first term on the right hand side of the induction equation is a [diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion "Diffusion") term. In a stationary fluid, the magnetic field declines and any concentrations of field spread out. If the Earth's dynamo shut off, the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch8-59)

In a perfect conductor (![Image 16: {\displaystyle \sigma =\infty \;}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0631216f514459564536249e21be791a8d25e427)), there would be no diffusion. By [Lenz's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz%27s_law "Lenz's law"), any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the _frozen-in-field theorem_. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch8-59)

The motion of the fluid is sustained by [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection "Convection"), motion driven by [buoyancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy "Buoyancy"). The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called _compositional convection_. A [Coriolis effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect "Coriolis effect"), caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north–south polar axis.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Buffett2000-57)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch8-59)

A dynamo can amplify a magnetic field, but it needs a "seed" field to get it started.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch8-59) For the Earth, this could have been an external magnetic field. Early in its history the Sun went through a [T-Tauri phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Tauri_star "T Tauri star") in which the solar wind would have had a magnetic field orders of magnitude larger than the present solar wind.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch10-60) However, much of the field may have been screened out by the Earth's mantle. An alternative source is currents in the core-mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity. Such effects may still provide a small bias that are part of the boundary conditions for the geodynamo.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch11-61)

The average magnetic field in the Earth's outer core was calculated to be 25 gauss, 50 times stronger than the field at the surface.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-62)

Simulating the geodynamo by computer requires numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the [magnetohydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics "Magnetohydrodynamics") (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating _kinematic dynamo_ computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and the effect on the magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Kono2002-63)

The first _self-consistent_ dynamo models, ones that determine both the fluid motions and the magnetic field, were developed by two groups in 1995, one in Japan[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-64) and one in the United States.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-selfconsistent-1)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-65) The latter received attention because it successfully reproduced some of the characteristics of the Earth's field, including geomagnetic reversals.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Kono2002-63)

### Effect of ocean tides

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth%27s_magnetic_field&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Effect of ocean tides")]

The oceans contribute to Earth's magnetic field. Seawater is an electrical conductor, and therefore interacts with the magnetic field. As the tides cycle around the ocean basins, the ocean water essentially tries to pull the geomagnetic field lines along. Because the salty water is only slightly conductive, the interaction is relatively weak: the strongest component is from the regular [lunar tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_tide "Lunar tide") that happens about twice per day (M2). Other contributions come from ocean swell, eddies, and even tsunamis.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-NASA2016-66)

 Sea level magnetic fields observed by satellites (NASA)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-NASA2016-66)[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

The strength of the interaction depends also on the temperature of the ocean water. The entire heat stored in the ocean can now be inferred from observations of the Earth's magnetic field.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-67)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-NASA2016-66)

### Currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth%27s_magnetic_field&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere")]

Electric currents induced in the ionosphere generate magnetic fields (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated near where the atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields by as much as 1°. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nT (one part in 2000), with variations over a few seconds of typically around 1 nT (one part in 50,000).[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-68)

Measurement and analysis
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth%27s_magnetic_field&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Measurement and analysis")]

The Earth's magnetic field strength was measured by [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") in 1832[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-69) and has been repeatedly measured since then, showing a relative decay of about 10% over the last 150 years.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-70) The [Magsat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magsat "Magsat") satellite and later satellites have used 3-axis vector magnetometers to probe the 3-D structure of the Earth's magnetic field. The later [Ørsted satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98rsted_(satellite) "Ørsted (satellite)") allowed a comparison indicating a dynamic geodynamo in action that appears to be giving rise to an alternate pole under the Atlantic Ocean west of South Africa.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-pmid11948347-71)

Governments sometimes operate units that specialize in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically part of a national [Geological survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_survey "Geological survey"), for example, the [British Geological Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Geological_Survey "British Geological Survey")'s [Eskdalemuir Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskdalemuir_Observatory "Eskdalemuir Observatory"). Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.

The [International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermagnet "Intermagnet"), with over 100 interlinked geomagnetic observatories around the world, has been recording the Earth's magnetic field since 1991.

The military determines local geomagnetic field characteristics, in order to detect _anomalies_ in the natural background that might be caused by a significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine. Typically, these [magnetic anomaly detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_anomaly_detector "Magnetic anomaly detector") are flown in aircraft like the UK's [Nimrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Siddeley_Nimrod "Hawker Siddeley Nimrod") or towed as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships.

Commercially, [geophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical "Geophysical")[prospecting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospecting "Prospecting") companies also use magnetic detectors to identify naturally occurring anomalies from [ore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore "Ore") bodies, such as the [Kursk Magnetic Anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_Magnetic_Anomaly "Kursk Magnetic Anomaly").

### Crustal magnetic anomalies

A model of short-wavelength features of Earth's magnetic field, attributed to lithospheric anomalies[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-72)

[Magnetometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer "Magnetometer") detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by iron [artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology) "Artifact (archaeology)"), kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and [middens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midden "Midden") in [archaeological geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_geophysics "Archaeological geophysics"). Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines,[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-73) the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-74) — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Kious-75) More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Kious-75)

Each measurement of the magnetic field is at a particular place and time. If an accurate estimate of the field at some other place and time is needed, the measurements must be converted to a model and the model used to make predictions.

The most common way of analyzing the global variations in the Earth's magnetic field is to fit the measurements to a set of [spherical harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics "Spherical harmonics"). This was first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Wallace2003-76) Spherical harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions, one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is zero along zero or more great circles passing through the North and South Poles; the number of such _[nodal lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal\_line "Nodal line")_ is the absolute value of the _order_ m. The function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; this plus the order is equal to the _degree_ ℓ. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the Earth. A _[monopole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic\_monopole "Magnetic monopole")_ is an isolated magnetic charge, which has never been observed. A _[dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic\_dipole "Magnetic dipole")_ is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a _[quadrupole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole "Quadrupole")_ to two dipoles brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch2-13)

Spherical harmonics can represent any [scalar field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field "Scalar field") (function of position) that satisfies certain properties. A magnetic field is a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field"), but if it is expressed in Cartesian components X, Y, Z, each component is the derivative of the same scalar function called the _[magnetic potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic\_scalar\_potential "Magnetic scalar potential")_. Analyses of the Earth's magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that differ by a multiplicative factor. A least-squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the Earth's field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each multiplied by the best-fitting _Gauss coefficient_ g m ℓ or h m ℓ.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch2-13)

The lowest-degree Gauss coefficient, g 0 0, gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients – g 1 0, g 1 1, and h 1 1 – determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution. The best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10° with respect to the rotational axis, as described earlier.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch2-13)

Spherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height (for example, ground observatories and satellites). In that case, each term with coefficient g m ℓ or h m ℓ can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as 1/r ℓ+1 and one that _increases_ with radius as r ℓ. The increasing terms fit the external sources (currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However, averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch2-13)

The remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source (ℓ=1) drops off as 1/r 2. The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off as 1/r 3. Quadrupole terms drop off as 1/r 4, and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on. Thus, only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface. From a variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree 14 or less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about 2,000 km (1,200 mi) or less. Smaller features are attributed to crustal anomalies.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-MMMch2-13)

The [International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Geomagnetism_and_Aeronomy "International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy") maintains a standard global field model called the [International Geomagnetic Reference Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Geomagnetic_Reference_Field "International Geomagnetic Reference Field") (IGRF). It is updated every five years. The 11th-generation model, IGRF11, was developed using data from satellites ([Ørsted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98rsted_(satellite) "Ørsted (satellite)"), [CHAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAMP_(satellite) "CHAMP (satellite)") and SAC-C) and a world network of geomagnetic observatories.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-77) The spherical harmonic expansion was truncated at degree 10, with 120 coefficients, until 2000. Subsequent models are truncated at degree 13 (195 coefficients).[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-irgf_health-78)

Another global field model, called the [World Magnetic Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Magnetic_Model "World Magnetic Model"), is produced jointly by the United States [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Centers_for_Environmental_Information "National Centers for Environmental Information") (formerly the National Geophysical Data Center) and the [British Geological Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Geological_Survey "British Geological Survey"). This model truncates at degree 12 (168 coefficients) with an approximate spatial resolution of 3,000 kilometers. It is the model used by the [United States Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense "United States Department of Defense"), the [Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom) "Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)"), the United States [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") (FAA), the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization "North Atlantic Treaty Organization") (NATO), and the [International Hydrographic Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Hydrographic_Organization "International Hydrographic Organization") as well as in many civilian navigation systems.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-79)

The above models only take into account the "main field" at the core-mantle boundary. Although generally good enough for navigation, higher-accuracy use cases require smaller-scale [magnetic anomalies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_anomalies "Magnetic anomalies") and other variations to be considered. Some examples are (see geomag.us ref for more):[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-80)

*   The "comprehensive modeling" (CM) approach by the [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddard_Space_Flight_Center "Goddard Space Flight Center") ([NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") and [GSFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSFC "GSFC")) and the [Danish Space Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Space_Research_Institute "Danish Space Research Institute"). CM attempts to reconcile data with greatly varying temporal and spatial resolution from ground and satellite sources. The latest version as of 2022 is CM5 of 2016. It provides separate components for main field plus [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere") (crustal), [M2 tidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide#Principal_lunar_semi-diurnal_constituent "Tide"), and primary/induced magnetosphere/ionosphere variations.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-81)
*   The US [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Centers_for_Environmental_Information "National Centers for Environmental Information") developed the [Enhanced Magnetic Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Magnetic_Model "Enhanced Magnetic Model") (EMM), which extends to degree and order 790 and resolves [magnetic anomalies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_anomalies "Magnetic anomalies") down to a wavelength of 56 kilometers. It was compiled from satellite, marine, aeromagnetic and ground magnetic surveys. As of 2018, the latest version, EMM2017, includes data from The European Space Agency's Swarm satellite mission.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-82)

For historical data about the main field, the IGRF may be used back to year 1900.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-irgf_health-78) A specialized GUFM1 model estimates back to year 1590 using ship's logs.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-83)[Paleomagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleomagnetic "Paleomagnetic") research has produced models dating back to 10,000 BCE.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-84)

Animals, including birds and turtles, can detect the Earth's magnetic field, and use the field to navigate during [migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration "Bird migration").[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-85) Some researchers have found that cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north–south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Burda2009-86)[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-Nature_summary-87) Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different [Google Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Earth "Google Earth") images.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-88)

Very weak electromagnetic fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds, which use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals are to blame for the electromagnetic field effect on the birds;[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-89) instead, the culprits have frequencies between 2 kHz and 5 MHz. These include AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field#cite_note-90)
