From left to right: a [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(geometry) "Square (geometry)"), a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube") and a [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract "Tesseract"). The square is two-dimensional (2D) and bounded by one-dimensional [line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment"); the cube is three-dimensional (3D) and bounded by two-dimensional squares; the tesseract is four-dimensional (4D) and bounded by three-dimensional cubes.

 The first four spatial dimensions, represented in a two-dimensional picture. 

1.   Two points can be connected to create a [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment").
2.   Two parallel line segments can be connected to form a [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square "Square").
3.   Two parallel squares can be connected to form a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube").
4.   Two parallel cubes can be connected to form a [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract "Tesseract").

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the **dimension** of a [mathematical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)") (or [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object")) is informally defined as the minimum number of [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinates "Coordinates") needed to specify any [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") within it.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-2) Thus, a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") has a [dimension of one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional_space "One-dimensional space") (1D) because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it– for example, the point at 5 on a number line. A [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)"), such as the [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(mathematics) "Boundary (mathematics)") of a [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry) "Cylinder (geometry)") or [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), has a [dimension of two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_space "Two-dimensional space") (2D) because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it– for example, both a [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude") are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. A [two-dimensional Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_Euclidean_space "Two-dimensional Euclidean space") is a two-dimensional space on the [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane"). The inside of a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube"), a cylinder or a sphere is [three-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional "Three-dimensional") (3D) because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.

In [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") are different categories and refer to [absolute space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_space_and_time "Absolute space and time"). That conception of the world is a [four-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space "Four-dimensional space") but not the one that was found necessary to describe [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"). The four dimensions (4D) of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") consist of [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(relativity) "Event (relativity)") that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an [observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(special_relativity) "Observer (special relativity)"). [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space") first approximates the universe without [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"); the [pseudo-Riemannian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold") of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") describe spacetime with matter and gravity. 10 dimensions are used to describe [superstring theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory "Superstring theory") (6D [hyperspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace "Hyperspace") + 4D), 11 dimensions can describe [supergravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergravity "Supergravity") and [M-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory "M-theory") (7D hyperspace + 4D), and the state-space of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") is an infinite-dimensional [function space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space").

The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. **High-dimensional space s** frequently occur in mathematics and the [sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"). They may be [Euclidean spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") or more general [parameter spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_space "Parameter space") or [configuration spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(mathematics) "Configuration space (mathematics)") such as in [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") or [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics"); these are [abstract spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)"), independent of the [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space").

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the dimension of an object is, roughly speaking, the number of [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom "Degrees of freedom") of a point that moves on this object. In other words, the dimension is the number of independent [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter") or [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinates "Coordinates") that are needed for defining the position of a point that is constrained to be on the object. For example, the dimension of a point is [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-dimensional_space "Zero-dimensional space"); the dimension of a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") is [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional_space "One-dimensional space"), as a point can move on a line in only one direction (or its opposite); the dimension of a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") is [two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_space "Two-dimensional space"), etc.

The dimension is an intrinsic property of an object, in the sense that it is independent of the dimension of the space in which the object is or can be [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(mathematics) "Embedding (mathematics)"). For example, a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve"), such as a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), is of dimension one, because the position of a point on a curve is determined by its signed distance along the curve to a fixed point on the curve. This is independent from the fact that a curve cannot be embedded in a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") of dimension lower than two, unless it is a line. Similarly, a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)") is of dimension two, even if embedded in [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space").

The dimension of [Euclidean _n_-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space")**E**_n_ is _n_. When trying to generalize to other types of spaces, one is faced with the question "what makes **E**_n_ _n_-dimensional?" One answer is that to cover a fixed [ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics) "Ball (mathematics)") in **E**_n_ by small balls of radius _ε_, one needs on the order of _ε_−_n_ such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the [Minkowski dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_dimension "Minkowski dimension") and its more sophisticated variant, the [Hausdorff dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension "Hausdorff dimension"), but there are also other answers to that question. For example, the boundary of a ball in **E**_n_ looks locally like **E**_n_-1 and this leads to the notion of the [inductive dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_dimension "Inductive dimension"). While these notions agree on **E**_n_, they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces.

A [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract "Tesseract") is an example of a four-dimensional object. Whereas outside mathematics the use of the term "dimension" is as in: "A tesseract _has four dimensions_", mathematicians usually express this as: "The tesseract _has dimension 4_", or: "The dimension of the tesseract _is_ 4".

Although the notion of higher dimensions goes back to [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"), substantial development of a higher-dimensional geometry only began in the 19th century, via the work of [Arthur Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley "Arthur Cayley"), [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton"), [Ludwig Schläfli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Schl%C3%A4fli "Ludwig Schläfli") and [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann"). Riemann's 1854 [Habilitationsschrift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitationsschrift "Habilitationsschrift"), Schläfli's 1852 _[Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorie\_der\_vielfachen\_Kontinuit%C3%A4t "Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität")_, and Hamilton's discovery of the [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") and [John T. Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves "John T. Graves")' discovery of the [octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion "Octonion") in 1843 marked the beginning of higher-dimensional geometry.

The rest of this section examines some of the more important mathematical definitions of dimension.

The dimension of a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") is the number of vectors in any [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)") for the space, [i.e.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_est "Id est") the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector. This notion of dimension (the [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality "Cardinality") of a basis) is often referred to as the _Hamel dimension_ or _algebraic dimension_ to distinguish it from other notions of dimension.

For the non-[free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_module "Free module") case, this generalizes to the notion of the [length of a module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_a_module "Length of a module").

The uniquely defined dimension of every [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectedness "Connectedness") topological [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") can be calculated. A connected topological manifold is [locally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_property "Local property")[homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to Euclidean _n_-space, in which the number _n_ is the manifold's dimension.

For connected [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"), the dimension is also the dimension of the [tangent vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") at any point.

In [geometric topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology "Geometric topology"), the theory of manifolds is characterized by the way dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively elementary, the **high-dimensional** cases _n_> 4 are simplified by having extra space in which to "work"; and the cases _n_ = 3 and 4 are in some senses the most difficult. This state of affairs was highly marked in the various cases of the [Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Poincaré conjecture"), in which four different proof methods are applied.

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Riemann_Sphere.gif/250px-Riemann_Sphere.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Riemann_Sphere.gif)

The complex plane can be mapped to the surface of a sphere, called the Riemann sphere, with the complex number 0 mapped to one pole, the unit circle mapped to the equator, and a [point at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity "Point at infinity") mapped to the other pole.

The dimension of a manifold depends on the base field with respect to which Euclidean space is defined. While analysis usually assumes a manifold to be over the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers "Real numbers"), it is sometimes useful in the study of [complex manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold") and [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety "Dimension of an algebraic variety") to work over the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers") instead. A complex number (_x_ + _iy_) has a [real part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_part "Real part")_x_ and an [imaginary part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_part "Imaginary part")_y_, in which x and y are both real numbers; hence, the complex dimension is half the real dimension.

Conversely, in algebraically unconstrained contexts, a single complex coordinate system may be applied to an object having two real dimensions. For example, an ordinary two-dimensional [spherical surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), when given a complex metric, becomes a [Riemann sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere "Riemann sphere") of one complex dimension.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-3)

The dimension of an [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") may be defined in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the dimension of the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") at any [Regular point of an algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety "Regular point of an algebraic variety"). Another intuitive way is to define the dimension as the number of [hyperplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane") that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is based on the fact that the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the variety.

An [algebraic set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_set "Algebraic set") being a finite union of algebraic varieties, its dimension is the maximum of the dimensions of its components. It is equal to the maximal length of the chains ![Image 4: {\displaystyle V_{0}\subsetneq V_{1}\subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq V_{d}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5994056681e18d759a8de3d2244fc2c40f5559c5) of sub-varieties of the given algebraic set (the length of such a chain is the number of "![Image 5: {\displaystyle \subsetneq }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ccda11a9c5eb10088602771f7c0f05ffea7f41c)").

Each variety can be considered as an [algebraic stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(mathematics) "Stack (mathematics)"), and its dimension as variety agrees with its dimension as stack. There are however many stacks which do not correspond to varieties, and some of these have negative dimension. Specifically, if _V_ is a variety of dimension _m_ and _G_ is an [algebraic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_group "Algebraic group") of dimension _n_[acting on _V_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)"), then the [quotient stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_stack "Quotient stack") [_V_/_G_] has dimension _m_−_n_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-4)

The [Krull dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krull_dimension "Krull dimension") of a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring") is the maximal length of chains of [prime ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal "Prime ideal") in it, a chain of length _n_ being a sequence ![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}_{0}\subsetneq {\mathcal {P}}_{1}\subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq {\mathcal {P}}_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/23f365fee3e4b8cc9f3d38cecfbf1347191f0757) of prime ideals related by inclusion. It is strongly related to the dimension of an algebraic variety, because of the natural correspondence between sub-varieties and prime ideals of the ring of the polynomials on the variety.

For an [algebra over a field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field "Algebra over a field"), the dimension as [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") is finite if and only if its Krull dimension is 0.

For any [normal topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_topological_space "Normal topological space")_X_, the [Lebesgue covering dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_covering_dimension "Lebesgue covering dimension") of _X_ is defined to be the smallest [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer")_n_ for which the following holds: any [open cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cover "Open cover") has an open refinement (a second open cover in which each element is a subset of an element in the first cover) such that no point is included in more than _n_ + 1 elements. In this case dim _X_ = _n_. For _X_ a manifold, this coincides with the dimension mentioned above. If no such integer _n_ exists, then the dimension of _X_ is said to be infinite, and one writes dim _X_ = ∞. Moreover, _X_ has dimension −1, i.e. dim _X_ = −1 if and only if _X_ is empty. This definition of covering dimension can be extended from the class of normal spaces to all [Tychonoff spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonoff_space "Tychonoff space") merely by replacing the term "open" in the definition by the term "**functionally open**".

An [inductive dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_dimension "Inductive dimension") may be defined [inductively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction") as follows. Consider a [discrete set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_point "Isolated point") of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging a 0-dimensional object in some direction, one obtains a 1-dimensional object. By dragging a 1-dimensional object in a _new direction_, one obtains a 2-dimensional object. In general, one obtains an (_n_ + 1)-dimensional object by dragging an _n_-dimensional object in a _new_ direction. The inductive dimension of a topological space may refer to the _small inductive dimension_ or the _large inductive dimension_, and is based on the analogy that, in the case of metric spaces, (_n_ + 1)-dimensional balls have _n_-dimensional [boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology) "Boundary (topology)"), permitting an inductive definition based on the dimension of the boundaries of open sets. Moreover, the boundary of a discrete set of points is the empty set, and therefore the empty set can be taken to have dimension −1.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-5)

Similarly, for the class of [CW complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complexes "CW complexes"), the dimension of an object is the largest n for which the [n-skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-skeleton "N-skeleton") is nontrivial. Intuitively, this can be described as follows: if the original space can be [continuously deformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy "Homotopy") into a collection of [higher-dimensional triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex "Simplex") joined at their faces with a complicated surface, then the dimension of the object is the dimension of those triangles.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Hausdorff dimension

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimension&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Hausdorff dimension")]

The [Hausdorff dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension "Hausdorff dimension") is useful for studying structurally complicated sets, especially [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal"). The Hausdorff dimension is defined for all [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") and, unlike the dimensions considered above, can also have non-integer real values.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-Hausdorff_dimension-6) The [box dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-counting_dimension "Box-counting dimension") or [Minkowski dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_dimension "Minkowski dimension") is a variant of the same idea. In general, there exist more definitions of [fractal dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension "Fractal dimension") that work for highly irregular sets and attain non-integer positive real values.

Every [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space") admits an [orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis "Orthonormal basis"), and any two such bases for a particular space have the same [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality "Cardinality"). This cardinality is called the dimension of the Hilbert space. This dimension is finite if and only if the space's [Hamel dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamel_dimension "Hamel dimension") is finite, and in this case the two dimensions coincide.

Classical physics theories describe three [physical dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Size "Size"): from a particular point in [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space"), the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies _i.e._, moving in a [linear combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination "Linear combination") of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See [Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system").)

A **temporal dimension**, or **time dimension**, is a dimension of time. Time is often referred to as the "[fourth dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime")" for this reason, but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-7) A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that we cannot move freely in time but subjectively move [in one direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time "Arrow of time").

The equations used in physics to model reality do not treat time in the same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") are [symmetric with respect to time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry "T-symmetry"), and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry "C-symmetry") and [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics) "Parity (physics)")) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the [laws of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics "Laws of thermodynamics") (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy")).

The best-known treatment of time as a dimension is [Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") and [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") (and extended to [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity")), which treats perceived space and time as components of a four-dimensional [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), known as [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), and in the special, flat case as [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"). Time is different from other spatial dimensions as time operates in all spatial dimensions. Time operates in the first, second and third as well as theoretical spatial dimensions such as a [fourth spatial dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space "Four-dimensional space"). Time is not however present in a single point of absolute infinite [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(mathematics) "Singularity (mathematics)") as defined as a [geometric point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_point "Geometric point"), as an infinitely small point can have no change and therefore no time. Just as when an object moves through [positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(geometry) "Position (geometry)") in space, it also moves through positions in time. In this sense the [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") moving any [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object "Physical object") to change is _time_.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-10)

### Additional dimensions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimension&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Additional dimensions")]

In physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. However, there are theories that attempt to unify the four [fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_forces "Fundamental forces") by introducing [extra dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_dimensions "Extra dimensions")/[hyperspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace "Hyperspace"). Most notably, [superstring theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory "Superstring theory") requires 10 spacetime dimensions, and originates from a more fundamental 11-dimensional theory tentatively called [M-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory "M-theory") which subsumes five previously distinct superstring theories. [Supergravity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergravity_theory "Supergravity theory") also promotes 11D spacetime = 7D hyperspace + 4 common dimensions. To date, no direct experimental or observational evidence is available to support the existence of these extra dimensions. If hyperspace exists, it must be hidden from us by some physical mechanism. One well-studied possibility is that the extra dimensions may be "curled up" ([compactified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactification_(physics) "Compactification (physics)")) at such tiny scales as to be effectively invisible to current experiments.

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Calabi-Yau.png/250px-Calabi-Yau.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Calabi-Yau.png)

Illustration of a Calabi–Yau manifold

In 1921, [Kaluza–Klein theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory "Kaluza–Klein theory") presented 5D including an extra dimension of space. At the level of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), Kaluza–Klein theory unifies [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") with [gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory") interactions, based on the realization that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"). However, at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still suffers from the same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity"). Therefore, these models still require a [UV completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_completion "UV completion"), of the kind that string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions (6D hyperspace) forming a [Calabi–Yau manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold "Calabi–Yau manifold"). Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory model building.

In addition to small and curled up extra dimensions, there may be extra dimensions that instead are not apparent because the matter associated with our visible universe is localized on a (3 + 1)-dimensional subspace. Thus, the extra dimensions need not be small and compact but may be [large extra dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_extra_dimensions "Large extra dimensions"). [D-branes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-brane "D-brane") are dynamical extended objects of various dimensionalities predicted by string theory that could play this role. They have the property that open string excitations, which are associated with gauge interactions, are confined to the [brane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane "Brane") by their endpoints, whereas the closed strings that mediate the gravitational interaction are free to propagate into the whole spacetime, or "the bulk". This could be related to why gravity is exponentially weaker than the other forces, as it effectively dilutes itself as it propagates into a higher-dimensional volume.

Some aspects of brane physics have been applied to [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology "Brane cosmology"). For example, brane gas cosmology[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-12) attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be since three is the largest number of spatial dimensions in which strings can generically intersect. If initially there are many windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration. Extra dimensions are said to be [universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_extra_dimension "Universal extra dimension") if all fields are equally free to propagate within them.

In 2024, [Günther Kletetschka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnther_Kletetschka "Günther Kletetschka") propounded that time exists in [three dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_dimensions "Three dimensions"), and that these three temporal dimensions naturally generate our [three spatial dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_spatial_dimensions "Three spatial dimensions"), creating a [six-dimensional universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-dimensional_universe "Six-dimensional universe") with [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"), and their [fundamental interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions "Fundamental interactions"). Kletetschka proposed his six-dimensional universe in a paper entitled _Three-Dimensional Time: A Mathematical Framework for Fundamental Physics_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-3DT-13) Kletetschka's mathematical framework maintains [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality"), accurately calculates [fermion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion") masses, and makes specific predictions for the discovery of [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-Phys-14) Kletetschka proposed numerous experiments to test his mathematical framework.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-3DT-13)

In computer graphics and spatial data
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimension&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: In computer graphics and spatial data")]

Several types of digital systems are based on the storage, analysis, and visualization of geometric shapes, including [illustration software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics_editor "Vector graphics editor"), [computer-aided design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design "Computer-aided design"), and [geographic information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_systems "Geographic information systems"). Different vector systems use a wide variety of data structures to represent shapes, but almost all are fundamentally based on a set of [geometric primitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_primitive "Geometric primitive") corresponding to the spatial dimensions:[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#cite_note-15)

*   **Point** (0-dimensional), a single coordinate in a [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system").
*   **Line** or **Polyline** (1-dimensional) usually represented as an ordered list of points sampled from a continuous line, whereupon the software is expected to [interpolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation "Interpolation") the intervening shape of the line as straight- or curved-line segments.
*   **Polygon** (2-dimensional) usually represented as a line that closes at its endpoints, representing the boundary of a two-dimensional region. The software is expected to use this boundary to partition 2-dimensional space into an interior and exterior.
*   **Surface** (3-dimensional) represented using a variety of strategies, such as a [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") consisting of connected polygon faces. The software is expected to use this surface to partition 3-dimensional space into an interior and exterior.

Frequently in these systems, especially GIS and [cartography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography "Cartography"), a representation of a real-world phenomenon may have a different (usually lower) dimension than the phenomenon being represented. For example, a city (a two-dimensional region) may be represented as a point, or a road (a three-dimensional volume of material) may be represented as a line. This _dimensional generalization_ correlates with tendencies in spatial cognition. For example, asking the distance between two cities presumes a conceptual model of the cities as points, while giving directions involving travel "up," "down," or "along" a road imply a one-dimensional conceptual model. This is frequently done for purposes of data efficiency, visual simplicity, or cognitive efficiency, and is acceptable if the distinction between the representation and the represented is understood but can cause confusion if information users assume that the digital shape is a perfect representation of reality (i.e., believing that roads really are lines).
