For other people, see Kneller (surname) .

Sir Godfrey Kneller Bt Self-portrait , 1685 Born Gottfried Kniller ( 1646-08-08 ) 8 August 1646 Lübeck , Holy Roman Empire Died 19 October 1723 (1723-10-19) (aged 77) London , England Known for Portrait painting Spouse Susanna Grave Relatives Johann Zacharias Kneller (brother) Andreas Kneller (brother) Sir Godfrey Kneller, [ a ] 1st Baronet (born Gottfried Kniller ; 8 August 1646 – 19 October 1723) was a German-born British painter. The leading portraitist in England during the late Stuart and early Georgian eras , he served as court painter to successive English and British monarchs , including Charles II of England and George I of Great Britain . Kneller also painted scientists such as Isaac Newton , foreign monarchs such as Louis XIV of France and visitors to England such as Michael Shen Fu-Tsung . A pioneer of the kit-cat portrait , he was also commissioned by William III of England to paint eight " Hampton Court Beauties " to match a similar series of paintings of Charles II's " Windsor Beauties " that had been painted by Kneller's predecessor as court painter, Peter Lely .

Early life [ edit ] Sir John Vanbrugh in Kneller's Kit-cat portrait , considered one of Kneller's finest portraits Kneller was born Gottfried Kniller in the Free City of Lübeck , the son of Zacharias Kniller, a portrait painter.

[ 2 ] Kneller studied in Leiden , but became a pupil of Ferdinand Bol and Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn in Amsterdam . He then travelled with his brother John Zacharias Kneller , who was an ornamental painter, to Rome and Venice in the early 1670s, painting historical subjects and portraits in the studio of Carlo Maratti , and later moved to Hamburg .

Career [ edit ] The brothers came to England in 1676, [ 3 ] and won the patronage of the Duke of Monmouth . He was introduced to, and painted a portrait of, Charles II .

In England, Kneller concentrated almost entirely on portraiture. In the spirit of enterprise, he founded a studio which churned out portraits on an almost industrial scale, relying on a brief sketch of the face with details added to a formulaic model, aided by the fashion for gentlemen to wear full wigs . His portraits set a pattern that was followed until William Hogarth and Joshua Reynolds .

Nevertheless, he established himself as a leading portrait artist in England.  When Sir Peter Lely died in 1680, Kneller was jointly appointed Principal Painter in Ordinary with John Riley to the Crown by Charles II.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] For about 20 years ( c.

1682 –1702) he lived at No. 16-17 The Great Piazza, Covent Garden .

[ 7 ] Kneller's studio manager was Edward Byng .

In the 1690s, Kneller painted the Hampton Court Beauties depicting the most glamorous ladies-in-waiting of the Royal Court for which he received, in 1692, his knighthood from William III . In 1695, he received, in the presence of the King, an honorary Doctorate of Law from the University of Oxford . In 1700, he was created a Knight of the Holy Roman Empire by Emperor Leopold I .

[ 8 ] He produced a series of " Kit-cat " portraits of 48 leading politicians and men of letters, members of the Kit-Cat Club .

[ 2 ] Created a baronet by King George I on 24 May 1715, [ 2 ] he was also head of the Kneller Academy of Painting and Drawing from 1711 until 1716 in Great Queen Street , London , which counted such artists as Thomas Gibson amongst its founding directors.  His paintings were praised by Whig members including John Dryden , Joseph Addison , [ 9 ] Richard Steele , and Alexander Pope .

On the landing in Horsham Museum in West Sussex hang works of art from the museum's extensive painting collection, featuring a large 18th-century portrait of Charles Eversfield and his wife, of Denne Park House.

[ 10 ] Personal life [ edit ] The coat of arms of Kneller of Whitton, Baronets [ 11 ] He married a widow, Susanna Grave, on 23 January 1704 at St Bride's Church , London.

[ 2 ] She was the daughter of the Reverend John Cawley , Archdeacon of Lincoln and Rector of Henley-on-Thames , and the granddaughter of regicide William Cawley .

[ 2 ] The couple had no children.

[ citation needed ] Death [ edit ] Kneller died of fever in 1723 at Great Queen Street and his remains were interred at Twickenham . He had been a churchwarden at St Mary's, Twickenham , when the 14th-century nave collapsed in 1713 and was active in the plans for the church's reconstruction by John James .

[ 12 ] His widow was buried at Twickenham on 11 December 1729.

[ 2 ] Legacy [ edit ] As to thinking better or worse of mankind from experience, some cunning people will not be satisfied unless they have put men to the test, as they think. There is a very good story told of Sir Godfrey Kneller, in his character of a Justice of the peace. A gentleman brought his servant before him, upon an accusation of having stolen some money from him; but it having come out that he had laid it purposely in the servant's way, in order to try his honesty, Sir Godfrey sent the master to prison.

James Boswell , The Life of Samuel Johnson [ 13 ] A memorial was erected in Westminster Abbey .

[ 2 ] Kneller's will gave a pension of £100 a year to his assistant Edward Byng and entrusted Byng with seeing that all unfinished work was completed. Byng also inherited the drawings in Kneller's studio.

[ 14 ] Kneller and his wife had no children together.

[ 2 ] Most of his fortune was inherited by his grandson, Godfrey Kneller Huckle, who was the son of Agnes Huckle, [ 2 ] Kneller's illegitimate daughter by Mrs Voss, [ 15 ] and who took his grandfather's surname (Kneller) [ 16 ] as a condition of his inheritance.

The site of the house Kneller built in 1709 in Whitton , near Twickenham, became occupied by the mid-19th century Kneller Hall , home of the Royal Military School of Music .

[ 2 ] Works [ edit ] In his hometown Lübeck there are works to be seen in the St. Annen Museum and in Saint Catherine Church . His former works at St. Mary's Church were destroyed by the Bombing of Lübeck 1942.  A large oil portrait (84" x 55") of James VII of Scotland (King James II of England ) hangs on the main staircase of private members' club, The Caledonian Club , in Belgravia, London.

A portrait of Queen Anne that belongs to Trinity Hospital in Retford , Nottinghamshire has been attributed to Kneller by the auctioneers Phillips – though it is unsigned. The hospital has a strong connection with Queen Anne, the founder being a first cousin of her grandmother. The portrait was restored and cleaned in 1999.
