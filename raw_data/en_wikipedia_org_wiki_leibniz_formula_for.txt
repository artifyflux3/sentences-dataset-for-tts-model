In mathematics , the Leibniz formula for π , named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , states that π π 4 = 1 − − 1 3 + 1 5 − − 1 7 + 1 9 − − ⋯ ⋯ = ∑ ∑ k = 0 ∞ ∞ ( − − 1 ) k 2 k + 1 , {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{4}}=1-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{5}}-{\frac {1}{7}}+{\frac {1}{9}}-\cdots =\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{k}}{2k+1}},} an alternating series .

It is sometimes called the Madhava–Leibniz series as it was first discovered by the Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama or his followers in the 14th–15th century (see Madhava series ), [ 1 ] and was later independently rediscovered by James Gregory in 1671 and Leibniz in 1673.

[ 2 ] The Taylor series for the inverse tangent function, often called Gregory's series , is arctan ⁡ ⁡ x = x − − x 3 3 + x 5 5 − − x 7 7 + ⋯ ⋯ = ∑ ∑ k = 0 ∞ ∞ ( − − 1 ) k x 2 k + 1 2 k + 1 .

{\displaystyle \arctan x=x-{\frac {x^{3}}{3}}+{\frac {x^{5}}{5}}-{\frac {x^{7}}{7}}+\cdots =\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{k}x^{2k+1}}{2k+1}}.} The Leibniz formula is the special case arctan ⁡ ⁡ 1 = 1 4 π π .

{\textstyle \arctan 1={\tfrac {1}{4}}\pi .} [ 3 ] It also is the Dirichlet L -series of the non-principal Dirichlet character of modulus 4 evaluated at s = 1 , {\displaystyle s=1,} and therefore the value β (1) of the Dirichlet beta function .

Proofs [ edit ] Proof 1 [ edit ] π π 4 = arctan ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 ) = ∫ ∫ 0 1 1 1 + x 2 d x = ∫ ∫ 0 1 ( ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( − − 1 ) k x 2 k + ( − − 1 ) n + 1 x 2 n + 2 1 + x 2 ) d x = ( ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( − − 1 ) k 2 k + 1 ) + ( − − 1 ) n + 1 ( ∫ ∫ 0 1 x 2 n + 2 1 + x 2 d x ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\pi }{4}}&=\arctan(1)\\&=\int _{0}^{1}{\frac {1}{1+x^{2}}}\,dx\\[8pt]&=\int _{0}^{1}\left(\sum _{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}x^{2k}+{\frac {(-1)^{n+1}\,x^{2n+2}}{1+x^{2}}}\right)\,dx\\[8pt]&=\left(\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\frac {(-1)^{k}}{2k+1}}\right)+(-1)^{n+1}\left(\int _{0}^{1}{\frac {x^{2n+2}}{1+x^{2}}}\,dx\right)\end{aligned}}} Considering only the integral in the last term, we have: 0 ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ 0 1 x 2 n + 2 1 + x 2 d x ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ 0 1 x 2 n + 2 d x = 1 2 n + 3 → → 0 as n → → ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle 0\leq \int _{0}^{1}{\frac {x^{2n+2}}{1+x^{2}}}\,dx\leq \int _{0}^{1}x^{2n+2}\,dx={\frac {1}{2n+3}}\;\rightarrow 0{\text{ as }}n\rightarrow \infty .} Therefore, by the squeeze theorem , as n → ∞ , we are left with the Leibniz series: π π 4 = ∑ ∑ k = 0 ∞ ∞ ( − − 1 ) k 2 k + 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{4}}=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{k}}{2k+1}}} Proof 2 [ edit ] Let f ( z ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ ( − − 1 ) n 2 n + 1 z 2 n + 1 {\displaystyle f(z)=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{n}}{2n+1}}z^{2n+1}} , when | z | < 1 {\displaystyle |z|<1} , the series ∑ ∑ k = 0 ∞ ∞ ( − − 1 ) k z 2 k {\displaystyle \sum _{k=0}^{\infty }(-1)^{k}z^{2k}} converges uniformly, then arctan ⁡ ⁡ ( z ) = ∫ ∫ 0 z 1 1 + t 2 d t = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ ( − − 1 ) n 2 n + 1 z 2 n + 1 = f ( z ) ( | z | < 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \arctan(z)=\int _{0}^{z}{\frac {1}{1+t^{2}}}dt=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{n}}{2n+1}}z^{2n+1}=f(z)\ (|z|<1).} Therefore, if f ( z ) {\displaystyle f(z)} approaches f ( 1 ) {\displaystyle f(1)} so that it is continuous and converges uniformly, the proof is complete, where, the series ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ ( − − 1 ) n 2 n + 1 {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{n}}{2n+1}}} to be converges by the Leibniz's test , and also, f ( z ) {\displaystyle f(z)} approaches f ( 1 ) {\displaystyle f(1)} from within the Stolz angle, so from Abel's theorem this is correct.

Convergence [ edit ] Comparison of the convergence of the Leibniz formula ( □ ) and several historical infinite series for π .

S n is the approximation after taking n terms. Each subsequent subplot magnifies the shaded area horizontally by 10 times.

(click for detail) Leibniz's formula converges extremely slowly: it exhibits sublinear convergence . Calculating π to 10 correct decimal places using direct summation of the series requires precisely five billion terms because ⁠ 4 / 2 k + 1 ⁠ < 10 −10 for k > 2 × 10 10 − ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ (one needs to apply Calabrese error bound ). To get 4 correct decimal places (error of 0.00005) one needs 5000 terms.

[ 4 ] Even better than Calabrese or Johnsonbaugh error bounds are available.

[ 5 ] However, the Leibniz formula can be used to calculate π to high precision (hundreds of digits or more) using various convergence acceleration techniques. For example, the Shanks transformation , Euler transform or Van Wijngaarden transformation , which are general methods for alternating series, can be applied effectively to the partial sums of the Leibniz series. Further, combining terms pairwise gives the non-alternating series π π 4 = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ ( 1 4 n + 1 − − 1 4 n + 3 ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ 2 ( 4 n + 1 ) ( 4 n + 3 ) {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{4}}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\left({\frac {1}{4n+1}}-{\frac {1}{4n+3}}\right)=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {2}{(4n+1)(4n+3)}}} which can be evaluated to high precision from a small number of terms using Richardson extrapolation or the Euler–Maclaurin formula . This series can also be transformed into an integral by means of the Abel–Plana formula and evaluated using techniques for numerical integration .

Unusual behaviour [ edit ] If the series is truncated at the right time, the decimal expansion of the approximation will agree with that of π for many more digits, except for isolated digits or digit groups. For example, taking five million terms yields 3.141592 4 _ _ 5358979323846 4 _ _ 643383279502 7 _ _ 841971693993 873 _ _ 058...

{\displaystyle 3.141592{\underline {4}}5358979323846{\underline {4}}643383279502{\underline {7}}841971693993{\underline {873}}058...} where the underlined digits are wrong. The errors can in fact be predicted; they are generated by the Euler numbers E n according to the asymptotic formula π π 2 − − 2 ∑ ∑ k = 1 N / 2 ( − − 1 ) k − − 1 2 k − − 1 ∼ ∼ ∑ ∑ m = 0 ∞ ∞ E 2 m N 2 m + 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{2}}-2\sum _{k=1}^{N/2}{\frac {(-1)^{k-1}}{2k-1}}\sim \sum _{m=0}^{\infty }{\frac {E_{2m}}{N^{2m+1}}}} where N is an integer divisible by 4. If N is chosen to be a power of ten, each term in the right sum becomes a finite decimal fraction. The formula is a special case of the Euler–Boole summation formula for alternating series, providing yet another example of a convergence acceleration technique that can be applied to the Leibniz series. In 1992, Jonathan Borwein and Mark Limber used the first thousand Euler numbers to calculate π to 5,263 decimal places with the Leibniz formula.

[ 6 ] Euler product [ edit ] The Leibniz formula can be interpreted as a Dirichlet series using the unique non-principal Dirichlet character modulo 4. As with other Dirichlet series, this allows the infinite sum to be converted to an infinite product with one term for each prime number . Such a product is called an Euler product . It is: π π 4 = ( ∏ ∏ p ≡ ≡ 1 ( mod 4 ) p p − − 1 ) ( ∏ ∏ p ≡ ≡ 3 ( mod 4 ) p p + 1 ) = 3 4 ⋅ ⋅ 5 4 ⋅ ⋅ 7 8 ⋅ ⋅ 11 12 ⋅ ⋅ 13 12 ⋅ ⋅ 17 16 ⋅ ⋅ 19 20 ⋅ ⋅ 23 24 ⋅ ⋅ 29 28 ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\pi }{4}}&={\biggl (}\prod _{p\,\equiv \,1\ ({\text{mod}}\ 4)}{\frac {p}{p-1}}{\biggr )}{\biggl (}\prod _{p\,\equiv \,3\ ({\text{mod}}\ 4)}{\frac {p}{p+1}}{\biggr )}\\[7mu]&={\frac {3}{4}}\cdot {\frac {5}{4}}\cdot {\frac {7}{8}}\cdot {\frac {11}{12}}\cdot {\frac {13}{12}}\cdot {\frac {17}{16}}\cdot {\frac {19}{20}}\cdot {\frac {23}{24}}\cdot {\frac {29}{28}}\cdots \end{aligned}}} In this product, each term is a superparticular ratio , each numerator is an odd prime number, and each denominator is the nearest multiple of 4 to the numerator.

[ 7 ] The product is conditionally convergent; its terms must be taken in order of increasing p .
