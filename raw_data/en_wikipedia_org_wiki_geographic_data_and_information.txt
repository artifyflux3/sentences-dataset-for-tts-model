Find sources: "Geographic data and information" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( April 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Geographic data and information is defined in the ISO/TC 211 series of standards as data and information having an implicit or explicit association with a location relative to Earth (a geographic location or geographic position ).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is also called geospatial data and information , [ citation needed ] georeferenced data and information , [ citation needed ] as well as geodata and geoinformation .

[ citation needed ] Location information (known by the many names mentioned here) is stored in a geographic information system (GIS).

There are also many different types of geodata, including vector files , raster files , geographic databases , web files, and multi-temporal data.

Spatial data or spatial information is broader class of data whose geometry is relevant but it is not necessarily georeferenced , such as in computer-aided design (CAD), see geometric modeling .

Fields of study [ edit ] Geographic data and information are the subject of a number of overlapping fields of study , mainly: Geocomputation Geographic information science Geographic information science and technology Geoinformatics Geomatics Geovisualization Technical geography "Geospatial technology" may refer to any of "geomatics", "geomatics", or "geographic information technology." The above is in addition to other related fields, such as: Cartography Geodesy Geography Geostatistics Photogrammetry Remote sensing Spatial data analysis Surveying Topography See also [ edit ] Main category: Geographic data and information Geomatics engineering Earth observation data Geographic feature Georeferencing Geospatial intelligence Ubiquitous geographic information References [ edit ] ^ Geolexica, the authoritative glossary for geographic information technology from ISO/TC 211 ^ Geolexica, the authoritative glossary for geographic information technology from ISO/TC 211 Further reading [ edit ] Roger A.
