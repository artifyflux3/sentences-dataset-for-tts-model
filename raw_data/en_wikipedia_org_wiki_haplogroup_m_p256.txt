For the human mtDNA haplogroup, see Haplogroup M (mtDNA) .

Haplogroup M-P256 Possible time of origin 32,000-47,000 years BP [ 1 ] Possible place of origin Wallacea (eastern Indonesia) or New Guinea [ 2 ] Ancestor K2b1 Defining mutations P256 Haplogroup M , AKA M-P256 and Haplogroup K2b1b (previously K2b1d) is a Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup . M-P256 is a descendant haplogroup of Haplogroup K2b1 , and is believed to have first appeared between 32,000 and 47,000 years ago.

[ 1 ] M-P256 is the most frequently occurring Y-chromosome haplogroup in West Papua and western Papua New Guinea .

[ 3 ] In addition, M-P256 is also found in neighboring parts of Melanesia , Indonesia and indigenous Australians .

Phylogenetic structure [ edit ] This phylogenetic tree of haplogroup subclades is based primarily on the trees published by YCC in 2008 [ 4 ] and ISOGG in 2016.

[ 2 ] M1 (M-M4) [ edit ] Haplogroup M-M4 Possible time of origin 8,200 [3,800–20,600] years BP [ 3 ] Possible place of origin Southeast Asia - Melanesia [ citation needed ] Ancestor M-P256 Defining mutations M4, M5/P73, M106, M186, M189, M296, P35 [ citation needed ] This group is found frequently in New Guinea and Melanesia , with a moderate distribution in neighboring parts of Indonesia , Micronesia , and Polynesia .

[ 7 ] The Hazara individual carried the SNP M186 (which is believed to be equivalent to M4).

It is also found with moderate frequency in neighboring parts of Indonesia ( Maluku , Nusa Tenggara ) and throughout Papua New Guinea , including offshore islands.

[ 1 ] The subclade M1b1 (M104_1/P22_1, M104_2/P22_2) is found frequently in populations of the Bismarck Archipelago and Bougainville Island , with a moderate distribution in New Guinea , Fiji , Tonga , East Futuna , and Samoa .

[ 9 ] [ 1 ] Previous phylogenetic history [ edit ] Main article: Conversion table for Y chromosome haplogroups Prior to 2002, at least seven different naming systems for the Y chromosome phylogenetic tree were used within academic literature, leading to considerable confusion. To resolve this, in 2002, major research groups collaborated to form the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). This resulted in a joint paper publication that contained a single new tree as a standard to use by the scientific community. Later, another group of scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy worked to continually improve the naming system.

The table below brings together the nomenclature used in Haplogroup M studies, prior to the landmark 2002 YCC Tree, enabling researchers reviewing older literature to quickly convert between the different nomenclatures that were in use.

[ 4 ] Before the discovery of the P256 marker, the current subgroup M-M4 (defined by the M4 marker) previously represented the whole of Haplogroup M-P256; and subgroups M2 and M3 were formerly classed as subgroups K1 and K7 of the parent Haplogroup K .
