It is the fifth-most populous city in Greece with a population of 148,562 in the city proper, according to the 2021 census.

[ 2 ] It is also the capital of the Larissa regional unit . It is a principal agricultural centre and a national transport hub, linked by road and rail with the port of Volos , the cities of Thessaloniki and Athens . The municipality of Larissa has 164,095 inhabitants, while the regional unit of Larissa reached a population of 268,963 (in 2021 [update] ).

[ 2 ] Legend has it that Achilles was born here.

Hippocrates , the "Father of Medicine", died here. Today, Larissa is an important commercial, transportation, educational, agricultural and industrial centre of Greece. The city straddles the Pineios river and N.-NE. of the city are the Mount Olympus and Mount Kissavos .

Mythology [ edit ] According to Greek mythology , it is said that the city was founded by Acrisius , who was killed accidentally by his grandson, Perseus .

[ 3 ] There lived Peleus , the hero beloved by the gods, and his son Achilles .

In mythology, the nymph Larissa was a daughter of the primordial man Pelasgus .

[ 4 ] The city of Larissa is mentioned in Book II of the Iliad by Homer : "Hippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in fertile Larissa— Hippothous , and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sons of the Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus." [ 5 ] [ 6 ] In this paragraph, Homer shows that the Pelasgians , Trojan allies, used to live in the city of Larissa. This city of Larissa was likely different from the city that was the birthplace of Achilles . The Larissa that features as a Trojan ally in the Iliad was likely to be located in the Troad , on the other side of the Aegean Sea .

History [ edit ] Antiquity [ edit ] Silver drachma of Larissa (410-405 BC). Head of the nymph Larissa left, wearing pearl earring, her hair bound in sakkos / ΛΑΡΙΣΑ above, [IA] below (retrograde), bridled horse -symbol of the city- galloping right.

Pre-history [ edit ] Traces of Paleolithic human settlement have been recovered from the area, but it was peripheral to areas of advanced culture.

[ 7 ] The area around Larissa was extremely fruitful; it was agriculturally important and in antiquity was known for its horses.

Archaic Era [ edit ] The name Larissa (Λάρισα Lárīsa ) is in origin a Pelasgian word for "fortress".

[ citation needed ] There were many ancient Greek cities with this name.

[ 8 ] The name of Thessalian Larissa is first recorded in connection with the aristocratic Aleuadai family.

[ 9 ] It was also a polis (city-state).

[ 10 ] Classical Era [ edit ] Larissa was a polis (city-state) during the Classical Era.

[ 11 ] Larissa is thought to be where the famous Greek physician Hippocrates and the famous philosopher Gorgias of Leontini died.

c.

370–360 BC.

When Larissa ceased minting the federal coins it shared with other Thessalian towns and adopted its coinage in the late fifth century BC, it chose local types for its coins. The obverse depicted the nymph of the local spring, Larissa, for whom the town was named; probably the choice was inspired by the famous coins of Kimon depicting the Syracusan nymph Arethusa . The reverse depicted a horse in various poses. The horse was an appropriate symbol of Thessaly, a land of plains, which was well known for its horses. Usually, there is a male figure; he should perhaps be seen as the eponymous hero of the Thessalians, Thessalos, who is probably also to be identified on many of the earlier, federal coins of Thessaly.

The first ancient theatre of the city. It was constructed inside the ancient city's centre during the reign of Antigonus II Gonatas towards the end of the third century BC. The theatre was in use for six centuries, until the end of the third century AD.

Pedestrian zone beside the First Ancient Greek theatre Ruins of the second ancient theatre Larissa, sometimes written Larisa on ancient coins and inscriptions, is near the site of the Homeric Argissa. It appears in early times, when Thessaly was mainly governed by a few aristocratic families, as an important city under the rule of the Aleuadae , whose authority extended over the whole district of Pelasgiotis . This powerful family possessed for many generations before 369 BC the privilege of furnishing the Tagus , the local term for the strategos of the combined Thessalian forces. The principal rivals of the Aleuadae were the Scopadae of Crannon , the remains of which are about 14 miles southwest.

Larissa was the birthplace of Meno , who thus became, along with Xenophon and a few others, one of the generals leading several thousands of Greeks from various places, in the ill-fated expedition of 401 (retold in Xenophon's Anabasis ) meant to help Cyrus the Younger , son of Darius II , king of Persia , overthrow his elder brother Artaxerxes II and take over the throne of Persia (Meno is featured in Plato 's dialogue bearing his name, in which Socrates uses the example of "the way to Larissa" to help explain to Meno the difference between true opinion and science (Meno, 97a–c); this "way to Larissa" might well be on the part of Socrates an attempt to call to Meno's mind a "way home", understood as the way toward one's true and "eternal" home reached only at death, that each man is supposed to seek in his life).

[ 12 ] The constitution of the town was democratic , which explains why it sided with Athens in the Peloponnesian War . A festival celebrated near Larissa resembled the Roman Saturnalia , and at which the slaves were waited on by their masters. As the chief city of ancient Thessaly, Larissa was taken by the Thebans and later directly annexed by Philip II of Macedon in 344. It remained under Macedonian control afterwards, except for a brief period when Demetrius Poliorcetes captured it in 302 BC.

Hellenistic Era [ edit ] Roman Era [ edit ] It was in Larissa that Philip V of Macedon signed in 197 BC a treaty with the Romans after his defeat at the Battle of Cynoscephalae , and it was there also that Antiochus III the Great , won a great victory in 192 BC. In 196 BC Larissa became an ally of Rome and was the headquarters of the Thessalian League .

Larissa is frequently mentioned in connection with the Roman civil wars which preceded the establishment of the Roman Empire and Pompey sought refuge there after the defeat of Pharsalus .

Middle Ages [ edit ] Remains of the Basilica of St. Achillios , destroyed during the Ottoman era Gravure of Larissa, c. 1820 The archaeological excavations on Frourio Hill , with the Bezesten of Larissa in the background A street in the Frourio quarter Larissa was sacked by the Ostrogoths in the late 5th century , and rebuilt under the Byzantine emperor Justinian I .

[ 13 ] In the eighth century, the city became the metropolis of the theme of Hellas .

[ 13 ] The city was captured in 986 by Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria , who carried off the relics of its patron saint, Saint Achilleios , to Prespa .

[ 13 ] It was again unsuccessfully besieged by the Italo-Normans under Bohemond I in 1082/3.

[ 13 ] After the Fourth Crusade , the King of Thessalonica , Boniface of Montferrat , gave the city to Lombard barons , but they launched a rebellion in 1209 that had to be subdued by the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders himself.

[ 13 ] The city was recovered by Epirus soon after.

[ 13 ] Ottoman period [ edit ] Larissa was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1386/87 and again in the 1390s, but only came under permanent Ottoman control in 1423, by Turahan Bey .

[ 14 ] Under the Ottoman rule, the city was known as Yeni-şehir i-Fenari , "new citadel". As the chief town and military base of Ottoman Thessaly , Larissa was a predominantly Muslim city.

[ 14 ] In 1521 ( Hijri 927) the town had 693 Muslim and 75 Christian households; [ 15 ] according to Gökbilgin (1956), it also included Albanian and Jewish communities.

[ 16 ] During Ottoman rule the administration of the Metropolis of Larissa was transferred to nearby Trikala where it remained until 1734, when Metropolitan Iakovos II returned the see from Trikala to Larissa and established the present-day metropolis of Larissa and Tyrnavos.

The town was noted for its trade fair in the 17th and 18th centuries, while the seat of the pasha of Thessaly was also transferred there in 1770.

[ 14 ] Larissa was the headquarters of Hursid Pasha during the Greek War of Independence . It was also renowned for its mosques (four of which were still in use in the late 19th century) and its Muslim cemeteries.

[ citation needed ] The city remained a part of the Ottoman Empire until Thessaly became part of the independent Kingdom of Greece in 1881, except for a period when Ottoman forces re-occupied it during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 .

[ 14 ] In the late 19th century, there was still a small village on the outskirts of the town inhabited by Africans from Sudan , a curious remnant of the forces collected by Ali Pasha .

In the 19th century, the town produced leather , cotton , silk and tobacco . Fevers and agues were prevalent owing to bad drainage and the overflowing of the river; and the death rate was higher than the birth rate.

[ dubious – discuss ] Modern Greek era [ edit ] Old postcard of the city, Alexandras Street, 1910 In 1881, the city, along with the rest of Thessaly , was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece during the prime ministry of Alexandros Koumoundouros . On 31 August 1881, a unit of the Greek Army headed by General Skarlatos Soutsos entered the city. A considerable portion of the Turkish population emigrated to the Ottoman Empire at that point. In this new era, the city starts gradually to expand and to be rebuilt by the Greek authorities.

A German Messerschmitt which was crash-landed on the military airfield at Larissa, shot down by RAF pilots during WWII During the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 , the city was the headquarters of Greek Crown Prince Constantine . The flight of the Greek army from here to Farsala took place on April 23, 1897. Turkish troops entered the city two days later. After a treaty for peace was signed, they withdrew and Larissa remained permanently in Greece. This was followed by a further exodus of Turks in 1898. The Hassan Bey mosque (which was built in the early 16th century) was demolished in 1908.

During the Axis Occupation of the country , the Jewish community of the city (dated back to the 2nd century BC, see Romaniotes [ citation needed ] ) suffered heavy losses. Today in the city there is a Holocaust memorial and a synagogue.

After WWII [ edit ] The "floating river" fountain in Central Square of Larissa (Sapka, former Themidos) After WWII the city was expanded rapidly. Today Larissa is the fourth largest Greek city with many squares, taverns and cafes. It has three public hospitals with one being a military hospital. It hosts the Hellenic Air Force Headquarters and NATO Headquarters in Greece. It has a School of Medicine and a School of Biochemistry – Biotechnology and the third largest in the country Institute of Technology. It occupies the first place among Greek cities in green coverage rate per square-metre urban space and the first place with the highest percentage of bars-taverns-restaurants per capita in Greece. It also has two public libraries and five museums.

[ 17 ] Ecclesiastical history [ edit ] Pineios river with the church of St. Achillios in the background, patron saint of the city Christianity penetrated early to Larissa, though its first bishop was recorded only in 325, at the Council of Nicaea .

St. Achillius of the fourth century is celebrated for his miracles.

Le Quien cites twenty-nine bishops from the fourth to the 18th centuries; [ 18 ] the most famous is Jeremias II, who occupied the see until 733 when Emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred it from the jurisdiction of the Pope of Rome to the Patriarchate of Constantinople . In the first years of the tenth century it had ten suffragan sees; [ 19 ] subsequently the number increased, and in c.

1175 , under Emperor Manuel I Comnenus , it reached twenty-eight.

[ 20 ] At the close of the 15th century, under Ottoman domination, there were only ten suffragan sees, [ 21 ] which gradually grew less and finally disappeared.

It was also briefly a Latin archbishopric in the early 13th century, and remains a Latin Metropolitan (top-ranking) titular see of the Roman Catholic Church, which must not be confused with the Latin episcopal (low-ranking) titular see Larissa in Syria . Today there is a Catholic church in the city (Sacred Heart of Jesus).
