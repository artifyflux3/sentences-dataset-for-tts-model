They are named after René Descartes who observed that the number D = 3 2 ⋅ 7 2 ⋅ 11 2 ⋅ 13 2 ⋅ 22021 = (3⋅1001) 2 ⋅ (22⋅1001 − 1) = 198585576189 would be an odd perfect number if only 22021 were a prime number , since the sum-of-divisors function for D would satisfy, if 22021 were prime, σ σ ( D ) = ( 3 2 + 3 + 1 ) ⋅ ⋅ ( 7 2 + 7 + 1 ) ⋅ ⋅ ( 11 2 + 11 + 1 ) ⋅ ⋅ ( 13 2 + 13 + 1 ) ⋅ ⋅ ( 22021 + 1 ) = ( 13 ) ⋅ ⋅ ( 3 ⋅ ⋅ 19 ) ⋅ ⋅ ( 7 ⋅ ⋅ 19 ) ⋅ ⋅ ( 3 ⋅ ⋅ 61 ) ⋅ ⋅ ( 22 ⋅ ⋅ 1001 ) = 3 2 ⋅ ⋅ 7 ⋅ ⋅ 13 ⋅ ⋅ 19 2 ⋅ ⋅ 61 ⋅ ⋅ ( 22 ⋅ ⋅ 7 ⋅ ⋅ 11 ⋅ ⋅ 13 ) = 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( 3 2 ⋅ ⋅ 7 2 ⋅ ⋅ 11 2 ⋅ ⋅ 13 2 ) ⋅ ⋅ ( 19 2 ⋅ ⋅ 61 ) = 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( 3 2 ⋅ ⋅ 7 2 ⋅ ⋅ 11 2 ⋅ ⋅ 13 2 ) ⋅ ⋅ 22021 = 2 D , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\sigma (D)&=(3^{2}+3+1)\cdot (7^{2}+7+1)\cdot (11^{2}+11+1)\cdot (13^{2}+13+1)\cdot (22021+1)\\&=(13)\cdot (3\cdot 19)\cdot (7\cdot 19)\cdot (3\cdot 61)\cdot (22\cdot 1001)\\&=3^{2}\cdot 7\cdot 13\cdot 19^{2}\cdot 61\cdot (22\cdot 7\cdot 11\cdot 13)\\&=2\cdot (3^{2}\cdot 7^{2}\cdot 11^{2}\cdot 13^{2})\cdot (19^{2}\cdot 61)\\&=2\cdot (3^{2}\cdot 7^{2}\cdot 11^{2}\cdot 13^{2})\cdot 22021=2D,\end{aligned}}} where we ignore the fact that 22021 is composite ( 22021 = 19 2 ⋅ 61 ).

A Descartes number is defined as an odd number n = m ⋅ p where m and p are coprime and 2 n = σ( m ) ⋅ ( p + 1) , whence p is taken as a 'spoof' prime. The example given is the only one currently known.

If m is an odd almost perfect number , [ 1 ] that is, σ( m ) = 2 m − 1 and 2 m − 1 is taken as a 'spoof' prime, then n = m ⋅ (2 m − 1) is a Descartes number, since σ( n ) = σ( m ⋅ (2 m − 1)) = σ( m ) ⋅ 2 m = (2 m − 1) ⋅ 2 m = 2 n . If 2 m − 1 were prime, n would be an odd perfect number.

Properties [ edit ] If n is a cube-free Descartes number not divisible by 3 , then n has over one million distinct prime divisors.

[ 2 ] If D = p q {\displaystyle D=pq} is a Descartes number other than Descartes' example, with spoof-prime factor p {\displaystyle p} , then q > 10 12 {\displaystyle q>10^{12}} .

[ 3 ] Generalizations [ edit ] John Voight generalized Descartes numbers to allow negative bases. He found the example 3 4 7 2 11 2 19 2 ( − − 127 ) 1 {\displaystyle 3^{4}7^{2}11^{2}19^{2}(-127)^{1}} .

[ 4 ] Subsequent work by a group at Brigham Young University found more examples similar to Voight's example, [ 4 ] and also allowed a new class of spoofs where one is allowed to also not notice that a prime is the same as another prime in the factorization.

[ 5 ] A generalization of Descartes numbers to multiperfect numbers has also been constructed. ( Tóth (2025) ).
