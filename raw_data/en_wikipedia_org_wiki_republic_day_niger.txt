Nigeriens consider this date to be the founding of their national institutions. Between 18 December 1958 and 3 August 1960, Niger remained a semi-autonomous Republic within the French Community .

Commemoration [ edit ] Since 1958, the 18th has been an historic anniversary, widely commemorated, but not a national festival. In 2005, the government of the Fifth Republic of Niger declared the 18th a national holiday, in conjunction with the 3 August Independence Day .

[ 1 ] The 18th is celebrated in Niger with official festivals and appearances of political leaders, as well as public parties and festivities. It is a public holiday , in which government offices and many businesses close.  The 50th anniversary celebrations were held in 2008, centered not in the capitol, but in the regional center of Tillabéry , and surrounded by sports, musical and arts competitions, the construction and opening of new buildings, a National Youth Festival, and other public festivities. Since the beginning of this national festival in 2006, the official commemorations have always taken place at Regional capitals .

Zinder was chosen for 2006 (the 48th anniversary) and again in 2018, Tahoua for 2007 and again 2017, Agadez for 2016, Maradi for 2015, Dosso for 2014, etc.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The National Youth Festival, previously held at other dates, has been tied to the new Holiday.
