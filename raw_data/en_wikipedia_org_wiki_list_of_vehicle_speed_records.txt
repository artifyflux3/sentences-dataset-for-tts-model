This list only presents the single greatest speed achieved in each broad record category; for more information on records under variations of test conditions, see the specific article for each record category. As with many world records , there may be some dispute over the criteria for a record-setting event, the authority of the organization certifying the record, and the actual speed achieved.

Mars aircraft 36 22 - Ingenuity (uncrewed) 12 Oct 2023 (unofficial) [ 51 ] ^ Mach number depends on ambient temperature, and thus altitude, as well as speed; it is not a direct measure of speed.

^ Over a 3-kilometer course ^ Average speed over an out-and-return course of 500 km Noted unofficial records [ edit ] ^ Unofficial helicopter speed records by the Sikorsky X2 (460 km/h on 15 September 2010) and the Eurocopter X3 (472 km/h on 7 June 2013) would surpass this record if accepted.

^ Greater speeds reportedly achieved by rigid airships, including 140.3 kilometres per hour (87.2 mph) by the American USS Macon (ZRS-5) , are not recognized by the FAI, because these runs did not account for wind speed by flying a set course in both directions.

In 1968, a Soviet November-class submarine reportedly tracked an American carrier group traveling at 31 knots (57 km/h; 36 mph).

[ 64 ] Uncrewed torpedo speed claims range from 60 knots (110 km/h; 69 mph) for the British Spearfish torpedo [ 65 ] to 200 knots (370 km/h; 230 mph) for the Russian VA-111 Shkval .

[ 66 ] ^ a b Ground effect vehicles (a.k.a. "Wing-In-Ground effect vehicles") are classified as maritime vessels, rather than aircraft, by the International Maritime Organization.

[ 62 ] ^ Measured over 1 km with a flying start Spacecraft [ edit ] Main article: List of spaceflight records § Speed and altitude In order to unambiguously express the speed of a spacecraft, a frame of reference must be specified. Typically, this frame is fixed to the body with the greatest gravitational influence on the spacecraft, as this is the most relevant frame for most purposes.

[ 67 ] Velocities in different frames of reference are not directly comparable; thus the matter of the "fastest spacecraft" depends on the reference frame used.

Because of the influence of gravity, maximum velocities are usually attained when a spacecraft is close to its primary body: either just after launch, at a point of closest approach ( periapsis ), or during the early stages of atmospheric entry .
