The fauna of Colombia is characterized by a high biodiversity , with the highest rate of species by area unit worldwide.

[ 1 ] Endemic animals [ edit ] Colombia has the largest number of endemic species (species that are not found naturally anywhere else) worldwide. About 10% of the species in the world live in Colombia.

[ 2 ] Some determinant factors in the distribution range of the species are the weather conditions, temperature , humidity and sunlight availability.

Endemics can easily become endangered or extinct due to their restricted habitat and vulnerability to the actions of man, including the introduction of new organisms.

See also: Endemic birds of Colombia Ecoregions with high endemism [ edit ] According to the Colombian Ministry of Environment, the following ecoregions have the highest percentage of endemic species: Cocora valley ( Quindío ) Serranía de la Macarena ( Meta Department ) Gorgona, Colombia ( island in the Pacific Ocean ) Amacayacu National Park ( Amazonas Department ) Environmental issues [ edit ] Main article: Environmental issues in Colombia Birds [ edit ] See also: List of birds of Colombia White-throated toucan ( Ramphastos tucanus ) inhabits the Amazon Basin Channel-billed toucan ( Ramphastos vitellinus ) Emerald toucanet ( Aulacorhynchus prasinus ) Northern helmeted curassow ( Pauxi pauxi ) lives in the Cordillera Oriental, Colombia mountain range Andean cock-of-the-rock is distributed in Andean cloud forests Oilbirds can be seen in Cueva de los Guacharos National Park Male rufous-tailed jacamar Collared inca ( Coeligena torquata ) Giant hummingbird Long-billed starthroat ( Heliomaster longirostris ) Mourning dove ( Zenaida macroura ) White-crowned pigeon ( Patagioenas leucocephala ) Green jay ( Cyanocorax yncas ) Tree swallow ( Tachycineta bicolor ) Townsend's warbler ( Dendroica townsendi ) Blue-grey tanager ( Thraupis episcopus ) White-throated tinamou ( Tinamus guttatus ) Over 1800 species of birds have been described in Colombia, (more than the number of existent bird species in North America and Europe combined).

Band-backed wren Stripe-backed wren Yariguies brush-finch Yellow-crowned redstart Yellow-headed brush-finch Yellow-rumped warbler The national bird [ edit ] The Vultur gryphus also known as the Andean condor is the national bird of Colombia .

The Andean condor inhabits the Andes mountain range. Although it is primarily a scavenger , feeding on carrion , this species belongs to the New World vulture family Cathartidae .

The condor is one of the largest birds on earth with a wingspan ranging from 274 to 310 cm (108–122 in) and weighing up to 11–15 kg (24–33 lb) for males and 7.5–11 kg (16–24 lb) for females, but overall length can range from 117 to 135 cm (46 to 53 inches).

The adult plumage is of a uniform black, with the exception of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the first molting.

Mammals [ edit ] See also: List of mammals in Colombia and Primates of Colombia There are 456 reported species of mammals in Colombia.

[ 3 ] Of these, about 22% are endangered or critically endangered . Most of the threatened species status are due to human activities, in particular destruction of plant and animal habitats driven by local consumption of organic resources, especially related to tropical forest destruction.

[ 4 ] While most of the species that are becoming extinct are not food species, their biomass is converted into human food when their habitat is transformed into pasture and cropland .

Colombia has the largest number of terrestrial mammals species in the world, including among others: The spectacled bear another rare mammal species, similar to the giant panda in Asia.

Tamandua tetradactyla Callicebus cupreus West Indian manatee Black-mantled tamarin Three-striped night monkey Jaguarundi Hoffmann's two-toed sloth Eastern cottontail ( Sylvilagus floridanus ) Pale spear-nosed bat Colombian woolly monkey Colombian black-handed titi Coppery titi Lucifer titi Black titi Collared titipo Ornate titi White-fronted capuchin Olinguito Giant anteater Giant armadillo Greater long-nosed armadillo Hoffmann's two-toed sloth Jaguar Cougar Linnaeus's two-toed sloth Nine-banded armadillo Pale-throated thripee-toed sloth Pygmy marmoset Silky anteater Southern naked-tailed armadillo Southern tamandua Spectacled bear Brown-throated three-toed sloth Amazonian manatee West Indian manatee Hippopotamus . Most of the animals in Pablo Escobar's personal zoo were shipped back to their natural habitats except the hippopotamus; some escaped, and a wild population has established itself in Colombia's main river, the Magdelena. Spread over a growing area, nobody knows exactly how many there are, or what will be their lasting effect on the environment, but estimates of the total population in 2020 range from 40 to 60 individuals.

[ 5 ] Amphibians [ edit ] Colombia has the largest number of amphibians in the world (including frogs , toads , salamanders and caecilians ) with 589 species, 208 of them being endangered, being the zoological group with the highest rate of endangerment. Some causes related with the decline of the amphibians are: chytridiomycosis , habitat destruction , drought , air pollution , water pollution and illegal trade.

Following a rapid inventory of the Bajo Caguán-Caquetá region in 2019, there are 513 known species in the Caquetá river and 148 known species in the Caguán. During this inventory eight species were identified as possibly new to science.
