Newton-metre One newton-metre is the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to the end of a moment arm that is one metre long.

One newton-metre is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to the end of a moment arm that is one metre long.

The unit is also used less commonly as a unit of work , or energy , in which case it is equivalent to the more common and standard SI unit of energy, the joule .

[ 2 ] In this usage the metre term represents the distance travelled or displacement in the direction of the force, and not the perpendicular distance from a fulcrum (i.e. the lever arm length) as it does when used to express torque. This usage is generally discouraged, [ 3 ] since it can lead to confusion as to whether a given quantity expressed in newton-metres is a torque or a quantity of energy.

[ 4 ] "Even though torque has the same dimension as energy (SI unit joule), the joule is never used for expressing torque".

[ 4 ] Newton-metres and joules are dimensionally equivalent in the sense that they have the same expression in SI base units , 1 N ⋅ ⋅ m = 1 kg ⋅ ⋅ m 2 s 2 , 1 J = 1 k g ⋅ ⋅ m 2 s 2 {\displaystyle 1\,{\text{N}}{\cdot }\mathrm {m} =1\,{\frac {{\text{kg}}{\cdot }{\text{m}}^{2}}{{\text{s}}^{2}}}\quad ,\quad 1\,\mathrm {J} =1\,{\frac {\mathrm {kg} {\cdot }\mathrm {m} ^{2}}{\mathrm {s} ^{2}}}} but are distinguished in terms of applicable kind of quantity , to avoid misunderstandings when a torque is mistaken for an energy or vice versa. Similar examples of dimensionally equivalent units include Pa versus J/m 3 , Bq versus Hz , and ohm versus ohm per square .
