is a political and social movement rooted in African-American communities that aligns largely with the American conservative movement, including the Christian right .

[ 1 ] Black conservatism emphasizes social conservatism , traditionalism , patriotism , capitalism , and free markets . What characterizes a 'black conservative' has changed over time, and proponents do not necessarily share the same political philosophy.

Influential black Republicans in the early 21st century who have held public office include U.S. Senator Tim Scott , U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas , Virginia Lt. Gov.

Winsome Sears , and Cabinet secretaries Ben Carson , Condoleezza Rice , and Colin Powell . Political commentators Candace Owens , Thomas Sowell , Shelby Steele , Armstrong Williams , Larry Elder , Walter Williams , and Jason L. Riley are influential figures in black conservatism.

[ 2 ] Overview [ edit ] Booker T. Washington Beliefs [ edit ] One of the main characteristics of black conservatism is its emphasis on personal choice and responsibilities above socioeconomic status and institutional racism .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Black conservatives typically support do-for-self, self reliance, and personal responsibility. Black conservatives tend to be self-critical of aspects of African-American culture that they believe have created poverty and dependency.

[ 5 ] John McWhorter 's 2000 book Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America and Bill Cosby 's 2004 " Pound Cake speech " exemplified this critique, though their authors did not strictly come from the black conservative movement.

A 2007 Pew Research Center survey showed that 19% of blacks identified as Religious Right .

[ 6 ] In 2004, though, the Pew Research Center indicated only 7% of blacks identified as Republican.

[ 7 ] A National Election Pool poll showed that support for California Proposition 8 (2008) (a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as an opposite-sex union) was strong among African-American voters; 70% of those interviewed in the exit poll—a higher percentage than any other racial group—stated that they voted in favor of Proposition 8.

[ 8 ] Polls by both the Associated Press and CNN mirrored this data, reporting support among black voters to be at 70% [ 9 ] and 75%, [ 10 ] respectively. African-American support was considered crucial to the Proposition's passage because African Americans made up an unusually large percentage of voters in 2008; the presence of African-American presidential candidate Barack Obama on the ballot was believed to have increased African-American voter turnout.

[ 11 ] Historical basis [ edit ] From Reconstruction up until the New Deal , the black population tended to vote Republican. During that period, the Republican Party—particularly in the Southern United States —was seen as more racially progressive than the Democratic Party, primarily because of the role of the Southern wing of the Democratic Party as the party of racial segregation and the Republican Party's roots in the abolitionist movement (see Dixiecrats ).

Blacks started to shift in significant numbers to the Democrats with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt [ 12 ] and continued with the election of John F. Kennedy . Among Truman Administration officials, the publication of Henry Lee Moon 's Balance of Power spurred Democratic partisan support for African-American constituencies.

[ 13 ] This shift was also influenced by Herbert Hoover 's practice of firing loyal African-Americans from positions within the Republican Party, in order to increase his appeal to Southern white voters.

[ 14 ] This can be considered an early example of a set of Republican Party methods that were later termed the Southern Strategy .
