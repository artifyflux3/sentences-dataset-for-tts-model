**Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-3)** (;[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-4)German:[[jaˈkoːbi]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German"); 10 December 1804 – 18 February 1851) was a German [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") who made fundamental contributions to [elliptic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_function "Elliptic function"), [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics) "Dynamics (mechanics)"), [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation"), [determinants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinants "Determinants") and [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory").

Jacobi was born of [Ashkenazi Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jew "Ashkenazi Jew") parentage in [Potsdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam "Potsdam") on 10 December 1804. He was the second of four children of a banker, Simon Jacobi. His elder brother, [Moritz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_von_Jacobi "Moritz von Jacobi"), would also become known later as an engineer and physicist. He was initially home schooled by his uncle Lehman, who instructed him in the classical languages and elements of mathematics. In 1816, the twelve-year-old Jacobi went to the Potsdam [Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(Germany) "Gymnasium (Germany)"), where students were taught all the standard subjects: classical languages, history, philology, mathematics, sciences, etc. As a result of the good education he had received from his uncle, as well as his own remarkable abilities, after less than half a year Jacobi was moved to the senior year despite his young age. However, as the University would not accept students younger than 16 years old, he had to remain in the senior class until 1821. He used this time to advance his knowledge, showing interest in all subjects, including Latin, Greek, philology, history and mathematics. During this period he also made his first attempts at research, trying to solve the [quintic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintic_equation "Quintic equation") by [radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_solution "Algebraic solution").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKoenigsberger1904-5)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPierpont1906261%E2%80%93262-6)

In 1821 Jacobi went to study at [Berlin University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_University "Berlin University"), where he initially divided his attention between his passions for [philology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology "Philology") and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"). In philology, he participated in the seminars of [Böckh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_August_B%C3%B6ckh "Philipp August Böckh"), drawing the professor's attention with his talent. Jacobi did not follow a lot of mathematics classes at the time, finding the level of mathematics taught at Berlin University too elementary. He continued, instead, with his private study of the more advanced works of [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler "Euler"), [Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange "Lagrange") and [Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace "Laplace"). By 1823 he understood that he needed to make a decision between his competing interests and chose to devote all his attention to mathematics.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDirichlet1855193%E2%80%93217-7) In the same year he became qualified to teach secondary school and was offered a position at the [Joachimsthal Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachimsthal_Gymnasium "Joachimsthal Gymnasium") in Berlin. Jacobi decided instead to continue to work towards a university position. In 1825, he obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy with a dissertation on the [partial fraction decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_fraction_decomposition "Partial fraction decomposition") of [rational fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_fraction "Rational fraction") defended before a commission led by [Enno Dirksen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enno_Dirksen "Enno Dirksen"). He followed immediately with his [habilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation "Habilitation") and at the same time converted to Christianity. Now qualifying for teaching university classes, the 21-year-old Jacobi lectured in 1825/26 on the theory of [curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_curves "Differential geometry of curves") and [surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces "Differential geometry of surfaces") at the University of Berlin.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDirichlet1855193%E2%80%93217-7)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJames200269%E2%80%9374-8)

In 1826, Jacobi became a [private lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatdozent "Privatdozent"), in the next year an [extraordinary professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_in_Germany "Academic ranks in Germany"), and in finally 1829, a tenured professor of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") at [Königsberg University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nigsberg_University "Königsberg University"), and held the chair until 1842. He suffered a [breakdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_breakdown "Mental breakdown") from overwork in 1843. He then visited [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") for a few months to regain his health. On his return he moved to Berlin, where he lived as a royal pensioner, apart from a very brief interim, until his death.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-2) During the [Revolution of 1848](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_1848 "Revolution of 1848") Jacobi was politically involved and unsuccessfully presented his parliamentary candidature on behalf of a [Liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism "Liberalism") club. This led, after the suppression of the revolution, to his royal grant being cut off – but his fame and reputation were such that it was soon resumed, thanks to the personal intervention of [Alexander von Humboldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt "Alexander von Humboldt").

Jacobi died in 1851 from a [smallpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox "Smallpox") infection. His grave is preserved at a cemetery in the [Kreuzberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreuzberg "Kreuzberg") section of Berlin, the [Friedhof I der Dreifaltigkeits-Kirchengemeinde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Trinity_Church_(Berlin)#Cemeteries "Holy Trinity Church (Berlin)") (61 Baruther Street). His grave is close to that of [Johann Encke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Encke "Johann Encke"), the astronomer. The crater [Jacobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_(crater) "Jacobi (crater)") on the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") is named after him.

Jacobi's birth name was Jacques Simon, a French-style name (his father was Simon Jacobi).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-9) Later, his name was Germanized to Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi and published in its Latinized form as Carolus Gustavus Jacobus Jacobi. He is sometimes referred to as C. G. J. Jacobi.

Scientific contributions
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Scientific contributions")]

One of Jacobi's greatest accomplishments was his theory of [elliptic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_function "Elliptic function") and their relation to the elliptic [theta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_function "Theta function"). This was developed in his great treatise _[Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamenta\_nova\_theoriae\_functionum\_ellipticarum "Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum")_ (1829), and in later papers in [Crelle's Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crelle%27s_Journal "Crelle's Journal"). Theta functions are of great importance in mathematical physics because of their role in the inverse problem for periodic and [quasi-periodic flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiperiodic_motion "Quasiperiodic motion"). The [equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion "Equations of motion") are [integrable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_integral "Jacobi integral") in terms of [Jacobi's elliptic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi%27s_elliptic_functions "Jacobi's elliptic functions") in the well-known cases of the [pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum "Pendulum"), the [Euler top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange,_Euler,_and_Kovalevskaya_tops "Lagrange, Euler, and Kovalevskaya tops"), the symmetric Lagrange top in a [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field"), and the [Kepler problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_problem "Kepler problem") (planetary motion in a central gravitational field).

He also made fundamental contributions in the study of differential equations and to [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), notably the [Hamilton–Jacobi theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi_equation "Hamilton–Jacobi equation").

It was in algebraic development that Jacobi's particular power mainly lay, and he made important contributions of this kind in many areas of mathematics, as shown by his long list of papers in Crelle's Journal and elsewhere from 1826 onwards.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-2) He is said to have told his students that when looking for a research topic, one should 'Invert, always invert' (German original: _"man muss immer umkehren"_), reflecting his belief that inverting known results can open up new fields for research, for example inverting [elliptic integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_integral "Elliptic integral") and focusing on the nature of elliptic and theta functions.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVan_Vleck19161%E2%80%9313-10)

In his 1835 paper, Jacobi proved the following basic result classifying periodic (including elliptic) functions:

> If a univariate single-valued function is multiply [periodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function "Periodic function"), then such a function cannot have more than two periods, and the ratio of the periods cannot be a real number.

He discovered many of the fundamental properties of theta functions, including the functional equation and the [Jacobi triple product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_triple_product "Jacobi triple product") formula, as well as many other results on [q-series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-series "Q-series") and [hypergeometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_series "Hypergeometric series").

The solution of the [Jacobi inversion problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_inversion_problem "Jacobi inversion problem") for the hyperelliptic [Abel map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Jacobi_map "Abel–Jacobi map") by [Weierstrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Weierstrass "Karl Weierstrass") in 1854 required the introduction of the [hyperelliptic theta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperelliptic_theta_function&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hyperelliptic theta function (page does not exist)") and later the general Riemann theta function for [algebraic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve "Algebraic curve") of arbitrary [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_(mathematics) "Genus (mathematics)"). The [complex torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_torus "Complex torus") associated to a genus ![Image 2: {\displaystyle g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77) algebraic curve, obtained by quotienting ![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {C} }^{g}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a4cb0a5067cf9117517b748b99557c7c732f777a) by the [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(group) "Lattice (group)") of periods is referred to as the [Jacobian variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_variety "Jacobian variety"). This method of inversion, and its subsequent extension by Weierstrass and [Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann") to arbitrary algebraic curves, may be seen as a higher genus generalization of the relation between elliptic integrals and the Jacobi or Weierstrass elliptic functions.

Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi

Jacobi was the first to apply elliptic functions to [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"), for example proving [Fermat's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat "Pierre de Fermat")[two-square theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_theorem_on_sums_of_two_squares "Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares") and [Lagrange's four-square theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem "Lagrange's four-square theorem"), and similar results for 6 and 8 squares.

His other work in number theory continued the work of [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss"): new proofs of [quadratic reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_reciprocity "Quadratic reciprocity"), and the introduction of the [Jacobi symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_symbol "Jacobi symbol"); contributions to higher reciprocity laws, investigations of [continued fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction "Continued fraction"), and the invention of [Jacobi sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_sum "Jacobi sum").

He was also one of the early founders of the theory of determinants.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJacobi1841285%E2%80%93318-11) In particular, he invented the [Jacobian determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant "Jacobian matrix and determinant") formed from the _n_ 2 partial derivatives of _n_ given functions of _n_ independent variables, which plays an important part in changes of variables in multiple integrals, and in many analytical investigations.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-2) In 1841 he reintroduced the [partial derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative") ∂ notation of [Legendre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien-Marie_Legendre "Adrien-Marie Legendre"), which was to become standard.

He was one of the first to introduce and study the symmetric polynomials that are now known as [Schur polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_polynomial "Schur polynomial"), giving the so-called [bialternant formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_polynomial#Definition_(Jacobi's_bialternant_formula) "Schur polynomial") for these, which is a special case of the [Weyl character formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_character_formula "Weyl character formula"), and deriving the [Jacobi–Trudi identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_polynomial#Jacobi%E2%88%92Trudi_identities "Schur polynomial"). He also discovered the [Desnanot–Jacobi formula for determinants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgson_condensation#Desnanot%E2%80%93Jacobi_identity_and_proof_of_correctness_of_the_condensation_algorithm "Dodgson condensation"), which underlie the [Plücker relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%BCcker_embedding "Plücker embedding") for [Grassmannians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian "Grassmannian").

Students of [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)"), [Lie theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra"), [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") and [operator algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_algebra "Operator algebra") often encounter the [Jacobi identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_identity "Jacobi identity"), the analog of [associativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property "Associative property") for the [Lie bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_bracket_of_vector_fields "Lie bracket of vector fields") operation.

[Planetary theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Planetary_theory&action=edit&redlink=1 "Planetary theory (page does not exist)") and other particular dynamical problems likewise occupied his attention from time to time. While contributing to [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics"), he introduced the [Jacobi integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_integral "Jacobi integral") (1836) for a [sidereal coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_coordinate_systems "Astronomical coordinate systems"). His theory of the _last multiplier_ is treated in _Vorlesungen über Dynamik_, edited by [Alfred Clebsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Clebsch "Alfred Clebsch") (1866).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-2)

He left many manuscripts, portions of which have been published at intervals in Crelle's Journal. His other works include _Commentatio de transformatione integralis duplicis indefiniti in formam simpliciorem_ (1832), _[Canon arithmeticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon\_arithmeticus "Canon arithmeticus")_ (1839), and _Opuscula mathematica_ (1846–1857). His _Gesammelte Werke_ (1881–1891) were published by the [Berlin Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences "Prussian Academy of Sciences").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-2)
