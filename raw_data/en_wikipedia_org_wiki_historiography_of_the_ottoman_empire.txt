Scholars have long studied the Empire, looking at the causes for its formation (such as the Ghaza thesis ), its relations to the Great Powers (such as Sick man of Europe ) and other empires (such as Transformation of the Ottoman Empire ), and the kinds of people who became imperialists or anti-imperialists (such as the Young Turks ), together with their mindsets. The history of the breakdown of the Empire (such as Ottoman decline thesis ) has attracted scholars of the histories of the Middle East (such as Partition of the Ottoman Empire ), and Greece ( Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire ).

Formulable theses [ edit ] Those about the emergence of the Ottoman Empire [ edit ] Main article: Osman's Dream Ghaza thesis — it is formulated first, but it is the most criticized and politicized. The thesis most clearly advocates the ethnic pan-Turkic principle. It was developed by Paul Wittek ; [ 1 ] Renegade thesis — represented in studies, articles and books by various authors. It is based on numerous eyewitness accounts. It is supplemented by the hypothesis of the geographical and to some extent civilizational succession of the Ottoman Empire ( Rûm ) by the Eastern Roman Empire ; Marxist models. Early Marxist interpretations, influenced by Marx and Engels' own writings, often characterized the Ottoman Empire (along with other "Oriental" societies) as operating under an " Asiatic mode of production " and " Oriental Despotism ".

[ 2 ] Socio-economic thesis — the newest and most modern, sustained in the traditions of Marxist historiography . The thesis is found in various articles and studies. It is based on the aftermath of the Black Death and the legacy of the Byzantine civil wars .

[ 3 ] Those about the decline of the Ottoman Empire [ edit ] Classic thesis — as a result of the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) with the subsequent Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca . Previously marked by the beginning of the reign of Catherine the Great , the writing of " Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya " and the death of Koca Ragıp Pasha ; Ottoman decline thesis — now-controversial thesis clearly formulated for the first time in 1958 by Bernard Lewis .

[ 4 ] Aligns with Koçi Bey 's risalets , but arguably ignores the Köprülü era and its reform of the Ottoman state, economy and navy heading into the 18th century; Neoclassical thesis — to some extent it unites the previous ones about the beginning of the Ottoman decline, which are divided even nearly two centuries in time. The beginning of the end was marked by the Treaty of Karlowitz , the Edirne event and the reign of Ahmed III .

Archival sources [ edit ] See also: Ottoman Archives and Ottoman Bank Archives and Research Centre Ottoman history has been rewritten for political and cultural advantage and speculative theories rife with inconsistent research, ahistorical assumptions and embedded biases.

[ 5 ] Partly because the archives are moderately new. The Ottoman Archives are a collection of historical sources related to the Ottoman Empire and a total of 39 nations whose territories one time or the other were part of this Empire, including 19 nations in the Middle East , 11 in the EU and Balkans , three in the Caucasus , two in Central Asia , Cyprus , as well as Palestine and the Republic of Turkey .

Ottoman Bank Archives and Research Centre operated in the former Head Office of the Ottoman Bank .

[ 6 ] Establishment of the Empire [ edit ] Main articles: Ghaza thesis and Osman's Dream Osman's Dream is a mythological story relating to the life of Osman I , founder of the Ottoman Empire . The story describes a dream experienced by Osman while staying in the home of a religious figure, Sheikh Edebali , in which he sees a metaphorical vision predicting the growth and prosperity of an empire to be ruled by him and his descendants. However there are other thesis addresses the question of how the Ottomans were able to expand from a small principality on the frontier of the Byzantine Empire into a centralized, intercontinental empire. According to the Ghaza thesis, the Ottomans accomplished this by attracting recruits to fight for them in the name of Islamic holy war against the non-believers . Such a warrior was known in Turkish as a ghazi , and thus this thesis sees the early Ottoman state as a "Ghazi State," defined by an ideology of holy war. The Ghaza Thesis dominated early Ottoman historiography throughout much of the twentieth century before coming under increasing criticism beginning in the 1980s.

[ 7 ] Historians now generally reject the Ghaza Thesis, and consequently the idea that Ottoman expansion was primarily fueled by holy war, but are conflicted with regard to what to replace it with.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Effect of nationalism [ edit ] Main article: Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire In seeking new identities and ideological foundations for their states, Arabs and Turks invoked ancient history: the Pharaohs, Kings of Babylon, and the Hittites of pre-Ottoman Anatolia. This could involve hostility and often vilification, [ 10 ] not so much regarding specific Ottoman policies but more about state building processes.

[ 11 ] Doumani’s study of the Arab region of Ottoman Palestine notes: "most Arab nationalists view the entire Ottoman era as a period of oppressive Turkish rule which stifled Arab culture and socioeconomic development and paved the way for European colonial control and the Zionist takeover of Palestine." [ 12 ] The 19th- and early 20th-century literature written by Westerners bent on "discovering" the Holy Land—that is, reclaiming it from what they believed was a stagnant and declining Ottoman Empire—provided the intellectual foundation for this shared image.

Ottoman Industrial Revolution [ edit ] Regarding the Ottoman Industrial Revolution, Edward Clark said, Ottoman responses to this European economic challenge are relatively unknown, and even the extensive and costly Ottoman industrial efforts of the 1840s seemingly have been dismissed as the casual, if not comical games of disinterested bureaucrats... What were the nature and magnitude of these Ottoman responses? What were Ottoman objectives? What main factors contributed to their failures? What if any achievements resulted?

[ 13 ] Collapse of the Empire [ edit ] Main article: Ottoman Decline Thesis Many twentieth-century scholars argued that power of the Ottoman Empire began waning after the death of Suleiman the Magnificent in 1566, and without the acquisition of significant new wealth the empire went into decline, a concept known as the Ottoman Decline Thesis . Since the late 1970s, however, historians increasingly came to question the idea of Ottoman decline, and now there is a consensus among academic historians that the Ottoman Empire did not decline.

Scholars following in Wittek's footsteps have moved away from his strong formulation [...] It is probably safe to suggest that at the moment there is no agreed point of reference about which most scholars gather, and that a more eclectic approach, resting more on the sources than on scholarly tradition, holds the field.

The early Ottoman military activity described as ghaza is now thought to have been a much more fluid undertaking, sometimes referring to actions that were nothing more than raids, sometimes meaning a deliberate holy war, but most often combining a mixture of these elements.

Ottomanist historians have produced several works in the last decades, revising the traditional understanding of this period from various angles, some of which were not even considered as topics of historical inquiry in the mid-twentieth century. Thanks to these works, the conventional narrative of Ottoman history – that in the late sixteenth century the Ottoman Empire entered a prolonged period of decline marked by steadily increasing military decay and institutional corruption – has been discarded.
