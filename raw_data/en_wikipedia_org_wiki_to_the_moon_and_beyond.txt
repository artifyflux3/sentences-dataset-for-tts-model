It depicted traveling from Earth out to an overall view of the universe and back again, zooming down to the atomic scale. It was filmed in a Cinerama process using a camera with a single fisheye lens and projected onto a dome screen.

Description [ edit ] The film was made in a format called "The New CINERAMA - 360 Process"  It was shown in a 96-foot-high "Moon Dome" that was part of Transportation and Travel building (Pavilion No. 123) in the Transportation section of the Fair and was presented by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines . The film was narrated by Rod Serling .

[ 1 ] Production [ edit ] Felix Bednarz designed the Cinerama 360 lens for Fairchild-Curtis (US 3,230,826 [1961]) The film was created using Cinerama 360° - a process that recorded on 70mm film at 18 fps using a fish-eye wide angle lens .

[ 2 ] It was projected in a domed theater using a similar wide angle projector. The film was made by Graphic Films Corporation, a company run by former Disney animator Lester Novros who had been making technical films for NASA, the US Air Force, and various aerospace clients.

[ 3 ] Influences on 2001: A Space Odyssey [ edit ] Stanley Kubrick saw the film at the Fair and was so impressed by its special effects and accurate depiction of scientifically based material that he hired Graphic Films as a design consultant on a film he already had in pre-production, 2001: A Space Odyssey .

[ 3 ] Graphic Films' Lester Novros, Con Pederson , and background artist Douglas Trumbull would air-mail research based concept sketches and notes covering the mechanics and physics of space travel to Kubrick in England during pre-production. They would go on to create storyboards for a portion of the space flight sequences seen in the film.

[ 3 ] Trumbull would eventually leave Graphic Films to become a special effects supervisor on 2001 .
