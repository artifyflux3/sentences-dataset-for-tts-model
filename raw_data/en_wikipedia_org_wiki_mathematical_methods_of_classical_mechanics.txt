Arnold Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics (title of the original in Russian: Математические методы классической механики ) is a textbook by mathematician Vladimir I. Arnold . It was originally written in Russian, and later translated into English by A. Weinstein and K. Vogtmann .

[ 1 ] It is aimed at graduate students.

A second edition was published in 1979, and a third in 1989. The book has since been translated into a number of other languages, including French, German, Japanese and Mandarin.

Reviews [ edit ] The Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society said, "The [book] under review [...] written by a distinguished mathematician [...is one of] the first textbooks [to] successfully to present to students of mathematics and physics, [sic] classical mechanics in a modern setting." [ 2 ] A book review in the journal Celestial Mechanics said, "In summary, the author has succeeded in producing a mathematical synthesis of the science of dynamics. The book is well presented and beautifully translated [...] Arnold's book is pure poetry; one does not simply read it, one enjoys it."
