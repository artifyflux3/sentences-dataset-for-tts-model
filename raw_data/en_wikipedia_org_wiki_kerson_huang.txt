Huang was born in Nanning , China and grew up in Manila , Philippines . He earned a B.S.

and a Ph.D.

in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1950 and 1953, respectively. He served as an instructor at MIT from 1953 to 1955, and subsequently spent two years as a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study . After returning to the MIT faculty in 1957, Huang became an authority on statistical physics , and worked on Bose–Einstein condensation and quantum field theory . At MIT, he had many PhD students in theoretical physics including Raymond G. Vickson [ 1 ] who became a professor in Operations Research at the University of Waterloo. After retiring in 1999, he wrote on biophysics and was also a visiting professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore .

[ 2 ] Huang was best known to Chinese readers as the translator of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam ; while a graduate student in physics, he adapted Edward FitzGerald 's famous adaptation into Classical Chinese verse. The book ( Chinese : 魯拜集 ) had been out of print for years, but was reprinted in Taiwan in 1989. With his wife Rosemary, Huang also translated the ancient divination text I Ching into English.

[ 3 ] Huang died on 1 September 2016 at the age of 88.
