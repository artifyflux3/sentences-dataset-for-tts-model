The tetralemma is a figure that features prominently in the logic of India .

Definition [ edit ] It states that with reference to any logical proposition (or axiom) X, there are four possibilities: X {\displaystyle X} (affirmation) ¬ ¬ X {\displaystyle \neg X} (negation) X ∧ ∧ ¬ ¬ X {\displaystyle X\land \neg X} (both) ¬ ¬ ( X ∨ ∨ ¬ ¬ X ) {\displaystyle \neg (X\lor \neg X)} (neither) Catuskoti [ edit ] The history of fourfold negation, the Catuskoti (Sanskrit), is evident in the logico-epistemological tradition of India, given the categorical nomenclature Indian logic in Western discourse. Subsumed within the auspice of Indian logic, ' Buddhist logic ' has been particularly focused in its employment of the fourfold negation, as evidenced by the traditions of Nagarjuna and the Madhyamaka , particularly the school of Madhyamaka given the retroactive nomenclature of Prasangika by the Tibetan Buddhist logico-epistemological tradition. Though tetralemma was also used as a form inquiry rather than logic in the Nasadiya Sukta of Rigveda (creation hymn) though seems to be rarely used as a tool of logic before Buddhism.
