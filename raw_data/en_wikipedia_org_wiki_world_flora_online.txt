Description [ edit ] The World Flora Online (WFO) is an open-access database, launched in October 2012 as a follow-up project to The Plant List , with the aim of publishing an online flora of all known plants by 2020.

[ 1 ] It is a project of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity , with goal of halting the loss of plant species worldwide by 2020. It is developed by a collaborative group of institutions around the world in response to the 2011–2020 Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC)'s updated Target 1: to produce "an online flora of all known plants".

An accessible flora of all known plant species was considered a fundamental requirement for plant conservation. It provides a baseline for the achievement and monitoring of other targets of the strategy. The previous target of GSPC was achieved in 2010 with The Plant List.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] WFO was conceived in 2012 by an initial group of four institutions; the Missouri Botanical Garden , the New York Botanical Garden , the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew .

[ 4 ] In all, 36 institutions are involved in the production.

[ 3 ] World Flora Online developed WFO's Plant List (wfoplantlist.org) to replace the traditional Plant List v.1.1 (plantlist.org).

[ 5 ] In 2024, Pl@ntNet joined the WFO consortium.
