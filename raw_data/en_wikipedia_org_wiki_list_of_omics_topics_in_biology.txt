Some of these terms are related to each other in a hierarchical fashion. For example, the genome contains the ORFeome , which gives rise to the transcriptome , which is translated to the proteome . Other terms are overlapping and refer to the structure and/or function of a subset of proteins (e.g.

glycome , kinome ).

An omicist is a scientist who studies omeomics, cataloging all the “omics” subfields.

[ 1 ] Omics.org is a Wiki that collects and alphabetically lists all the known "omes" and "omics." [ 2 ] List of topics [ edit ] -ome Field of study (-omics) Collection of Parent subject Notes Acetylome Acetylomics [ 3 ] complete set of proteins and their corresponding lysine residues that undergo acetylation Molecular Biology Allergenome Allergenomics [ 4 ] Proteomics of allergens Genetics Antibodyome Antibodyomics The complete set of antibodies present in an organism Immunology Archaeome Archaeomics The collective genetic material of microorganisms in archaeological samples Microbiology Bacteriome Bacteriomics Community of bacteria associated with a particular ecological niche or host organism Microbiology Bibliome Bibliomics Scientific bibliographic data Biointeractome Biointeractomics The complete set of molecular interactions within a biological system Molecular Biology Biome The whole set of ecological community of organisms and environments Ecology Cellome Cellomics Cellular Biology Connectome Connectomics Structural and functional brain connectivity at different spatiotemporal scales Neuroscience Cytome Cytomics Cellular systems of an organism Cytology Editome RNA editing sites Embryome Embryomics Cell lineages of embryonic cells, genes expressed and antigens present during development Embryology Envirome Enviromics Gene related environment factors (envirome) Environmental DNA Environmental omics Sequencing of ambient DNA Epigenome Epigenomics Epigenetic modifications Molecular genetics Epigenomics is the study of the complete set of epigenetic modifications on the genetic material of a cell, collectively known as the epigenome Exposome (2005) Exposomics An individual's environmental exposures , including in the prenatal environment Molecular genetics A proposed term and field of study of the disease-causing effects of environmental factors (the " nurture " component of " nature vs. nurture ").

[ 5 ] Exposome (2009) Composite occupational exposures and occupational health problems Occupational safety and health The proposers of this term were aware of the previous term as used above but proposed to apply the term to a new field.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Exome Exomics Exons in a genome Molecular Genetics Foodome Foodomics Food and Nutrition issues related to bioactivity, quality, safety and traceability of foods through the application and integration of advanced omics technologies to improve consumer's well-being, health, and confidence.

Nutrition The term was first defined in 2009 [ 8 ] Genome Genomics ( Classical genetics ) Genes ( DNA sequences / Chromosomes ) Genetics "Genome" refers to the set of all genes in an organism. However, "genome" was coined decades before it was discovered that most DNA is " non-coding " and not part of a gene; thus, "genome" originally referred to the entire collection of DNA within an organism. Today, both definitions are used, depending on the context.

[ 9 ] Glycome Glycomics Glycans Glycobiology Hologenome Hologenomics Genomes of community members (i.e., holobionts ) Metagenomics Humeome Humeomics The chemical components of soil humus Soil science Interferome Interferomics Interferons Immunology Also a database of the same name.

[ 10 ] Interactome Interactomics All interactions The term "interactomics" is generally not used. Instead, interactomes are considered the study of systems biology .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Ionome Ionomics Inorganic biomolecules Molecular Biology Kinome Kinomics Kinases Molecular Biology Proteins that add a phosphate group Lipidome Lipidomics [ 13 ] Lipids Biochemistry Mechanome Mechanomics The mechanical systems within an organism Metabolome Metabolomics Metabolites All products of a biological reaction (including intermediates) Metagenome Metagenomics Genetic material found in an environmental sample Molecular Biology The genetic material is assumed to contain DNA from multiple organisms and therefore multiple genomes, hence the inclusion of the prefix meta- .

Metallome Metallomics Metals and metalloids Microbiome microbiomics Collection of microorganisms in another organism such as an animal Microbiology Obesidome Obesidomics Obesity related proteins Proteomics Coined by Pardo et al., 2012.

[ 14 ] ORFeome ORFeomics Open reading frames (ORFs) Molecular Genetics Organome Organomics Organ interactions Cellular Signalling / Cell Signaling and Tissue Engineering The study of crosstalk between organs using physiologically relevant in-vitro models Parvome Parvomics Secondary metabolites Biochemistry Coined by Mark Martin and introduced by Julian Davies in 2008, referring to the Latin parvus for "small", and describing the "humungous microbial world of small (secreted) molecules of great structural diversity".
