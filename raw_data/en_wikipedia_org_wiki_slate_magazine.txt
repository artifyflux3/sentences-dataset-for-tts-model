_**Slate**_ is an [online magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_magazine "Online magazine") that covers current affairs, politics, and culture in the United States. It was created in 1996 by former _[New Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_Republic "The New Republic")_ editor [Michael Kinsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kinsley "Michael Kinsley"), initially under the ownership of [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") as part of [MSN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN "MSN"). In 2004, it was purchased by [The Washington Post Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Holdings "Graham Holdings") (later renamed the Graham Holdings Company), and since 2008 has been managed by [The Slate Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Slate_Group "The Slate Group"), an online publishing entity created by Graham Holdings. _Slate_ is based in New York City, with an additional office in Washington, D.C.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-1)

_Slate_, which is updated throughout the day, covers politics, arts and culture, sports, and news. According to its former editor-in-chief [Julia Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Turner_(journalist) "Julia Turner (journalist)"), the magazine is "not fundamentally a breaking news source", but rather aimed at helping readers to "analyze and understand and interpret the world" with witty and entertaining writing.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:0-2) As of mid-2015, it publishes about 1,500 stories per month.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:4-3)

A French version, _slate.fr_, was launched in February 2009 by a group of four journalists, including [Jean-Marie Colombani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Marie_Colombani "Jean-Marie Colombani"), Eric Leser, and economist [Jacques Attali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Attali "Jacques Attali"). Among them, the founders hold 50 percent in the publishing company, while The Slate Group holds 15 percent.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-5) In 2011, _slate.fr_ started a separate site covering African news, _Slate Afrique_, with a Paris-based editorial staff.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-6)

As of 2021, the magazine is both ad-supported and has a membership model with a [metered paywall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metered_paywall "Metered paywall"). It is known, and sometimes criticized, for having adopted [contrarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrarian "Contrarian") views, giving rise to the term "Slate Pitches".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:1-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:2-9) It has a generally [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States "Modern liberalism in the United States") editorial stance.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-12)

Background
----------

_Slate_ features regular and semi-regular columns such as _Explainer, Moneybox, Spectator, Transport_, and _[Dear Prudence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dear\_Prudence\_(advice\_column) "Dear Prudence (advice column)")_. Many of the articles are short (less than 2,000 words) and argument-driven. Around 2010, the magazine also began running long-form journalism. Many of the longer stories are an outgrowth of the "Fresca Fellowships", so-called because former editor Plotz liked the soft drink [Fresca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresca "Fresca"). "The idea is that every writer and editor on staff has to spend a month or six weeks a year not doing their regular job, but instead working on a long, ambitious project of some sort", Plotz said in an interview.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-13)

_Slate_ introduced a [paywall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall "Paywall")-based business model in 1998 that attracted up to 20,000 subscribers but was later abandoned.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:5-14) A similar subscription model was implemented in April 2001 by _Slate_'s independently owned competitor, [Salon.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon.com "Salon.com").

_Slate_ started a daily feature, "Today's Pictures", on November 30, 2005, which featured 15â€“20 photographs from the archive at [Magnum Photos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_Photos "Magnum Photos") that share a common theme. The column also features two animated "Interactive Essays" a month.

The design of _Slate_'s homepage from 2006 to 2013

On its 10th anniversary, _Slate_ unveiled a redesigned website. It introduced _Slate V_ in 2007,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-15) an online video magazine with content that relates to or expands upon their written articles. In 2013, the magazine was redesigned under the guidance of design director [Vivian Selbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Selbo "Vivian Selbo").

_Slate_ was nominated for four digital [National Magazine Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Magazine_Awards "National Magazine Awards") in 2011 and won the [NMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_society_of_magazine_editors#National_Magazine_Awards "American society of magazine editors") for General Excellence. In the same year, the magazine laid off several high-profile journalists, including co-founder [Jack Shafer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Shafer "Jack Shafer") and [Timothy Noah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Noah "Timothy Noah") (author of the _Chatterbox_ column).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:6-16) At the time, it had around 40 full-time editorial staff.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:6-16) The following year, a dedicated ad sales team was created.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-17)

_Slate_ launched the "Slate Book Review" in 2012, a monthly books section edited by Dan Kois.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-18)

The next year, _Slate_ became profitable after preceding years had seen layoffs and falling ad revenues.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:0-2)

In 2014, _Slate_ introduced a [paywall system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall_system "Paywall system") called "Slate Plus", offering ad-free podcasts and bonus materials. A year later, it had attracted 9,000 subscribers generating about $500,000 in annual revenue.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:5-14)

_Slate_ moved all content behind a [metered paywall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metered_paywall "Metered paywall") for international readers in June 2015, explaining "our U.S.-based sales team sells primarily to domestic advertisers, many of whom only want to reach a domestic audience. ...The end result is that, outside the United States, we are not covering our costs."[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-19) At the same time, it was stated that there were no plans for a domestic paywall.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:4-3)

### Reputation for counterintuitive arguments ("Slate pitches")

Since 2006,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:1-8)_Slate_ has been known for publishing [contrarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrarian "Contrarian") pieces arguing against commonly held views about a subject, giving rise to the #slatepitches Twitter [hashtag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag "Hashtag") in 2009.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:2-9) The _[Columbia Journalism Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia\_Journalism\_Review "Columbia Journalism Review")_ has defined _Slate_[pitches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_Pitch "Sales Pitch") as "an idea that sounds wrong or counterintuitive proposed as though it were the tightest logic ever", and in explaining its success wrote "Readers want to click on Slate Pitches because they want to know what a writer could possibly say that would support their logic".[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-20)

In 2014, _Slate_'s then editor-in-chief Julia Turner acknowledged a reputation for counterintuitive arguments forms part of _Slate_'s "distinctive" brand, but argued that the hashtag misrepresents the site's journalism. "We are not looking to argue that up is down and black is white for the sake of being contrarian against all logic or intellectual rigor. But journalism is more interesting when it surprises you either with the conclusions that it reaches or the ways that it reaches them."[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:0-2)

In a 2019 article for the site, _Slate_ contributor Daniel Engber reflected on the changes that had occurred on the site since he started writing for it 15 years previously. He suggested that its original worldview, influenced by its founder Kinsley and described by Engber as "feisty, surprising, debate-club centrist-by-default" and "liberal contrarianism", had shifted towards "a more reliable, left-wing slant", whilst still giving space for heterodox opinions, albeit "tempered by other, graver duties". He argued that this was necessary within the context of a "Manichean age of flagrant cruelty and corruption", although he also acknowledged that it could be "a troubling limitation".[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-21)

Podcasts
--------

According to NiemanLab, _Slate_ has been involved in [podcasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast "Podcast") "almost from the very beginning" of the medium.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-NJLab-22) Its first podcast offering, released on July 15, 2005,[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-23) featured selected stories from the site read by Andy Bowers, who had joined _Slate_ after leaving [NPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR "NPR") in 2003.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-NJLab-22)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:3-24) By June 2012, _Slate_ had expanded their lineup to 19 podcasts, with _Political Gabfest_ and _Culture Gabfest_ being the most popular.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-NJLab-22) This count had shrunk to 14 by February 2015, with all receiving six million downloads per month.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-:3-24) The podcasts are "a profitable part of [_Slate'_ s] business"; the magazine charges more for advertising in its podcasts than in any of its other content.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)#cite_note-NJLab-22)
