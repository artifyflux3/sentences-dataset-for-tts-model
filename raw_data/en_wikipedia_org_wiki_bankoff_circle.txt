The Bankoff circle was first constructed by Leon Bankoff in 1974.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Construction [ edit ] The Bankoff circle is formed from three semicircles that create an arbelos . A circle C 1 is then formed tangent to each of the three semicircles, as an instance of the problem of Apollonius . Another circle C 2 is then created, through three points: the two points of tangency of C 1 with the smaller two semicircles, and the point where the two smaller semicircles are tangent to each other.

C 2 is the Bankoff circle.

Radius of the circle [ edit ] If r = AB / AC , then the radius of the Bankoff circle is: R = 1 2 r ( 1 − − r ) .

{\displaystyle R={\frac {1}{2}}r\left(1-r\right).} References [ edit ] ^ Bankoff, L.
