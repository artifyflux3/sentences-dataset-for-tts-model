'Ted' Daeschler is an American vertebrate paleontologist and Associate Curator and Chair of Vertebrate Biology at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia .  He is a specialist in fish paleontology , especially in the Late Devonian , and in the development of the first limbed vertebrates.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] He is the  discoverer of the transitional fossil tetrapod Hynerpeton bassetti , [ 4 ] and a Devonian fish-like specimen of Sauripterus taylori with fingerlike appendages, [ 5 ] and was also part of a team of researchers that discovered the transitional fossil Tiktaalik .

He received a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998.

[ 6 ] He has held recent research grants from the National Science Foundation , the National Geographic Society , and other donors. He is also known for his work on the preservation of natural history collections.

[ 7 ] He is a professor at Drexel University in the Department of Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science.
