The country is located in Central America and bounded to the north and west by Mexico , to the east by Belize and by the Gulf of Honduras , to the east by Honduras , to the southeast by El Salvador , and to the south by the Pacific Ocean . Two mountain chains enter Guatemala from west to east, dividing the country into three major regions: the highlands , where the mountains are located; the Pacific coast, south of the mountains; and the limestone plateau of the Petén region , north of the mountains. These areas vary in climate, elevation, and landscape, providing dramatic contrasts between hot and humid tropical lowlands and highland peaks and valleys.

Regions [ edit ] Regions of Guatemala The southern edge of the western highlands is marked by the Sierra Madre , which stretches from the Mexican border south and east, and continues at lower elevations toward El Salvador . The mountain chain is characterised by steep volcanic cones, including Tajumulco Volcano 4,220 m or 13,845 ft, the highest point in the country and Central America . All of Guatemala's 37 volcanoes (3 of them active: Pacaya , Santiaguito and Fuego ), are in this mountain chain, and are abundant in the highlands.

The northern chain of mountains begins near the Mexican border with the Cuchumatanes range, then stretches east through the Chuacús and Chamá sierras, down to the Santa Cruz and Minas sierras, near the Caribbean Sea . The northern and southern mountains are separated by the Motagua valley, where the Motagua river and its tributaries drains from the highlands into the Caribbean being navigable in its lower end, where it forms the boundary with Honduras .

The rivers are short and shallow in the Pacific vertient, larger and deeper, such as the Polochic which drains in Lake Izabal , Río Dulce , Motagua and Sarstún that forms the boundary with Belize in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico vertient ( Usumacinta , which forms the boundary between Chiapas , Mexico and Petén and its tributaries such as La Pasión and San Pedro .

Most of the major cities are located in the Highlands. Major cities are the capital Guatemala City , elevation 1,500 m ( Central Highlands ), Antigua Guatemala , elevation 1,530 m ( Central Highlands ), Quetzaltenango elevation 2,350 m ( Western Highlands ) and Puerto Barrios on the Caribbean coast. The largest lake Lago de Izabal (589.6 km 2 ), is close to the Caribbean coast.

Volcán Tajumulco , 4,220 m, the highest point in Central America, is located in the western department of San Marcos .

The last major earthquake was on February 4, 1976, killing more than 23,000 in the Central Highlands.

Climate [ edit ] Guatemala map of Köppen climate classification zones Climate is hot and humid in the Pacific and Petén Lowlands. It is more temperate in the highlands, to freezing cold at the high of the Cuchumatanes range, and hot/drier in the easternmost departments.

Guatemala's location on the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean makes it a target for hurricanes , including Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and Hurricane Stan in October 2005, which killed more than 1,500 people. The damage was not wind related, but caused by flooding and landslides.

[ edit ] Climate change in Guatemala is a serious issue as Guatemala is considered one of 10 nations most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

[ 5 ] In 2010, Guatemala "ranked second in the world on the Global Climate Risk Index, which indicates the level of exposure and vulnerability to extreme events." [ 6 ] Both commercial agricultural production and subsistence farming have declined, and thus subsistence farmers find it more difficult to find work as day laborers when their own harvests fail .

[ 7 ] About 300,000 subsistence farmers reported crop loss due to drought in 2018.

[ 8 ] About half of Guatemala's workforce is in the agricultural sector.

[ 9 ] Poor crop yields due to climate change have been identified as a factor in migration to the United States.
