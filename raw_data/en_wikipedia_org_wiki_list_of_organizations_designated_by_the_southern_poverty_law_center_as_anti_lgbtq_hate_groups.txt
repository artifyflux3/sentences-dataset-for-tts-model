[ 1 ] The SPLC defines hate groups as those that "... have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics." The SPLC states that hate group activities may include speeches, marches, rallies, meetings, publishing, leafleting, and criminal acts such as violence.

[ 2 ] The SPLC classifies organizations that propagate "known falsehoods – claims about LGBTQ people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities – and repeated, groundless name-calling" as anti-LGBTQ hate groups. The SPLC states that "viewing homosexuality as unbiblical does not qualify organizations to be listed as hate groups." [ 3 ] SPLC President J. Richard Cohen clarified "[B]y 'known falsehoods,' we mean such things as asserting that gays and lesbians are more disposed to molesting children than heterosexuals – which the overwhelming weight of credible scientific research has determined is patently untrue. Nowhere in our report do we equate taking a position against same-sex marriage with hate speech." [ 4 ] Types of hate groups [ edit ] Main article: List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as hate groups The SPLC reported that 926 hate groups were active in the United States in 2008, up from 888 in 2007. These included: 186 separate Ku Klux Klan (KKK) groups (race hate) 196 neo-Nazi groups 111 white nationalist groups 98 white power skinhead groups 39 Christian Identity groups 93 neo-Confederate groups 113 black separatist groups 159 patriot movement groups 90 general hate groups subdivided into anti-LGBTQ , anti-Muslim , anti-immigrant , Holocaust denial , white power music , radical traditionalist Catholic groups, and other groups espousing a variety of hateful doctrines.

Tracking of hate groups: commendation and criticism [ edit ] The Southern Poverty Law Center has provided the FBI with information on hate groups.

[ 5 ] Since 1981, the SPLC has published a quarterly Intelligence Report that provides updates on its monitoring of what it describes as radical right hate groups and extremists in the United States, providing information on the organizational efforts and tactics of these groups.

[ 6 ] It has been cited by scholars as a reliable source on right-wing extremism and hate groups.

[ 7 ] The SPLC also publishes a newsletter, the HateWatch Weekly , and maintains a blog, HateWatch , which monitor the extreme right.

[ 8 ] Rory McVeigh, Chair of the University of Notre Dame Sociology Department, described the SPLC as "an excellent source of information for social scientists who study hate groups." [ 9 ] The SPLC's data on hate groups was questioned by journalist Ken Silverstein who argues that the organization sometimes exaggerates the threats posed by certain groups.

[ 10 ] In the wake of an August 2012 shooting at the headquarters of the Family Research Council , Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank criticized the SPLC's listing of the Family Research Council as an anti-gay hate group while others, including Americablog 's former editor John Aravosis , defended the categorization.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] History of the LGBTQ list [ edit ] In November 2010, thirteen groups were added: American Family Association , Family Research Council , Illinois Family Institute , Americans for Truth about Homosexuality , Heterosexuals Organized for a Moral Environment , Family Research Institute , Abiding Truth Ministries , American Vision , Chalcedon Foundation , Dove World Outreach Center , Faithful Word Baptist Church , Traditional Values Coalition , and MassResistance .

[ 13 ] With these new groups SPLC stated that gays remain the minority most targeted by hate crimes.

[ 14 ] In March 2012, the SPLC added eleven groups to the listing: United Families International , SaveCalifornia.com , Sons of Thundr (a.k.a. Faith Baptist Church), You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International , Parents Action League , Jewish Political Action Committee, Mission: America , Windsor Hills Baptist Church, True Light Pentecost Church, Tom Brown Ministries, and Public Advocate of the United States .

[ 15 ] In early 2014, the SPLC added seven groups: World Congress of Families /Howard Center For Family, Religion and Society, based in Rockford, Illinois, the Catholic Family and Human Rights institute (C-FAM), the Ruth Institute, the Pray in Jesus Name Project, Pacific Justice Institute , Mission: America and the Liberty Counsel .

[ 16 ] In 2024, the SPLC added two anti-transgender organizations to the list: Genspect and Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine (SEGM).

[ 17 ] Notable groups listed [ edit ] Anti-LGBT , against lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , and queer / questioning ( LGBTQ ) people, or anti-gay can refer to activities in certain categories (or combination of categories): attitudes against or discrimination against LGBTQ people, violence against LGBT people , LGBTQ rights opposition and religious opposition to LGBTQ people . In its Winter 2010 Intelligence Report the SPLC noted that for thirty years going back to Anita Bryant's Christian fundamentalists Save Our Children campaign, the first organized opposition to the gay rights movement defeating an ordinance banning discrimination in areas of housing, employment, and public accommodation based on sexual orientation , "hard-line elements of the religious right have been searching for ways to demonize gay people – or, at a minimum, to find arguments that will prevent their normalization in society." These groups utilize anti-gay myths to "form the basis of its claim that homosexuality is a social evil that must be suppressed – an opinion rejected by virtually all relevant medical and scientific authorities." The SPLC notes these anti-gay myths "almost certainly contribute to hate crime violence directed at the LGBT community, which is more targeted for such attacks than any other minority group in America." [ 18 ] Abiding Truth Ministries [ edit ] Abiding Truth Ministries is a conservative Christian organization located in Temecula, California .

[ 19 ] Their president, Scott Lively , is an American author, attorney and activist, noted for his opposition to LGBT rights and his involvement in the ex-gay movement . Lively has called for the criminalization of "the public advocacy of homosexuality" as far back as 2007.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] He is also directly linked to pending anti-gay legislation in Uganda , which would, if passed, make homosexual conduct punishable by a lengthy prison sentence or death .

[ 22 ] Along with Kevin E. Abrams, he co-authored the book The Pink Swastika , which states in the preface that "homosexuals [are] the true inventors of Nazism and the guiding force behind many Nazi atrocities." [ 23 ] In fact, under Nazi Germany, gays and lesbians were sent to concentration camps and several historians have questioned the book's claims and selective use of research.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Lively is the former state director for the California branch of the American Family Association and formed Watchmen on the Walls based in Riga , Latvia.

[ 29 ] According to a January 2011 profile, Lively "has not changed his view that gays are 'agents of America's moral decline' but has refocused his approach to fit his flock in Springfield, Massachusetts" and "is toning down his antigay rhetoric and shifting his focus to helping the downtrodden." [ 30 ] The SPLC regards Abiding Truth Ministries as a hate group.

[ 31 ] Lively has responded with his blog.

[ 32 ] Alamo Christian Foundation [ edit ] Main article: Alamo Christian Foundation The Alamo Christian Foundation was a cult founded by Tony Alamo and one of his wives, Susan Alamo in 1969 in Hollywood, California and later relocated to Dyer, Arkansas. The cult was plagued with legal troubles stemming from allegations of member abuse and tax troubles with the IRS . The cult dissolved when Tony Alamo was arrested and convicted on ten counts of child sexual abuse in 2009.

Alliance Defending Freedom [ edit ] In 2013, the SPLC described the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) as a "virulently anti-gay" organization. According to the SPLC, the ADF advocates in favor of the criminalization of homosexuality , opposes equal rights for LGBT people, including marriage equality , and makes false claims about the lives of LGBT people. In 2003, the ADF filed an unsuccessful amicus brief in Lawrence v. Texas asking the Supreme Court to uphold Texas' criminal prohibition of sodomy . It has also published documents intended for school distribution stating that "there are moral, social, and medical reasons why homosexual behavior should not be affirmed," and citing medical studies and crime statistics indicating that homosexuals frequently engage in promiscuous behavior, and have a high rate of violent crime and mental illness.

[ 33 ] Conservative columnist and professor Mike Adams criticized the SPLC for the designation because "Their reason for the characterization was simply that the ADF opposes efforts of the LGBT community to impose its agenda on those who disagree with them for religious reasons." [ 34 ] ADF has responded to some media use of SPLC's "hate group" designation against them as defamatory and a discredit to the media profession.

[ 35 ] American Family Association [ edit ] The American Family Association (AFA) is a United States non-profit organization that promotes conservative fundamentalist Christian values.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] They oppose same-sex marriage , pornography , and abortion .

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] It was founded in 1977 by Donald Wildmon as the National Federation for Decency and is headquartered in Tupelo, Mississippi .

The AFA defined itself as "a Christian organization promoting the Biblical ethic of decency in American society with primary emphasis on television and other media," later switching their stated emphasis to "moral issues that impact the family".

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] It engages in activism efforts, including buycotts , action alert emails, publications on the AFA's web sites or in the AFA Journal , broadcasts on American Family Radio , and lobbying .

[ 47 ] The organization has an annual budget of US$14 million and owns 180 American Family Radio stations in 28 states.

[ 48 ] As of November 2010 [update] , AFA has been listed as a hate group by the SPLC for the "propagation of known falsehoods" and the use of "demonizing propaganda" against LGBT people.

[ 49 ] AFA countered with the claim that the SPLC is not a reliable source.

[ 50 ] American Vision [ edit ] American Vision is a United States nonprofit organization founded in 1978 by Steve Schiffman. It operates as a Christian ministry, and calls for "equipping and empowering Christians to restore America's biblical foundation." Gary DeMar has been the organization's president since 1984. Their website promotes Christian Reconstructionism and Postmillennialism , and opposes dispensationalism .

[ citation needed ] The Southern Poverty Law Center labels American Vision an anti-gay hate group due to its support of the " death penalty for practicing homosexuals".

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Americans for Truth About Homosexuality [ edit ] Americans for Truth about Homosexuality (AFTAH) is an organization founded by Peter LaBarbera , which describes itself as "dedicated to exposing the homosexual activist agenda".

[ 54 ] In 2010, AFTAH was designated an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which said "AFTAH is notable for its posting of the utterly discredited work of Paul Cameron (of the Family Research Institute ), who has claimed that gays and lesbians live vastly shorter lives than heterosexuals".

[ 49 ] [ 55 ] Atlah Worldwide Church [ edit ] Further information: Atlah Worldwide Church Center for Family and Human Rights [ edit ] The Center for Family and Human Rights (C-Fam) is a United States –based research institute / think tank , founded in 1997, in order to monitor and affect the policy debate at the United Nations and other international institutions. It was formerly known as the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute.

[ 56 ] The 501(c)(3) organization describes its own mission as "to defend life and family at international institutions and to publicize the debate".

[ 57 ] The SPLC has characterized the institute as being "heavily focused on global anti-LGBT work", citing its opposition to United Nations efforts to protect LGBT rights and to study and prevent anti-LGBT violence, and praise of American anti-gay activist Scott Lively .

[ 58 ] Chalcedon Foundation [ edit ] The Chalcedon Foundation is an American Christian Reconstructionist organization founded by Rousas John Rushdoony . It is named after the Council of Chalcedon .

[ 59 ] The Chalcedon Foundation has been listed by the SPLC in 2012.

[ 31 ] The SPLC notes that The Institutes of Biblical Law , written by Rushdoony in 1973, called for strict biblical law that would "mean the death penalty for 'practicing homosexuals,' among many other 'abominators.

' " [ 60 ] Church Militant [ edit ] Church Militant , also known as Saint Michael's Media, was founded by ex-gay traditionalist Catholic Michael Voris , is an "Ultra-orthodox Catholic propaganda outlet" which pushes an "anti-LGBT agenda" [ 61 ] according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

[ 62 ] Hatewatch's 2018 article [ 63 ] details that: Church Militant has also advocated for so-called reparative therapy, better known as gay conversion therapy, which seeks to "cure" homosexuals of their gayness. After the Southern Poverty Law Center sued a New Jersey–based conversion therapy organization and won, the court ruling that Jews Offering New Alternatives to Healing (JONAH) must cease its operations, Church Militant decried the ruling, calling the plaintiffs guilty of dishonesty.

The group has been repudiated by the Catholic Church and has no official affiliation with them and is not an approved Catholic ministry or apostolate .

[ 64 ] Dove World Outreach Center [ edit ] Dove World Outreach Center is a 50-member non-denominational charismatic Christian church in Gainesville , Florida led by pastor Terry Jones and his wife, Sylvia. The church first gained notice during the late 2000s for its public displays and criticism of Islam and gays , and was designated as a hate group by the SPLC.

[ 49 ] In 2012, after President Obama's endorsement of gay marriage, the church hanged an Obama effigy with a rainbow flag on its lawn.

[ 65 ] In January 2013 effigies of President Obama and President Clinton were burned to protest their abortion and pro-LGBT policies.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] The Gainesville Sun reported that Terry Jones was fined by the city for the unauthorized fire.

[ 68 ] Faithful Word Baptist Church [ edit ] Faithful Word Baptist Church is a United States–based fundamentalist Baptist church in Tempe, Arizona .

[ 69 ] The church is King James Bible only [ 69 ] with regard to the Bible , and the church's members meet in an office space located in a strip mall .

[ 70 ] Steven L. Anderson established the church in December 2005 and remains its pastor. In August 2009, the church received national attention when Anderson shared that he was praying for the death of President Barack Obama in his sermons.

The SPLC has listed the church as an anti-gay hate group, [ 53 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] noting that Pastor Anderson described gays as " sodomites " who "recruit through rape ", and "recruit through molestation ".

[ 53 ] In explaining the hate group designation, the SPLC said that Anderson suggests that homosexuals should be killed, and in a sermon he stated, "The biggest hypocrite in the world is the person who believes in the death penalty for murderers but not for homosexuals." [ 53 ] [ 74 ] A few days after the listing, Pastor Anderson stated "I do hate homosexuals, and if hating homosexuals makes our church a hate group, then that's what we are." [ 71 ] Family Research Council [ edit ] The Family Research Council (FRC) is an American conservative Christian group and lobbying organization formed in the United States in 1981 by James Dobson . It was incorporated in 1983.

[ 75 ] In the late 1980s, the FRC officially became a division of Dobson's main organization, Focus on the Family , but after an administrative separation, the FRC became an independent entity in 1992.

Tony Perkins is the current president.

The FRC promotes what it considers to be traditional family values , by advocating and lobbying for socially conservative policies. It opposes and lobbies against LGBT rights , abortion , divorce , embryonic stem-cell research , and pornography . The FRC is affiliated with a 501(c) (4) lobbying PAC known as FRC Action.

[ 76 ] In May 2010, Sprigg publicly suggested that repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy would encourage molestation of heterosexual service members.

[ 77 ] In November FRC President Perkins was asked about Sprigg's comments regarding the criminalization of same-sex behavior: he responded that criminalizing homosexuality is not a goal of the Family Research Council.

[ 78 ] [ 79 ] Perkins repeated the FRC's association of gay men with pedophilia, saying that "If you look at the American College of Pediatricians, they say the research is overwhelming that homosexuality poses a danger to children." [ 78 ] [ 79 ] The American College of Pediatricians is an advocacy group, not a medical association.

Southern Poverty Law Center first designated the FRC as a hate group in 2010.

[ 80 ] Thereafter the FRC disputed the designation, with President Tony Perkins posting a comment on FRC's website.

[ 81 ] Family Research Institute [ edit ] The Family Research Institute (FRI), originally known as the Institute for the Scientific Investigation of Sexuality (ISIS), is an American non-profit organization based in Colorado Springs, Colorado , which states that it has "...one overriding mission: to generate empirical research on issues that threaten the traditional family, particularly homosexuality, AIDS , sexual social policy, and drug abuse ".

[ 82 ] The FRI is part of a movement of small, often faith-based organizations (sometimes called the Christian right ) which seek to influence the political debate in the United States. They seek "...to restore a world where marriage is upheld and honored, where children are nurtured and protected, and where homosexuality is not taught and accepted, but instead is discouraged and rejected at every level." [ 82 ] The Boston Globe reported that the FRI's 2005 budget was less than $ 200,000.

[ 83 ] The FRI is run by Paul Cameron , who earned a doctorate in psychology at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1966. Cameron founded the Institute for the Scientific Investigation of Sexuality in 1982, and this institute later became the FRI.

The group bases its work around its belief which is expressed in its best known slogan and the address of its primary Web site, God Hates Fags, which asserts that every tragedy in the world is linked to homosexuality – specifically society's increasing tolerance and acceptance of the so-called homosexual agenda . The group believes that God hates gays above all other kinds of "sinners" [ 150 ] and it also believes that homosexuality should be a capital crime .

[ 151 ] Its views on homosexuality are partially based on teachings which are found in the Old Testament , specifically in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, which they interpret to mean that homosexual behavior is detestable.

The ADL describes the Westboro Baptist Church as being "virulently homophobic ", but according to the ADL, its anti-homosexual rhetoric is often a cover for antisemitism , anti-Americanism , racism , and anti-Catholicism .

[ 152 ] The SPLC added the Westboro Baptist Church to its list of hate groups in 2010.

[ 153 ] [ 154 ] [ 155 ] World Congress of Families [ edit ] World Congress of Families is a United States organization that promotes Christian right values internationally.

[ 156 ] It opposes same-sex marriage , pornography , and abortion , while supporting a society built on "the voluntary union of a man and a woman in a lifelong covenant of marriage".

[ 157 ] [ 158 ] [ 159 ] [ 160 ] WCF comprises organizations in several countries, and most of its member partners are strongly active campaigners for pro-life positions and specific Christian views on marriage that oppose same-sex marriage.

[ 161 ] [ unreliable source?

] WCF was formed in 1997 and is active worldwide, regularly organizing "large international 'pro-family' conventions".

[ 162 ] Its opposition to gay marriage and abortion has attracted criticism.

[ 163 ] It was added to the list of anti-LGBT hate groups in February 2014 for its involvement with the 2013 Russian LGBT propaganda law and opposing LGBT rights internationally.

[ 164 ] [ 165 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ] You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International [ edit ] You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International (YCRBYCHI) was a United States–based organization which identified itself as a Christian youth ministry that held assemblies, including music concerts and discussions with students, in public schools . Founded by Bradlee Dean, the organization was based in Annandale, Minnesota . YCRBYCHI's mission statement was: "To reshape America by re-directing the current and future generations both morally and spiritually through education, media, and the Judeo-Christian values found in our U.S. Constitution." [ 168 ] The organization garnered letters of support from school personnel, as well as some religious and political figures. It also drew controversy for using assemblies for religious purposes, misleading school administrators about the nature of the program, and proselytizing its views on abortion and homosexuality .

[ 169 ] [ 170 ] [ 171 ] The SPLC designated the organization as an anti-gay hate group in March 2012.

[ 172 ] In addition to "rhetoric about executing gays and lesbians", You Can Run But You Cannot Hide's president and CEO, Bradlee Dean, has stated that homosexuals "on average, they molest 117 people before they're found out. How many kids have been destroyed, how many adults have been destroyed because of crimes against nature?" [ 173 ] In response to media coverage, Dean has written an editorial alleging that his statements were taken out of context, and produced a video [ 174 ] which sought to rebut the media's reporting on his statements. The SPLC linked Dean, among other anti-gay hate group leaders, to nativist movements that made an increase in numbers on their hate groups list.

In the case of groups the center considers anti-gay ... the center says listings are based on 'propagation of known falsehoods – claims about LGBTQ people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities – and repeated, groundless name-calling.

We do, however, feel it is important to point out when claims being made are demonstrably false, and when disparaging, emotion-provoking stereotypes are used in place of facts and logic.
