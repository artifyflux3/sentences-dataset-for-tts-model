The University of Wisconsin Press ) The 11-limit tonality diamond , part of the basis for Partch's music theory Part of the keyboard of the Chromelodeon Genesis of a Music is a book first published in 1949 by microtonal composer Harry Partch (1901–1974).

Partch first presents a polemic against both equal temperament and the long history of stagnation in the teaching of music ; according to Alex Ross , this is "the most startling forty-five-page history of music ever written". In particular, Partch holds Johann Sebastian Bach responsible for "the movement toward equal-tempered tuning, which meant that composers could not absorb the scales of other world traditions; and the urge to make music ever more instrumental and abstract." [ 1 ] He then goes on to explain his tuning theory based on just intonation , the ensemble of musical instruments of his own invention (such as the "Surrogate Kithara, a struck-string, harplike instrument", [ 2 ] and the guitar with movable frets he used to compose Barstow [ 3 ] ), and several of his largest musical compositions .

The book has been highly influential to succeeding generations of microtonal composers, including Lou Harrison , [ 4 ] Ben Johnston , [ 5 ] and James Tenney .

[ 6 ] A revised and enlarged second edition was published just before Partch's death in 1974.

[ 7 ] Concepts [ edit ] Partch presents 4 "basic monophonic concepts": Consonance and dissonance : "The ear informs us that tones which are in small-number proportion, say in the relation of 2 to 1, are strong, clear, powerful, consonant." [ 8 ] "The smaller the number involved in the [interval] ratios , the more consonant the ratio; the larger the numbers, the more dissonant".

[ 9 ] "Dual Identity": "Every ratio of a Monophonic system is at least a dual identity." [ 8 ] " Odentity [is] determined by the odd-number ratio component of the numerator, and another one, the Udentity [is] determined by the odd-number component of the denominator. A ratio thus always belongs to two tonalities, an Otonality in accordance with its Odentity , and an Utonality in accordance with its Udentity." [ 9 ] Minor : "Under-number Tonality, or Utonality ("minor"), is the immutable faculty of ratios, which in turn represent an immutable faculty of the human ear." [ 8 ] See: Arithmetic progression and Undertone series History: Music has appeared to have advanced up the harmonic series throughout history.

[ 8 ] Pythagorean tuning is 3-limit, "just intonation" often refers to 5-limit tuning , while Partch uses an 11- limit tuning. Partch admirer Ben Johnston uses 31-limit or higher " extended just intonation ".
