The tables were based on a translation into Chinese of the Zij (Islamic astronomical tables), the title Huihui Lifa literally meaning "Muslim System of Calendar Astronomy".

History [ edit ] Around 1384, during the Ming Dynasty , Hongwu Emperor ordered the Chinese translation and compilation of Islamic astronomical tables , a task that was carried out by the scholars Mashayihei (مشایخی), a Muslim astronomer, and Wu Bozong , a Chinese scholar-official.

These tables came to be known as the Huihui Lifa ( Muslim System of Calendrical Astronomy ), and were published in China a number of times until the early 18th century, [ 1 ] despite the fact the Qing Dynasty had officially abandoned the tradition of Chinese-Islamic astronomy in 1659.

In the early Joseon period, the Islamic calendar served as a basis for calendar reform owing to its superior accuracy over the existing Chinese-based calendars.

[ 2 ] A Korean translation of the Huihui Lifa was studied in Korea under the Joseon Dynasty during the time of Sejong in the 15th century.
