Find sources: "Dystopia" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( February 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Life in Kowloon Walled City in British Hong Kong has often inspired the dystopian identity in modern media works.

[ 1 ] A dystopia (lit. "bad place") is an imagined world or society in which people lead wretched, dehumanized, fearful lives.

[ 2 ] It is an imagined place (possibly state ) in which everything is unpleasant or bad, typically a totalitarian or environmentally degraded one. Dystopia is widely seen as the opposite of utopia – a concept coined by Thomas More in 1516 to describe an ideal society.

[ 3 ] Both topias are common topics in fiction . Dystopia is also referred to as cacotopia [ 4 ] or anti-utopia.

[ citation needed ] Dystopias are often characterized by fear or distress, [ 5 ] tyrannical governments, environmental disaster , [ 6 ] or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Themes typical of a dystopian society include: complete control over the people in a society through the use of propaganda and police state tactics, heavy censorship of information or denial of free thought, worship of an unattainable goal, the complete loss of individuality, and heavy enforcement of conformity.

[ 7 ] Despite certain overlaps, dystopian fiction is distinct from post-apocalyptic fiction, and an undesirable society is not necessarily dystopian. Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to society, environment , politics, economics, religion,  psychology, ethics, science, or technology. Some authors use the term to refer to existing societies, many of which are, or have been, totalitarian states or societies in an advanced state of collapse. Dystopias, through an exaggerated worst-case scenario, often present a criticism of a current trend, societal norm, or political system.

[ 8 ] Etymology [ edit ] "Dustopia",  the  original  spelling  of  "dystopia",  first  appeared  in  Lewis  Henry  Younge's Utopia:  or  Apollo's  Golden  Days in  1747.

[ 9 ] Additionally, dystopia was  used  as  an  antonym  for utopia by John  Stuart  Mill in  one  of  his  1868  Parliamentary  speeches  ( Hansard Commons )  by  adding  the  prefix  "dys"  ( Ancient Greek : δυσ- "bad")  to  "topia" ( Ancient Greek : τόπος , lit.

'place'),  reinterpreting  the  initial  "u"  as  the  prefix  "eu"  ( Ancient Greek : ευ- "good")  instead  of  "ou"  ( Ancient Greek : οὐ "not").

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] It  was  used  to  denounce  the  government's  Irish  land  policy:  "It  is,  perhaps,  too  complimentary  to  call  them  Utopians,  they  ought  rather  to  be  called  dys-topians,  or  caco-topians.  What  is  commonly  called  Utopian  is  something  too  good  to  be  practicable;  but  what  they  appear  to  favour  is  too  bad  to  be  practicable." [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Decades  before  the  first  documented  use  of  the  word  "dystopia"  was  "cacotopia"/"kakotopia"  (using Ancient Greek : κακόs ,  "bad,  wicked")  originally  proposed  in  1818  by Jeremy  Bentham : "As  a  match  for  utopia  (or  the  imagined  seat  of  the  best  government)  suppose  a  cacotopia  (or  the  imagined  seat  of  the  worst  government)  discovered  and  described." [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Though  dystopia  became  the  more  popular  term,  cacotopia  finds  occasional  use; Anthony  Burgess ,  author  of A  Clockwork  Orange (1962),  said  it  was  a  better  fit  for  Orwell's Nineteen  Eighty-Four because  "it  sounds  worse  than  dystopia".

[ 18 ] Theory [ edit ] Some  scholars,  such  as Gregory  Claeys and Lyman  Tower  Sargent ,  make  certain  distinctions  between  typical  synonyms  of  dystopias.  For  example,  Claeys  and  Sargent  define literary  dystopias as  societies  imagined  as  substantially  worse  than  the  society  in  which  the  author  writes.  Some  of  these  are anti-utopias ,  which  criticize  attempts  to  implement  various  concepts  of  utopia.

[ 19 ] In  the  most  comprehensive  treatment  of  the  literary  and  real  expressions  of  the  concept, Dystopia:  A  Natural  History ,  Claeys  offers  a  historical  approach  to  these  definitions.

[ 20 ] Here,  the  tradition  is  traced  from  early  reactions  to  the French  Revolution .  Its  commonly anti-collectivist character  is  stressed,  and  the  addition  of  other  themes—the  dangers  of  science  and  technology,  of  social  inequality,  of  corporate  dictatorship,  of  nuclear  war—are  also  traced.  A  psychological  approach  is  also  favored  here,  with  the  principle  of  fear  being  identified  with  despotic  forms  of  rule,  carried  forward  from  the  history  of  political  thought,  and  group  psychology  introduced  as  a  means  of  understanding  the  relationship  between  utopia  and  dystopia.  Andrew  Norton-Schwartzbard  noted  that  "written  many  centuries  before  the  concept  "dystopia"  existed, Dante 's Inferno in  fact  includes  most  of  the  typical  characteristics  associated  with  this  genre – even  if  placed  in  a  religious  framework  rather  than  in  the  future  of  the  mundane  world,  as  modern  dystopias  tend  to  be.

[ 21 ] In  the  same  vein,  Vicente  Angeloti  remarked  that  " George  Orwell 's  emblematic  phrase, a  boot  stamping  on  a  human  face  –  forever ,  would  aptly  describe  the  situation  of  the  denizens  in  Dante's  Hell.  Conversely,  Dante's  famous  inscription Abandon  all  hope,  ye  who  enter  here would  have  been  equally  appropriate  if  placed  at  the  entrance  to  Orwell's  " Ministry  of  Love "  and  its  notorious  " Room  101 ." [ 22 ] Society [ edit ] See also: Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction § In society People  Leaving  the  Cities ,  photo  art  by Zbigniew  Libera ,  which  imagines  a  dystopian  future  in  which  people  have  to  leave  dying metropolises Dystopias  typically  reflect  contemporary sociopolitical realities  and  extrapolate  worst-case  scenarios  as  warnings  for  necessary  social  change  or  caution.

[ 23 ] Dystopian  fictions  invariably  reflect  the  concerns  and  fears  of  their  creators'  contemporaneous  culture.

[ 24 ] Due  to  this,  they  can  be  considered  a  subject  of social  studies .

[ 25 ] In  dystopias,  citizens  may  live  in  a  dehumanized  state,  be  under  constant  surveillance,  or  have  a  fear  of  the  outside  world.

[ 26 ] In  the  film What  Happened  to  Monday the  protagonists  (identical  septuplet  sisters)  risk  their  lives  by  taking  turns  onto  the  outside  world  because  of  a one-child  policy in place  in  this  futuristic  dystopian  society.

[ 27 ] In  a  1967  study, Frank  Kermode suggests  that  the  failure  of  religious  prophecies  led  to  a  shift  in  how  society  apprehends  this  ancient  mode.  Christopher  Schmidt  notes  that,  while  the  world  goes  to  waste  for  future  generations,  people  distract  themselves  from  disaster  by  passively  watching  it  as  entertainment.

[ 28 ] In  the  2010s,  there  was  a  surge  of  popular  dystopian young  adult  literature and  blockbuster  films.

[ 29 ] [ 28 ] Some  have  commented  on  this  trend,  saying  that  "it  is  easier  to  imagine  the  end  of  the  world  than  it  is  to  imagine  the end  of  capitalism ".

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Cultural  theorist  and  critic Mark  Fisher identified  the  phrase  as  encompassing  the  theory  of capitalist  realism —the  perceived  "widespread  sense  that  not  only  is  capitalism  the  only  viable  political  and  economic  system,  but  also  that  it  is  now  impossible  even  to  imagine  a  coherent  alternative  to  it"—and  used  the  above  quote  as  the  title  to  the  opening  chapter  of  his  book, Capitalist  Realism:  Is  There  No  Alternative?

.  In  the  book,  he  also  refers  to  dystopian  film  such  as Children  of  Men (originally  a novel by P.  D.  James )  to  illustrate  what  he  describes  as  the  "slow  cancellation  of  the  future".

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] Theo  James ,  an  actor  in Divergent (originally  a novel by Veronica  Roth ),  explains  that  "young  people  in  particular  have  such  a  fascination  with  this  kind  of  story  [...]  It's  becoming  part  of  the  consciousness.  You  grow  up  in  a  world  where  it's  part  of  the  conversation  all  the  time–the  statistics  of our  planet  warming  up .  The  environment  is  changing.  The  weather  is  different.  These  are  things  that  are  very  visceral  and  very  obvious,  and  they  make  you  question  the  future,  and  how  we  will  survive.  It's  so  much  a  part  of  everyday  life  that  young  people  inevitably  –  consciously  or  not  –  are  questioning  their  futures  and  how  the  Earth  will  be.  I  certainly  do.  I  wonder  what  kind  of  world  my  children's  kids  will  live  in." [ 29 ] The substantial sub-genre of alternative  history works  depicting  a  world  in  which Nazi  Germany  won  the  Second  World  War can  be  considered  as  dystopias.  So  can  other  works  of  Alternative  History,  in  which  a  historical  turning  point  led  to  a  manifestly  repressive  world.  For  example,  the  2004 mockumentary C.S.A.:  The  Confederate  States  of  America , and Ben  Winters ' Underground  Airlines ,  in  which slavery  in  the  United  States continues  to  the  present,  with  "electronic  slave  auctions"  carried  out  via  the  Internet  and  slaves  controlled  by  electronic  devices  implanted  in  their  spines;  or Keith  Roberts ' Pavane in  which  20th-Century  Britain  is  ruled  by  a  Catholic  theocracy  and  the Inquisition is  actively  torturing  and  burning  "heretics".

Find sources: "Dystopia" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( February 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Politics [ edit ] In When  the  Sleeper  Wakes , H.  G.  Wells depicted  the  governing  class  as hedonistic and  shallow.

[ 38 ] George  Orwell contrasted  Wells's  world  to  that  depicted  in  Jack  London's The  Iron  Heel ,  where  the  dystopian  rulers  are  brutal  and  dedicated  to  the  point  of  fanaticism,  which  Orwell  considered  more  plausible.

[ 39 ] The  political  principles  at  the  root  of  fictional  utopias  (or  "perfect  worlds")  are idealistic in  principle  and  result  in  positive  consequences  for  the  inhabitants;  the  political  principles  on  which  fictional  dystopias  are  based,  while  often  based  on  utopian  ideals,  result  in  negative  consequences  for  inhabitants  because  of  at  least  one fatal  flaw .

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] Dystopias  are  often  filled  with pessimistic views  of  the  ruling  class  or a government that is brutal or uncaring and rules with an 'iron fist'.

[ 42 ] Dystopian  governments  are  sometimes  ruled  by  a fascist regime  or  dictators.  These  dystopian  government  establishments  often  have  protagonists  or  groups  that  lead  a  " resistance "  to  enact  change  within  their  society,  as seen  in Alan  Moore 's V  for  Vendetta .

[ 43 ] Dystopian  political  situations  are  depicted  in  novels  such  as We , Parable  of  the  Sower , Darkness  at  Noon , Nineteen  Eighty-Four , Brave  New  World , The  Handmaid's  Tale , The  Hunger  Games , Divergent , Fahrenheit  451 , and  such  films  as Metropolis , Brazil (1985), Battle  Royale , FAQ:  Frequently  Asked  Questions , Soylent  Green , The  Purge:  Election  Year , Logan's  Run , The  Running  Man (1987),  and Hemet,  or  the  Landlady  Don't  Drink  Tea .

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] An  earlier  example  is Jules  Verne 's The  Begum's  Millions with  its  depiction  of  Stahlstadt  (Steel  City),  a  vast  industrial  and  mining  complex,  which  is  totally  devoted  to  the  production  of  ever  more  powerful  and  destructive  weapons,  and  which  is  ruled  by  the  dictatorial  and  totally  ruthless  Prof.  Schultze  –  a militarist and racist who  dreams  of  world  conquest  and  as  the  first  step  plots  the  complete  destruction  of  the  nearby  Ville-France,  a  utopian  model  city  constructed  and  maintained  with  public  health  as  its  government's  primary  concern.

Economics [ edit ] The  economic  structures  of  dystopian  societies  in  literature  and  other  media  have  many  variations,  as  the  economy  often directly  relates  to  the  elements depicted by the writer as  the  source  of  the  oppression.  There  are  several archetypes that these  societies  tend  to  follow.  One theme  is  the  dichotomy  of planned  economies versus free  market economies,  a  conflict  which  is  found  in  such  works  as Ayn  Rand 's Anthem and Henry  Kuttner 's  short  story  "The  Iron  Standard".  Another  example is Norman  Jewison 's  1975  film Rollerball .

[ 46 ] Some  dystopias,  such  as  that  of Nineteen  Eighty-Four ,  feature black  markets with  goods  that  are  dangerous  and  difficult  to  obtain  or  the  characters  may  be  at  the  mercy  of  the  state-controlled  economy.

Kurt  Vonnegut 's Player  Piano depicts  a  dystopia  in  which  the  centrally  controlled  economic  system  has  indeed  made  material  abundance  plentiful,  but  deprived  the  mass  of  humanity  of  meaningful  labor;  virtually all  work  is  menial and unsatisfying, with only a small number of the group that achieves education being admitted to the elite and its work.

[ 47 ] In Tanith  Lee 's Don't  Bite  the  Sun ,  there  is  no  want  of  any  kind  –  only  unabashed  consumption  and  hedonism,  leading  the  protagonist  to  begin  looking  for  a  deeper  meaning  to  existence.

[ 48 ] Even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society's flaws, as in Brave New World , the state often controls the economy. A character, reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body, cites as a reason that it works for everyone else.

[ 49 ] Other  works  feature  extensive privatization and corporatism - both  consequences  of capitalism - where  privately  owned, unaccountable  large  corporations  have  replaced  the  government  in  setting  policy  and  making  decisions. They manipulate, infiltrate, control, bribe, are contracted by, and function as the government. This  is  seen  in  the  novels Jennifer  Government and Oryx  and  Crake and  the  movies Alien , Avatar , RoboCop , Visioneers , Idiocracy , Soylent  Green , WALL-E and Rollerball .  Corporate  republics  are  common  in  the cyberpunk genre,  as  seen in Neal  Stephenson 's Snow  Crash and Philip  K.  Dick 's Do  Androids  Dream  of  Electric  Sheep?

(as  well  as  the  film Blade  Runner ,  influenced  by  and  based  upon  Dick's  novel).

Class [ edit ] Dystopian  fiction  frequently  draws  stark  contrasts  between  the  privileges  of  the  ruling  class  and  the  dreary  existence  of  the  working  class. In Aldous  Huxley 's 1931 novel Brave New World, a class system is prenatally determined, with Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons. The lower classes have reduced brain function and are specially conditioned to be satisfied with their position in life.

[ 50 ] Outside of this society, several human settlements exist in the conventional way, but the World Government describes them as 'savages.' [ citation needed ] In George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four , the dystopian society features a tiered class structure: the ruling elite, the ' Inner Party ,' at the top; the ' Outer Party ' below them, functioning as a type of middle class with minor privileges; and the working-class proletariat at the bottom of the hierarchy, with few rights, yet making up the vast majority of the population.

[ 51 ] In the film Elysium , the majority of Earth's surface population lives in poverty, with little access to health care, and is subjected to worker exploitation and police brutality . Meanwhile, the wealthy live above Earth in luxury, with access to technologies that cure all diseases, reverse aging, and regenerate body parts.

[ citation needed ] Written  a  century  earlier,  the  future  society  depicted  in H.  G.  Wells ' The  Time  Machine had  started  in  a  similar  way  to Elysium –  with  workers  consigned  to  living  and  working  in  underground  tunnels while the wealthy live on a surface transformed into a beautiful garden. However, over a long period, the roles were eventually reversed—the rich degenerated and became decadent 'livestock,' regularly caught and eaten by the underground cannibal Morlocks.

[ citation needed ] Family [ edit ] Some  fictional  dystopias,  such  as Brave  New  World and Fahrenheit  451 ,  have  eradicated  the  family  and  prevented  it  from  re-establishing  itself  as  a  social  institution.  In Brave  New  World ,  where  children  are  artificially reproduced,  the  concepts  of  "mother"  and  "father"  are  considered obscene .  In some novels, such as We , the state is hostile to motherhood, as a pregnant woman from One State rebels.

[ 52 ] Religion [ edit ] In  dystopias,  religious  groups  may  play  the  role  of  oppressed  or  oppressor.  One  of  the  earliest  examples  is Robert  Hugh  Benson 's Lord  of  the  World ,  about  a  futuristic  world  where Marxists and Freemasons led  by  the Antichrist have  taken  over  the  world  and  the  only  remaining  source  of  dissent  is  a  tiny  and  persecuted Catholic minority.

[ 53 ] In Brave New World , the establishment of the state involved lopping off the tops of all crosses (symbols of Christianity) to make them 'T's (symbols of Henry  Ford's  Model  T ).

[ 54 ] In C. S. Lewis 's That Hideous Strength , the leaders of the fictional National Institute of Coordinated Experiments—an academic and governmental joint venture promoting an anti-traditionalist social agenda—are contemptuous of religion and require initiates to desecrate Christian symbols.

Margaret  Atwood 's  novel The  Handmaid's  Tale is set in  a  future  United  States  under  a  Christian-based  theocratic  regime.

[ 55 ] Identity [ edit ] In  the  Russian  novel We by Yevgeny  Zamyatin ,  first  published  in  1921, people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are referred to only by numbers instead of names.

[ 56 ] The  latter  feature  also  appears  in  the  film THX  1138 . In some dystopian works, such as Kurt  Vonnegut 's Harrison  Bergeron , society forces individuals to conform to radical egalitarian social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment, even competence, as forms of inequality.

[ citation needed ] Complete  conformity  and  suppression  of  individuality  (to  the  point  of  acting  in  unison) are  also  depicted  in Madeleine  L'Engle 's A  Wrinkle  in  Time .

Violence [ edit ] Violence is prevalent in many dystopias, often in the form of war, but also in urban crimes led by (predominantly teenage) gangs (e.g., A Clockwork Orange ), or rampant crime met with blood  sports (e.g.

Battle  Royale , The  Running  Man , The  Hunger  Games , Divergent ,  and The  Purge ). It  is  also  explained  in Suzanne  Berne 's  essay  "Ground  Zero",  where  she  explains  her  experience  of  the  aftermath  of  11  September  2001.

[ 57 ] Nature [ edit ] Fictional  dystopias  are  commonly  urban  and  frequently  isolate  their  characters  from  all  contact  with  the  natural  world.

[ 58 ] Sometimes  they  require  their  characters  to  avoid  nature,  as  when walks are  regarded  as  dangerously anti-social in  Ray  Bradbury's Fahrenheit  451 ,  as  well  as  in his  short  story  " The  Pedestrian ".

[ citation needed ] In That  Hideous  Strength ,  science  coordinated  by  the government  is  directed  toward  the  control  of  nature  and  the  elimination  of  natural  human  instincts.    In Brave  New  World ,  the  lower  class  is  conditioned  to  be  afraid  of  nature  but encouraged to visit  the  countryside  and  consume  transport  and  games  to  promote  economic  activity.

[ 59 ] Lois  Lowry's  " The  Giver "  shows  a  society  where  technology  and  the  desire  to  create  a  utopia  have  led  humanity  to  enforce  climate  control  on  the  environment,  as  well  as  to  eliminate  many  undomesticated  species  and  to  provide  psychological  and  pharmaceutical  repellent  against  human  instincts.

E.  M.  Forster 's  " The  Machine  Stops "  depicts  a  dramatically altered  global  environment  which  forces  people  to  live  underground  due  to  an  atmospheric  contamination.

[ 60 ] As  Angel  Galdon-Rodriguez  points  out,  this  kind of isolation  caused  by  external  toxic  hazard  is  later  used  by  Hugh  Howey  in  his  series  of  dystopias  of  the Silo  Series .

[ 61 ] Excessive  pollution  that  destroys  nature  is  common  in  many  dystopian  films,  such  as The  Matrix , RoboCop , WALL-E , April  and  the  Extraordinary  World and Soylent  Green ,  as  well  as  in  video games  like Cyberpunk 2077 and Half-Life  2 .  A  few  "green"  fictional  dystopias  do  exist,  such  as  in Michael  Carson 's  short  story  " The  Punishment  of  Luxury "  and Russell  Hoban 's Riddley  Walker .  The  latter  is  set  in  the  aftermath  of  nuclear  war,  "a post-nuclear  holocaust Kent,  where  technology  has been  reduced  to  the  level  of  the Iron  Age ".

[ 62 ] [ citation needed ] Science  and  technology [ edit ] Contrary  to  the technologically  utopian claims,  which  view  technology  as  a  beneficial  addition  to  all  aspects  of  humanity,  technological  dystopia  concerns  itself  with  and  focuses  largely  (but  not  always)  on  the  negative  effects  caused  by  new  technology.

[ 63 ] Technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature.

[ 63 ] Jaron  Lanier ,  a  digital  pioneer,  has  become  a  technological  dystopian:  "I  think  it's  a  way  of  interpreting  technology  in  which  people  forgot to  taking  responsibility." [ citation needed ] "'Oh,  it's  the  computer  that  did  it,  not  me.'  'There's  no  more  middle  class?  Oh,  it's  not  me.  The  computer  did  it.'"  This  quote  explains  that  people  begin  to  not  only  blame  the  technology  for  the  changes  in  lifestyle  but  also  believe  that  technology  is  all powerful.  It  also  points  to  a  technological  deterministic  perspective  in  terms  of  reification.

[ 64 ] Technologies harm our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.

[ 65 ] Communication among family members and friends has decreased due to increased time spent using technology. Virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence; people resort to technological media for communication.

Technologies reinforce hierarchies: concentrate knowledge and skills; increase surveillance, and erode privacy, widen inequalities of power and wealth, and lead to surrendering control to machines.

Douglas Rushkoff , a technological utopian, states in his article that the professional designers "re-mystified" the computer, making it harder to understand. Users had to depend on built-in programs that were incomprehensible to ordinary users.

[ 63 ] More efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life (by causing stress, destroying jobs, and increasing materialism).

[ 66 ] In his article "Prest-o! Change-o!", technological dystopian James Gleick describes the remote control as a classic example of technology that fails to solve the problem it was designed to fix. Gleick quotes historian Edward Tenner, who argues that the remote control's ease of use increases distraction for viewers. As a result, people become more dissatisfied with what they are watching.

[ 66 ] Technologies destroy nature, harming human health and the environment. Business priorities replaced community, and the "story online" replaced real people as the "soul of the Net".

Oxford English Dictionary (Online ed.).

Oxford University Press .

(Subscription or participating institution membership required.) According to the Oxford English Dictionary , a "dystopia" is: "An imaginary place or condition in which everything is as bad as possible; opp. UTOPIA (cf. CACOTOPIA). So dystopian n., one who advocates or describes a dystopia; dystopian a., of or pertaining to a dystopia; dystopianism, dystopian quality or characteristics." The example of first usage given in the OED (1989 ed.) refers to the 1868 speech by John Stuart Mill quoted above. Other examples given in the OED include: 1952 Negley & Patrick Quest for Utopia xvii. 298 The Mundus Alter et Idem [of Joseph Hall] is...the opposite of eutopia, the ideal society: it is a dystopia, if it is permissible to coin a word. 1962 C. WALSH From Utopia to Nightmare 11 The 'dystopia' or 'inverted utopia'. Ibid. 12 Stories...that seemed in their dystopian way to be saying something important. Ibid. ii. 27 A strand of utopianism or dystopianism. 1967 Listener 5 Jan. 22 The modern classics Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four are dystopias. They describe not a world we should like to live in, but one we must be sure to avoid. 1968 New Scientist 11 July 96/3 It is a pleasant change to read some hope for our future is trevor ingram ... I fear that our real future is more likely to be dystopian.
