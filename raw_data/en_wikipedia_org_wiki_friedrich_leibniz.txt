Biography [ edit ] Leibniz was born in Altenberg, Saxony , the son of Ambrosious Leibniz, a civil servant, and a Leipzig noblewoman named Anna Deuerlin.

[ 3 ] He completed his master's degree at the University of Leipzig during 1622 and became an actuary in administration at the university.

[ 1 ] His first marriage in 1625 produced a son, Johann Friedrich, and a daughter, Anna Rosina. He was elected to the chair in moral philosophy at Leipzig in 1640. A childless marriage to a second wife ended with her death 1643.

[ 3 ] [ 6 ] A subsequent 1644 marriage to Catharina Schmuck, a daughter of a well known lawyer (or professor of law [ 5 ] ) produced a son, the polymath Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] During 1646 Leibniz was vice chairman of the faculty of philosophy and also was Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Leipzig, in addition to employment as actuary.

[ 3 ] He possessed a collection of books of ancient source.

[ 5 ] He died in Leipzig .

Eric John Aiton considers Friedrich Leibniz ... a competent though not original scholar, who devoted his time to his offices and to his family as a pious, Christian father.

[ 9 ] On the other hand, in an address he delivered in 1646, Friedrich equated Apollo , the Greek god of knowledge, with Lucifer the christian devil, and introduced other variants in Biblical and Greek myths, notably the view of Eve as the she- Python slaughtered by Apollo - Lucifer .

[ 10 ] Friedrich Leibniz is notable because his mathematical "descendants," which include Carl Friedrich Gauss , number more than 170,000 (largely due to his son ).
