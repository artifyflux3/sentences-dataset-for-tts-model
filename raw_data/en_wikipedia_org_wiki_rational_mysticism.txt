Lines of investigation include historical and philosophical inquiry as well as scientific inquiry within such fields as neurophysiology and psychology .

Overview [ edit ] The term "rational mysticism" was in use at least as early as 1911 when it was the subject of an article by Henry W. Clark in the Harvard Theological Review .

[ 1 ] In a 1924 book, Rational Mysticism, theosophist William Kingsland correlated rational mysticism with scientific idealism .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] South African philosopher J. N. Findlay frequently used the term, developing the theme in Ascent to the Absolute and other works in the 1960s and 1970s.

[ 4 ] Columbia University pragmatist John Herman Randall, Jr.

characterized both Plotinus and Baruch Spinoza as “rationalists with overtones of rational mysticism” in his 1970 book Hellenistic Ways of Deliverance and the Making of Christian Synthesis.

[ 5 ] Rice University professor of religious studies Jeffrey J. Kripal , in his 2001 book Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom, defined rational mysticism as “not a contradiction in terms” but “a mysticism whose limits are set by reason.” [ 6 ] In response to criticism of his book The End of Faith , author Sam Harris used the term rational mysticism for the title of his rebuttal.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] University of Pennsylvania neurotheologist Andrew Newberg has been using nuclear medicine brain imaging in similar research since the early 1990s.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Executive editor of Discover magazine Corey S. Powell, in his 2002 book, God in the Equation, attributed the term to Albert Einstein : “In creating his radical cosmology, Einstein stitched together a rational mysticism, drawing on—but distinct from—the views that came before.” [ 13 ] Science writer John Horgan interviewed and profiled James Austin , Terence McKenna , Michael Persinger , Christian Rätsch , Huston Smith , Ken Wilber , Alexander Shulgin and others for Rational Mysticism: Dispatches from the Border Between Science and Spirituality, [ 14 ] his 2003 study of “the scientific quest to explain the transcendent.” [ 15 ] See also [ edit ] Analytic philosophy Gnosis Henosis Philosophy of Baruch Spinoza Platonism Pythagoreanism Relationship between religion and science Sociology of scientific knowledge References [ edit ] ^ Clark, Henry W.

In one sense indeed, Plotinos is the most consistent " naturalist " in Greek thought; though of course he is not an empirical and functional naturalist, like Aristotle , but rather a rationalistic and structural naturalist, like Spinoza .  Spinoza, in fact, is the one philosopher among moderns with whom Plotinos can be most validly compared.  Both Plotinos and Spinoza are rationalists with overtones of rational mysticism.

The frontal lobe , the area right behind our foreheads, helps us focus our attention in prayer and meditation.  The parietal lobe , located near the backs of our skulls, is the seat of our sensory information.

Newberg says it's involved in that feeling of becoming part of something greater than oneself.  The limbic system , nestled deep in the center, regulates our emotions and is responsible for feelings of awe and joy.
