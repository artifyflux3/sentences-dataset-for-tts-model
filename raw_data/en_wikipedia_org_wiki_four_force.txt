In special relativity [ edit ] The four-force is defined as the rate of change in the four-momentum of a particle with respect to the particle's proper time . Hence,: F = d P d τ τ .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\mathrm {d} \mathbf {P}  \over \mathrm {d} \tau }.} For a particle of constant invariant mass m > 0 {\displaystyle m>0} , the four-momentum is given by the relation P = m U {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =m\mathbf {U} } , where U = γ γ ( c , u ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} =\gamma (c,\mathbf {u} )} is the four-velocity . In analogy to Newton's second law ,  we can also relate the four-force to the four-acceleration , A {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} } , by equation: F = m A = ( γ γ f ⋅ ⋅ u c , γ γ f ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {A} =\left(\gamma {\mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u}  \over c},\gamma {\mathbf {f} }\right).} Here f = d d t ( γ γ m u ) = d p d t {\displaystyle {\mathbf {f} }={\mathrm {d}  \over \mathrm {d} t}\left(\gamma m{\mathbf {u} }\right)={\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p}  \over \mathrm {d} t}} and f ⋅ ⋅ u = d d t ( γ γ m c 2 ) = d E d t .

{\displaystyle {\mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u} }={\mathrm {d}  \over \mathrm {d} t}\left(\gamma mc^{2}\right)={\mathrm {d} E \over \mathrm {d} t}.} where u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } , p {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} } and f {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} } are 3-space vectors describing the velocity, the momentum of the particle and the force acting on it respectively; and E {\displaystyle E} is the total energy of the particle.

Including thermodynamic interactions [ edit ] From the formulae of the previous section it appears that the time component of the four-force is the power expended, f ⋅ ⋅ u {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u} } , apart from relativistic corrections γ γ / c {\displaystyle \gamma /c} . This is only true in purely mechanical situations, when heat exchanges vanish or can be neglected.

In the full thermo-mechanical case, not only work , but also heat contributes to the change in energy, which is the time component of the energy–momentum covector . The time component of the four-force includes in this case a heating rate h {\displaystyle h} , besides the power f ⋅ ⋅ u {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u} } .

[ 1 ] Note that work and heat cannot be meaningfully separated, though, as they both carry inertia.

[ 2 ] This fact extends also to contact forces, that is, to the stress–energy–momentum tensor .

[ 3 ] [ 2 ] Therefore, in thermo-mechanical situations the time component of the four-force is not proportional to the power f ⋅ ⋅ u {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u} } but has a more generic expression, to be given case by case, which represents the supply of internal energy from the combination of work and heat, [ 2 ] [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 3 ] and which in the Newtonian limit becomes h + f ⋅ ⋅ u {\displaystyle h+\mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u} } .

In general relativity [ edit ] In general relativity the relation between four-force, and four-acceleration remains the same, but the elements of the four-force are related to the elements of the four-momentum through a covariant derivative with respect to proper time.

F λ λ := D P λ λ d τ τ = d P λ λ d τ τ + Γ Γ λ λ μ μ ν ν U μ μ P ν ν {\displaystyle F^{\lambda }:={\frac {DP^{\lambda }}{d\tau }}={\frac {dP^{\lambda }}{d\tau }}+\Gamma ^{\lambda }{}_{\mu \nu }U^{\mu }P^{\nu }} In addition, we can formulate force using the concept of coordinate transformations between different coordinate systems. Assume that we know the correct expression for force in a coordinate system at which the particle is momentarily at rest. Then we can perform a transformation to another system to get the corresponding expression of force.

[ 5 ] In special relativity the transformation will be a Lorentz transformation between coordinate systems moving with a relative constant velocity whereas in general relativity it will be a general coordinate transformation.

Consider the four-force F μ μ = ( F 0 , F ) {\displaystyle F^{\mu }=(F^{0},\mathbf {F} )} acting on a particle of mass m {\displaystyle m} which is momentarily at rest in a coordinate system. The relativistic force f μ μ {\displaystyle f^{\mu }} in another coordinate system moving with constant velocity v {\displaystyle v} , relative to the other one, is obtained using a Lorentz transformation: f = F + ( γ γ − − 1 ) v v ⋅ ⋅ F v 2 , f 0 = γ γ β β ⋅ ⋅ F = β β ⋅ ⋅ f .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {f} &=\mathbf {F} +(\gamma -1)\mathbf {v} {\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {F}  \over v^{2}},\\f^{0}&=\gamma {\boldsymbol {\beta }}\cdot \mathbf {F} ={\boldsymbol {\beta }}\cdot \mathbf {f} .\end{aligned}}} where β β = v / c {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\beta }}=\mathbf {v} /c} .

In general relativity , the expression for force becomes f μ μ = m D U μ μ d τ τ {\displaystyle f^{\mu }=m{DU^{\mu } \over d\tau }} with covariant derivative D / d τ τ {\displaystyle D/d\tau } . The equation of motion becomes m d 2 x μ μ d τ τ 2 = f μ μ − − m Γ Γ ν ν λ λ μ μ d x ν ν d τ τ d x λ λ d τ τ , {\displaystyle m{d^{2}x^{\mu } \over d\tau ^{2}}=f^{\mu }-m\Gamma _{\nu \lambda }^{\mu }{dx^{\nu } \over d\tau }{dx^{\lambda } \over d\tau },} where Γ Γ ν ν λ λ μ μ {\displaystyle \Gamma _{\nu \lambda }^{\mu }} is the Christoffel symbol . If there is no external force, this becomes the equation for geodesics in the curved space-time . The second term in the above equation, plays the role of a gravitational force. If f f α α {\displaystyle f_{f}^{\alpha }} is the correct expression for force in a freely falling frame ξ ξ α α {\displaystyle \xi ^{\alpha }} , we can use then the equivalence principle to write the four-force in an arbitrary coordinate x μ μ {\displaystyle x^{\mu }} : f μ μ = ∂ ∂ x μ μ ∂ ∂ ξ ξ α α f f α α .

{\displaystyle f^{\mu }={\partial x^{\mu } \over \partial \xi ^{\alpha }}f_{f}^{\alpha }.} Examples [ edit ] In special relativity, Lorentz four-force (four-force acting on a charged particle situated in an electromagnetic field) can be expressed as: f μ μ = q F μ μ ν ν U ν ν , {\displaystyle f_{\mu }=qF_{\mu \nu }U^{\nu },} where F μ μ ν ν {\displaystyle F_{\mu \nu }} is the electromagnetic tensor , U ν ν {\displaystyle U^{\nu }} is the four-velocity , and q {\displaystyle q} is the electric charge .
