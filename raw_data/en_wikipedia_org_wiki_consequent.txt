A consequent is the second half of a hypothetical proposition .  In the standard form of such a proposition, it is the part that follows "then". In an implication , if P implies Q , then P is called the antecedent and Q is called the consequent .

[ 1 ] In some contexts, the consequent is called the apodosis .

[ 2 ] Examples: If P {\displaystyle P} , then Q {\displaystyle Q} .

Q {\displaystyle Q} is the consequent of this hypothetical proposition.

If X {\displaystyle X} is a mammal, then X {\displaystyle X} is an animal.

Here, " X {\displaystyle X} is an animal" is the consequent.

If computers can think, then they are alive.

"They are alive" is the consequent.

The consequent in a hypothetical proposition is not necessarily a consequence of the antecedent.

If monkeys are purple, then fish speak Klingon.

"Fish speak Klingon" is the consequent here, but intuitively is not a consequence of (nor does it have anything to do with) the claim made in the antecedent that "monkeys are purple".
