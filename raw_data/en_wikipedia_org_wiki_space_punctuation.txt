In [writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing "Writing"), a **space** () is a blank area that [separates words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_divider "Word divider"), [sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing "Sentence spacing"), and other written or printed [glyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph") (characters). Conventions for spacing vary among languages, and in some languages the spacing rules are complex.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Inter-word spaces ease the reader's task of identifying words, and avoid outright ambiguities such as "now here" vs. "nowhere". They also provide convenient guides for where a human or program may start new lines.

[Typesetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting "Typesetting") can use spaces of varying widths, just as it can use graphic characters of varying widths. Unlike graphic characters, typeset spaces are [commonly stretched in order to align text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment "Typographic alignment"). A [typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter"), on the other hand, typically has only one width for all characters, including spaces. Following widespread acceptance of the typewriter, some typewriter conventions influenced [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography") and the design of printed works.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") representation of text facilitates getting around mechanical and physical limitations such as character widths in at least two ways:

*   [Character encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_sets "Character sets") such as [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") provide spaces of several widths, which are encoded using distinct numeric [code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point"). For example, Unicode U+0020 is the "normal" space character, but U+00A0 adds the meaning that a new line should not be started there, while U+2003 represents a space with a fixed width of one [em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography) "Em (typography)"). Collectively, such characters are called [Whitespace characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character "Whitespace character").

*   Formatting and drawing languages and software commonly provide much more flexibility in spacing. For example, SVG, PostScript, and countless other languages enable drawing characters at specific (x,y) coordinates on a screen or page. By drawing each word at a specific starting coordinate, such programs need not "draw" spaces at all (this can lead to difficulties in extracting the correct text back out). Similarly, word processors can "fully justify" text, stretching inter-word spaces to make all lines the same length (as can mechanical [Linotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linotype_machine "Linotype machine") machines). Precision is limited by physical capabilities of output devices.

Use in natural languages

![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png)This article **needs attention from an expert in Linguistics**. The specific problem is: **At some point, this subsection contained a lot of incorrect claims about Semitic languages, and weasel-wording. It was clearly written by someone who doesn’t know any of the relevant languages. Some claims remain largely unsupported and Euro-centric. This needs attention from a historical linguist. If such an expert can’t be found, it is better to rewrite this with a focus on developments within individual writing systems – which is _not_ how it’s structured at the moment.**[WikiProject Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Linguistics "Wikipedia:WikiProject Linguistics") may be able to help recruit an expert._(August 2023)_

Modern English uses a space to separate words, but not all languages follow this practice. According to Paul Saenger in _Space Between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading,_[Ancient Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hebrew "Biblical Hebrew") and [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") did use spaces partly to compensate in clarity for the [lack of written vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad "Abjad") when no _[mater lectionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater\_lectionis "Mater lectionis")_ was used for a vowel, though in the Middle Ages they sometimes omitted spaces when vowel points were marked.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-1) The earliest Greek script also used interpuncts to divide words rather than spacing, although this practice was soon displaced by the _[scriptio continua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptio\_continua "Scriptio continua")_. In [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin"), spaces and interpuncts came often to be dropped in favor of _scriptio continua_, and were not used to separate words again until roughly AD 600–800.

Word spacing was later used by Irish and Anglo-Saxon scribes, beginning after the creation of the [Carolingian minuscule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule "Carolingian minuscule") by [Alcuin of York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York "Alcuin of York") and the scribes’ adoption of it. Spacing would become standard in [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") Italy and France, and then [Byzantium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantium "Byzantium") by the end of the 16th century; then entering into the Slavic languages in [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic "Cyrillic") in the 17th century, and only in modern times entering modern [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-2)[_[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy\_dispute#Disputed\_statement "Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Space\_(punctuation)#Dubious "Talk:Space (punctuation)")_]

[CJK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters "CJK characters") languages do not use spaces when dealing with text containing mostly [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters "Chinese characters") and [kana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana "Kana"). In [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"), spaces may occasionally be used to separate people’s [family names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_name "Family name") from [given names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name "Given name"), to denote omitted [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_particles "Japanese particles") (especially the topic particle _wa_), and for certain literary or artistic effects. Modern [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"), however, has spaces as an essential part of its writing system (because of Western influence), given the phonetic nature of the [hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul "Hangul") script that requires word dividers to avoid ambiguity, as opposed to Chinese characters which are mostly very distinguishable from each other. In Korean, spaces are used to separate chunks of nouns, nouns and [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_postpositions "Korean postpositions"), adjectives, and verbs; for certain compounds or phrases, spaces may be used or not, as in the phrase for “[Republic of Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Korea "Republic of Korea"),” usually spelled without spaces as 대한민국 rather than with a space as 대한 민국.

[Runic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic "Runic") texts use either an [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct")-like or a [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)")-like punctuation mark to separate words. There are two [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") characters dedicated for this: U+16EB᛫RUNIC SINGLE PUNCTUATION and U+16EC᛬RUNIC MULTIPLE PUNCTUATION.

Languages with a Latin-derived alphabet have used various methods of sentence spacing since the advent of movable type in the 15th century.

*   One space (some times called _[French spacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French\_spacing "French spacing")_, _q.v._). This is a common convention in most countries that use the [ISO basic Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet "ISO basic Latin alphabet") for published and final written work, as well as digital (World Wide Web) media.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-3)[Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser") usually do not differentiate between single and multiple spaces in source code when displaying text, unless the text is given a "white-space" [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets") attribute. Without this being set, [collapsing strings of spaces to a single space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_collapsing "Whitespace collapsing") allow HTML source code to be spaced in a more machine-readable way, at the expense of control over the spacing of the rendered page.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-4)
*   Double space (_[English spacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English\_spacing "English spacing")_). It is sometimes claimed that this convention stems from the use of the [monospaced font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font "Monospaced font") on [typewriters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriters "Typewriters").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-5) However, instructions to use more spacing between sentences than words date back centuries, and two spaces on a typewriter was the closest approximation to typesetters' previous rules aimed at improving readability.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-6) Wider spacing continued to be used by both typesetters and typists until the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), after which typesetters gradually transitioned to word spacing between sentences in published print, while typists continued the practice of using two spaces.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-17)
*   One widened space, typically one-and-a-third to slightly less than twice as wide as a word space. This spacing was sometimes used in typesetting before the 19th century. It has also been used in other non-typewriter typesetting systems such as the [Linotype machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linotype_machine "Linotype machine")[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-18) and the [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX "TeX") system.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-19) Modern computer-based digital fonts can adjust the spacing after terminal punctuation as well, creating a [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing#Computer_era "Sentence spacing") slightly wider than a standard word space.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-20)

There has been some [controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing#Controversy "Sentence spacing") regarding the proper amount of sentence spacing in typeset material. The _Elements of Typographic Style_ states that only a single word space is required for sentence spacing.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-21) Psychological studies suggest "readers benefit from having two spaces after periods."[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-22)

### Unit symbols and numbers

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Unit symbols and numbers")]

The [International System of Units (SI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") prescribes inserting a space between a number and a [unit of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement "Unit of measurement") (the space being regarded as an implied multiplication sign) but never between a prefix and a base unit; a space (or a [multiplication dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_dot "Multiplication dot")) should also be used between units in compound units.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-BIPM_style-23)

*   5.0 cm, _not_ 5.0cm or 5.0 c m or 5.0 cms
*   45 kg, _not_ 45kg or 45 k g or 45 kgs
*   32°C, _not_ 32°C or 32° C
*   20 kN m or 20 kN⋅m, _not_ 20 kNm or 20 k Nm
*   π/2 rad, _not_ π/2rad or π / 2 rad
*   50%, _not_ 50% or 50 percent (Note:% is not an SI unit, and many [style guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide "Style guide") do not follow this recommendation; 50% is used as adjective, e.g. to express concentration as in 50% acetic acid.)

The only exception to this rule is the traditional symbolic notation of [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle"): [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)") (e.g., 30°), [minute of arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_of_arc "Minute of arc") (e.g., 22′), and [second of arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_of_arc "Second of arc") (e.g., 8″).

The SI also prescribes the use of a space[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-24) (often typographically a [thin space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space "Thin space")) as a [thousands separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousands_separator "Thousands separator") where required. Both the point and the comma are reserved as [decimal markers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_marker "Decimal marker").

*   1 000 000 000 000 (thin space) or 1000000 _not_ 1,000,000 or 1.000.000
*   1 000 000 000 000 (regular space which is significantly wider)

Sometimes a [narrow non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space#Width_variation "Non-breaking space") or [non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space "Non-breaking space"), respectively, is recommended (as in, for example, [IEEE Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Standards "IEEE Standards")[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-25) and [IEC standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_standards "IEC standards")[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#cite_note-26)) to avoid the separation of units and values or parts of compounds units, due to automatic [line wrap and word wrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_wrap_and_word_wrap "Line wrap and word wrap").

Unicode [defines many variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character#Unicode "Whitespace character") of a single whitespace character, with various properties; the more commonly encountered variations include:

*   U+0020 SPACE
*   U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE
*   U+2002 EN SPACE
*   U+2003 EM SPACE

In [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL "URL"), spaces are [percent encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding "Percent-encoding") with its [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII")/[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 "UTF-8") representation `%20`.

*   [Figure space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_space "Figure space")
*   [Non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space "Non-breaking space")

If you are working on documents that will be printed without any intervention from a compositor (e.g., documents produced on the office laser printer), you will have to carefully scrutinize every piece of punctuation to be sure that the document contains the correct character (see table 5). You should also delete any extra wordspacing before and after punctuation marks. The conventions are: One space follows sentence-ending punctuation mark (period, question mark, or exclamation point). One space follows comma, colon, or semicolon ...

In the nineteenth century, which was a dark and inflationary age in typography and type design, many compositors were encouraged to stuff extra space between sentences. Generations of twentieth century typists were then taught to do the same, by hitting the spacebar twice after every period [full stop]. Your typing as well as your typesetting will benefit from unlearning this quaint Victorian habit. As a general rule, no more than a single space is required after a period, colon, or any other mark of punctuation

Publications in the United States today usually have the same spacing after a punctuation mark as between words on the same line. Since word processors make available the same fonts used by typesetters for printed works, many writers, influenced by the look of typeset publications, now leave only one space after a concluding punctuation mark. In addition, most publishers' guidelines for preparing electronic manuscripts ask authors to type only the spaces that are to appear in print.

Publications in the United States today usually have the same spacing after a punctuation mark as between words on the same line. Since word processors make available the same fonts used by typesetters for printed works, many writers, influenced by the look of typeset publications, now leave only one space after a concluding punctuation mark. In addition, most publishers' guidelines for preparing electronic manuscripts ask authors to type only the spaces that are to appear in print.

The view at CMOS is that there is no reason for two spaces after a period in published work. Some people, however—my colleagues included—prefer it, relegating this preference to their personal correspondence and notes. I've noticed in old American books printed in the few decades before and after the turn of the twentieth century (ca. 1870–1930 at least) that there seemed to be a trend in publishing to use extra space (sometimes quite a bit of it) after periods. And many people were taught to use that extra space in typing class (I was). But introducing two spaces after the period causes problems: (1) it is inefficient, requiring an extra keystroke for every sentence; (2) even if a program is set to automatically put an extra space after a period, such automation is never foolproof; (3) there is no proof that an extra space actually improves readability—as your comment suggests, it's probably just a matter of familiarity (Who knows? perhaps it's actually more efficient to read with less regard for sentences as individual units of thought—many centuries ago, for example in ancient Greece, there were no spaces even between words, and no punctuation); (4) two spaces are harder to control for than one in electronic documents (I find that the earmark of a document that imposes a two-space rule is a smattering of instances of both three spaces and one space after a period, and two spaces in the middle of sentences); and (5) two spaces can cause problems with line breaks in certain programs. So, in our efficient, modern world, I think there is no room for two spaces after a period. In the opinion of this particular copyeditor, this is a good thing.

In typewritten (as distinct from typeset) material, it was customary to place two spaces after a colon, semicolon, full stop or other sentence closing punctuation. Programs for word processing and desktop publishing offer more sophisticated, variable spacing, so this practice of double spacing is now avoided because it can create distracting gaps on a page.
