Infobox references Chemical compound Silylidyne is a chemical substance occurring as a molecule found in stars and probably existing in interstellar space, or as a monolayer on the surface of solid silicon . The SiH molecule is a radical , and can be made experimentally by striking an electric arc to silicon on a low pressure hydrogen gas.

[ 1 ] Surface [ edit ] As a surface layer, silicon hydrides form when the silicon is cleaned with hydrofluoric acid. These hydrides decompose to SiH when heated to 750 K.

[ 2 ] Other ways to coat a silicon surface in hydrogen is via reaction with atomic hydrogen , or hot silane .

[ 3 ] A (111) crystal face will become covered in the pure monohydride, but other faces on a silicon crystal will also have the dihydride and trihydride groups.

[ 3 ] Group [ edit ] The silylidyne group, not to be confused with silylidyne, is a ≡SiH group that is bonded with a triple bond. The hydrogen can be substituted by other groups to make a more generic family of silylidynes. It is known as a ligand on molybdenum.

Natural occurrence [ edit ] Silylidyne in space was first noticed in sun spots in 1933. Later on it was found on the solar disk, photosphere, and in cool stars.

Mira variable stars of type M or S may have emission lines of SiH. In even cooler brown dwarfs and planets, SiH is not found, but instead silicon takes form as silicon monoxide at low pressures, and SiH 4 at high pressures. Minute amounts of SiH as a transient species may be found in these bodies as SiO and SiH 4 react with water.

[ 4 ] Properties [ edit ] The Si-H bond strength is 80 kcal/mol.

[ 3 ] Spectrum [ edit ] The most prominent spectral band is due to A 2 Δ → X 2 Π transitions. Higher level excited states are the B 2 Σ − and C 2 Σ + , D 2 Δ, E 2 Σ + .

[ 4 ] The life time of the molecules in the A state is 530 nanoseconds. They decay to the X ground state.
