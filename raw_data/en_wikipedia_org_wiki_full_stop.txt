The **full stop** ([Commonwealth English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_English "Commonwealth English")), **period** ([North American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_English "North American English")), or **full point****.** is a [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") mark used for several purposes, most often to mark the end of a [declarative sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_sentence "Declarative sentence") (as distinguished from a [question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question "Question") or exclamation).[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-2)

A full stop is frequently used at the end of word [abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation "Abbreviation")—in [British usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English"), primarily truncations such as _Rev._, but not after [contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_(grammar) "Contraction (grammar)") which retain the final letter such as _[Revd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revd "Revd")_;[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-4) in [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English"), it is used in both cases. It may be placed after an initial letter used to abbreviate a word. It is often placed after each individual letter in [initialisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialism "Initialism"), (e.g., "U.S."), but not usually in those that are [acronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronyms "Acronyms") ("NATO)".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-5) However, the use of full stops after letters in initialisms is declining, and many of these without punctuation have become accepted norms (e.g., "UK" and "NATO").[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-6) When used in a series (typically of three, an [ellipsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis "Ellipsis")) the mark is also used to indicate omitted words.

In the [English-speaking world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world "English-speaking world"), a punctuation mark identical to the full stop is used as the [decimal separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator "Decimal separator") and for other purposes, and may be called a **point**. In computing, it is called a **dot**.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Williamson-7) It is sometimes called a **[baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(typography) "Baseline (typography)") dot** to distinguish it from the [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct") (or middle dot).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Williamson-7)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-8)

History
-------

### Ancient Greek origin

The full stop symbol derives from the [Greek punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_punctuation "Greek punctuation") introduced by [Aristophanes of Byzantium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes_of_Byzantium "Aristophanes of Byzantium") in the 3rd century[BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCE "BCE") in [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In his system, there was a series of dots whose placement determined their meaning. His three punctuations were these: the end of a completed thought or expression was marked by a high dot ˙, called the _stigmḕ teleía_ (στιγμὴ τελεία) or "terminal dot"; the "middle dot" ·, the _stigmḕ mésē_ (στιγμὴ μέση), marked a division in a thought occasioning a longer breath (essentially a [semicolon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon "Semicolon")); the low dot ., called the _hypostigmḕ_ (ὑποστιγμή) or "underdot", marked a division in a thought occasioning a shorter breath (essentially a [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma")).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Nicholas-9)

The name _period_ is first attested (as the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin "Medieval Latin") loanword _peridos_) in [Ælfric of Eynsham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86lfric_of_Eynsham "Ælfric of Eynsham")'s [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") treatment on grammar. There, it was distinguished from the full stop (the _distinctio_) and continued the Greek underdot's earlier function as a comma between phrases.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-OED-10) It shifted its meaning to a dot marking a full stop in the works of the 16th-century grammarians.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-OED-10) In the 7th century, [Isidore of Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville "Isidore of Seville") updated the system slightly; he assigned the dots to indicate short ., medium · and long · pauses in reading, respectively.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-11)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-12)

### Medieval Latin to modern English

In practice, scribes mostly employed the terminal dot; the others fell out of use and were later replaced by other symbols. From the 9th century onwards, the full stop began appearing as a low mark (instead of a high one), and by the time [printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing#History "Printing") began in Western Europe, the lower dot was regular and then universal.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Nicholas-9)

In 19th-century texts, [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English") and [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English") both frequently used the terms _period_ and _full stop_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-13)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-puncpoints-1) The word _period_ was used as a name for what printers often called the "full point", the punctuation mark that was a dot on the baseline and used in several situations. The phrase _full stop_ was only used to refer to the punctuation mark when it was used to terminate a sentence.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-puncpoints-1) This terminological distinction seems to be eroding. For example, the 1998 edition of _[Fowler's Modern English Usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%27s\_Modern\_English\_Usage "Fowler's Modern English Usage")_ used _full point_ for the mark used after an abbreviation, but _full stop_ or _full point_ when it was employed at the end of a sentence;[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-14) the 2015 edition, however, treats them as synonymous (and prefers _full stop_),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-15) and _[New Hart's Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Hart%27s\_Rules "New Hart's Rules")_ does likewise (but prefers _full point_).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-16) The last edition (1989) of the original _Hart's Rules_ (before it became _[The Oxford Guide to Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Oxford\_Guide\_to\_Style "The Oxford Guide to Style")_ in 2002) exclusively used _full point_.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-17)

Usage
-----

Full stops are the most commonly used punctuation marks; analysis of texts indicate that approximately half of all punctuation marks used are full stops.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-18)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-19) Some of the usages of full stops are:

### Ending sentences

Full stops indicate the end of declarative sentences, in contrast to questions or exclamations. The full stop is omitted when adjacent to an [ellipsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis "Ellipsis").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-20)

### Abbreviations

It is usual in North American English to use full stops after initials; e.g.: _[A. A. Milne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.\_A.\_Milne "A. A. Milne")_[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Barden_2007-21) and _[George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George\_W.\_Bush "George W. Bush")_.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Blakesley-Hoogeveen_2007-22) British usage is less strict.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-SCS-23) A few style guides discourage full stops after initials.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-ELJ_2014-24)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-ThirdText-25) However, there is a general trend and initiatives to spell out names in full instead of abbreviating them in order to avoid ambiguity.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Knuth_2016-26)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Dunne_2015_1-27)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Dunne_2015_2-28)

A full stop is used after some [abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation "Abbreviation").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-29) If the abbreviation ends a declaratory sentence, there is no additional period immediately following the full stop that ends the abbreviation (e.g. "My name is Gabriel Gama Jr."). Though two full stops (one for the abbreviation, one for the sentence ending) might be expected, conventionally only one is written.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Nova_SEU-30) This is an intentional omission, and thus not [haplography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplography "Haplography"), which is an unintentional omission of a duplicate. In the case of an interrogative or exclamatory sentence ending with an abbreviation, a question or exclamation mark can still be added (e.g., "Are you Gabriel Gama Jr.?").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Nova_SEU-30)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-31)

According to the Oxford Dictionaries, this does not include, for example, the standard abbreviations for titles such as _Professor_ ("Prof.") or _Reverend_ ("Rev."), because they do not end with the last letter of the word they are abbreviating.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-OxfordD-32) In American English, the common convention is to include the period after all such abbreviations.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-OxfordD-32)

#### Acronyms and initialisms

In [acronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") and [initialisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialism "Initialism"), the modern style is generally to not use full points after each initial (e.g.: _DNA_, _UK_, _USSR_). The punctuation is somewhat more often used in American English, most commonly with _U.S._ and _U.S.A._ in particular, depending upon the house style of a particular writer or publisher.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-33) As some examples from American style guides, _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_ (primarily for book and academic-journal publishing) deprecates the use of full points in initialisms, including _U.S._,[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-34) while _[The Associated Press Stylebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Associated\_Press\_Stylebook "The Associated Press Stylebook")_ (primarily for journalism) dispenses with full points in initialisms, including acronyms, except for certain two-letter cases, including _U.S._, _U.K._ and _[U.N.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_Nations "United Nations")_, but not _[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European\_Union "European Union")_.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-35) Acronyms, which can be pronounced as words, have tended to lose full stops even when they were formerly used; e.g., Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services became Q.A.N.T.A.S., then QANTAS, and ultimately [Qantas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas "Qantas").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-36)

### Time

In British English, whether for the [12-hour clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock "12-hour clock") or sometimes its [24-hour counterpart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock "24-hour clock"), the dot is commonly used and some style guides recommend it when telling time, including those from non-[BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") public broadcasters in the UK, the academic manual published by [Oxford University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Press "Oxford University Press") under various titles,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-37) as well as the internal [house style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide "Style guide") book for the University of Oxford,[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-38) and that of _[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Economist "The Economist")_,[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-39)_[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Guardian "The Guardian")_[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-40) and _[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Times "The Times")_ newspapers.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-41) American and [Canadian English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_English "Canadian English") mostly prefers and uses colons (:) (i.e., 11:15 PM/pm/p.m. or 23:15 for AmE/CanE and 11.15 pm or 23.15 for BrE);[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-42) the UK BBC uses only 24-hour times with a colon, since at least the August 2020 update of its news style guide.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-43) The point as a time separator is also used in [Irish English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-English "Hiberno-English"), particularly by the [Raidió Teilifís Éireann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raidi%C3%B3_Teilif%C3%ADs_%C3%89ireann "Raidió Teilifís Éireann") (RTÉ), and to a lesser extent in Australian, Cypriot, Maltese, New Zealand, South African and other [Commonwealth English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_in_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations "English in the Commonwealth of Nations") varieties outside Canada.

### In conversation

In British English, the words "full stop" at the end of an utterance strengthen it; they indicate that it admits no further discussion: "I'm not going with you, full stop." In American English, the word "period" serves this function. Another common use in [African-American Vernacular English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English "African-American Vernacular English") is found in the phrase "And that's on period", which is used to express the strength of the speaker's previous statement, usually to emphasise an opinion.

### Decimal or thousands separator

The period [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph") is used in the presentation of numbers, either as a [decimal separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator "Decimal separator") or as a [thousands separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousands_separator "Thousands separator").

In the more prevalent usage in English-speaking countries, as well as in South Asia and East Asia, the point represents a decimal separator, visually dividing whole numbers from fractional (decimal) parts. The comma is then used to separate the whole-number parts into groups of three digits each when numbers are sufficiently large.

*   1.007 (one and seven thousandths)
*   1,002.007 (one thousand two and seven thousandths)
*   1,002,003.007 (one million two thousand three and seven thousandths)

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Cologne_Germany_Max-Load-Sign-at-Harbour-Crane-34-01.jpg/250px-Cologne_Germany_Max-Load-Sign-at-Harbour-Crane-34-01.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cologne_Germany_Max-Load-Sign-at-Harbour-Crane-34-01.jpg)

A point used as a thousands separator on a sign in Germany

The more prevalent usage in much of Europe, southern Africa and Latin America (with the exception of Mexico due to the influence of the United States) reverses the roles of the comma and point but sometimes substitutes a ([thin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinspace "Thinspace")-)space for a point.

*   1,007 (one and seven thousandths)
*   1.002,007 or 1 002,007 (one thousand two and seven thousandths)
*   1.002.003,007 or 1 002 003,007 (one million two thousand three and seven thousandths)

To avoid problems with the spaces (such as the potential confusion that could be introduced by [line wrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_wrap_and_word_wrap "Line wrap and word wrap")), another convention sometimes used is to use [apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe "Apostrophe") signs (') instead of spaces.

[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh "Bangladesh"), [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal "Nepal") and [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan") follow the [Indian numbering system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_numbering_system "Indian numbering system"), which utilizes commas and decimals much like the aforementioned system popular in most English-speaking countries but separates values of one hundred thousand and above differently, into divisions of _lakh_ and _crore_:

*   1.007 (one and seven thousandths)
*   1,002.007 (one thousand two and seven thousandths)
*   10,02,003.007 (one million two thousand three and seven thousandths, or ten _lakh_ two thousand three and seven thousandths)

### Multiplication sign

In countries that use the comma as a decimal separator, the point is sometimes found as a [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication") sign; for example, 5,2 . 2 = 10,4; this usage is impractical in cases where the point is used as a decimal separator, hence the use of the [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct"): 5.2 · 2 = 10.4. The interpunct is also used when multiplying units in science—for example, _50 km/h_ could be written as _50 km·h−1_—and to indicate a [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product"), i.e., the scalar product of two vectors.

### Ordinal dot

In many languages, an ordinal dot is used as the [ordinal indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator "Ordinal indicator"). This applies mostly in Central and Northern Europe: in [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"), [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language "Hungarian language"), several Slavic languages ([Czech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language "Czech language"), [Slovak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_language "Slovak language"), [Slovene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_language "Slovene language"), [Serbo-Croatian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian "Serbo-Croatian")), [Faroese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroese_language "Faroese language"), [Icelandic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language "Icelandic language"), [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language "Danish language"), [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language"), [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "Finnish language"), [Estonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language "Estonian language"), [Latvian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_language "Latvian language") and also in [Basque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language "Basque language") and [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language "Turkish language"). The dots are typically placed after the ordinal number; for example, "7." generally represents the seventh.

The Serbian standard of Serbo-Croatian (unlike the Croatian and Bosnian standards) uses the dot in the role of the ordinal indicator only past Arabic numerals, while Roman numerals are used without a dot.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language"), the period can be omitted if there is no ambiguity about whether a given numeral is ordinal or cardinal.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Multilevel numbered headings

In modern texts, multilevel numbered headings are widely used. For example, the string "2.3.1.5" represents a 4th-level heading within chapter 2 (i.e., in the second chapter, the third subsection, the first sub-subsection and the fifth, the sub-sub-subsection).

### Logic

In older literature on [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), the period glyph was used to indicate how expressions should be bracketed, as explained in the [Glossary of _Principia Mathematica_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Principia_Mathematica "Glossary of Principia Mathematica"). Full stops can be used as the border of [logical operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective "Logical connective") to potentially prevent ambiguities; e.g., in `⊢: P∈Ω. E!B̌P. ⊃. P∈Ded.`, full stops are used to separate logical statements.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-44)

### Computing

"Dot (character)" redirects here. For the fictional character, see [Yakko, Wakko, and Dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakko,_Wakko,_and_Dot "Yakko, Wakko, and Dot").

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), the full point, usually called a _dot_ in this context, is often used as a [delimiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter "Delimiter"), such as in [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") lookups, Web addresses, [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file "Computer file") names and software release versions:

*   www**.**wikipedia**.**org
*   document**.**txt
*   192**.**168**.**0**.**1
*   Chrome 92**.**0**.**4515**.**130

It is used in many [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") as an important part of the syntax. [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") uses it as a means of accessing a member of a [struct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language) "Struct (C programming language)"), and this syntax was inherited by [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") as a means of accessing a member of a [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science) "Class (computer science)") or [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science) "Object (computer science)").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-45)[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)") and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)") also follow this convention. [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal (programming language)") uses it both as a means of accessing a member of a record set (the equivalent of struct in C), a member of an object, and after the _end_ construct that defines the body of the program. In [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)"), it is also used for generalised [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space") and [outer product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_product "Outer product"). In [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language) "Erlang (programming language)"), [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog "Prolog") and [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk "Smalltalk"), it marks the end of a [statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science) "Statement (computer science)") ("sentence"). In a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression"), it represents a match of any character. In [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl") and [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "PHP"), the dot is the [string concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_concatenation "String concatenation") operator. In the [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language) "Haskell (programming language)") standard library, it is the [function composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") operator. In [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL "COBOL"), a full stop ends a statement.

In [file systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system "File system"), the dot is commonly used to separate the [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension "Filename extension") of a file name from the name of the file (e.g., `filename.mp4`). [RISC OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC_OS "RISC OS") uses dots to separate levels of the [hierarchical file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_file_system "Hierarchical file system") when writing path names—similar to `/` (forward-slash) in [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix")-based systems and `\` (back-slash) in [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS "MS-DOS")-based systems and the [Windows NT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT "Windows NT") systems that succeeded them. In [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") operating systems, some applications treat files or directories that start with a dot as [hidden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file "Hidden file"). This means that they are not displayed or listed to the user by default. In Unix-like systems and [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows"), the dot character represents the [working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory "Working directory") of the file system. Two dots (`..`) represent the [parent directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent_directory "Parent directory") of the working directory.

[Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell "Bourne shell")-derived command-line interpreters, such as sh, [ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell "KornShell") and [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) "Bash (Unix shell)"), use the dot as a command to [read a file and execute its content in the running interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(command) "Source (command)"). (Some of these also offer _source_ as a synonym, based on that usage in the [C shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell "C shell").)

Versions of software are often denoted with the style _x**.**y**.**z_ (or more), where _x_ is a major release, _y_ is a mid-cycle enhancement release and _z_ is a [patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing) "Patch (computing)") level designation, but actual usage is entirely vendor specific.

### Telegraphy

The term _STOP_ was used in [telegrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_telegraph "Electrical telegraph") in the United States in place of the full stop. The end of a sentence would be marked by _STOP_; its use "in telegraphic communications was greatly increased during the World War, when the Government employed it widely as a precaution against having messages garbled or misunderstood, as a result of the misplacement or emission [_[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")_] of the tiny dot or period."[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-46)

The [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet") uses the full stop to signify a syllable break.

Punctuation styles when quoting
-------------------------------

The practice in the United States and Canada is to place full stops and commas inside quotation marks in most styles.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-APA-47) In the British system, which is also called "logical quotation",[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-JISS-48) full stops and commas are placed according to grammatical sense:[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-APA-47)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-49) This means that when they are part of the quoted material, they should be placed inside, and otherwise should be outside. For example, they are placed outside in the cases of words-as-words, titles of short-form works and quoted sentence fragments.

*   Bruce Springsteen, nicknamed "the Boss," performed "American Skin." (closed or American style)
*   Bruce Springsteen, nicknamed "the Boss", performed "American Skin". (logical or British style)
*   He said, "I love music." (both)

There is some national crossover. The American style is common in British fiction writing.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-50) The British style is sometimes used in American English. For example, _The Chicago Manual of Style_ recommends it for fields where comma placement could affect the meaning of the quoted material, such as linguistics and textual criticism.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-51)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-52)

The use of placement according to logical or grammatical sense, or "logical convention", now the more common practice in regions other than North America,[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-53) was advocated in the influential book _[The King's English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_King%27s\_English "The King's English")_ by Fowler and Fowler, published in 1906. Prior to the influence of this work, the typesetter's or printer's style, or "closed convention", now also called American style, was common throughout the world.

Spacing after a full stop
-------------------------

There have been a number of practices relating to the spacing after a full stop. Some examples are listed below:

*   One [word space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_spacing "Word spacing") ("[French spacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_spacing "French spacing")"). This is the current convention in most countries that use the [ISO basic Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet "ISO basic Latin alphabet") for published and final written work, as well as digital media.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-54)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Manjoo-55)
*   Two word spaces ("[English spacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_spacing "English spacing")"). It is sometimes claimed that the two-space convention stems from the use of the [monospaced font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font "Monospaced font") on [typewriters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter"), but in fact that convention replicates much earlier typography—the intent was to provide a clear break between sentences.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-56) This spacing method was gradually replaced by the single space convention in published print, where space is at a premium, and continues in much digital media.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Manjoo-55)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-57)
*   One widened space (such as an [em space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_space "Em space")). This spacing was seen in [historical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_sentence_spacing "History of sentence spacing") typesetting practices (until the early 20th century).[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-58) It has also been used in other typesetting systems such as the [Linotype machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linotype_machine "Linotype machine")[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-59) and the [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX "TeX") system.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-60) Modern computer-based digital fonts can adjust the spacing after terminal punctuation as well, creating a space slightly wider than a standard word space.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-61)

In other scripts
----------------

### Greek

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Minuscule_1424%2C_f._317_r._1_Tim_3%2C16.jpg/330px-Minuscule_1424%2C_f._317_r._1_Tim_3%2C16.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minuscule_1424,_f._317_r._1_Tim_3,16.jpg)

A [New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament") manuscript with high dots as full stops

Although the present Greek full stop (τελεία, _teleía_) is [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek "Romanization of Greek") as a Latin full stop[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-62) and encoded identically with the full stop in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Nicholas-9) the historic full stop in Greek was a _high_ dot and the _low_ dot functioned as a kind of [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_comma "Greek comma"), [as noted above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#History). The low dot was increasingly but irregularly used to mark full stops after the 9th century and was fully adapted after the advent of print.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-Nicholas-9) The teleia should also be distinguished from the [ano teleia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ano_teleia "Ano teleia"), which is named "_high_ stop" but looks like an [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct"), and principally functions as the Greek [semicolon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon "Semicolon").

### Armenian

The [Armenian script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_alphabet "Armenian alphabet") uses the `։` (վերջակետ, _verdjaket_). It looks similar to the [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)") (`:`).

### Chinese and Japanese

[Punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_punctuation "Chinese punctuation") used with [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters "Chinese characters") (and in [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_input_method "Japanese input method")) often includes U+3002。IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP, a small circle used as a full stop instead of a solid dot. When used with [traditional characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"), the full stop is generally centered on the [mean line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_line "Mean line"); when used with [simplified characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters "Simplified Chinese characters"), it is usually aligned to the baseline. In written [vertical text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts "Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts"), the full stop is sometimes positioned to the top-right or in the top- to center-middle. In Unicode, it is the U+FE12︒PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP.

### Korean

Korean uses the Latin full stop along with [its native script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul "Hangul").

### Ge'ez

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Yohannes_IV_-_5.jpg/250px-Yohannes_IV_-_5.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yohannes_IV_-_5.jpg)

An _ˈarat nettib_ written in an Amharic inscription that commemorated [Yohannes IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohannes_IV "Yohannes IV")'s call to arms

In the [Ge'ez script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%27ez_script "Ge'ez script") that is used to write [Amharic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic_language "Amharic language") and several other Ethiopian and Eritrean languages, the equivalent of the full stop following a sentence is the "_ˈarat nettib_" (U+1362።ETHIOPIC FULL STOP), which means _four dots_. The two dots on the right are slightly ascending from the two on the left, with space in between.

### Brahmic scripts

#### Nagari

[Indo-Aryan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_languages "Indo-Aryan languages") predominantly use [Nagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81gar%C4%AB_script "Nāgarī script")-based scripts. In the [Devanagari script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari "Devanagari") that is used to write languages like [Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi"), [Maithili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maithili_language "Maithili language"), [Nepali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language "Nepali language"), etc., a vertical line U+0964।DEVANAGARI DANDA is used to mark the end of a sentence. It is known as _poorna viraam_ (full stop). In [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit"), the additional symbol of two vertical lines U+0965॥DEVANAGARI DOUBLE DANDA is used to mark the end of a poetic verse. However, some languages that are written in Devanagari use the Latin full stop, such as [Marathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language "Marathi language").

In the [Eastern Nagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Nagari "Eastern Nagari") script used to write languages like [Bangla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language "Bengali language") and [Assamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assamese_language "Assamese language"), the same vertical line ("।") is used for a full stop, known as _Daa`ri_ in Bengali. Also, languages like [Odia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odia_language "Odia language") and [Panjabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language "Punjabi language") (which respectively use [Oriya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odia_script "Odia script") and [Gurmukhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurmukhi "Gurmukhi") scripts) use the same symbol. Inspired from [Indic scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indic_scripts "Indic scripts"), the [Santali language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santali_language "Santali language") also uses a similar symbol in [Ol Chiki script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol_Chiki_script "Ol Chiki script"): U+1C7E᱾OL CHIKI PUNCTUATION MUCAAD to mark the end of a sentence. Similarly, it also uses U+1C7F᱿OL CHIKI PUNCTUATION DOUBLE MUCAAD to indicate a major break, like the end of a section, although rarely used.

#### Sinhalese

In [Sinhala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_language "Sinhala language"), a symbol called _kundaliya_ U+0DF4෴SINHALA PUNCTUATION KUNDDALIYA was used before the colonial era. Latin full stops were later introduced into the [Sinhalese script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_script "Sinhalese script") after the introduction of paper due to the influence of European languages.

#### Southeast Asian

In [Burmese script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_script "Burmese script"), the symbol U+104B။MYANMAR SIGN SECTION is used as a full stop. However, in [Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language "Thai language"), no symbol corresponding to the full stop is used as _[terminal punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal\_punctuation "Terminal punctuation")_. A sentence is written without spaces and a space is typically used to mark the end of a clause or sentence.

#### Tibetic

The [Tibetan script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_script "Tibetan script") uses two different full stops: _tshig-grub_ (U+0F0D།TIBETAN MARK SHAD) marks the end of a section of text, while the _don-tshan_ (U+0F0E༎TIBETAN MARK NYIS SHAD) is used to mark the end of a whole topic. The descendants of Tibetic script also use similar symbols: For example, the [Róng script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B3ng_script "Róng script") of the [Lepcha language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepcha_language "Lepcha language") uses ᰻‎ and ᰼‎ (U+1C3B᰻LEPCHA PUNCTUATION TA-ROL and U+1C3C᰼LEPCHA PUNCTUATION NYET THYOOM TA-ROL). However, due to the influence of the [Burmese script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_script "Burmese script"), the [Meitei script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitei_script "Meitei script") of the [Manipuri language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipuri_language "Manipuri language") uses U+AAF0꫰MEETEI MAYEK CHEIKHAN for a comma and U+ABEB꯫MEETEI MAYEK CHEIKHEI to mark the end of a sentence.

### Shahmukhi

For [Indo-Aryan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_languages "Indo-Aryan languages") which are written in [Nastaliq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nastaliq "Nastaliq"), like [Kashmiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_language "Kashmiri language"), [Panjabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language "Punjabi language"), [Saraiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraiki_language "Saraiki language") and [Urdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu "Urdu"), a symbol called _k͟hatma_ (U+06D4۔ARABIC FULL STOP) is used as a full stop at the end of sentences and in abbreviations. The symbol (۔) looks similar to a lowered [dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash "Dash") (–).

In text messages
----------------

Researchers from [Binghamton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binghamton_University "Binghamton University") performed a small study, published in 2016, on young adults and found that text messages that included sentences ended with full stops—as opposed to those with no terminal punctuation—were perceived as insincere, though they stipulated that their results apply only to this particular medium of communication: "Our sense was, is that because [text messages] were informal and had a chatty kind of feeling to them, that a period may have seemed stuffy, too formal, in that context," said head researcher Cecelia Klin.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-64) The study did not find handwritten notes to be affected.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-65)

A 2016 story by Jeff Guo in _[The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Washington\_Post "The Washington Post")_ stated that the line break had become the default method of punctuation in texting, comparable to the use of line breaks in poetry, and that a period at the end of a sentence causes the tone of the message to be perceived as cold, angry or [passive-aggressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive-aggressive "Passive-aggressive").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-66)

According to Gretchen McCulloch, an internet linguist, using a full stop to end messages is seen as "rude" by more and more people. She said this can be attributed to the way we text and use instant messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. She added that the default way to break up one's thoughts is to send each thought as an individual message.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-67)

Notes
-----

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_ref-2 "Jump up")**This sentence-ending use, alone, defines the strictest sense of _full stop_. Although _full stop_ technically applies only when the mark is used to end a sentence, the distinction—drawn since at least 1897[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-puncpoints-1)—is not maintained by all modern style guides and dictionaries.
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_ref-4 "Jump up")**Fowler's _[Modern English Usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern\_English\_Usage "Modern English Usage")_ is prescriptive: abbreviations formed by dropping the end of a word are properly given a period, but doing the same to those where some portion of the middle is dropped, "is ill advised".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#cite_note-3)

The British style is strongly advocated by some American language experts. In defense of nearly a century and a half of the American style, however, it may be said that it seems to have been working fairly well and has not resulted in serious miscommunication. Whereas there clearly is some risk with question marks and exclamation points, there seems little likelihood that readers will be misled concerning the period or comma. There may be some risk in such specialized material as textual criticism, but in that case author and editors may take care to avoid the danger by alternative phrasing or by employing, in this exacting field, the exacting British system. In linguistic and philosophical works, specialized terms are regularly punctuated the British way, along with the use of single quotation marks.

According to what is sometimes called the British style (set forth in The Oxford Guide to Style [the successor to Hart's Rules]; see bibliog. 1.1.]), a style also followed in other English-speaking countries, only those punctuation points that appeared in the original material should be included within the quotation marks; all others follow the closing quotation marks.... In the kind of textual studies where retaining the original placement of a comma in relation to closing quotation marks is essential to the author's argument and scholarly integrity, the alternative system described in 6.10 ['the British style'] could be used, or rephrasing might avoid the problem.
