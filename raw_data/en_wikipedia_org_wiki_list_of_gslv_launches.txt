II F14 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre , carrying INSAT-3DS .

This is a list of launches conducted by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) using Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) rockets. This list does not include LVM3 (formerly known as GSLV Mk III) launches, which can be found here .

Notable missions [ edit ] GSLV MK. I flight D1 [ edit ] Main article: GSLV This was the first developmental flight of the GSLV Mk.I featuring Russian cryogenic engine KVD-1 . It was used to place an experimental satellite GSAT-1 into the orbit. However, due to sub-optimal performance and lack of fuel the vehicle did not achieve the intended orbit and the satellite had to maneuver itself using onboard fuel to correct the shortfall. ISRO claims the launch to be successful.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In a 2014 interview, ISRO Chairman K. Radhakrishnan attributed the failure to incorrect mixture ratio used in the cryogenic upper stage.

[ 3 ] [ 1 ] [ 4 ] GSLV MK. II flight D5 [ edit ] Main article: GSLV-D5 This was the second test flight with indigenous cryogenic stage CE-7.5 and the first successful launch with the CE-7.5 . The flight lifted and successfully placed the 1,982 kilograms (4,370 lb) GSAT-14 into the orbit. This flight became the harbinger of successful launch with the indigenous cryogenic stage.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] GSLV MK. II flight F09 [ edit ] Main article: South Asia Satellite This was the fourth consecutive successful flight of GSLV Mk. II with indigenous cryogenic engine. The flight placed the regional satellite South Asia Satellite was previously named as South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Satellite.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] The satellite was a gift from India to its neighbors to bolster Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's neighborhood first policy .

[ 12 ] Afghanistan , Bangladesh , Bhutan , Maldives , Nepal and Sri Lanka are the users of the multi-dimensional facilities provided by the satellite.

[ 15 ] F02 10 July 2006 12:08 Mk I Second INSAT-4C 2168 kg GTO INSAT Failure One of the L40 strap-on engines failed at lift-off. Both rocket and satellite had to be destroyed over the Bay of Bengal after the rocket's trajectory veered outside permitted limits.

[ 16 ] F04 2 September 2007 12:51 Mk I Second INSAT-4CR 2160 kg GTO INSAT Partial failure High roll rate build-up due control system malfunction on one L40 strapon resulted in premature shutdown of other strap-on stages.

[ 17 ] Due to an error in the guidance subsystem achieved orbit had lower apogee and inclination higher than expected.

[ 18 ] Orbit corrected through satellite, eventually the INSAT-4CR was placed in its slot.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Satellite completed its planned design life while it was fully operational. ISRO claims this GSLV flight to be successful.

[ 22 ] 2010–2017 [ edit ] Flight No.

Failed to reach orbit due to malfunction of the Fuel Booster Turbo Pump (FBTP) of the cryogenic upper stage.

[ 23 ] F06 25 December 2010 10:34 Mk I Second GSAT-5P 2310 kg GTO INSAT Failure First flight of GSLV Mk.I (c). Aft shroud of upper stage engine bay disintegrated due to aerodynamic loads, snapping the electrical continuity to L40 strapons.

[ 24 ] [ 17 ] Vehicle was destroyed by range safety officer after loss of control over liquid-fueled boosters.

[ 25 ] D5 5 January 2014 10:48 Mk II Second GSAT-14 1980 kg GTO INSAT Success The flight was scheduled for 19 August 2013, but one hour and 14 minutes before the lift off, a leakage was reported and the launch was halted.

[ 26 ] Second flight of GSLV with indigenous cryogenic upper stage (CUS) developed by ISRO's Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) was launched successfully on 5 January 2014.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] It was a launch with precision of 40 m (130 ft). All the three stages performed successfully.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] This was the first successful flight of the cryogenic stage which was developed indigenously in India.

D6 27 August 2015 11:22 Mk II Second GSAT-6 2117 kg GTO INSAT Success GSLV Mk II D6 with an Indigenous Cryogenic Engine (ICE) successfully ferried GSAT-6 payload into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) with injection parameters of 170 km x 35945 km, 19.96° inclination. The cuboid-shaped GSAT-6 satellite includes a technology demonstrator S-Band unfurlable antenna with a diameter of six metre which will provide S-band communication services during its expected mission life of nine years.
