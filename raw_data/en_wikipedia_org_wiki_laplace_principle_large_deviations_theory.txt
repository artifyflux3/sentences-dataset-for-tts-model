Find sources: "Laplace principle" large deviations theory – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2024 ) In mathematics , Laplace's principle is a basic theorem in large deviations theory which is similar to Varadhan's lemma . It gives an asymptotic expression for the Lebesgue integral of exp(− θφ ( x )) over a fixed set A as θ becomes large. Such expressions can be used, for example, in statistical mechanics to determining the limiting behaviour of a system as the temperature tends to absolute zero .

Statement of the result [ edit ] Let A be a Lebesgue-measurable subset of d - dimensional Euclidean space R d and let φ : R d → R be a measurable function with ∫ ∫ A e − − φ φ ( x ) d x < ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle \int _{A}e^{-\varphi (x)}\,dx<\infty .} Then lim θ θ → → ∞ ∞ 1 θ θ log ⁡ ⁡ ∫ ∫ A e − − θ θ φ φ ( x ) d x = − − e s s i n f x ∈ ∈ A ⁡ ⁡ φ φ ( x ) , {\displaystyle \lim _{\theta \to \infty }{\frac {1}{\theta }}\log \int _{A}e^{-\theta \varphi (x)}\,dx=-\mathop {\mathrm {ess\,inf} } _{x\in A}\varphi (x),} where ess inf denotes the essential infimum . Heuristically, this may be read as saying that for large θ , ∫ ∫ A e − − θ θ φ φ ( x ) d x ≈ ≈ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − θ θ e s s i n f x ∈ ∈ A ⁡ ⁡ φ φ ( x ) ) .

{\displaystyle \int _{A}e^{-\theta \varphi (x)}\,dx\approx \exp \left(-\theta \mathop {\mathrm {ess\,inf} } _{x\in A}\varphi (x)\right).} Application [ edit ] The Laplace principle can be applied to the family of probability measures P θ given by P θ θ ( A ) = ( ∫ ∫ A e − − θ θ φ φ ( x ) d x ) / ( ∫ ∫ R d e − − θ θ φ φ ( y ) d y ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} _{\theta }(A)=\left(\int _{A}e^{-\theta \varphi (x)}\,dx\right){\bigg /}\left(\int _{\mathbf {R} ^{d}}e^{-\theta \varphi (y)}\,dy\right)} to give an asymptotic expression for the probability of some event A as θ becomes large. For example, if X is a standard normally distributed random variable on R , then lim ε ε ↓ ↓ 0 ε ε log ⁡ ⁡ P [ ε ε X ∈ ∈ A ] = − − e s s i n f x ∈ ∈ A ⁡ ⁡ x 2 2 {\displaystyle \lim _{\varepsilon \downarrow 0}\varepsilon \log \mathbf {P} {\big [}{\sqrt {\varepsilon }}X\in A{\big ]}=-\mathop {\mathrm {ess\,inf} } _{x\in A}{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}} for every measurable set A .
