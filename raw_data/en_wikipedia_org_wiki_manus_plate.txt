The Manus plate was formed in between the North Bismark Plate and the South Bismark Plate . The Manus plate currently rotates counter-clockwise in the Melanesia area.

[ 1 ] Formation [ edit ] The Manus plate formed during the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal , making its maximum age approximately 781,000 years old.

[ 2 ] The Manus plate formed in-between and on top of the transform boundaries that were separating the North and South Bismark plates.

[ 2 ] The plate was formed of young mid-ocean ridge basalt, along with pieces of older oceanic floor that had broken off of the South Bismarck plate.

[ 2 ] Boundaries and Movement [ edit ] The north and northeast boundaries of the Manus plate, with the North Bismark and Pacific plates are both convergent boundaries .

[ 3 ] The plates southeast borders of the South Bismark plate is a divergent boundary .

[ 3 ] The southwest boundary bordering the South Bismark plate is a transform boundary . The Manus plate currently has a rate of rotation of 51°/ Ma at the spot, -3.04°N, 150.46°E, in the counter-clockwise direction, due to the plates left lateral motion.

[ 4 ] This is likely the fastest plate rotation, on Earth at this time.
