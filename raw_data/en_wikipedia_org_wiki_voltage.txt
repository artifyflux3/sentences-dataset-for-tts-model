**Voltage**, also known as (**electrical**) **potential difference**, **electric pressure**, or **electric tension**, is the difference in [electric potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential "Electric potential") between two points.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-2) In a [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics "Electrostatics")[electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field"), it corresponds to the [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(electrical) "Work (electrical)") needed per unit of [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") to move a positive [test charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_particle#Electrostatics "Test particle") from the first point to the second point. In the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_unit "SI unit") (SI), the [derived unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit "SI derived unit") for voltage is the _[volt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt "Volt")_ (_V_).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-5)

The voltage between points can be caused by the build-up of [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") (e.g., a [capacitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor "Capacitor")), and from an [electromotive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force "Electromotive force") (e.g., [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction") in a [generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator "Electric generator")).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-7) On a macroscopic scale, a potential difference can be caused by electrochemical processes (e.g., cells and batteries), the pressure-induced [piezoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectric_effect "Piezoelectric effect"), and the [thermoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect "Thermoelectric effect"). Since it is the difference in electric potential, it is a physical [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)")[quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity "Quantity").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-8)

A [voltmeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltmeter "Voltmeter") can be used to measure the voltage between two points in a system.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-9) Often a common reference potential such as the [ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_(electricity) "Ground (electricity)") of the system is used as one of the points. In this case, voltage is often mentioned at a point without completely mentioning the other measurement point. A voltage can be associated with either a source of energy or the loss, dissipation, or storage of energy.

The SI unit of work per unit charge is the [joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule "Joule") per [coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb "Coulomb"), where 1 volt = 1 joule (of work) per 1 coulomb of charge.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The old SI definition for _volt_ used [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power "Electric power") and [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current"); starting in 1990, the [quantum Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Hall_effect "Quantum Hall effect") and [Josephson effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effect "Josephson effect") were used,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-10) and in 2019 [physical constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant "Physical constant") were given defined values for the definition of all SI units.

Voltage is denoted symbolically by ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \Delta V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa0ec3d68205fb7f4452de096cb34a50f661111e), simplified _V_, especially in [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language")-speaking countries. Internationally, the symbol _U_ is standardized.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-11)

The [electrochemical potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_potential "Electrochemical potential") is the voltage that can be directly measured with a voltmeter.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-13) The [Galvani potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvani_potential "Galvani potential") that exists in structures with junctions of dissimilar materials, is also work per charge but cannot be measured with a voltmeter in the external circuit (see [§Galvani potential vs. electrochemical potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#Galvani_potential_vs._electrochemical_potential)).

Voltage is defined so that negatively charged objects are pulled towards higher voltages, while positively charged objects are pulled towards lower voltages.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-15) Therefore, the [conventional current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_current "Conventional current") in a wire or [resistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor "Resistor") always flows from higher voltage to lower voltage.

Historically, voltage has been referred to using terms like "tension" and "pressure". Even today, the term "tension" is still used, for example within the phrase "[high tension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_voltage "High voltage")" (HT) which is commonly used in the contexts of automotive electronics and systems using thermionic valves ([vacuum tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube")).

In a static field, the work is independent of the path

In [electrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics "Electrostatics"), the voltage increase from point ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{A}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/616d51d23b445f2129e504894af3ff6a45fff33c) to some point ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{B}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c7cdc2442eb6d55026b46a3146059c19d747438) is given by the change in [electrostatic potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential#Electrostatics "Electric potential")![Image 8: {\textstyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d67b50b7ba03a56fea637093cf80e12807852d19) from ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{A}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/616d51d23b445f2129e504894af3ff6a45fff33c) to ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{B}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c7cdc2442eb6d55026b46a3146059c19d747438). By definition,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-:1-16): 78  this is:

![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Delta V_{AB}&=V(\mathbf {r} _{B})-V(\mathbf {r} _{A})\\&=-\int _{\mathbf {r} _{0}}^{\mathbf {r} _{B}}\mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}-\left(-\int _{\mathbf {r} _{0}}^{\mathbf {r} _{A}}\mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}\right)\\&=-\int _{\mathbf {r} _{A}}^{\mathbf {r} _{B}}\mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c5042e740229945296a5e386e1391ff90f213a6)
where ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d7f22b39d51f780fc02859059c1757c606b9de2) is the intensity of the electric field.

In this case, the voltage increase from point A to point B is equal to the work done per unit charge, against the electric field, to move the charge from A to B without causing any acceleration.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-:1-16): 90–91  Mathematically, this is expressed as the [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral") of the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") along that path. In electrostatics, this line integral is independent of the path taken.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-:1-16): 91

Under this definition, any circuit where there are time-varying magnetic fields, such as [AC circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current"), will not have a well-defined voltage between nodes in the circuit, since the electric force is not a [conservative force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force "Conservative force") in those cases.[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-:0-17) However, at lower frequencies when the electric and magnetic fields are not rapidly changing, this can be neglected (see [electrostatic approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics#Electrostatic_approximation "Electrostatics")).

The electric potential can be generalized to electrodynamics, so that differences in electric potential between points are well-defined even in the presence of time-varying fields. However, unlike in electrostatics, the electric field can no longer be expressed only in terms of the electric potential.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-:1-16): 417  Furthermore, the potential is no longer uniquely determined up to a constant, and can take significantly different forms depending on the choice of [gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_fixing "Gauge fixing").[[note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-18)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-:1-16): 419–422

In this general case, some authors[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-19) use the word "voltage" to refer to the line integral of the electric field, rather than to differences in electric potential. In this case, the voltage rise along some path ![Image 13: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10d6ec962de5797ba4f161c40e66dca74ae95cc6) from ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{A}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/616d51d23b445f2129e504894af3ff6a45fff33c) to ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{B}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c7cdc2442eb6d55026b46a3146059c19d747438) is given by:

![Image 16: {\displaystyle \Delta V_{AB}=-\int _{\mathcal {P}}\mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/be9249bdeae8aabca0825cf103be3dd445a26b7f)
However, in this case the "voltage" between two points depends on the path taken.

In [circuit analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_analysis_(electrical_circuits) "Network analysis (electrical circuits)") and [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"), [lumped element models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumped_element_model "Lumped element model") are used to represent and analyze circuits. These elements are idealized and self-contained circuit elements used to model physical components.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-:2-20)

When using a lumped element model, it is assumed that the effects of changing magnetic fields produced by the circuit are suitably contained to each element.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-:2-20) Under these assumptions, the electric field in the region exterior to each component is conservative, and voltages between nodes in the circuit are well-defined, where[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-:2-20)

![Image 17: {\displaystyle \Delta V_{AB}=-\int _{\mathbf {r} _{A}}^{\mathbf {r} _{B}}\mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6dbd80fd919c85cc9b56d223f47a7f6572805cda)
as long as the path of integration does not pass through the inside of any component. The above is the same formula used in [electrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics "Electrostatics"). This integral, with the path of integration being along the test leads, is what a voltmeter will actually measure.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-21)[[note 3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-22)

If uncontained magnetic fields throughout the circuit are not negligible, then their effects can be modelled by adding [mutual inductance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_inductance "Mutual inductance") elements. In the case of a physical inductor though, the ideal lumped representation is often accurate. This is because the external fields of inductors are generally negligible, especially if the inductor has a closed [magnetic path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_circuit "Magnetic circuit"). If external fields are negligible, we find that

![Image 18: {\displaystyle \Delta V_{AB}=-\int _{\mathrm {exterior} }\mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}=L{\frac {dI}{dt}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/402f8c0ba204fd9935d04ed909677ad8d4126b87)
is path-independent, and there is a well-defined voltage across the inductor's terminals.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-23) This is the reason that measurements with a voltmeter across an inductor are often reasonably independent of the placement of the test leads.

Main article: [Volt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt "Volt")

The volt (symbol: **V**) is the [derived unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit "SI derived unit") for [electric potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential "Electric potential"), voltage, and [electromotive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force "Electromotive force").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-24)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-25) The volt is named in honour of the Italian physicist [Alessandro Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta "Alessandro Volta") (1745–1827), who invented the [voltaic pile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaic_pile "Voltaic pile"), possibly the first chemical [battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity) "Battery (electricity)").

A simple analogy for an [electric circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_circuit "Electric circuit") is water flowing in a closed circuit of [pipework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipework "Pipework"), driven by a mechanical [pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump "Pump").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] This can be called a "water circuit". The potential difference between two points corresponds to the [pressure difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_pressure "Fluid pressure") between two points. If the pump creates a pressure difference between two points, then water flowing from one point to the other will be able to do work, such as driving a [turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine "Turbine"). Similarly, work can be done by an [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") driven by the potential difference provided by a [battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery "Electric battery"). For example, the voltage provided by a sufficiently-charged automobile battery can "push" a large current through the windings of an automobile's [starter motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starter_motor "Starter motor"). If the pump is not working, it produces no pressure difference, and the turbine will not rotate. Likewise, if the automobile's battery is very weak or "dead" (or "flat"), then it will not turn the starter motor.

The hydraulic analogy is a useful way of understanding many electrical concepts. In such a system, the work done to move water is equal to the "[pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") drop" (compare p.d.) multiplied by the [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") of water moved. Similarly, in an electrical circuit, the work done to move electrons or other charge carriers is equal to "electrical pressure difference" multiplied by the quantity of electrical charges moved. In relation to "flow", the larger the "pressure difference" between two points (potential difference or water pressure difference), the greater the flow between them (electric current or water flow). (See "[electric power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power#Definition "Electric power")".)

Working on [high-voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_voltage "High voltage") power lines

Specifying a voltage measurement requires explicit or implicit specification of the points across which the voltage is measured. When using a voltmeter to measure voltage, one electrical lead of the voltmeter must be connected to the first point, one to the second point.

A common use of the term "voltage" is in describing the voltage dropped across an electrical device (such as a resistor). The [voltage drop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_drop "Voltage drop") across the device can be understood as the difference between measurements at each terminal of the device with respect to a common reference point (or [ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_(electricity) "Ground (electricity)")). The voltage drop is the difference between the two readings. Two points in an electric circuit that are connected by an ideal conductor without resistance and not within a changing [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") have a voltage of zero. Any two points with the same potential may be connected by a conductor and no current will flow between them.

### Addition of voltages

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voltage&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Addition of voltages")]

The voltage between _A_ and _C_ is the sum of the voltage between _A_ and _B_ and the voltage between _B_ and _C_. The various voltages in a circuit can be computed using [Kirchhoff's circuit laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws "Kirchhoff's circuit laws").

When talking about [alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current") (AC) there is a difference between instantaneous voltage and average voltage. Instantaneous voltages can be added for [direct current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current "Direct current") (DC) and AC, but average voltages can be meaningfully added only when they apply to signals that all have the same frequency and phase.

Measuring instruments
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voltage&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Measuring instruments")]

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/9VBatteryWithMeter.jpg/250px-9VBatteryWithMeter.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:9VBatteryWithMeter.jpg)

[Multimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter "Multimeter") set to measure voltage

Instruments for measuring voltages include the [voltmeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltmeter "Voltmeter"), the [potentiometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer_(measuring_instrument) "Potentiometer (measuring instrument)"), and the [oscilloscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope "Oscilloscope"). [Analog voltmeters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltmeter "Voltmeter"), such as moving-coil instruments, work by measuring the current through a fixed resistor, which, according to [Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law "Ohm's law"), is proportional to the voltage across the resistor. The potentiometer works by balancing the unknown voltage against a known voltage in a [bridge circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_circuit "Bridge circuit"). The cathode-ray oscilloscope works by amplifying the voltage and using it to deflect an [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") beam from a straight path, so that the deflection of the beam is proportional to the voltage.

A common voltage for [flashlight batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity) "Battery (electricity)") is 1.5 volts (DC). A common voltage for [automobile batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_battery "Automotive battery") is 12 volts (DC).

Common voltages supplied by power companies to consumers are 110 to 120 volts (AC) in North America and 220 to 240 volts (AC) in most of Europe. The voltage in [electric power transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission "Electric power transmission") lines used to distribute electricity from power stations can be several hundred times greater than consumer voltages, typically 110 to 1200 kV (AC).

The voltage used in [overhead lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_line "Overhead line") to power railway locomotives is between 12 kV and 50 kV (AC) or between 0.75 kV and 3 kV (DC).

Galvani potential vs. electrochemical potential
-----------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voltage&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Galvani potential vs. electrochemical potential")]

Inside a conductive material, the energy of an electron is affected not only by the average electric potential but also by the specific thermal and atomic environment that it is in. When a [voltmeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltmeter "Voltmeter") is connected between two different types of metal, it measures not the electrostatic potential difference, but instead something else that is affected by thermodynamics.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-26) The quantity measured by a voltmeter is the negative of the difference of the [electrochemical potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_potential "Electrochemical potential") of electrons ([Fermi level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_level "Fermi level")) divided by the electron charge and commonly referred to as the voltage difference, while the pure unadjusted [electrostatic potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_potential "Electrostatic potential") (not measurable with a voltmeter) is sometimes called [Galvani potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvani_potential "Galvani potential"). The terms "voltage" and "electric potential" are ambiguous in that, in practice, they can refer to _either_ of these in different contexts.

The term _electromotive force_ was first used by Volta in a letter to [Giovanni Aldini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Aldini "Giovanni Aldini") in 1798, and first appeared in a published paper in 1801 in _[Annales de chimie et de physique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annales\_de\_chimie\_et\_de\_physique "Annales de chimie et de physique")_.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-Varney-27): 408  Volta meant by this a force that was not an [electrostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic "Electrostatic") force, specifically, an [electrochemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical "Electrochemical") force.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-Varney-27): 405  The term was taken up by [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") in connection with [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction") in the 1820s. However, a clear definition of voltage and method of measuring it had not been developed at this time.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-28): 554  Volta distinguished electromotive force (emf) from _tension_ (potential difference): the observed potential difference at the terminals of an electrochemical cell when it was open circuit must exactly balance the emf of the cell so that no current flowed.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_note-Varney-27): 405

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_ref-:0_17-0)**This follows from the [Maxwell-Faraday equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell-Faraday_equation "Maxwell-Faraday equation"): ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {E} =-{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2eb118e22c941e34f5537dbbdcaa3d7ba23603e0) If there are changing magnetic fields in some [simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected_space "Simply connected space") region, then the [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics) "Curl (mathematics)") of the electric field in that region is non-zero, and as a result the electric field is not conservative. For more, see [Conservative force §Mathematical description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force#Mathematical_description "Conservative force").
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_ref-18)**For example, in the [Lorenz gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_gauge_condition "Lorenz gauge condition"), the electric potential is a [retarded potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarded_potential "Retarded potential"), which propagates at the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"); whereas in the [Coulomb gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_Gauge "Coulomb Gauge"), the potential changes instantaneously when the source charge distribution changes.
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage#cite_ref-22)**This statement makes a few assumptions about the nature of the voltmeter (these are discussed in the cited paper). One of these assumptions is that the current drawn by the voltmeter is negligible.
