**Archimedes of Syracuse**[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-1) ( [_AR-kih-MEE-deez_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"); c. 287– c. 212 BC) was an [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece")[mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics"), [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist"), [engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer "Engineer"), [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer"), and [inventor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention "Invention") from the ancient city of [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily "Syracuse, Sicily") in [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Greek_and_Hellenistic_Sicily "History of Greek and Hellenistic Sicily"). Although few details of his life are known, based on his surviving work, he is considered one of the leading scientists in [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"), and one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. Archimedes anticipated modern [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") and [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis") by applying the concept of the [infinitesimals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalieri%27s_principle "Cavalieri's principle") and the [method of exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion "Method of exhaustion") to derive and rigorously prove many [geometrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry")[theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem"), including the [area of a circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle "Area of a circle"), the [surface area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area "Surface area") and [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") of a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), the area of an [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"), the area under a [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"), the volume of a segment of a [paraboloid of revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraboloid_of_revolution "Paraboloid of revolution"), the volume of a segment of a [hyperboloid of revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid_of_revolution "Hyperboloid of revolution"), and the area of a [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral "Spiral").

Archimedes' other mathematical achievements include deriving an [approximation of pi (π)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80 "Approximations of π"), defining and investigating the [Archimedean spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral "Archimedean spiral"), and devising a system using [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation") for expressing [very large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_numbers "Large numbers"). He was also one of the first to [apply mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics "Applied mathematics") to [physical phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), working on [statics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics "Statics") and [hydrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatics "Hydrostatics"). Archimedes' achievements in this area include a proof of the law of the [lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever "Lever"), the widespread use of the concept of [center of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass#History "Center of mass"), and the enunciation of the law of [buoyancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy "Buoyancy") known as [Archimedes' principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_principle "Archimedes' principle"). In astronomy, he made measurements of the apparent diameter of the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") and the size of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"). He is also said to have built a [planetarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium") device that demonstrated the movements of the known celestial bodies, and may have been a precursor to the [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism "Antikythera mechanism"). He is also credited with designing innovative [machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine "Machine"), such as his [screw pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_screw "Archimedes' screw"), [compound pulleys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_and_tackle "Block and tackle"), and defensive war machines to protect his native [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily "Syracuse, Sicily") from invasion.

Archimedes died during the [siege of Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(213%E2%80%93212_BC) "Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)"), when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero") describes visiting Archimedes' tomb, which was surmounted by a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") and a [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry) "Cylinder (geometry)") that Archimedes requested be placed there to represent his most valued mathematical discovery.

Unlike his inventions, Archimedes' mathematical writings were little known in antiquity. [Alexandrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria") mathematicians read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until c. 530 AD by [Isidore of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Miletus "Isidore of Miletus") in [Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine "Byzantine")[Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople "Constantinople"), while [Eutocius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutocius_of_Ascalon "Eutocius of Ascalon")' commentaries on Archimedes' works in the same century opened them to wider readership for the first time. In the [Middle ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ages "Middle ages"), Archimedes' work was translated into Arabic in the 9th century and then into Latin in the 12th century, and were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_in_the_Renaissance "History of science in the Renaissance") and in the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution"). The discovery in 1906 of works by Archimedes, in the [Archimedes Palimpsest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest "Archimedes Palimpsest"), has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.

_[Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero") Discovering the Tomb of Archimedes_ (1805) by [Benjamin West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_West "Benjamin West")

The details of Archimedes's life are obscure; a biography of Archimedes mentioned by [Eutocius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutocius "Eutocius") was allegedly written by his friend [Heraclides Lembus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclides_Lembus "Heraclides Lembus"), but this work has been lost, and modern scholarship is doubtful that it was written by Heraclides to begin with.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-2)

Based on a statement by the Byzantine Greek scholar [John Tzetzes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tzetzes "John Tzetzes") that Archimedes lived for 75 years before his death in 212 BC, Archimedes is estimated to have been born c. 287 BC in the seaport city of [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily "Syracuse, Sicily"), [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily"), at that time a self-governing colony in [Magna Graecia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Graecia "Magna Graecia"). In the _[Sand-Reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sand\_Reckoner "The Sand Reckoner")_, Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an astronomer about whom nothing else is known; [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch") wrote in his _[Parallel Lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel\_Lives "Parallel Lives")_[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-3) that Archimedes was related to King [Hiero II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiero_II_of_Syracuse "Hiero II of Syracuse"), the ruler of Syracuse, although [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero") and [Silius Italicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silius_Italicus "Silius Italicus") suggest he was of humble origin.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198710-4) It is also unknown whether he ever married or had children, or if he ever visited [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria"), Egypt, during his youth;[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-Acerbi2008-5) though his surviving written works, addressed to Dositheus of Pelusium, a student of the Alexandrian astronomer [Conon of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conon_of_Samos "Conon of Samos"), and to the head librarian [Eratosthenes of Cyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes "Eratosthenes"), suggested that he maintained collegial relations with scholars based there.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198711%E2%80%9312-6) In the preface to _On Spirals_ addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes says that "many years have elapsed since Conon's death." [Conon of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conon_of_Samos "Conon of Samos") lived c. 280–220 BC, suggesting that Archimedes may have been an older man when writing some of his works.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Golden wreath

Measurement of volume (a) before and (b) after an object has been submerged, with (∆V) indicating the rising amount of liquid is equal to the volume of the object

Another story of a problem that Archimedes is credited solving with in service of Hiero II is the "wreath problem."[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198718-7) According to [Vitruvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius "Vitruvius"), writing about two centuries after Archimedes' death, [King Hiero II of Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiero_II_of_Syracuse "Hiero II of Syracuse") had commissioned a golden wreath for a temple to the immortal gods, and had supplied pure gold to be used by the goldsmith.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-8) However, the king had begun to suspect that the goldsmith had substituted some cheaper silver and kept some of the pure gold for himself, and, unable to make the smith confess, asked Archimedes to investigate.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198719-9) Later, while stepping into a bath, Archimedes allegedly noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose more the lower he sank in the tub and, realizing that this effect could be used to determine the golden crown's [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume"), was so excited that he took to the streets naked, having forgotten to dress, crying "[Eureka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(word) "Eureka (word)")!"[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-10), meaning "I have found [it]!"[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198719-9) According to Vitruvius, Archimedes then took a lump of gold and a lump of silver that were each equal in weight to the wreath, and, placing each in the bathtub, showed that the wreath displaced more water than the gold and less than the silver, demonstrating that the wreath was gold mixed with silver.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198719-9)

A different account is given in the _Carmen de Ponderibus_,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-11) an anonymous 5th century Latin didactic poem on weights and measures once attributed to the grammarian [Priscian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priscian "Priscian").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198719-9) In this poem, the lumps of gold and silver were placed on the scales of a balance, and then the entire apparatus was immersed in water; the difference in density between the gold and the silver, or between the gold and the crown, causes the scale to tip accordingly.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-12) Unlike the more famous bathtub account given by Vitruvius, this poetic account uses the [hydrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatics "Hydrostatics") principle now known as [Archimedes' principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27s_principle "Archimedes's principle") that is found in his treatise _[On Floating Bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On\_Floating\_Bodies "On Floating Bodies")_, where a body immersed in a fluid experiences a [buoyant force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy "Buoyancy") equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198720%E2%80%9321-13)[Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei"), who invented a [hydrostatic balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium "Hydrostatic equilibrium") in 1586 inspired by Archimedes' work, considered it "probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself."[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-14)

### Launching the _Syracusia_

A large part of Archimedes' work in engineering probably arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily "Syracuse, Sicily").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198714-15)[Athenaeus of Naucratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeus "Athenaeus") in his _[Deipnosophistae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deipnosophistae "Deipnosophistae")_ quotes a certain Moschion for a description on how King Hiero II commissioned the design of a huge ship, the _[Syracusia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracusia "Syracusia")_, which is said to have been the largest ship built in [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity") and, according to Moschion's account, it was launched by Archimedes.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-16) Plutarch tells a slightly different account,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-17) relating that Archimedes boasted to Hiero that he was able to move any large weight, at which point Hiero challenged him to move a ship.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198715-18) These accounts contain many fantastic details that are historically implausible, and the authors of these stories provide conflicting about how this task was accomplished:[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198715-18) Plutarch states that Archimedes constructed a [block-and-tackle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_and_tackle "Block and tackle")[pulley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulley "Pulley") system, while [Hero of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria") attributed the same boast to Archimedes' invention of the _baroulkos_, a kind of [windlass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windlass "Windlass").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-19)[Pappus of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria "Pappus of Alexandria") attributed this feat, instead, to Archimedes' use of [mechanical advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_advantage "Mechanical advantage"),[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198715-18) the principle of [leverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever "Lever") to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move, attributing to him the oft-quoted remark: "Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth."[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-20)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-21)

Athenaeus, likely garbling the details of Hero's account of the baroulkos,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198716-22) also mentions that Archimedes used a "screw" in order to remove any potential water leaking through the hull of the _Syracusia_. Although this device is sometimes referred to as [Archimedes' screw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_screw "Archimedes' screw"), it likely predates him by a significant amount, and none of his closest contemporaries who describe its use ([Philo of Byzantium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byzantium "Philo of Byzantium"), [Strabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo "Strabo"), and [Vitruvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius "Vitruvius")) credit him with its use.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198715-18)

### War machines

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Archimedes_Heat_Ray_conceptual_diagram.svg/250px-Archimedes_Heat_Ray_conceptual_diagram.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Archimedes_Heat_Ray_conceptual_diagram.svg)

Mirrors placed as a [parabolic reflector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_reflector "Parabolic reflector") to attack upcoming ships

The greatest reputation Archimedes earned during antiquity was for the defense of his city from the Romans during the [Siege of Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(213%E2%80%93212_BC) "Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198728%E2%80%9329-23) According to Plutarch,[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-24) Archimedes had constructed war machines for Hiero II, but had never been given an opportunity to use them during Hiero's lifetime. In 214 BC, however, during the [Second Punic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Punic_War "Second Punic War"), when Syracuse switched allegiances from [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic") to [Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage "Carthage"), the Roman army under [Marcus Claudius Marcellus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus "Marcus Claudius Marcellus") attempted to take the city, Archimedes allegedly personally oversaw the use of these war machines in the defense of the city, greatly delaying the Romans, who were only able to capture the city after a long siege.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198726,_28-25) Three different historians, [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch"), [Livy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livy "Livy"), and [Polybius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius "Polybius") provide testimony about these war machines, describing improved [catapults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catapults "Catapults"), cranes that dropped heavy pieces of lead on the Roman ships or which used an iron [claw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_of_Archimedes "Claw of Archimedes") to lift them out of the water, dropping the back in so that they sank.[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-27)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198727-28)

A much more improbable account, not found in any of the three earliest accounts (Plutarch, Polybius, or Livy) describes how Archimedes used "burning mirrors" to focus the sun's rays onto the attacking Roman ships, setting them on fire.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198728%E2%80%9329-23) The earliest account to mention ships being set on fire, by the 2nd century CE satirist [Lucian of Samosata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian_of_Samosata "Lucian of Samosata"),[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-29) does not mention mirrors, and only says the ships were set on fire by artificial means, which may imply that burning projectiles were used.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198728%E2%80%9329-23) The first author to mention mirrors is [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen"), writing later in the same century.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-30) Nearly four hundred years after Lucian and Galen, [Anthemius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthemius_of_Tralles "Anthemius of Tralles"), despite skepticism, tried to reconstruct Archimedes' hypothetical reflector geometry.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-31)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-32) The purported device, sometimes called "[Archimedes' heat ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_heat_ray "Archimedes' heat ray")", has been the subject of an ongoing debate about its credibility since the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance"). [[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-33)[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") rejected it as false,[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-34) while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes, with mixed results.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-death_ray-35)

### Death

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Death_of_Archimedes_%281815%29_by_Thomas_Degeorge.png/250px-Death_of_Archimedes_%281815%29_by_Thomas_Degeorge.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Death_of_Archimedes_(1815)_by_Thomas_Degeorge.png)

_The Death of Archimedes_ (1815) by [Thomas Degeorge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Degeorge "Thomas Degeorge")

There are several divergent accounts of Archimedes' death during the sack of Syracuse after it fell to the Romans:[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198730%E2%80%9331-36) The oldest account, from [Livy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livy "Livy"),[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-37) says that, while drawing figures in the dust, Archimedes was killed by a Roman soldier who did not know he was Archimedes. According to Plutarch,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-38) the soldier demanded that Archimedes come with him, but Archimedes declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem, and the soldier killed Archimedes with his sword. Another story from Plutarch has Archimedes carrying mathematical instruments before being killed because a soldier thought they were valuable items.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198730%E2%80%9331-36) Another Roman writer, [Valerius Maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerius_Maximus "Valerius Maximus") (fl. 30 AD), wrote in _Memorable Doings and Sayings_ that Archimedes' last words as the soldier killed him were "... but protecting the dust with his hands, said 'I beg of you, do not disturb this." which is similar to the last words now commonly attributed to him, "[Do not disturb my circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_disturb_my_circles "Do not disturb my circles"),"[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-39) which otherwise do not appear in any ancient sources.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198730%E2%80%9331-36)

Marcellus was reportedly angered by Archimedes' death, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset (he called Archimedes "a geometrical [Briareus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecatoncheires "Hecatoncheires")") and had ordered that he should not be harmed.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-40)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-41)[Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero") (106–43 BC) mentions that Marcellus brought to Rome two planetariums Archimedes built,[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198723%E2%80%9325-42) which were constructed by Archimedes and which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets, one of which he donated to the [Temple of Virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Honor_and_Virtue "Temple of Honor and Virtue") in Rome, and the other he allegedly kept as his only personal loot from Syracuse."[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-43)[Pappus of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria "Pappus of Alexandria") reports on a now lost treatise by Archimedes _On Sphere-Making_, which may have dealt with the construction of these mechanisms.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDijksterhuis198727-28) Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of [differential gearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device) "Differential (mechanical device)"), which was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times, but the discovery in 1902 of the Antikythera mechanism, another device built c. 100 BC designed with a similar purpose, has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient Greeks,[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-44) with some scholars regarding Archimedes' device as a precursor.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-45)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-46)

While serving as a [quaestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaestor "Quaestor") in Sicily, Cicero himself found what was presumed to be Archimedes' tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. The tomb carried a sculpture illustrating Archimedes' [favorite mathematical proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sphere_and_Cylinder "On the Sphere and Cylinder"), that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two-thirds that of an enclosing cylinder including its bases.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-47)

Mathematics
-----------

While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made contributions to the field of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics"), both in applying the techniques of his predecessors to obtain new results, and developing new methods of his own.

### Method of exhaustion

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/PiArchimede4.svg/250px-PiArchimede4.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PiArchimede4.svg)

Archimedes calculates the side of the 12-gon from that of the [hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon "Hexagon") and for each subsequent doubling of the sides of the regular polygon

In _[Quadrature of the Parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature\_of\_the\_Parabola "Quadrature of the Parabola")_, Archimedes states that a certain proposition in [Euclid's Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements") demonstrating that the area of a circle is proportional to its diameter was proven using a lemma now known as the [Archimedean property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_property "Archimedean property"), that “the excess by which the greater of two unequal regions exceed the lesser, if added to itself, can exceed any given bounded region.” Prior to Archimedes, [Eudoxus of Cnidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus "Eudoxus of Cnidus") and other earlier mathematicians[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-48) applied this lemma, a technique now referred to as the "method of exhaustion," to find the volume of a [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron "Tetrahedron"), [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder "Cylinder"), [cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone "Cone"), and [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), for which proofs are given in book XII of [Euclid's Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAcerbi2018279-49)

In _[Measurement of a Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement\_of\_a\_Circle "Measurement of a Circle")_, Archimedes employed this method to show that the area of a circle is the same as a right triangle whose base and height are equal to its radius and circumference.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAcerbi2018280-50) He then approximated the ratio between the radius and the circumference, the value of [π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi"), by drawing a larger [regular hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_hexagon "Regular hexagon") outside a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") then a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each [regular polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon"), calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of π lay between 3⁠1/7⁠ (approx. 3.1429) and 3⁠10/71⁠ (approx. 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-51) In the same treatise, he also asserts that the value of the [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") of 3 as lying between ⁠265/153⁠ (approximately 1.7320261) and ⁠1351/780⁠ (approximately 1.7320512), which he may have derived from a similar method.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-52)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Parabolic_segment_and_inscribed_triangle.svg/200px-Parabolic_segment_and_inscribed_triangle.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parabolic_segment_and_inscribed_triangle.svg)

A proof that the area of the [parabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola") segment in the upper figure is equal to 4/3 that of the inscribed triangle in the lower figure from _[Quadrature of the Parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature\_of\_the\_Parabola "Quadrature of the Parabola")_

In _[Quadrature of the Parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature\_of\_the\_Parabola "Quadrature of the Parabola")_, Archimedes used this technique to prove that the area enclosed by a [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola") and a straight line is ⁠4/3⁠ times the area of a corresponding inscribed [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") as shown in the figure at right, expressing the solution to the problem as an [infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)#History_of_the_theory_of_infinite_series "Series (mathematics)")[geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series "Geometric series") with the [common ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Common_ratio_r "Geometric series")⁠1/4⁠:[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTENetz2022139-53)

![Image 8: {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }4^{-n}=1+4^{-1}+4^{-2}+4^{-3}+\cdots ={4 \over 3}.\;}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a27b8944909dc6de31998c85104a4dfca51187cc)
If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller [secant lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line "Secant line"), and whose third vertex is where the line that is parallel to the parabola's axis and that passes through the midpoint of the base intersects the parabola, and so on. This proof uses a variation of the series [1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · ·](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1/4_%2B_1/16_%2B_1/64_%2B_1/256_%2B_%C2%B7_%C2%B7_%C2%B7 "1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · ·") which sums to⁠1/3⁠.

He also used this technique in order to measure the surface areas of a sphere and cone,[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-54) to calculate the area of an ellipse,[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-55) and to find the area contained within an [Archimedean spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral "Archimedean spiral").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-56)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAcerbi2018280-50)

### Mechanical method

> For it is more feasible, having already in one’s possession, through the method, of a knowledge of some sort of the matters under investigation, to provide the proof – rather than investigating it, knowing nothing.

In addition to developing on the works of earlier mathematicians with the method of exhaustion, Archimedes also pioneered a novel technique using the [law of the lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_lever "Law of the lever") in order to measure the area and volume of shapes using physical means. He first gives an outline of this proof in _Quadrature of the Parabola_ alongside the geometric proof, but he gives a fuller explanation in _[The Method of Mechanical Theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Method\_of\_Mechanical\_Theorems "The Method of Mechanical Theorems")_.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTENetz2022139-53) According to Archimedes, he proved the results in his mathematical treatises first using this method, and then worked backwards, applying the method of exhaustion only after he had already calculated an approximate value for the answer.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTENetz2022187-58)

### Large numbers

Archimedes also developed methods for representing large numbers.

In _[The Sand Reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sand\_Reckoner "The Sand Reckoner")_, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the [myriad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad "Myriad"),[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-59) the Greek term for the number 10,000, in order to calculate a number that was greater than the grains of sand needed to fill the universe. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million, i.e., 10,000 x 10,000) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 [vigintillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_large_numbers "Names of large numbers"), or 8×10 63.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-60) In doing so, he demonstrated that mathematics could represent arbitrarily large numbers.

In the _[Cattle Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27\_cattle\_problem "Archimedes' cattle problem")_, Archimedes challenges the mathematicians at the [Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria "Library of Alexandria") to count the numbers of cattle in the [Herd of the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cattle_of_Helios "The Cattle of Helios"), which involves solving a number of simultaneous [Diophantine equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation "Diophantine equation"). A more difficult version of the problem in which some of the answers are required to be [square numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number "Square number"), and the answer is a [very large number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_large_number "Very large number"), approximately 7.760271×10 206 544.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-61)

### Archimedean solid

In a lost work described by [Pappus of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria "Pappus of Alexandria"), Archimedes proved that there are exactly thirteen semiregular polyhedra.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTENetz2022133-62)

Front page of Archimedes' _Opera_, in Greek and Latin, edited by [David Rivault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rivault_de_Flurence "David Rivault de Flurence") (1615)

Archimedes made his work known through correspondence with mathematicians in [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria"),[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAcerbi2018-63) which were originally written in [Doric Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doric_Greek "Doric Greek"), the dialect of ancient Syracuse.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-64)

### Surviving works

The following are ordered chronologically based on new terminological and historical criteria set by Knorr (1978) and Sato (1986).[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-65)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-66)

#### _Measurement of a Circle_

This is a short work consisting of three propositions. It is written in the form of a correspondence with Dositheus of Pelusium, who was a student of [Conon of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conon_of_Samos "Conon of Samos"). In Proposition II, Archimedes gives an approximation of the value of pi (π), showing that it is greater than ⁠223/71⁠ (3.1408...) and less than ⁠22/7⁠ (3.1428...).

#### _The Sand Reckoner_

In this treatise, also known as _**Psammites**_, Archimedes finds a number that is greater than the [grains of sand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand "Sand") needed to fill the universe. This book mentions the [heliocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism "Heliocentrism") theory of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") proposed by [Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos"), as well as contemporary ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various [celestial bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_bodies "Celestial bodies"), and attempts to measure the apparent diameter of the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun").[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-67)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-:7-68) By using a system of numbers based on powers of the [myriad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad "Myriad"), Archimedes concludes that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8×10 63 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. _The Sand Reckoner_ is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-69)

Archimedes discusses astronomical measurements of the Earth, Sun, and Moon, as well as [Aristarchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos")' heliocentric model of the universe, in the _Sand-Reckoner_.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-70) Without the use of either trigonometry or a table of chords, Archimedes determines the Sun's apparent diameter by first describing the procedure and instrument used to make observations (a straight rod with pegs or grooves),[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-71) applying correction factors to these measurements, and finally giving the result in the form of upper and lower bounds to account for observational error.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-72)

[Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy"), quoting Hipparchus, also references Archimedes' [solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice "Solstice") observations in the _Almagest_. This would make Archimedes the first known Greek to have recorded multiple solstice dates and times in successive years.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-Acerbi2008-5)

#### _On the Equilibrium of Planes_

There are two books to _On the Equilibrium of Planes_: the first contains seven [postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") and fifteen [propositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition "Proposition"), while the second book contains ten propositions. In the first book, Archimedes proves the law of the [lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever "Lever"),[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-73) which states that:

> [Magnitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)") are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights.

Earlier descriptions of the principle of the lever are found in a work by [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") and in the _[Mechanical Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics\_(Aristotle) "Mechanics (Aristotle)"),_ belonging to the [Peripatetic school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripatetic_school "Peripatetic school") of the followers of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), the authorship of which has been attributed by some to [Archytas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archytas "Archytas").[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-lever_clagett-74)

Archimedes uses the principles derived to calculate the areas and [centers of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") of various geometric figures including [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle"), [parallelograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram") and [parabolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola").[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-works-75)

#### _Quadrature of the Parabola_

In this work of 24 propositions addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes proves by two methods that the area enclosed by a [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola") and a straight line is 4/3 the area of a [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") with equal base and height. He achieves this by two different methods: first by applying the [law of the lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_lever "Law of the lever"), and by calculating the value of a [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series "Geometric series") that sums to infinity with the [ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio") 1/4.

#### _On the Sphere and Cylinder_

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Esfera_Arqu%C3%ADmedes.svg/250px-Esfera_Arqu%C3%ADmedes.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Esfera_Arqu%C3%ADmedes.svg)

A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder including its bases

In this two-volume treatise addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes obtains the result of which he was most proud, namely the relationship between a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") and a [circumscribed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribe "Circumscribe")[cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry) "Cylinder (geometry)") of the same height and [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter "Diameter"). The volume is ⁠4/3⁠π _r_ 3 for the sphere, and 2 π _r_ 3 for the cylinder. The surface area is 4 π _r_ 2 for the sphere, and 6 π _r_ 2 for the cylinder (including its two bases), where _r_ is the radius of the sphere and cylinder.

#### _On Spirals_

This work of 28 propositions is also addressed to Dositheus. The treatise defines what is now called the [Archimedean spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral "Archimedean spiral"). It is the [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity"). Equivalently, in modern [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system "Polar coordinate system") (_r_, θ), it can be described by the equation ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \,r=a+b\theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d9168c1d8cb658b99ff96f53fae23efcb2a60a6b) with [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")a and b.

This is an early example of a [mechanical curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") (a curve traced by a moving [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)")) considered by a Greek mathematician.

#### _On Conoids and Spheroids_

This is a work in 32 propositions addressed to Dositheus. In this treatise Archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of [sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(geometry) "Cross section (geometry)") of [cones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry) "Cone (geometry)"), spheres, and paraboloids.

#### _On Floating Bodies_

There are two books of _On Floating Bodies_. In the first book, Archimedes spells out the law of [equilibrium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/equilibrium "wikt:equilibrium") of fluids and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-76)

This may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary Greek astronomers such as [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes "Eratosthenes") that the Earth is round.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The fluids described by Archimedes are not self-gravitating since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Archimedes' principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_principle "Archimedes' principle") of buoyancy is given in this work, stated as follows:[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-77)

> Any body wholly or partially immersed in fluid experiences an upthrust equal to, but opposite in direction to, the weight of the fluid displaced.

In the second part, he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water, similar to the way that icebergs float.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-78)

#### _Ostomachion_

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Stomachion.JPG/250px-Stomachion.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stomachion.JPG)

_[Ostomachion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostomachion "Ostomachion")_ is a [dissection puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_puzzle "Dissection puzzle") found in the [Archimedes Palimpsest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest "Archimedes Palimpsest")

Also known as **Loculus of Archimedes** or **Archimedes' Box**,[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-:1-79) this is a [dissection puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_puzzle "Dissection puzzle") similar to a [Tangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram "Tangram"), and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the [Archimedes Palimpsest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest "Archimedes Palimpsest"). Archimedes calculates the areas of the 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square "Square"). [Reviel Netz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reviel_Netz "Reviel Netz") of [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University") argued in 2003 that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-80) The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection are excluded.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-81) The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics").

The origin of the puzzle's name is unclear, and it has been suggested that it is taken from the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") word for "throat" or "gullet", _stomachos_ (στόμαχος).[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-82)[Ausonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausonius "Ausonius") calls the puzzle _Ostomachion_, a Greek compound word formed from the roots of _osteon_ (ὀστέον, 'bone') and _machē_ (μάχη, 'fight').[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-:1-79)

#### The cattle problem

In this work, addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria, Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the [Herd of the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cattle_of_Helios "The Cattle of Helios"), which involves solving a number of simultaneous [Diophantine equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation "Diophantine equation"). [Gotthold Ephraim Lessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing "Gotthold Ephraim Lessing") discovered this work in a Greek manuscript consisting of a 44-line poem in the [Herzog August Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzog_August_Library "Herzog August Library") in [Wolfenbüttel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenb%C3%BCttel "Wolfenbüttel"), Germany in 1773. There is a more difficult version of the problem in which some of the answers are required to be [square numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number "Square number"). A. Amthor first solved this version of the problem[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-83) in 1880, and the answer is a [very large number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_large_number "Very large number"), approximately 7.760271×10 206 544.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-84)

#### _The Method of Mechanical Theorems_

As with _[The Cattle Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27s\_cattle\_problem "Archimedes's cattle problem")_, _The Method of Mechanical Theorems_ was written in the form of a letter to [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes "Eratosthenes") in [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria").

In this work Archimedes uses a novel method, an early form of [Cavalieri's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalieri%27s_principle "Cavalieri's principle"),[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-ArchimedesCalc-85) to rederive the results from the treatises sent to Dositheus (_Quadrature of the Parabola_, _On the Sphere and Cylinder_, _On Spirals_, _On Conoids and Spheroids_) that he had previously used the [method of exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion "Method of exhaustion") to prove,[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTENetz2022131-86) using the [law of the lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_lever "Law of the lever") he applied in _On the Equilbrium of Planes_ in order to find the [center of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_gravity "Center of gravity") of an object first, and reasoning geometrically from there in order to more easily derive the volume of an object.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTENetz2022187%E2%80%93193-87) Archimedes states that he used this method to derive the results in the treatises sent to Dositheus before he proved them more rigorously with the method of exhaustion, stating that it is useful to know that a result is true before proving it rigorously, much as [Eudoxus of Cnidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus "Eudoxus of Cnidus") was aided in proving that the volume of a cone is one-third the volume of cylinder by knowing that [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus") had already asserted it to be true on the argument that this is true by the fact that the pyramid has one-third the rectangular prism of the same base.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTENetz2022150-151-88)

This treatise was thought lost until the discovery of the [Archimedes Palimpsest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest "Archimedes Palimpsest") in 1906.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-89)

### Apocryphal works

Archimedes' _[Book of Lemmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Lemmas "Book of Lemmas")_ or _Liber Assumptorum_ is a treatise with 15 propositions on the nature of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"). [T. L. Heath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._L._Heath "T. L. Heath") and [Marshall Clagett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Clagett "Marshall Clagett") argued that it cannot have been written by Archimedes in its current form,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The _Lemmas_ may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Other questionable attributions to Archimedes' work include the Latin poem _[Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen\_de\_ponderibus\_et\_mensuris "Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris")_ (4th or 5th century), which describes the use of a [hydrostatic balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium "Hydrostatic equilibrium"), to solve the problem of the crown, and the 12th-century text _[Mappae clavicula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mappae\_clavicula "Mappae clavicula")_, which contains instructions on how to perform [assaying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay "Assay") of metals by calculating their specific gravities.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-kingcrown-90)[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-91)

### Lost works

Many written works by Archimedes have not survived or are only extant in heavily edited fragments:[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTENetz2022133-135-92)[Pappus of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria "Pappus of Alexandria") mentions _On Sphere-Making_, as well as a work on [semiregular polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiregular_polyhedra "Semiregular polyhedra"), and another work on spirals, while [Theon of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theon_of_Alexandria "Theon of Alexandria") quotes a remark about [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction") from the now-lost _Catoptrica_. _Principles_, addressed to Zeuxippus, explained the number system used in _[The Sand Reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sand\_Reckoner "The Sand Reckoner")_; there are also _On Balances_; _On Centers of Gravity._[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTENetz2022133-135-92)

Scholars in the medieval Islamic world also attribute to Archimedes a formula for calculating the area of a triangle from the length of its sides, which today is known as [Heron's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula "Heron's formula") due to its first known appearance in the work of [Heron of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria") in the 1st century AD, and may have been proven in a lost work of Archimedes that is no longer extant.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-FOOTNOTENetz2022135-136-93)

### Archimedes Palimpsest

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Archimedes_Palimpsest.jpg/250px-Archimedes_Palimpsest.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Archimedes_Palimpsest.jpg)

In 1906, the Archimedes Palimpsest revealed works by Archimedes thought to have been lost

In 1906, the Danish professor [Johan Ludvig Heiberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Ludvig_Heiberg_(historian) "Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)") visited [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople "Constantinople") to examine a 174-page [goatskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatskin_(material) "Goatskin (material)")[parchment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment "Parchment") of prayers, written in the 13th century, after reading a short transcription published seven years earlier by [Papadopoulos-Kerameus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasios_Papadopoulos-Kerameus "Athanasios Papadopoulos-Kerameus").[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-:8-94)[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-95) He confirmed that it was indeed a [palimpsest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palimpsest "Palimpsest"), a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, a common practice in the Middle Ages, as [vellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellum "Vellum") was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th-century copies of previously lost treatises by Archimedes.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-:8-94)[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-96) The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of _On Floating Bodies_ in the original Greek. It is the only known source of _The Method of Mechanical Theorems_, referred to by [Suidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suda "Suda") and thought to have been lost forever. _Stomachion_ was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts.

The treatises in the Archimedes Palimpsest include:

*   _[On the Equilibrium of Planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On\_the\_Equilibrium\_of\_Planes "On the Equilibrium of Planes")_
*   _[On Spirals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On\_Spirals "On Spirals")_
*   _[Measurement of a Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement\_of\_a\_Circle "Measurement of a Circle")_
*   _[On the Sphere and Cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On\_the\_Sphere\_and\_Cylinder "On the Sphere and Cylinder")_
*   _[On Floating Bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On\_Floating\_Bodies "On Floating Bodies")_
*   _[The Method of Mechanical Theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Method\_of\_Mechanical\_Theorems "The Method of Mechanical Theorems")_
*   _[Stomachion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomachion "Stomachion")_
*   Speeches by the 4th century BC politician [Hypereides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypereides "Hypereides")
*   A commentary on [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s _[Categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories\_(Aristotle) "Categories (Aristotle)")_
*   Other works

The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On 29 October 1998, it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for a total of $2.2 million.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-97)[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-98) The palimpsest was stored at the [Walters Art Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walters_Art_Museum "Walters Art Museum") in [Baltimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore "Baltimore"), [Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland "Maryland"), where it was subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") and [X-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray")[light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") to read the overwritten text.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-99) It has since returned to its anonymous owner.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-100)[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-101)

Sometimes called the father of mathematics[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-102) and [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics"),[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-103) historians of science and mathematics almost universally agree that Archimedes was the finest mathematician from antiquity.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-104)

### Classical antiquity

The reputation that Archimedes had for mechanical inventions in classical antiquity is well-documented;[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-105)[Athenaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeus "Athenaeus")[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-106) recounts in his _[Deipnosophistae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deipnosophistae "Deipnosophistae")_ how Archimedes supervised the construction of the largest known ship in antiquity, the [Syracusia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracusia "Syracusia"), while [Apuleius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apuleius "Apuleius")[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-107) talks about his work in [catoptrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catoptrics "Catoptrics").[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-108)[Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch")[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-109) had claimed that Archimedes disdained mechanics and focused primarily on pure [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), but this is generally considered to be a mischaracterization by modern scholarship, fabricated to bolster Plutarch's own [Platonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism "Platonism") values rather than to an accurate presentation of Archimedes,[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-110) and, unlike his inventions, Archimedes' mathematical writings were little known in antiquity outside of the works of [Alexandrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria") mathematicians.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The first comprehensive compilation was not made until c. 530 AD by [Isidore of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Miletus "Isidore of Miletus") in [Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine "Byzantine")[Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople "Constantinople"),[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] while [Eutocius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutocius_of_Ascalon "Eutocius of Ascalon")' commentaries on Archimedes' works earlier in the same century opened them to wider readership for the first time.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Middle ages

Archimedes' work was translated into Arabic by [Thābit ibn Qurra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C4%81bit_ibn_Qurra "Thābit ibn Qurra") (836–901 AD), and into Latin via Arabic by [Gerard of Cremona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_of_Cremona "Gerard of Cremona") (c. 1114–1187). Direct Greek to Latin translations were later done by [William of Moerbeke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Moerbeke "William of Moerbeke") (c. 1215–1286) and [Iacobus Cremonensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iacopo_da_San_Cassiano "Iacopo da San Cassiano") (c. 1400–1453).[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-111)[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-112)

### Renaissance and early modern Europe

During the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_in_the_Renaissance "History of science in the Renaissance"), the _[Editio princeps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editio\_princeps "Editio princeps")_ (First Edition) was published in [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel "Basel") in 1544 by [Johann Herwagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Herwagen "Johann Herwagen") with the works of Archimedes in Greek and Latin,[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-113) which were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_in_the_Renaissance "History of science in the Renaissance") and again [in the 17th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution").[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-114)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-115)

[Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci") repeatedly expressed admiration for Archimedes, and attributed his invention [Architonnerre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architonnerre "Architonnerre") to Archimedes.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-Nelson_Examiner-116)[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-PennyM-117)[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-Thurston1996-118)[Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") called him "superhuman" and "my master",[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-119)[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-120) while [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") said, "I think Archimedes is comparable to no one", consciously emulating him in his early work.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-121)[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz") said, "He who understands Archimedes and [Apollonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga") will admire less the achievements of the foremost men of later times".[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-122)

Italian numismatist and archaeologist Filippo Paruta (1552–1629) and [Leonardo Agostini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Agostini "Leonardo Agostini") (1593–1676) reported on a bronze coin in Sicily with the portrait of Archimedes on the obverse and a cylinder and sphere with the monogram ARMD in Latin on the reverse.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-123) Although the coin is now lost and its date is not precisely known, [Ivo Schneider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Schneider "Ivo Schneider") described the reverse as "a sphere resting on a base – probably a rough image of one of the planetaria created by Archimedes," and suggested it might have been minted in Rome for Marcellus who "according to ancient reports, brought two spheres of Archimedes with him to Rome".[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-124)

### In modern mathematics

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/FieldsMedalFront.jpg/250px-FieldsMedalFront.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FieldsMedalFront.jpg)

The [Fields Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal "Fields Medal") carries a portrait of Archimedes

Gauss's heroes were Archimedes and Newton,[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-125) and [Moritz Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Cantor "Moritz Cantor"), who studied under Gauss in the [University of Göttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen "University of Göttingen"), reported that he once remarked in conversation that "there had been only three epoch-making mathematicians: Archimedes, Newton, and [Eisenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthold_Eisenstein "Gotthold Eisenstein")".[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-126) Likewise, [Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead "Alfred North Whitehead") said that "in the year 1500 Europe knew less than Archimedes who died in the year 212 BC."[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-127) The historian of mathematics [Reviel Netz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reviel_Netz "Reviel Netz"),[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-128) echoing Whitehead's proclamation on [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), said that "Western science is but a series of footnotes to Archimedes," calling him "the most important scientist who ever lived." and [Eric Temple Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Temple_Bell "Eric Temple Bell"),[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-129) wrote that "Any list of the three "greatest" mathematicians of all history would include the name of Archimedes. The other two usually associated with him are [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss"). Some, considering the relative wealth—or poverty—of mathematics and physical science in the respective ages in which these giants lived, and estimating their achievements against the background of their times, would put Archimedes first."

The discovery in 1906 of previously lost works by Archimedes in the [Archimedes Palimpsest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest "Archimedes Palimpsest") has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-130)[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-131)

The [Fields Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal "Fields Medal") for outstanding achievement in mathematics carries a portrait of Archimedes, along with a carving illustrating his proof on the sphere and the cylinder. The inscription around the head of Archimedes is a quote attributed to 1st century AD poet [Manilius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Manilius "Marcus Manilius"), which reads in Latin: _Transire suum pectus mundoque potiri_ ("Rise above oneself and grasp the world").[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-132)[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-133)[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-134)

### Cultural influence

The world's first seagoing [steamship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat "Steamboat") with a [screw propeller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller "Propeller") was the [SS _Archimedes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Archimedes "SS Archimedes"), which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-135)

Archimedes has also appeared on postage stamps issued by [East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany") (1973), [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece") (1983), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") (1983), [Nicaragua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua "Nicaragua") (1971), [San Marino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marino "San Marino") (1982), and [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") (1963).[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-136)

The exclamation of [Eureka!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(word) "Eureka (word)") attributed to Archimedes is the state motto of [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California"). In this instance, the word refers to the discovery of gold near [Sutter's Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutter%27s_Mill "Sutter's Mill") in 1848 which sparked the [California gold rush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_gold_rush "California gold rush").[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-137)

There is a [crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_crater "Impact crater") on the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") named [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_(crater) "Archimedes (crater)") ([29°42′N 4°00′W / 29.7°N 4.0°W](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Archimedes&params=29.7_N_4_W_)) in his honor, as well as a lunar [mountain range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range "Mountain range"), the [Montes Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montes_Archimedes "Montes Archimedes") ([25°18′N 4°36′W / 25.3°N 4.6°W](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Archimedes&params=25.3_N_4.6_W_)).[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#cite_note-138)
