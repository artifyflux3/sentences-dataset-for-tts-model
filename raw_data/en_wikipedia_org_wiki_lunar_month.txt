This article is about the definitions of a 'month' that are mainly of significance in astronomy. For other definitions, including a description of a month in the calendars of different cultures around the world, see [month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month "Month").

In [lunar calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar "Lunar calendar"), a **lunar month** is the time between two successive [syzygies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_(astronomy) "Syzygy (astronomy)") of the same type: [new moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_moon "New moon") or [full moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon "Full moon"). The precise definition varies, especially for the beginning of the month.

Animation of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") as it cycles through its phases, as seen from the Northern Hemisphere. The apparent wobbling of the Moon is known as [libration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libration "Libration").

In [Shona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shona_people "Shona people"), [Middle Eastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East"), and [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") traditions, the month starts when the [young crescent moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_moon "New moon") first becomes visible, at evening, after [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_conjunction "Astronomical conjunction") with the Sun one or two days before that evening (e.g., in the [Islamic calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar "Islamic calendar")). In [ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_calendar "Egyptian calendar"), the lunar month began on the day when the waning moon could no longer be seen just before sunrise.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTEParker19509%E2%80%9323-1) Others run from [full moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon "Full moon") to full moon.

Yet others use calculation, of varying degrees of sophistication, for example, the [Hebrew calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar "Hebrew calendar"), the [Chinese calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar "Chinese calendar"), or the [ecclesiastical lunar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus "Computus"). Calendars count integer days, so months may be 29 or 30 days in length, in some regular or irregular sequence. [Lunar cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Cycles "Lunar Cycles") are prominent, and calculated with great precision in the ancient Hindu [Panchangam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchangam "Panchangam") calendar, widely used in the Indian subcontinent.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In Indonesia, the month from conjunction to conjunction is divided into thirty parts known as _[tithi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithi "Tithi")_. A _tithi_ is between 19 and 26 hours long. The date is named after the _tithi_ ruling at sunrise. When the _tithi_ is shorter than the day, the _tithi_ may jump. This case is called _kṣaya_ or _lopa_. Conversely a _tithi_ may 'stall' as well, that is – the same _tithi_ is associated with two consecutive days. This is known as _vriddhi_.

In English [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law "Common law"), a "lunar month" traditionally meant exactly 28 days or four weeks, thus a contract for 12 months ran for exactly 48 weeks.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAngell184652-2) In the United Kingdom, the lunar month was formally replaced by the [calendar month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_month "Calendar month") for deeds and other written contracts by section 61(a) of the [Law of Property Act 1925](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Property_Act_1925 "Law of Property Act 1925") and for post-1850 legislation by the [Interpretation Act 1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_Act_1978 "Interpretation Act 1978") (Schedule 1 read with sections 5 and 23 and with Schedule 2 paragraph 4(1)(a)) and its predecessors.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTELaw1983405-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-4)

There are several types of lunar month. The term _lunar month_ usually refers to the [synodic month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#Synodic_month) because it is the cycle of the visible [phases of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase "Lunar phase").

Most of the following types of lunar month, except the distinction between the sidereal and tropical months, were first recognized in [Babylonian lunar astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_theory#Babylon "Lunar theory").

The **synodic month** ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): συνοδικός, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek "Romanization of Greek"):_synodikós_, meaning "pertaining to a synod, i.e., a meeting"; in this case, of the Sun and the Moon), also **lunation**, is the average period of the Moon's orbit with respect to the line joining the Sun and Earth: 29 (Earth) days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 2.9 seconds.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTESupplement1961107,_488-5) This is the period of the [lunar phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase "Lunar phase"), because the Moon's appearance depends on the position of the Moon with respect to the Sun as seen from Earth. Due to [tidal locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking "Tidal locking"), the same hemisphere of the Moon always faces the Earth and thus the length of a [lunar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_day "Lunar day") (sunrise to sunrise on the Moon) equals the time that the Moon takes to complete one [orbit around Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon "Orbit of the Moon"), returning to the same [lunar phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase "Lunar phase").

While the Moon is orbiting Earth, Earth is progressing in its orbit around the Sun. After completing its [§Sidereal month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#Sidereal_month), the Moon must move a little further to reach the new position having the same angular distance from the Sun, appearing to move with respect to the stars since the previous month. Consequently, at 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes and 11.5 seconds,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTESupplement1961107,_488-5) the sidereal month is about 2.2 days shorter than the synodic month. Thus, about 13.37 sidereal months, but about 12.37 synodic months, occur in a [Gregorian year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar").

Since [Earth's orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit "Earth's orbit") around the Sun is [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit "Elliptic orbit") and not [circular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit "Circular orbit"), the [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed "Orbital speed") of Earth's progression around the Sun varies during the year. Thus, the [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity") is faster nearer [periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapsis "Periapsis") and slower near [apoapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoapsis "Apoapsis"). The same is true (to an even larger extent) for the Moon's orbit around Earth. Because of these two variations in angular rate, the actual time between [lunations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunation "Lunation") may vary from about 29.274 days (or  29 d 6 h 35 min) to about 29.829 days (or 29 d 19 h 54 min.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-6) The average duration in modern times (mean synodic month) is 29.53059 days or 29 d 12 h 44 min 3 s, with up to seven hours variation about the mean in any given year.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTESeidelmann1992577-7)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-9) A more precise figure of the average duration may be derived for a specific date using the [lunar theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_theory "Lunar theory") of [Chapront-Touzé and Chapront (1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeride_Lunaire_Parisienne "Ephemeride Lunaire Parisienne"): 

29.5305888531 + 0.00000021621 _T_ − 3.64×10−10 _T_ 2 where _T_ = (JD − 2451545.0)/36525 and JD is the [Julian day number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day_number "Julian day number") (and JD = 2451545 corresponds to 1 January AD 2000).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChapront-Touz%C3%A9Chapront1988-10)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTESeidelmann1992576-11) The duration of synodic months in ancient and medieval history is itself a topic of scholarly study.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoldstein200365-12)

The period of the [Moon's orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon "Orbit of the Moon") as defined with respect to the [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere") of apparently [fixed stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_stars "Fixed stars") (the [International Celestial Reference Frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Celestial_Reference_Frame "International Celestial Reference Frame"); ICRF) is known as a **sidereal month** because it is the time it takes the Moon to return to a similar position among the [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _sidera_): 27.321 661 days (27 d 7 h 43 min 11.6 s).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang201257-13)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTESupplement1961107,_488-5)This type of month has been observed among cultures in the Middle East, India, and China in the following way: they divided the sky into 27 or 28 [lunar mansions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_station "Lunar station"), one for each day of the month, identified by the prominent star(s) in them.

Just as the [tropical year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year") is based on the amount of time between perceived rotations of the sun around the earth (based on the Greek word τροπή meaning "turn"), the tropical month is the average time between corresponding [equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox "Equinox").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTESupplement1961107,_488-5) It is also the average time between successive moments when the moon crosses from the southern celestial hemisphere to the northern (or vice versa), or successive crossing of a given [right ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension "Right ascension") or [ecliptic longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic_longitude "Ecliptic longitude").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-14) The moon rises at the North Pole once every tropical month, and likewise at the South Pole.

It is customary to specify positions of celestial bodies with respect to the [First Point of Aries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Point_of_Aries "First Point of Aries") (Sun's location at the [March equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox "March equinox")). Because of Earth's [precession of the equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession "Axial precession"), this point moves back slowly along the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic"). Therefore, it takes the Moon less time to return to an [ecliptic longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic_coordinate_system "Ecliptic coordinate system") of 0° than to the same point amid the [fixed stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_stars "Fixed stars").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-15) This slightly shorter period, 27.321 582 days (27 d 7 h 43 min 4.7 s), is commonly known as the **tropical month** by analogy with Earth's [tropical year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTESupplement1961107,_488-5)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang201257-13)

The [Moon's orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon "Orbit of the Moon") approximates an ellipse rather than a circle. However, the orientation (as well as the shape) of this orbit is not fixed. In particular, the position of the extreme points (the line of the [apsides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis "Apsis"): [perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perigee "Perigee") and [apogee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee "Apogee")), rotates once ([apsidal precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession "Apsidal precession")) in about 3,233 days (8.85 years). It takes the Moon longer to return to the same apsis because it has moved ahead during one revolution. This longer period is called the **anomalistic month**[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-16) and has an average length of 27.554 551 days (27 d 13 h 18 min 33.2 s). The [apparent diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_diameter "Apparent diameter") of the Moon varies with this period, so this type has some relevance for the prediction of [eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse "Eclipse") (see [Saros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saros_cycle "Saros cycle")), whose extent, duration, and appearance (whether total or annular) depend on the exact apparent diameter of the Moon. The apparent diameter of the [full moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon "Full moon") varies with the [full moon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon_cycle "Full moon cycle"), which is the beat period of the synodic and anomalistic month, as well as the period after which the apsides point to the Sun again.

An anomalistic month is longer than a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the [same direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prograde_motion "Prograde motion") as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in about 8.85 years. Therefore, the Moon takes a little longer to return to perigee than to return to the same star.

A **draconic month** or **draconitic month**[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-Linton2004-17) is also known as a **nodal month** or **nodical month**.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-Lockyer1870-18) The name _draconic_ refers to a mythical [dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon "Dragon"), said to live in the [lunar nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_node "Lunar node") and eat the Sun or Moon during an [eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse "Eclipse").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinton20047-19) A solar or lunar eclipse is possible only when the Moon is at or near either of the two points where its orbit crosses the [ecliptic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic_plane "Ecliptic plane"); i.e., the satellite is at or near either of its [orbital nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_node "Orbital node").

The orbit of the Moon lies in a plane that is [inclined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination "Orbital inclination") about 5.14° with respect to the ecliptic plane. The line of intersection of these planes passes through the two points at which the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic plane: the _ascending node_ and the _descending node_.

The draconic or nodical month is the average interval between two successive transits of the Moon through the same [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_node "Lunar node"). Because of the [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque") exerted by the Sun's gravity on the [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") of the Earth–Moon system, the plane of the Moon's orbit [gradually rotates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_precession "Lunar precession") westward, which means the nodes gradually rotate around Earth. As a result, the time it takes the Moon to return to the same node is shorter than a sidereal month, lasting 27.212 220 days (27 d 5 h 5 min 35.8 s).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-20) The line of nodes of the Moon's orbit [precesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession "Nodal precession") 360° in about 6,793 days (18.6 years).[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-21)

A draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month because the nodes precess in the [opposite direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion "Retrograde motion") to that in which the Moon is orbiting Earth, one rotation every 18.6 years. Therefore, the Moon returns to the same node slightly earlier than it returns to meet the same reference star.

Regardless of the culture, all lunar calendar months approximate the mean length of the synodic month, the average period the Moon takes to cycle through [its phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase "Lunar phase") ([new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_moon "New moon"), first quarter, [full](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon "Full moon"), last quarter) and back again: 29–30[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-22)[days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day "Day"). The Moon completes one orbit around Earth every 27.3 days (a sidereal month), but due to [Earth's orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit "Earth's orbit") motion around the Sun, the Moon does not yet finish a synodic cycle until it has reached the point in [its orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon "Orbit of the Moon") where the Sun is in the same [relative position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_of_the_Sun "Position of the Sun").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-23)

This table lists the average lengths of five types of astronomical lunar month, derived from [Chapront, Chapront-Touzé & Francou 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#CITEREFChaprontChapront-Touz%C3%A9Francou2002). These are not constant, so a first-order (linear) approximation of the [secular change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_variation "Secular variation") is provided.

Valid for the [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy) "Epoch (astronomy)")[J2000.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2000.0 "J2000.0") (1 January 2000 12:00 [TT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time "Terrestrial Time")):

| Month type | Length in days |
| --- | --- |
| draconitic | 27.212 220 815 + 4.14×10−6 × _T_ |
| tropical | 27.321 582 252 + 1.82×10−7 × _T_ |
| sidereal | 27.321 661 554 + 2.17×10−7 × _T_ |
| anomalistic | 27.554 549 886 − 1.007×10−6 × _T_ |
| synodic | 29.530 588 861 + 2.52×10−7 × _T_ |

_Note:_ In this table, time is expressed in [Ephemeris Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris_Time "Ephemeris Time") (more precisely [Terrestrial Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time "Terrestrial Time")) with days of 86,400 [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI")[seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"). _T_ is centuries since the epoch (2000), expressed in [Julian centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_year_(astronomy) "Julian year (astronomy)") of 36,525 days. For calendrical calculations, one would probably use days measured in the time scale of [Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time "Universal Time"), which follows the somewhat unpredictable rotation of the Earth, and progressively accumulates a difference with ephemeris time called [ΔT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94T_(timekeeping) "ΔT (timekeeping)") ("delta-T").

Apart from the long term (millennial) drift in these values, all these periods vary continually around their mean values because of the complex [orbital effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy) "Perturbation (astronomy)") of the Sun and planets affecting its motion.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-24)

The periods are derived from polynomial expressions for [Delaunay's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-Eug%C3%A8ne_Delaunay "Charles-Eugène Delaunay") arguments used in [lunar theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_theory "Lunar theory"), as listed in Table 4 of [Chapront, Chapront-Touzé & Francou (2002)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#CITEREFChaprontChapront-Touz%C3%A9Francou2002)

_W_ 1 is the ecliptic longitude of the Moon with regard to the fixed ICRS equinox: its period is the _sidereal_ month. If we add the [rate of precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession#Values "Axial precession") to the sidereal angular velocity, we get the angular velocity with regard to the equinox of the date: its period is the _tropical_ month (which is rarely used). _l_ is the mean anomaly: its period is the _anomalistic_ month. _F_ is the argument of latitude: its period is the _draconic_ month. _D_ is the elongation of the Moon from the Sun: its period is the _synodic_ month.

Derivation of a period from a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") for an argument _A_ (angle):

![Image 2: {\displaystyle A=A_{0}+(A_{1}\times T)+(A_{2}\times T^{2})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7d29faebf34682bd37c2bb80b4d741b3e60e5fac);

_T_ in centuries (cy) is 36,525 days from [epoch J2000.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy)#J2000 "Epoch (astronomy)").

The angular velocity is the first derivative:

![Image 3: {\displaystyle \operatorname {d} \!A/\operatorname {d} \!t=A'=A_{1}+(2\times A_{2}\times T)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/90c270025408526ee57081cf2e6b0a70c8a80acd).

The period (_Q_) is the inverse of the angular velocity:

![Image 4: {\displaystyle Q={1 \over A'}={1 \over A_{1}+(2\times A_{2}\times T)}={1 \over A_{1}}\times {1 \over 1+(2\times {A_{2} \over A_{1}}\times T)}={1 \over A_{1}}\times (1-2\times {A_{2} \over A_{1}}\times T)={1 \over A_{1}}-(2\times {A_{2} \over (A_{1}\times A_{1})}\times T)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b30712d0cd7957769bf4a8d87ba169a871ce9ff),

ignoring higher-order terms.

_A_ 1 in ″/cy; _A_ 2 in ″/cy 2; so the result _Q_ is expressed in cy/″, which is a very inconvenient unit.

1 revolution (rev) is 360° × 60′ × 60″ = 1,296,000″; to convert the unit of the velocity to revolutions/day, divide _A_ 1 by _B_ 1 = 1,296,000 × 36,525 = 47,336,400,000; _C_ 1 = _B_ 1 ÷ _A_ 1 is then the period (in days/revolution) at the epoch J2000.0.

For rev/day 2 divide _A_ 2 by _B_ 2 = 1,296,000 × 36,525 2 = 1,728,962,010,000,000.

For ![Image 5: {\displaystyle A_{2}\div (A_{1}\times A_{1})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39e2ff9dd918d25a478c17ebe474419488c7ba03) the numerical conversion factor then becomes 2 × _B_ 1 × _B_ 1 ÷ _B_ 2 = 2 × 1,296,000. This would give a linear term in days change (of the period) per day, which is also an inconvenient unit: for change per year multiply by a factor 365.25, and for change per century multiply by a factor 36,525. _C_ 2 = 2 × 1,296,000 × 36,525 × _A_ 2 ÷ (_A_ 1 × _A_ 1).

Then period _P_ in days:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle P=C_{1}-C_{2}\times T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8875193a0640c6ce8c28cdfcd8bf98df38e9b09).

Example for synodic month, from Delaunay's argument _D_: _D_′ = 1602961601.0312 − 2 × 6.8498 × _T_″/cy; _A_ 1 = 1602961601.0312″/cy; _A_ 2 = −6.8498″/cy 2; _C_ 1 = 47,336,400,000 ÷ 1,602,961,601.0312 = 29.530588860986 days; _C_ 2 = 94,672,800,000 × −6.8498 ÷ (1,602,961,601.0312 × 1,602,961,601.0312) = −0.00000025238 days/cy.

In 2004 the variations were from 29 d 15 h 35 min in May to 29 d 10 h 34 min in December.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-8)
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_ref-Linton2004_17-0)**In medieval times, the part of the Moon's orbit south of the ecliptic was known as the 'dragon' (which devoured the Moon during eclipses) and from this we get the terminology 'dragon's head' for the ascending node and 'dragon's tail' for the descending node. … The periods between successive nodes has, over time, been termed the dracontic, draconic and draconitic month, the words deriving from the Greek for 'dragon'.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinton20047-19)
