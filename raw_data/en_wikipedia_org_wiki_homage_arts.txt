[ 1 ] The term is often used in the arts , where one author or artist shows respect to another by allusion or imitation; this is often spelled like and pronounced similar to the original French hommage ( / oʊ ˈ m ɑː ʒ / ).

[ 2 ] Description [ edit ] It was originally a declaration of fealty in the feudal system – swearing that one was the man (French: homme ), or subordinate, of the feudal lord.

[ 3 ] The concept then became used figuratively for an acknowledgement of quality or superiority. For example, a man might give homage to a lady, so honouring her beauty and other graces. In German scholarship, followers of a great scholar developed the custom of honouring their mentor by producing papers for a festschrift dedicated to him.

[ 4 ] In music, homage can take the form of a composition ( Homage to Paderewski ), a tribute album ( Homage to Charles Parker ) or a sample .

[ 5 ] Digital techniques used to generate many forms of media make it easy to borrow from other works, and this remediation may be used in homage to them.
