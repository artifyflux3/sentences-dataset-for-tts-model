My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love by Dmitri Vrubel on Berlin Wall , 1991 Stalin Monument In The Hague by Komar and Melamid Often referred to as “Soviet Pop Art”, Sots Art or soc art ( Russian : Соц-арт ,  short for Socialist Art) originated in the Soviet Union in the early 1970s as a reaction against the official aesthetic doctrine of the state— socialist realism , which was marked by reverential depictions of workers, peasants living happily in their communes.

Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid are credited with the invention of the term "Sots Art"; in an analogy with the Western pop art movement, which incorporated the kitchy elements of the Western mass culture , sots art capitalized on the imagery of the Socialist mass culture.

[ 1 ] According to Arthur Danto , Sots Art's attack on official styles is similar in intent to American pop art and German capitalist realism .
