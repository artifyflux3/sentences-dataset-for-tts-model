[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The history of Rizza manifolds follows the history of the structure that such objects carry. According to Shoshichi Kobayashi ( 1975 ), the geometry of complex Finsler structures was first studied in Rizza's 1964 paper "F-forme quadratiche ed hermitiane", but Rizza announced his results nearly two years before, in the short communications ( Rizza 1962a ) and ( Rizza 1962b ), proving them in the article ( Rizza 1963 ), nearly one year earlier than the one cited by Kobayashi. Rizza called this differential geometric structure, defined on even-dimensional manifolds , "Struttura di Finsler quasi Hermitiana": [ 3 ] his motivation for the introduction of the concept seems to be the aim of comparing two different structures existing on the same manifold.

[ 4 ] Later Ichijyō (1988 , p. 1) started calling this structure " Rizza structure ", and manifolds carrying it " Rizza manifolds ".

[ 1 ] Formal definition [ edit ] The content of this paragraph closely follows references ( Rizza 1963 ) and ( Ichijyō 1988 ), borrowing the scheme of notation equally from both sources. Precisely, given a differentiable manifold M {\displaystyle M} and one of its points x ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} , T M {\displaystyle TM} is the tangent bundle of M {\displaystyle M} ; T x M {\displaystyle T_{x}M} is the tangent space at x {\displaystyle x} ; Definition 1.

Let M {\displaystyle M} be a 2 n {\displaystyle 2n} - dimensional Finsler manifold , n ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle n\geq 1} , and let F : T M → → R {\displaystyle F:TM\to \mathbb {R} } its Finsler function. If the condition (1) F ( x , c y ) = | c | F ( x , y ) ∀ ∀ c ∈ ∈ C , x ∈ ∈ M , y ∈ ∈ T x M {\displaystyle F(x,cy)=|c|F(x,y)\qquad \forall c\in \mathbb {C} ,\quad x\in M,\quad y\in T_{x}M} holds true, then M {\displaystyle M} is a Rizza manifold .
