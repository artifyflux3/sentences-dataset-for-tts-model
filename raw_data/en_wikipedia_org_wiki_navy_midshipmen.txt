The academy sponsors 36 varsity sports teams and 12 club sport teams.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Both men's and women's teams are called Navy Midshipmen or Mids .

[ 4 ] They participate in the NCAA 's Division I , as a non-football member of the Patriot League , a football-only member of the American Athletic Conference in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), and a member of the Collegiate Sprint Football League (men), Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (men), Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges , Eastern Intercollegiate Gymnastics League (men), Mid-Atlantic Squash Conference (men) and Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association . Navy is also one of approximately 300 members of the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).

The most important sporting event at the academy is the annual Army–Navy Game . The 2014 season marked Navy's 13th consecutive victory over Army. The three major service academies ( Navy , Air Force , and Army ) compete for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy , which is awarded to the academy that defeats the others in football that year (or retained by the previous winner in the event of a three-way tie).

Participation in athletics is, in general, mandatory at the Naval Academy and most Midshipmen not on an intercollegiate team must participate actively in intramural or club sports. There are exceptions for non-athletic Brigade Support Activities such as YP Squadron (a professional surface warfare training activity providing midshipmen the opportunity to earn the Craftmaster Badge ) or the Drum and Bugle Corps .

Varsity-letter winners wear a specially-issued blue cardigan with a large gold "N" patch affixed. If they belong to a team that beats Army in any sport designated "Star" competition, they are also awarded a gold star ("N-Star") to affix near the "N" for each such victory.

[ 16 ] Football [ edit ] Main article: Navy Midshipmen football Navy celebrates winning the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy after winning the 2005 Army–Navy Game on December 3, 2005 The Naval Academy's football program is one of the nation's oldest, with its history dating back to 1879.

[ 17 ] There were two separate efforts to establish a Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment to help keep the school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that made it much closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it.

[ 18 ] The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful in its efforts. Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy.

[ 19 ] A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team would wake up and practice before reveille and following drill and meals. The squad received encouragement from some of the faculty, who allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the school superintendent, who had banned football and similar activities.
