For a list of eponymous statutes, see List of legislation named for a person .

This list of eponymous laws provides links to articles on laws , principles , adages , and other succinct observations or predictions named after a person. In some cases the person named has coined the law – such as Parkinson's law . In others, the work or publications of the individual have led to the law being so named – as is the case with Moore's law . There are also laws ascribed to individuals by others, such as Murphy's law ; or given eponymous names despite the absence of the named person. Named laws range from significant scientific laws such as Newton's laws of motion, to humorous examples such as Murphy's law.

Mendel's first law, or the law of segregation, states that each organism has a pair of genes ; that it inherits one from each parent, and that the organism will pass down only one of these genes to its own offspring. These different copies of the same gene are called alleles . Mendel's second law, the law of independent assortment, states that different traits will be inherited independently by the offspring.

*This concept only applies to adults, as the presence of fontanelles and open suture lines in infants that have not yet fused means there is potential for a change in size and intracranial volume.
