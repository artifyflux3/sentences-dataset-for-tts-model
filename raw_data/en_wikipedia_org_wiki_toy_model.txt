Find sources: "Toy model" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In scientific modeling , a toy model is a deliberately simplistic model with many details removed so that it can be used to explain a mechanism concisely. It is also useful in a description of the fuller model.

In toy mathematical models used in mathematical physics , this is usually done by reducing or extending the number of dimensions or reducing the number of fields/variables or restricting them to a particular symmetric form.

In toy economic models , some may be only loosely based on theory, others more explicitly so. They allow for a quick first pass at some question, and present the essence of the answer from a more complicated model or from a class of models. For the researcher, they may come before writing a more elaborate model, or after, once the elaborate model has been worked out. Blanchard's list of examples includes the IS–LM model , the Mundell–Fleming model , the RBC model , and the New Keynesian model .

[ 1 ] The phrase " tinker-toy model " is also used, [ citation needed ] in reference to the Tinkertoys product used for children's constructivist learning .

Examples [ edit ] Examples of toy models in physics include: the Ising model as a toy model for ferromagnetism , or lattice models more generally. It is the simplest model that allows for Euclidean quantum field theory in statistical physics .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Newtonian orbital mechanics as described by assuming that Earth is attached to the Sun by an elastic band; the Schwarzschild metric , general relativistic model describing a single symmetrical non-rotating non-charged concentration of mass (such as a perfect spherical mass): a simple relativistic "equivalent" of the classical symmetric Newtonian mass (in fact, the first solution of the Einstein field equations to be developed); Hawking radiation around a black hole described as conventional radiation from a fictitious membrane at radius r = 2m (the black hole membrane paradigm ); frame-dragging around a rotating star considered as the effect of space being a conventional viscous fluid ; the null dust ; the Gödel metric in general relativity, which allows closed timelike curves ; the Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, in which general relativistic effects of structure formation are not taken into account.

[ 5 ] the empty universe , a simple expanding universe model; the Bohr model of the atom, a "semi-classical" quantum mechanical model of the atom, which can be solved exactly for the hydrogen atom; the particle in a box in quantum mechanics; the Spekkens model , a hidden-variable theory ; the primon gas , which illustrates some connections between number theory and physics.
