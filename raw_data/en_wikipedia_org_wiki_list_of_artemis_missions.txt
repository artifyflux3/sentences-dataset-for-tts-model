US deep space exploration programs Emblem of the Artemis program The Artemis program is a human spaceflight program by the United States . The Artemis program is intended to reestablish a human presence on the Moon for the first time since Apollo 17 in 1972; mid-term objectives include establishing an international expedition team, and a sustainable human presence on the Moon. Long-term objectives for Artemis are laying the foundations for the extraction of lunar resources, and eventually making crewed missions to Mars and beyond feasible.

To date, missions in the program are aimed at exploration of the Moon , including crewed and robotic exploration of the lunar surface. These explorations will be more focused towards areas such as the lunar poles and the far side of the moon . Three flights of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle are currently planned for launch in the Artemis program in the early 2020s, beginning with Artemis 1 . Before Artemis was named, the flights were referred to as "Orion missions". Numerous supporting scientific and technology demonstration missions are planned for launch under the program's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS), in addition to planned and proposed uncrewed logistical missions to construct and resupply the Gateway and its expendable and reusable lunar landers in lunar orbit .

Main missions [ edit ] Mission Launch date Crew Launch vehicle [ a ] Launch pad Duration [ b ] EFT-1 5 December 2014 — Uncrewed mission Delta IV Heavy Cape Canaveral Space Force Station , SLC-37B 4h24m (success) Exploration Flight Test 1, high apogee high reentry test, carrying an uncrewed Orion capsule on its first spaceflight Artemis I 16 November 2022 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] — Uncrewed mission SLS Block 1 Crew Kennedy Space Center , LC-39B 25.5d (success) Maiden flight of the SLS, formerly "Exploration Mission 1" (EM1), carrying an uncrewed Orion capsule and ten CubeSats selected through several programs.

[ 20 ] Surface missions [ edit ] Peregrine (left) and Nova-C (right) will be the first two robotic landers to directly support the Artemis program.

The Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program will support the Artemis program by landing several small payloads focused on scouting for lunar resources , in situ resource utilization (ISRU) experiments and lunar science, in preparation for an extended human presence on the lunar surface.

[ 25 ] However, the spacecraft was unable to reach the moon because of a propellant leak. It burned up over the Pacific Ocean on 18 January.

[ 26 ] IM-1 15 February 2024 Intuitive Machines Nova-C Eaglecam Kennedy Space Center , LC-39A Falcon 9 7 days [ 27 ] The lander carried six NASA-sponsored instruments, as well as six payloads from other customers, including EagleCAM.

[ 28 ] The Odysseus lander successfully touched down at Malapert A near the lunar south pole on 22 February 2024.

[ 29 ] The mission ended after 7 days with the onset of lunar night, after which no further signals from the spacecraft were received.

[ 30 ] Blue Ghost M1 15 January 2025 Firefly Aerospace Blue Ghost Kennedy Space Center , LC-39A Falcon 9 5 months, 9 days [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The Blue Ghost lander launched on 15 January 2025 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and successfully landed in the Mare Crisium on 2 March 2025, thus becoming only the second commercial mission to achieve a successful moon landing.

[ 34 ] IM-2 27 February 2025 Intuitive Machines Nova-C Micro-Nova Gracie AstroAnt MAPP LV1 Yaoki Kennedy Space Center , LC-39A Falcon 9 12 hours (Partial failure) [ 35 ] The mission successfully launched on 27 February 2025 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and landed at lunar south pole in Mons Mouton on 6 March 2024.

[ 36 ] However, the lander tipped after touchdown, preventing any meaningful scientific experiments from being performed.

[ 37 ] On March 13, Intuitive Machines shared that, like on the IM-1 mission, the Athena 's altimeter had failed during landing, leaving its onboard computer without an accurate altitude reading. As a result, the spacecraft struck a plateau, tipped over, and skidded across the lunar surface, rolling once or twice before settling inside the crater. The company's CEO compared it to a baseball player sliding into a base. During the slide, the spacecraft rolled once or twice, before coming to rest inside the crater. The impact also kicked up regolith that coated the solar panels in dust, further degrading their performance.
