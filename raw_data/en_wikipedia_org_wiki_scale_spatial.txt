Spatial scale is a specific application of the term scale for describing or categorizing (e.g. into orders of magnitude ) the size of a space (hence spatial ), or the extent of it at which a phenomenon or process occurs.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] For instance, in physics an object or phenomenon can be called microscopic if too small to be visible. In climatology , a micro-climate is a climate which might occur in a mountain , valley or near a lake shore. In statistics , a megatrend is a political, social, economical, environmental or technological trend which involves the whole planet or is supposed to last a very large amount of time. The concept is also used in geography , astronomy , and meteorology .

[ 3 ] These divisions are somewhat arbitrary; where, on this table, mega- is assigned global scope, it may only apply continentally or even regionally in other contexts. The interpretations of meso- and macro- must then be adjusted accordingly.

This animation gives a sense of the awe-inspiring scale of some of the known objects in our universe.
