Started in the 1950s, they are usually found in churches, theatres , and cinemas.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Cry rooms are often designed with soundproofing properties to dampen the sounds made within. Many are equipped with a speaker system to allow the occupants to continue listening to the presentation in the main space, be it a church service or performance in a theatre.

[ 4 ] Some churches have cry rooms for when a child becomes "out of control, disruptive enough to distract people, or makes it hard for others to hear or contemplate".

[ 5 ] Cry rooms are used in theatres and cinemas to allow a child to be taken out of the main auditorium while still allowing the accompanying adult to watch the performance.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] There are hardly any cry rooms anymore, particularly in cinemas, which is mainly due to the rise of multiplex theaters beginning in the 1970s.
