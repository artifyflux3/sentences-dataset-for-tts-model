**Geostatistics** is a branch of [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") focusing on spatial or [spatiotemporal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime")[datasets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataset "Dataset"). Developed originally to predict [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution") of [ore grades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore_grade "Ore grade") for [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining "Mining") operations,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-1) it is currently applied in diverse disciplines including [petroleum geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_geology "Petroleum geology"), [hydrogeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogeology "Hydrogeology"), [hydrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology "Hydrology"), [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"), [oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography "Oceanography"), [geochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemistry "Geochemistry"), [geometallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometallurgy "Geometallurgy"), [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography"), [forestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry "Forestry"), [environmental control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_control "Environmental control"), [landscape ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_ecology "Landscape ecology"), [soil science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_science "Soil science"), and [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture") (esp. in [precision farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_farming "Precision farming")). Geostatistics is applied in varied branches of [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography"), particularly those involving the spread of diseases ([epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology "Epidemiology")), the practice of commerce and military planning ([logistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics "Logistics")), and the development of efficient [spatial networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_network "Spatial network"). Geostatistical algorithms are incorporated in many places, including [geographic information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_systems "Geographic information systems") (GIS).

Geostatistics is intimately related to interpolation methods but extends far beyond simple interpolation problems. Geostatistical techniques rely on statistical models based on random function (or [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable "Random variable")) theory to model the uncertainty associated with spatial estimation and simulation.

A number of simpler interpolation methods/algorithms, such as [inverse distance weighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_distance_weighting "Inverse distance weighting"), [bilinear interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation "Bilinear interpolation") and [nearest-neighbor interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_interpolation "Nearest-neighbor interpolation"), were already well known before geostatistics.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-IandS1989-2) Geostatistics goes beyond the interpolation problem by considering the studied phenomenon at unknown locations as a set of correlated random variables.

Let _Z_(**x**) be the value of the variable of interest at a certain location **x**. This value is unknown (e.g., temperature, rainfall, [piezometric level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometric_surface "Potentiometric surface"), geological facies, etc.). Although there exists a value at location **x** that could be measured, geostatistics considers this value as random since it was not measured or has not been measured yet. However, the randomness of _Z_(**x**) is not complete. Still, it is defined by a [cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function "Cumulative distribution function") (CDF) that depends on certain information that is known about the value _Z_(**x**):

![Image 1: {\displaystyle F({\mathit {z}},\mathbf {x} )=\operatorname {Prob} \lbrace Z(\mathbf {x} )\leqslant {\mathit {z}}\mid {\text{information}}\rbrace .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dd35df17b8ab1932e8902d52ddc16d38a8edbfbd)
Typically, if the value of _Z_ is known at locations close to **x** (or in the [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)") of **x**) one can constrain the CDF of _Z_(**x**) by this neighborhood: if a high spatial continuity is assumed, _Z_(**x**) can only have values similar to the ones found in the neighborhood. Conversely, in the absence of spatial continuity _Z_(**x**) can take any value. The spatial continuity of the random variables is described by a model of spatial continuity that can be either a parametric function in the case of [variogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram "Variogram")-based geostatistics, or have a non-parametric form when using other methods such as [multiple-point simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Multiple-point_simulation&action=edit&redlink=1 "Multiple-point simulation (page does not exist)")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-3) or [pseudo-genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pseudo-genetic&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pseudo-genetic (page does not exist)") techniques.

By applying a single spatial model on an entire domain, one makes the assumption that _Z_ is a [stationary process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process "Stationary process"). It means that the same statistical properties are applicable on the entire domain. Several geostatistical methods provide ways of relaxing this stationarity assumption.

In this framework, one can distinguish two modeling goals:

1.   [Estimating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory "Estimation theory") the value for _Z_(**x**), typically by the [expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value "Expected value"), the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median "Median") or the [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics) "Mode (statistics)") of the CDF _f_(_z_,**x**). This is usually denoted as an estimation problem.
2.   [Sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics) "Sampling (statistics)") from the entire probability density function _f_(_z_,**x**) by actually considering each possible outcome of it at each location. This is generally done by creating several alternative maps of _Z_, called realizations. Consider a domain discretized in _N_ grid nodes (or pixels). Each realization is a sample of the complete _N_-dimensional joint distribution function

![Image 2: {\displaystyle F(\mathbf {z} ,\mathbf {x} )=\operatorname {Prob} \lbrace Z(\mathbf {x} _{1})\leqslant z_{1},Z(\mathbf {x} _{2})\leqslant z_{2},...,Z(\mathbf {x} _{N})\leqslant z_{N}\rbrace .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f56338be72352419af1ef8a6fe59645f88d36fe9)In this approach, the presence of multiple solutions to the interpolation problem is acknowledged. Each realization is considered as a possible scenario of what the real variable could be. All associated workflows are then considering ensemble of realizations, and consequently ensemble of predictions that allow for probabilistic forecasting. Therefore, geostatistics is often used to generate or update spatial models when solving [inverse problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem "Inverse problem").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-5)
A number of methods exist for both geostatistical estimation and multiple realizations approaches. Several reference books provide a comprehensive overview of the discipline.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-IandS1989-2)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-15)

Kriging is a group of geostatistical techniques to interpolate the value of a random field (e.g., the elevation, z, of the landscape as a function of the geographic location) at an unobserved location from observations of its value at nearby locations.

#### Bayesian estimation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geostatistics&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Bayesian estimation")]

Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem "Bayes' theorem") is used to update a probability model as more evidence or information becomes available. Bayesian inference is playing an increasingly important role in geostatistics.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-16) Bayesian estimation implements kriging through a spatial process, most commonly a [Gaussian process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process "Gaussian process"), and updates the process using [Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_Theorem "Bayes' Theorem") to calculate its posterior. High-dimensional Bayesian geostatistics.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-17)

#### Finite difference method

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geostatistics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Finite difference method")]

Considering the principle of conservation of probability, recurrent difference equations (finite difference equations) were used in conjunction with lattices to compute probabilities quantifying uncertainty about the geological structures. This procedure is a numerical alternative method to Markov chains and Bayesian models.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics#cite_note-18)
