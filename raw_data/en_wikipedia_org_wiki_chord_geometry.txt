For other uses, see Chord (disambiguation) .

Common lines and line segments on a circle, including a chord in blue A chord (from the Latin chorda , meaning "catgut or string") of a circle is a straight line segment whose endpoints both lie on a circular arc . If a chord were to be extended infinitely on both directions into a line , the object is a secant line . The perpendicular line passing through the chord's midpoint is called sagitta (Latin for "arrow").

More generally, a chord is a line segment joining two points on any curve , for instance, on an ellipse . A chord that passes through a circle's center point is the circle's diameter .

In circles [ edit ] Main article: Circle § Chord Among properties of chords of a circle are the following: Chords are equidistant from the center if and only if their lengths are equal.

Equal chords are subtended by equal angles from the center of the circle.

A chord that passes through the center of a circle is called a diameter and is the longest chord of that specific circle.

If the line extensions (secant lines) of chords AB and CD intersect at a point P, then their lengths satisfy AP·PB = CP·PD ( power of a point theorem ).

In conics [ edit ] The midpoints of a set of parallel chords of a conic are collinear ( midpoint theorem for conics ).

[ 1 ] In trigonometry [ edit ] Chords were used extensively in the early development of trigonometry . The first known trigonometric table, compiled by Hipparchus in the 2nd century BC, is no longer extant but tabulated the value of the chord function for every ⁠7 + 1 / 2 ⁠ degrees .  In the 2nd century AD, Ptolemy compiled a more extensive table of chords in his book on astronomy , giving the value of the chord for angles ranging from ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ to 180 degrees by increments of ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ degree. Ptolemy used a circle of diameter 120, and gave chord lengths accurate to two sexagesimal (base sixty) digits after the integer part.

[ 2 ] The chord function is defined geometrically as shown in the picture. The chord of an angle is the length of the chord between two points on a unit circle separated by that central angle . The angle θ is taken in the positive sense and must lie in the interval 0 < θ ≤ π (radian measure). The chord function can be related to the modern sine function, by taking one of the points to be (1,0), and the other point to be ( cos θ , sin θ ), and then using the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the chord length: [ 2 ] crd ⁡ ⁡ θ θ = ( 1 − − cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) 2 + sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ = 2 − − 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ = 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( θ θ 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {crd} \theta ={\sqrt {(1-\cos \theta )^{2}+\sin ^{2}\theta }}={\sqrt {2-2\cos \theta }}=2\sin \left({\frac {\theta }{2}}\right).} [ 3 ] The last step uses the half-angle formula . Much as modern trigonometry is built on the sine function, ancient trigonometry was built on the chord function. Hipparchus is purported to have written a twelve-volume work on chords, all now lost, so presumably, a great deal was known about them. In the table below (where c is the chord length, and D the diameter of the circle) the chord function can be shown to satisfy many identities analogous to well-known modern ones: Name Sine-based Chord-based Pythagorean sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ + cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ = 1 {\displaystyle \sin ^{2}\theta +\cos ^{2}\theta =1\,} crd 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ + crd 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( π π − − θ θ ) = 4 {\displaystyle \operatorname {crd} ^{2}\theta +\operatorname {crd} ^{2}(\pi -\theta )=4\,} Half-angle sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ 2 = ± ± 1 − − cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ 2 {\displaystyle \sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}=\pm {\sqrt {\frac {1-\cos \theta }{2}}}\,} crd ⁡ ⁡ θ θ 2 = 2 − − crd ⁡ ⁡ ( π π − − θ θ ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {crd} \ {\frac {\theta }{2}}={\sqrt {2-\operatorname {crd} (\pi -\theta )}}\,} Apothem ( a ) c = 2 r 2 − − a 2 {\displaystyle c=2{\sqrt {r^{2}-a^{2}}}} c = D 2 − − 4 a 2 {\displaystyle c={\sqrt {D^{2}-4a^{2}}}} Angle ( θ ) c = 2 r sin ⁡ ⁡ ( θ θ 2 ) {\displaystyle c=2r\sin \left({\frac {\theta }{2}}\right)} c = D 2 crd ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle c={\frac {D}{2}}\operatorname {crd} \theta } The inverse function exists as well: [ 4 ] θ θ = 2 arcsin ⁡ ⁡ c 2 r {\displaystyle \theta =2\arcsin {\frac {c}{2r}}} See also [ edit ] Circular segment – the part of the sector that remains after removing the triangle formed by the center of the circle and the two endpoints of the circular arc on the boundary.
