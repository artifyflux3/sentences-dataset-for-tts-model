[ 1 ] Psephology attempts to both forecast and explain election results. 
The term is more common in Britain and in those English-speaking communities that rely heavily on the British standard of the language.

[ citation needed ] Psephology uses historical precinct voting data, public opinion polls , campaign finance information and similar statistical data. The term was coined in 1948 by W. F. R. Hardie (1902–1990) in the United Kingdom after R. B. McCallum , a friend of Hardie's, requested a word to describe the study of elections. Its first documented usage in writing appeared in 1952.

[ 2 ] Etymology [ edit ] The term draws from the Greek word for pebble as the ancient Greeks used pebbles to vote. (Similarly, the word " ballot " is derived from the medieval French word " ballotte ", meaning a small ball.

( August 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Psephology is a division of political science that deals with the examination as well as the statistical analysis of elections and polls. People who practise psephology are called psephologists.

A few of the major tools that are used by a psephologist are historical precinct voting data, campaign finance information, and other related data.

Public opinion polls also play an important role in psephology. Psephology also has various applications specifically in analysing the results of election returns for current indicators, as opposed to predictive purposes. For instance, the Gallagher Index measures the amount of proportional representation in an election.

Degrees in psephology are not offered (instead, a psephologist might have a degree in political science and/or statistics). Knowledge of demographics, statistical analysis and politics (especially electoral systems and voting behaviour) are prerequisites for becoming a psephologist.

Notable psephologists [ edit ] Notable psephologists include: David Andrews, who since 1973 has led the Canadian network CTV's analysis and "calling" of dozens of federal and elections and referendums Michael Barone , who has co-authored The Almanac of American Politics biennially since 1972 John Bowman David Butler and Robert McKenzie , who co-developed the swingometer Robert Chapman Nate Cohn Charlie Cook , publisher of The Cook Political Report F.
