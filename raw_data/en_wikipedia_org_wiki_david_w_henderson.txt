Henderson Henderson on his 70th birthday in South Africa Born ( 1939-02-23 ) February 23, 1939 United States Died December 20, 2018 (2018-12-20) (aged 79) Known for Topology , algebraic geometry , history of mathematics and educational mathematics Spouse Daina Taimina Scientific career Fields Mathematician David Wilson Henderson (February 23, 1939 – December 20, 2018) was a professor emeritus of Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at Cornell University . His work ranges from the study of topology, algebraic geometry , history of mathematics and exploratory mathematics for teaching prospective mathematics teachers. His papers in the philosophy of mathematics place him with the intuitionist school of philosophy of mathematics .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] His practical geometry, which he put to work and discovered in his carpentry work, gives a perspective of geometry as the understanding of the infinite spaces through local properties.

[ 3 ] Euclidean geometry is seen in his work as extendable to the spherical and hyperbolic spaces starting with the study and reformulation of the 5th postulate .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] He was struck by an automobile in a pedestrian crosswalk on December 19, 2018, and died the next day from his injuries.
