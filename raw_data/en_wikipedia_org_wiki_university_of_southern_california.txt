Newspaper Daily Trojan Colors Cardinal and gold [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Nickname Trojans Sporting affiliations NCAA Division I FBS – Big Ten ACHA MPSF Mascot Traveler [ 9 ] Tommy Trojan (unofficial) Website usc .edu The University of Southern California ( USC , SC , or Southern Cal [a] ) is a private research university in Los Angeles , California, United States. Founded in 1880 by Robert M. Widney , it is the oldest private research university in California, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] and has an enrollment of more than 47,000 students.

[ 4 ] The university is composed of one liberal arts school, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences , and 22 undergraduate , graduate , and professional schools, enrolling roughly 21,000 undergraduate and 28,500 post-graduate students from all fifty U.S. states and more than 115 countries.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] It is a member of the Association of American Universities , which it joined in 1969.

USC sponsors a variety of intercollegiate sports and competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Big Ten Conference .

[ 16 ] Members of USC's sports teams, the Trojans , have won 107 NCAA team championships and 412 NCAA individual championships.

[ 17 ] As of 2021, Trojan athletes have won 326 medals at the Olympic Games ( 153 golds, 96 silvers, and 77 bronzes ), more than any other American university.

[ 18 ] USC has had 571 football players drafted to the National Football League , the second-highest number of draftees in the country.

[ 19 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of the University of Southern California Robert Maclay Widney , founder of the university, photographed in 1885 The Widney Alumni House, the campus's first building Founding and early history [ edit ] The University of Southern California was founded following the efforts of Judge Robert Maclay Widney , who helped secure donations from several key figures in early Los Angeles history: a Protestant nurseryman, Ozro Childs ; an Irish Catholic former governor, John Gately Downey ; and a German Jewish banker, Isaias Wolf Hellman . The three donated 308 acres to establish the campus and provided the necessary seed money for the construction of the first buildings. Originally operated in affiliation with the Methodist Church, the school mandated from the start that "no student would be denied admission because of race". The university is no longer affiliated with any church, having severed formal ties in 1952. When USC opened in 1880, the school had an enrollment of 53 students and a faculty of 10. Its first graduating class in 1884 was a class of three: two males and a female, who was valedictorian .

USC was further expanded with the construction of Old College in 1887, which served as the College of Liberal Arts (now Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences). Although envisioned as the permanent centerpiece to the university, its age and lack of earthquake safety became major concerns as USC moved through the 20th century.

[ 20 ] The building was eventually demolished in 1948.

USC in the 20th century [ edit ] Despite a growing student and faculty population, the university maintained most of its campus along Trousdale Parkway (then known as University Avenue). Beginning in 1919, architect John Parkinson developed a master plan for the university that expanded beyond this avenue, focusing on Romanesque buildings for which the university has become notable.

[ 21 ] Bovard Administration Building was completed in 1921 along this parkway, and remains one of the university's oldest and most iconic buildings. The Gwynn Wilson Student Union, Doheny Memorial Library , and Allan Hancock Foundation were completed in 1927, 1932, and 1940, respectively, and remain directly adjacent to the university's central quad (now Hahn Plaza).

[ 22 ] Many of these were constructed under President Rufus B. von KleinSmid , who spearheaded the creation of 19 buildings over 25 years.

[ 20 ] The onset of World War II led to a transformation of campus life, with a shift in academic programs and student enrollment. Total enrollment fell 15%; military programs were instituted, and by the end of the war 75% of male students were involved in some branch of the military. USC was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program , which offered students a path to a Navy commission.  After the war ended, enrollment of veterans under the G.I. Bill soared to 24,000 by 1947, straining USC's facilities and resources.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] In 1950, Founder's Hall (now Taper Hall of Humanities) was constructed, becoming the first new classroom space in a decade. University Avenue was closed to through traffic. In 1958, Norman Topping became president, and initiated a campaign for capital construction to support USC's burgeoning population. Under the assistance of architect William Pereira , USC constructed 99 buildings between 1961 and 1979.

[ 21 ] The university hosted some Olympics activities in 1984, and in 1990, Steven Sample became president of the university.

[ 25 ] Origin of USC's mascot [ edit ] USC students and athletes are known as Trojans, epitomized by the Trojan Shrine , nicknamed "Tommy Trojan", near the center of campus. Until 1912, USC students (especially athletes) were known as Fighting Methodists or Wesleyans, though neither name was approved by the university. Tommy’s sword has been stolen so frequently that instead of replacing it with an expensive brass one each time, he is now provided with a wooden one.

[ 26 ] During a fateful track and field meet with Stanford University , the USC team was beaten early and seemingly conclusively. After only the first few events, it seemed implausible USC would ever win, but the team fought back, winning many of the later events, to lose only by a slight margin. After this contest, Los Angeles Times sportswriter Owen Bird reported the USC athletes "fought on like the Trojans of antiquity", and the president of the university at the time, George F. Bovard , approved the name officially.

Campus [ edit ] Main article: Campus of the University of Southern California The Doheny Library The main campus is in the University Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of downtown Los Angeles . Located off exit 20B of Interstate 110 , the campus's boundaries are Jefferson Boulevard on the north and northeast, Figueroa Street on the southeast, Exposition Boulevard on the south, and Vermont Avenue on the west. Since the 1960s, through-campus vehicle traffic has been either severely restricted or entirely prohibited on some thoroughfares. The University Park campus is within walking distance to Los Angeles landmarks such as the Shrine Auditorium and Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , which is operated and managed by the university.

[ 27 ] Most buildings are in the Romanesque Revival style, although some dormitories, engineering buildings, and physical sciences labs are of various Modernist styles (especially two large Brutalist dormitories at the campus's northern edge) that sharply contrast with the predominantly red-brick campus. Widney Alumni House, built in 1880, is the oldest university building in Southern California. The historic portion of the main campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

Besides its main campus at University Park, USC also operates the Health Sciences Campus about 2 miles (3.2 km) northeast of downtown. In addition, the Children's Hospital Los Angeles is staffed by USC faculty from the Keck School of Medicine , and is often referred to as USC's third campus. USC also operates an Orange County center in Irvine for business, pharmacy, social work, and education, and the Information Sciences Institute , with centers in Arlington, Virginia , and Marina del Rey . For its science students, USC operates the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies on Catalina Island just 20 miles (32 km) off the coast of Los Angeles, and home to the Philip K. Wrigley Marine Science Center.

The Price School of Public Policy also runs a satellite campus in Sacramento . A Health Sciences Alhambra campus holds the Primary Care Physician Assistant Program, the Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research (IPR), and the Masters in Public Health Program. In 2005, USC established a federal relations office in Washington, DC., and in March 2023, USC announced the opening of a new Capital Campus in Washington, D.C. The university purchased a seven-story 60,000 square feet building and remodeled it to house classrooms, event venues, office spaces, a bookstore and a theater.  Located in the heart of the Dupont Circle neighborhood, the USC Capital Campus is also home to USC's Office of Research Advancement, which helps university faculty researchers secure federal funding for multidisciplinary research projects. USC was developed under two master plans drafted and implemented some forty years apart. The first was prepared by Train & Williams but it was replaced by the second, made the Parkinsons in 1919.

[ 28 ] The Center for International and Public Affairs, topped by a 5,500 lb (2,500 kg) globe, is the tallest structure on campus.

[ 29 ] Built under the second master plan, it reflects a trend towards modernism during that period.

The second and largest master plan was prepared in 1961 under the supervision of President Norman Topping , campus development director Anthony Lazzaro , and architect William Pereira .

USC's role in making visible and sustained improvements in the neighborhoods surrounding both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses earned it the distinction of College of the Year 2000 by the Time/Princeton Review College Guide . Roughly half of the university's students volunteer in community-service programs in neighborhoods around campus and throughout Los Angeles. These outreach programs, as well as previous administrations' commitment to remaining in South Los Angeles amid widespread calls to move the campus following the 1965 Watts Riots , are credited for the safety of the university during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots . The ZIP Code for USC is 90089 and that of the surrounding University Park community is 90007.

The globe tower and Waite Phillips Hall, home to the USC Rossier School of Education Traveler horse statue at University of Southern California in Los Angeles USC has an endowment of $8.1 billion and carries out nearly $1 billion per year in sponsored research.

[ 3 ] University Village [ edit ] In 1999, USC purchased the University Park shopping center, which was demolished in 2014. In September of the same year, the university began construction on USC Village, a 1.25-million-square-foot residential and retail center directly adjacent to USC's University Park campus on 15 acres of land owned by the university.

[ 30 ] The USC Village has over 130,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor, with student housing on the four floors above. The $700 million project is the biggest development in the history of USC and is also one of the largest in the history of South Los Angeles. With a grand opening held on August 17, 2017, [ 31 ] the USC Village includes a Trader Joe's, a Target, a fitness center, restaurants, outdoor dining, 400 retail parking spots, a community room, and housing for 2,700 students.

[ 32 ] Health Sciences campus [ edit ] The original Los Angeles County - USC Medical Center Located three miles (5 km) from downtown Los Angeles and seven miles (11 km) from the University Park campus, USC's Health Sciences campus is a major center for basic and clinical biomedical research in the fields of cancer , gene therapy , the neurosciences , and transplantation biology , among others. The 79-acre (32 ha) [ 33 ] campus is home to the region's first and oldest medical and pharmacy schools, as well as acclaimed programs in nurse anesthesiology, occupational therapy , physical therapy , physician assistant, and pharmacy which are respectively ranked No. 11, No. 5, No. 6, No. 20, No. 12 by U.S. News & World Report in 2024.

[ 34 ] In addition to the Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center , which is one of the nation's largest teaching hospitals, the campus includes three patient care facilities: USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center , Keck Hospital of USC , and the USC Eye Institute. USC faculty staffs these and many other hospitals in Southern California, including the internationally acclaimed Children's Hospital Los Angeles . The health sciences campus is also home to the USC School of Pharmacy and several research buildings such as USC/Norris Cancer Research Tower, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute , Harlyne J. Norris Cancer Research Tower and Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research.

The Keck Hospital of USC is ranked No. 7 out of 420 hospitals in the State of California [ 35 ] and ranks in the top twenty nationally for specialities by U.S. News & World Report , including cancer, cardiology, gastroenterology, and geriatrics.

[ 36 ] In July 2013, the university expanded its medical services into the foothill communities of northern Los Angeles when it acquired the 185 bed Verdugo Hills Hospital in Glendale, California . USC planned on making at least $30 million in capital improvements to the facility, which was officially renamed USC Verdugo Hills Hospital. This 40-year-old hospital provides the community a 24-hour emergency department, primary stroke center, maternity/labor and delivery, cardiac rehabilitation, and imaging and diagnostic services.

[ 37 ] In July 2022, the university acquired the 348 bed Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia, California .

[ 38 ] Renamed USC Arcadia Hospital it is a full-service community hospital offering advanced cardiovascular services including cardiac catheterization, electrophysiology and open-heart surgery.

Los Angeles County has designated it as both a heart attack receiving center and a comprehensive stroke center, as well as an Emergency Department Approved for Pediatrics. The hospital also offers a variety of surgical services in orthopaedics, neurosurgery, obstetrics, gynecology, and cancer care, plus physical rehabilitation and many other medical specialties.

[ 39 ] USC physicians serve more than one million patients each year.

Public transit [ edit ] Expo Park/USC station and Mudd Hall of Philosophy in the background USC is served by several rapid transit stations. The Metro E Line light rail service between Downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica wraps around the south and eastern edges of the University Park campus. The E Line has three stations in the vicinity of the USC main campus: Jefferson/USC Station , Expo Park/USC Station , and Vermont/Expo Station .

[ 40 ] The Metro J Line bus service serves both the University Park campus at 37th Street/USC station and the Health Sciences campus at LA General Medical Center station .

[ 41 ] In addition, both campuses are served by several Metro and municipal bus routes.

Former agricultural college campus [ edit ] Chaffey College was founded in 1883 in the city of Ontario, California , as an agricultural college branch campus of USC under the name of Chaffey College of Agriculture of the University of Southern California. USC ran the Chaffey College of Agriculture until financial troubles closed the school in 1901. In 1906, the school was reopened by the municipal and regional government and thus officially separated from USC. Renamed as Chaffey College, it now exists as a community college as part of the California Community College System .

Organization and administration [ edit ] Bovard Hall, shortly after completion in 1921. The streets later became pedestrian-only.

USC is a private public-benefit nonprofit corporation controlled by a board of trustees composed of 50 voting members and several life trustees, honorary trustees, and trustees emeriti who do not vote. Voting members of the board of trustees are elected for five-year terms. One-fifth of the Trustees stand for re-election each year, and votes are cast only by the trustees not standing for election. Trustees tend to be high-ranking executives of large corporations (both domestic and international), successful alumni, members of the upper echelons of university administration, or some combination of the three.

The university administration consists of a president, a provost , several vice-presidents of various departments, a treasurer, a chief information officer , and an athletic director .

[ 42 ] The current president is Beong-Soo Kim who on July 1, 2025, succeeded Carol Folt .

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] The USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, the Graduate School, and the twenty professional schools are each led by an academic dean .

[ 45 ] USC occasionally awards emeritus titles to former administrators. There are six administrators emeriti. The University of Southern California's twenty professional schools include the USC Leventhal School of Accounting , USC School of Architecture , USC Roski School of Art and Design, USC Iovine and Young Academy , USC Marshall School of Business , USC School of Cinematic Arts , USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism , USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance , Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC , USC School of Dramatic Arts , USC Rossier School of Education , USC Viterbi School of Engineering , USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology , USC Gould School of Law , Keck School of Medicine of USC , USC Thornton School of Music , USC School of Pharmacy , USC Bovard College, USC Sol Price School of Public Policy , and USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work .

[ 46 ] Student government [ edit ] The Gwynn Wilson Student Union on the University Park campus The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) is the official representative government of the undergraduate students at USC. It consists of a popularly elected president and vice president who lead an appointed executive cabinet, a popularly elected legislative branch, and judicial oversight. The executive cabinet oversees funding, communications, programming, and advocacy work. All USG activities are funded by the student activity fee. In addition to USG, residents within university housing are represented and governed by the Residential Housing Association (RHA), which is divided by residence hall. The Graduate Student Government (GSG) consists of senators elected by the students of each school proportional to its enrollment and its activities are funded by a graduate and professional student activity fee.

[ 77 ] DPS's patrol and response jurisdiction includes a 2.5 square mile area around each USC campus.

[ 78 ] The Department of Public Safety headquarters is on the University Park campus, and there are substations in the University Village and on the Health Sciences campus.

[ 79 ] The department operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. All USC Public Safety Officers are required to be police academy graduates [ 80 ] so that under California Penal Code statute they can be granted peace officer power of arrest authority while on duty, enforce state laws and local city municipal codes, and investigate crimes.

[ 81 ] DPS is overseen by an independent advisory board of 21 faculty, staff, student and community members appointed by the USC President. The board reviews DPS performance, stop, and misconduct data, and conducts periodic assessments of DPS policies, practices, and operational performance.

[ 82 ] The department has a formal working relationship with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), [ 83 ] which includes USC paying for newly hired Public Safety Officers to attend the six month-long Los Angeles Police Academy.

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] A special joint USC/LAPD crime task force composed of USC DPS personnel and approximately 40 selected Los Angeles police officers, including a dedicated specially trained LAPD SWAT team, [ 86 ] [ 87 ] is assigned exclusively to the USC campus community to address crime and quality of life issues.

Academics [ edit ] Main article: University of Southern California academics The law school building is one example of Brutalist architecture on USC's main campus.

USC is a large, primarily residential research university.

[ 88 ] The majority of the student body was undergraduate until 2007, when graduate student enrollment began to exceed undergraduate.

[ 89 ] The four-year, full-time undergraduate instructional program is classified as "balanced arts & sciences/professions" with a high graduate coexistence. Admissions are characterized as "most selective, lower transfer in"; 95 undergraduate majors and 147 academic and professional minors are offered.

[ 88 ] [ 90 ] The graduate program is classified as "comprehensive" and offers 134 master's, doctoral, and professional degrees through twenty professional schools.

[ 88 ] [ 90 ] USC is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges .

[ 90 ] USC's academic departments fall either under the general liberal arts and sciences of the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences for undergraduates, the Graduate School for graduates, or the university's 20 professional schools.

[ 91 ] Bovard Auditorium Vivian Hall, part of the Viterbi School of Engineering complex The USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, the oldest and largest of the USC schools, grants undergraduate degrees in more than 180 majors and minors across the humanities, social sciences, and natural/physical sciences, and offers doctoral and masters programs in more than twenty fields.

[ 92 ] Dornsife College is responsible for the general education program for all USC undergraduates and houses a full-time faculty of almost 1,000, nearly 8,000 undergraduate majors (over a third of the total USC undergraduate population), and 1,300 doctoral students. In addition to thirty academic departments, the college also houses dozens of research centers and institutes. In the 2008–2009 academic year, 4,400 undergraduate degrees and 5,500 advanced degrees were awarded. Formerly called "USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences", the college received a $200 million gift from USC trustees Dana and David Dornsife on March 23, 2011, after which the college was renamed in their honor, following the naming pattern of other professional schools and departments at the university.

[ 93 ] All PhD degrees awarded at USC and most master's degrees are under the jurisdiction of the Graduate School.

[ 94 ] Professional degrees are awarded by each of the respective professional schools.

The USC School of Cinematic Arts The School of Cinematic Arts , the oldest and largest film school in the country, confers degrees in six different programs.

[ 95 ] [ 96 ] As the university administration considered cinematic skills too valuable to be kept to film industry professionals, the school opened its classes to the university at large in 1998.

[ 97 ] In 2001, the film school added an Interactive Media & Games Division studying stereoscopic cinema, panoramic cinema, immersive cinema, interactive cinema, video games, virtual reality, and mobile media. In September 2006, George Lucas donated $175 million to expand the film school, which at the time was the largest single donation to USC (and its fifth over $100 million). The donation will be used to build new structures and expand the faculty.

[ 98 ] The acceptance rate to the School of Cinematic Arts has consistently remained between 4–6% for the past several years.

[ when?

] Watt Hall houses the USC School of Architecture and the Roski School of Art and Design.

The USC School of Architecture was established in 1916, the first in Southern California . From at least 1972 to 1976, and likely for a number of years prior to 1972, it was called The School of Architecture and Fine Art. The School of Fine Art (known as SOFA for a number of years after Architecture and Fine Art separated) was eventually named the Roski School of Fine Arts in 2006 during a ceremony to open the then-new Masters of Fine Art building, which occupies the previous and completely refurbished Lucky Blue Jean factory. This small department grew rapidly with the help of the Allied Architects of Los Angeles. A separate School of Architecture was organized in September 1925. The school has been home to teachers such as Richard Neutra , Ralph Knowles, James Steele, A. Quincy Jones , William Pereira and Pierre Koenig . The school of architecture also claims notable alumni Frank Gehry , Jon Jerde , Thom Mayne , Raphael Soriano , Gregory Ain , and Pierre Koenig. Two of the alumni have become Pritzker Prize winners. In 2006, Qingyun Ma , a distinguished Shanghai-based architect, was named dean of the school.

[ 99 ] The Andrew and Erna Viterbi School of Engineering is headed by Dean Yannis Yortsos . Previously known as the USC School of Engineering, it was renamed on March 2, 2004, in honor of Qualcomm co-founder Andrew Viterbi and his wife Erna, who had donated $52 million to the school. Viterbi School of Engineering has been ranked No. 11 and No. 9 in the United States in U.S. News & World Report ' s engineering rankings for 2018 and 2019 respectively.

[ 100 ] The Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism The Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism , founded in 1971, is one of the two communication programs in the country endowed by Walter Annenberg (the other is at the University of Pennsylvania ). The School of Journalism, which became part of the School for Communication in 1994, [ 101 ] features a core curriculum that requires students to devote themselves equally to print, broadcast and online media for the first year of study. The journalism school consistently ranks among the nation's top undergraduate journalism schools.

[ 102 ] USC's Annenberg School's endowment rose from $7.5 million to $218 million between 1996 and 2007.

[ 103 ] In 2015, the new building named for Wallis Annenberg started serving all faculty and students.

The Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry at the University of Southern California was established in 1897 as The College of Dentistry, and today, awards undergraduate and graduate degrees. Headed by Dean Avishai Sadan, the school traditionally has maintained five Divisions: Academic Affairs & Student Life, Clinical Affairs, Continuing Education, Research, and Community Health Programs and Hospital Affairs. In 2006, the USC Department of Physical Therapy and Biokinesiology , and the USC Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, which both had previously been organized as "Independent Health Professions" programs at the USC College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, were administratively aligned under the School of Dentistry and renamed "Divisions," bringing the total number of Divisions at the School of Dentistry to seven. In 2010, alumnus Herman Ostrow donated $35 million to name the school the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry. In 2013, the school introduced an eighth division, and in 2014, a $20 million gift endowed and named the USC Mrs. T.H. Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy.

USC collaborated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University to offer the USC Executive MBA program in Shanghai . USC Dornsife also operates two international study centers in Paris and Madrid. The Marshall School of Business has satellite campuses in Orange County and San Diego . In 2012, USC established the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance , the university's first new school in forty years, [ 104 ] which was a gift from philanthropist Glorya Kaufman .

[ 167 ] Athletics [ edit ] Main article: USC Trojans The Galen Center , home of USC basketball and volleyball The USC Trojans participate in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as part of the Big Ten Conference .

[ 168 ] USC student athletes have won 123 total team national championships, 97 for men and 26 for women, including non-NCAA championships. Of this total, 80 and 14 are NCAA national championships for men and women, respectively. The NCAA does not include college football championships in its calculation. Although there are multiple organizations that name national champions, USC claims 11 football championships. The men's 361 individual championships are the second-best in the nation and 53 ahead of third place, the Texas Longhorns . USC's cross-town rival is the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), with whom there is fierce athletic and scholastic competition. USC's rivalry with Notre Dame predates the UCLA rivalry by three years. The Notre Dame rivalry stems mainly from the annual football game played between these two universities and is considered one of the greatest rivalries in college athletics.

[ 169 ] USC has won 113 NCAA team championships, third most behind Stanford (135) [ 170 ] and cross-town rival UCLA (123).

[ 17 ] The Trojans have also won at least one national team title in 26 consecutive years (1959–1960 to 1984–1985).

Traditions and student activities [ edit ] USC mascot Traveler with Trojan Warrior and the Spirit of Troy As one of the oldest universities in California, the University of Southern California has a number of traditions. USC's official fight song is " Fight On ", which was composed in 1922 by USC dental student Milo Sweet with lyrics by Sweet and Glen Grant.

[ 173 ] Rivalries [ edit ] Main articles: Notre Dame – USC rivalry and UCLA–USC rivalry During the week prior to the traditional USC-UCLA rivalry football game, the Tommy Trojan statue is covered to prevent UCLA vandalism.

USC has rivalries with multiple schools. Although generally limited to football, USC has a major rivalry with Notre Dame .

[ 174 ] The annual game is played for the Jeweled Shillelagh . The rivalry has featured more national championship teams, Heisman trophy winners, All-Americans, and future NFL hall-of-famers than any other collegiate match-up. The two schools have kept the annual game on their schedules since 1926 (except 1942–44 because of World War II travel restrictions and 2020 because of the COVID-19 Pandemic) and the game is often referred to as the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football.

[ 175 ] [ 176 ] [ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] USC's most famous rival is UCLA with whom there is fierce athletic and scholastic competition. Both universities are in Los Angeles and approximately 10 miles (16 km) apart. Both schools were members of the Pac-12 Conference for nearly a century until leaving for the Big Ten in 2024. Until 1982, the two schools also shared the same football stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The victor of the annual football game takes home the Victory Bell . The Trojans and Bruins also compete in a year-long all-sports competition for the Lexus Gauntlet Trophy . Pranks between UCLA and USC were commonplace several decades ago. Both universities have cracked down on pranks since a 1989 incident when USC students released hundreds of crickets into the main UCLA library during finals week.

[ 180 ] Days before a clash between rivals UCLA and USC in 2009, the Bruins mascot was vandalized. It was splashed in cardinal and gold paint, USC's official colors, sparking memories of pranks played in the years earlier.

[ 181 ] The week preceding the annual football matchup with UCLA is known as "Troy Week" and features a number of traditions including "The Ultimate Trojan Experience", Save Tommy Night, the CONQUEST! Bonfire, and all-night vigils by the USC Helenes and Trojan Knights to protect the campus from UCLA Bruins .

In addition, USC has rivalries with other former Pac-12 schools, particularly the Stanford Cardinal as they were the only two private universities in the Pac-12 Conference and are situated at opposing regions of California, as well as being the two oldest private research universities in California, 1880 and 1891, respectively. Recently, a rivalry has begun to exist between USC and the University of Oregon because of the two universities' dominant football programs with each school often serving as the toughest match-up on the opponent's schedule.

Mascots [ edit ] Traveler, a white Andalusian horse , is the university's official mascot. Traveler I first appeared at a football game in 1961 ridden by Richard Saukko. The current horse is known as Traveler IX.

[ 182 ] Tommy Trojan , officially known as the Trojan Shrine, is a bronze statue in the model of a Trojan warrior at the center of campus. It is commonly mistaken as the school's official mascot. The statue was modeled after Trojan football players and is engraved with the ideal characteristics of a Trojan. It is a popular meeting point for students and a landmark for visitors.

[ 183 ] In the 1940s, George Tirebiter , a car-chasing dog, was the most popular unofficial mascot. It gained fame among students after it bit the mascot of the UCLA Bruins. The dog was kept by the Trojan Knights and was known to chase down cars on Trousdale Parkway, which runs through campus. After the original dog died, three others succeeded it. A statue was built in 2006 to honor the unofficial mascot.

[ 184 ] Marching band [ edit ] The drum major of the Spirit of Troy wears a more elaborate uniform and conducts the band with a sword.

The Spirit of Troy is USC's marching band and has been featured in at least ten major movies and performed in both the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

[ 185 ] They have also performed on television shows and with other musicians. The band performed on the title track of the 1979 Fleetwood Mac album Tusk , which went on to be a multi-platinum record . The band performed during halftime at Super Bowl XXI in 1987 and Super Bowl XXII in 1988. In 1990, the band performed live on America's Funniest Home Videos . Additionally, the band later played on another multi-platinum Fleetwood Mac album, The Dance (1997).

[ 186 ] The Spirit of Troy is the only collegiate band to have two platinum records.

[ 187 ] [ 188 ] In recent years, the band has appeared at the 2009 Grammy Awards , accompanying Radiohead ; on the 2009 Academy Awards with Beyoncé and Hugh Jackman ; and during the finale of American Idol 2008, backing Renaldo Lapuz in instrumentation of his original song, "We're Brothers Forever".

[ 189 ] [ 190 ] [ 191 ] In 2009, the band played on the show Dancing with the Stars .

[ 192 ] The USC band was only one of two American groups invited to march in the Hong Kong Chinese New Year parade in 2003 and 2004. The Trojan Marching Band performed at the 2005 World Expo in Nagoya, Japan . In May 2006, the Trojan Marching Band traveled to Italy, performing once in Florence, and twice in Rome (including in front of the Coliseum). The band has also, for many years, performed the 1812 Overture with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra (or occasionally with other orchestras) each year at the Hollywood Bowl "Tchaikovsky Spectacular." [ 193 ] Spirit groups [ edit ] The Song Girls celebrating a USC Trojans football victory Song Girls [ edit ] Founded in 1967, the USC Song Girls appear at football, basketball, and volleyball games as well as other sporting events, rallies, and university and alumni functions.

[ 194 ] [ 195 ] The squad also performs internationally. The squad has traveled to Italy , Austria , France , Hungary , Czech Republic , Japan , China and Australia , most recently having traveled to Milan , Italy to perform at the 2015 World Expo on America's Independence Day. Unlike other college cheer teams, Song Girls are primarily a dance squad and do not perform gymnastics, stunts, or lead cheers.

[ 194 ] [ 196 ] The Song Girls perform to the music of and often appear with The Spirit of Troy. Together with the Trojan Marching Band, they are a visible public face of the university and function as the ambassadors of spirit and goodwill for the Trojan Family.

Yell Leaders [ edit ] Lindley Bothwell founded the USC Yell Leading Squad in 1919 in his first year as a student at USC. He felt that together, with a few friends, he could aid in "firing up" the crowd during football games.

[ 197 ] The USC Yell Leaders worked closely with The Spirit of Troy and the Song Girls to lead cheers and perform stunts to rally Trojan fans at football, basketball, and volleyball games. The sweater-clad team consisted of all men for most of its existence, though the squad later opened itself up to applicants from both sexes and did feature one female Yell Leader in 1998.

[ 198 ] They were disbanded by the university after the 2005–06 season and replaced by the co-ed Spirit Leaders.

[ 199 ] Spirit Leaders [ edit ] The USC Spirit Leaders are responsible for leading stadium wide chants and increasing crowd participation at all Trojan athletic events, including football and basketball games.

[ 197 ] Student media [ edit ] A The Southern California Trojan issued in 1915 The Daily Trojan has been the student newspaper of USC since 1912 and is a primary source of news and information for the campus. It secured the first interview of President Richard Nixon after his resignation. The publication does not receive financial aid from the university and instead runs entirely on advertisement revenue. Published from Monday to Friday during the fall and spring semesters, the newspaper turns into the Summer Trojan during the summer term and publishes once a week. It is the paper of record on campus.

KXSC (FM) is a University of Southern California-owned, public radio station based in Sunnyvale, California , serving the San Francisco Bay Area. KXSC-AM, previously known as KSCR, is the university's student-run station, which is managed entirely by an unpaid staff of nearly 200 undergraduate and graduate volunteers. The station gives students hands-on experience in a variety of music industry and broadcast-related positions, including live event promotion, social media management, radio production, and audio engineering . Besides providing nearly 24 hours of daily live programming, the station also hosts live events, bringing local and touring bands to campus. The station's annual KXSC Fest, which began in 2009, has played host to performers such as Nosaj Thing , [ 200 ] Muna (band) , [ 201 ] Mika Miko , [ 202 ] Dan Deacon , [ 203 ] Thee Oh Sees , [ 204 ] and Flying Lotus .

[ 205 ] KXSC traces its roots to the original KUSC , which was operated by students starting in 1946. When KUSC transitioned to classical programming and moved off-campus in the mid-1970s, a group of students interested in  having a student-run radio station founded KSCR in 1975.

[ 206 ] KSCR was broadcast at 1560AM out of a student in the Hancock Foundation Building. In 1984, the university authorized a grant to move KSCR to a new location in Marks Hall. In 2010, KSCR adopted the call letters KXSC in order to be eligible to obtain a new FM license from the FCC, as well as to mark the station's move to a brand-new facility in the basement of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.

[ 207 ] Trojan Vision (often abbreviated as TV8 ) is the student television station at USC. TV8 was established in 1997 by the Annenberg School for Communication , but it is now a part of the School of Cinematic Arts. Trojan Vision broadcasts 24/7 from the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts to the University Park Campus on Channel 8.1 and online through their website. Programming is also made available to the greater Los Angeles community on local channel LA36. In addition to a selection of regularly airing shows of many genres, Trojan Vision also broadcasts the shows Platforum , a round-table debate show; Annenberg TV News , a news program ; and CU@USC , an interview program.

[ 208 ] El Rodeo is USC's student-run yearbook . One of the oldest student traditions at the university, the yearbook's first edition was released in 1889 and was originally called The Sybil . The name was changed to El Rodeo in 1899 to reflect the cowboy-themed events students threw to advertise the yearbook as a "roundup" of the year's events. It was long packaged with the Student Activity Card, which gave students access to all home sports games. Since the card was dissolved in 2007, the yearbook has been sold as a stand-alone item.

[ 209 ] Fraternities and sororities [ edit ] Fraternities and sororities have had a long history on the campus. Centered on a portion of West 28th Street known as "The Row", between Figueroa Street and Hoover Street just north of campus, USC's Greek system began soon after the school's founding when Kappa Alpha Theta founded a chapter in 1887. Today, the university sponsors four fraternities and ten sororities in the Interfraternity Conference (IFC) and Panhellenic Conference (PHC), respectively.

[ 210 ] In 2022, eleven fraternities disaffiliated from the university to form the University Park Interfraternity Council (UPIFC).

[ 211 ] Outside the Panhellenic and Interfraternity conferences, the Greek community at USC is very diverse, boasting the Multicultural, Asian, Inter-Fraternity (composed of professional fraternities), and the National Pan-Hellenic (historically Black) Councils. Organizations governed by these councils include chapters of some of the oldest Latino and Black Greek organizations in the country, while also including established professional business, engineering, and pre-law fraternities, and other multiculturally based groups.

Controversies [ edit ] Title IX violations [ edit ] In the mid-2010s, USC was embroiled in numerous controversies and scandals. On May 1, 2014, USC was named as one of many higher-education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights for potential Title IX violations by Barack Obama 's White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault .

[ 212 ] USC is also under a concurrent Title IX investigation for potential anti-male bias in disciplinary proceedings, as well as denial of counseling resources to male students.

[ 213 ] In 2018, USC was ordered to pay $111,965 in legal fees to a male student accused of rape after the Title IX investigation run by Gretchen Means Gaspari was deemed unfair.

[ 214 ] In 2020, USC was penalized for its faulty Title IX processes by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.

[ 215 ] George Tyndall [ edit ] The following year, the Los Angeles Times broke another story about USC focusing on George Tyndall , a gynecologist accused of abusing 52 patients at USC. The reports span from 1990 to 2016, and include using racist and sexual language, conducting exams without gloves, and taking pictures of his patients' genitals.

Inside Higher Ed noted that "other incidents in which the university is perceived to have failed to act on misconduct by powerful officials" have occurred, [ 216 ] when it reported that the university's president, C. L. Max Nikias , was resigning. Tyndall was fired in 2017 after reaching a settlement with the university. By June 1, 2018, 401 people had contacted a special hotline to receive complaints about the doctor.

[ 217 ] On October 18, nearly 100 women were reported to have filed new lawsuits against the university, bringing the number of accusations up to over 500 current and former students.

[ 218 ] A series of settlements to the victims totalled to over $1.1 billion, the largest sexual abuse settlement of any university.

[ 219 ] Keck School of Medicine [ edit ] In 2016, Carmen Puliafito resigned as dean of the Keck School of Medicine. In 2017, the Los Angeles Times revealed that Puliafito had engaged in parties with young recreational drug users and prostitutes, including at the Keck School's offices, with harm to at least one user. His resignation had occurred shortly after a police investigation of those activities. In 2018, Dennis Kelly resigned as men's health physician at USC after almost twenty years. The following year, he was accused by six male graduate students of inappropriate conduct.

[ 220 ] By 2020, 49 accusations of misconduct had been made against Kelly, all by gay or bisexual students and former students.

[ 221 ] Implication in Varsity Blues scandal [ edit ] USC was one of several universities involved in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal .

[ 222 ] [ 223 ] On March 12, 2019, three coaches and one athletic director were charged with accepting bribes from wealthy families for fraudulently facilitating their children's admission to USC. Among the twelve university personnel charged for their involvement in the scandal nationwide, four were associated with USC.

[ 224 ] Following its involvement in the admissions scandal, the university was derided by its old nickname: the "University of Spoiled Children", a nickname it had previously worked hard to shed.

[ 225 ] [ 226 ] [ 227 ] Preferential treatment of Qatari royal [ edit ] A 2020 investigative report by the Los Angeles Times revealed that USC granted a bachelor's and master's degree to Khalifa bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani , a Qatari royal, while allowing him to avoid rules and procedures that apply to other students. He was accepted to USC as a transfer student from Los Angeles Mission College after his mother, Moza bint Nasser , met USC president Max Nikias in 2012 in Los Angeles, California, at the behest of USC trustee Tom Barrack . An adjunct professor said that Al Thani's handlers delivered a final paper in a bag that also contained a Rolex watch, which the adjunct returned.

[ 228 ] Rankings data [ edit ] In December 2022, three former students in an online graduate program offered by the Rossier School of Education and administered by educational technology company 2U filed a class action lawsuit for the school's filing faulty data with U.S. News & World Report in an effort to boost rankings.

[ 229 ] [ 230 ] [ 231 ] Rossier removed itself from the rankings in early 2022.

[ 232 ] [ 233 ] 2024 student protests regarding the Gaza War [ edit ] See also: List of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in the United States in 2024 In April 2024, the USC administration under President Carol Folt was met with widespread criticism following the decision to restrict valedictorian Asna Tabassum from speaking during that year's commencement ceremony.

[ 234 ] [ 235 ] USC cited safety concerns stemming from Tabassum's pro-Palestinian viewpoints. Following several on-campus protests, statements from dozens of human rights organizations and national coverage, USC further restricted all external speakers from speaking at that year's main commencement.

[ 236 ] The following week, USC became embroiled in additional controversy following a pro-Palestinian protest against the Gaza war , beginning at 4:30 A.M. on April 24, 2024, which took place in Alumni Park, a central plaza of campus. The student organizers wrote in a release that, among other demands, the campus occupation would not end until it saw financial transparency of USC’s endowments and investments, an academic boycott of Israel , and protection of free speech .

[ 237 ] After involved students refused to disperse despite intervention from campus police, the university brought the Los Angeles Police Department in to remove protestors. The situation escalated to involve the complete closure of all campus facilities, the campus itself, and the arrests of 93 protestors.

[ 238 ] On April 25, 2024, Folt announced that the main stage commencement ceremony in May would not take place.

[ 239 ] The actions of USC's administration towards student protestors further prompted the withdrawal of two high-profile speakers scheduled to address the USC Rossier School of Education, which was announced in an open letter to the administration on the website Literary Hub , as well as to USC officials.

[ 240 ] [ 241 ] In February 2025, Leo Terrell , the head of the Trump administration's Task Force to Combat Antisemitism , announced that he would investigate USC as part of the Department of Justice's broader investigation into antisemitism on college campuses .

^ The alternative name "Southern Cal" frequently appears in sports-related news articles to distinguish it from the University of South Carolina , who also uses the "USC" acronym. USC discourages use of "Southern Cal" out of concern the name might suggest a foundational association to the University of California, Berkeley (commonly known as "Cal" in the athletics context), even though the two institutions have no affiliation other than their longtime (but not current) Pac-12 membership. For several years, USC's media guides contained the following request: "Note to the media: In editorial references to athletic teams of the University of Southern California, the following are preferred: USC, Southern California, So. California, Troy and Trojans for men's or women's teams, and Women of Troy for women's teams. The use of 'Southern Cal' on licensed apparel and merchandise is limited in scope and necessary to protect federal trademark rights." [ 257 ] b.
