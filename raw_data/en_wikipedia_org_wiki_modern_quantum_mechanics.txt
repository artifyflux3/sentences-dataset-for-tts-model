J. Sakurai For the historical development of modern quantum theory, see History of quantum mechanics § Modern quantum mechanics .

Modern Quantum Mechanics Cover of the 3rd edition Author J. J. Sakurai and Jim Napolitano Language English Subject Quantum mechanics Published 1985 Publisher Cambridge University Press Publication place United States ISBN 978-1-108-64592-8 OCLC 1202949320 Dewey Decimal 530.12 LC Class QC174.12 Identifiers refer to the 2020 third edition eBook unless otherwise noted Modern Quantum Mechanics , often called Sakurai or Sakurai and Napolitano , is a standard graduate-level quantum mechanics textbook written originally by J. J. Sakurai and edited by San Fu Tuan in 1985, with later editions coauthored by Jim Napolitano . Sakurai died in 1982 before he could finish the textbook and both the first edition of the book, published in 1985 by Benjamin Cummings , and the revised edition of 1994, published by Addison-Wesley , were edited and completed by Tuan posthumously.

[ 1 ] The book was updated by Napolitano and released two later editions. The second edition was initially published by Addison-Wesley in 2010 and rereleased as an eBook by Cambridge University Press , which released a third edition in 2020.

Table of contents (3rd edition) [ edit ] Prefaces Chapter 1: Fundamental Concepts Chapter 2: Quantum Dynamics Chapter 3: Theory of Angular Momentum Chapter 4: Symmetry in Quantum Mechanics Chapter 5: Approximation Methods Chapter 6: Scattering Theory Chapter 7: Identical Particles Chapter 8: Relativistic Quantum Mechanics Appendix A: Electromagnetic Units Appendix B: Elementary Solutions to Schrödinger's Wave Equation Appendix C: Hamiltonian for a Charge in an Electromagnetic Field Appendix D: Proof of the Angular-Momentum Rule (3.358) Appendix E: Finding Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients Appendix F: Notes on Complex Variables Bibliography Index Reception [ edit ] Early editions of the book have received several reviews.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] It is a standard textbook on the subject and is recommended in other works on the subject, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] it has inspired other textbooks on the subject, [ 7 ] and it is used as a point of comparison in book reviews.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Along with Griffith's Introduction to Quantum Mechanics , the book was also analyzed in a review of the "Philosophical Standpoints of Textbooks in Quantum Mechanics" in June 2020.
