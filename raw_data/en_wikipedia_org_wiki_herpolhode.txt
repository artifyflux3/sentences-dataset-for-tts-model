The endpoint of the angular velocity moves in a plane in absolute space, called the invariable plane, that is orthogonal to the angular momentum vector L . The fact that the herpolhode is a curve in the invariable plane appears as  part of Poinsot's construction .

The trajectory of the angular velocity around the angular momentum in the invariable plane is a circle in the case of a symmetric top , but in the general case wiggles inside an annulus, while still being concave towards the angular momentum.
