For example, when R is the ring of integers Z , it is the same thing as the category of abelian groups . The category of right modules is defined in a similar way.

One can also define the category of bimodules over a ring R but that category is equivalent to the category of left (or right) modules over the enveloping algebra of R (or over the opposite of that).

Note: Some authors use the term module category for the category of modules. This term can be ambiguous since it could also refer to a category with a monoidal-category action .

[ 1 ] Properties [ edit ] The categories of left and right modules are abelian categories . These categories have enough projectives [ 2 ] and enough injectives .

[ 3 ] Mitchell's embedding theorem states every abelian category arises as a full subcategory of the category of modules over some ring.

Projective limits and inductive limits exist in the categories of left and right modules.

[ 4 ] Over a commutative ring , together with the tensor product of modules ⊗, the category of modules is a symmetric monoidal category .

Objects [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( March 2023 ) A monoid object of the category of modules over a commutative ring R is exactly an associative algebra over R .

A compact object in R -Mod is exactly a finitely presented module.

Category of vector spaces [ edit ] See also: FinVect The category K - Vect (some authors use Vect K ) has all vector spaces over a field K as objects, and K -linear maps as morphisms. Since vector spaces over K (as a field) are the same thing as modules over the ring K , K - Vect is a special case of R - Mod (some authors use Mod R ), the category of left R -modules.

Much of linear algebra concerns the description of K - Vect . For example, the dimension theorem for vector spaces says that the isomorphism classes in K - Vect correspond exactly to the cardinal numbers , and that K - Vect is equivalent to the subcategory of K - Vect which has as its objects the vector spaces K n , where n is any cardinal number.

Generalizations [ edit ] The category of sheaves of modules over a ringed space also has enough injectives (though not always enough projectives).
