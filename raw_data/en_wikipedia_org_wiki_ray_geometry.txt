A red line near the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)") on the two-dimensional [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system")

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **straight line**, usually abbreviated **line**, is an infinitely long object with no width, depth, or [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature"), an idealization of such physical objects as a [straightedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge "Straightedge"), a taut string, or a [ray of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(optics) "Ray (optics)"). Lines are [spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)") of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") one, which may be [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") in spaces of dimension two, three, or higher. The word _line_ may also refer, in everyday life, to a [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment"), which is a part of a line delimited by two [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") (its _endpoints_).

[Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements") defines a straight line as a "breadthless length" that "lies evenly with respect to the points on itself", and introduced several [postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulate "Postulate") as basic unprovable properties on which the rest of geometry was established. _**Euclidean line**_ and _[Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean\_geometry "Euclidean geometry")_ are terms introduced to avoid confusion with generalizations introduced since the end of the 19th century, such as [non-Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"), [projective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"), and [affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry").

In the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics") deductive geometry of [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements"), a general _line_ (now called a _[curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve")_) is defined as a "breadthless length", and a _straight line_ (now called a [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment")) was defined as a line "which lies evenly with the points on itself".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-:0-1): 291  These definitions appeal to readers' physical experience, relying on terms that are not themselves defined, and the definitions are never explicitly referenced in the remainder of the text. In modern geometry, a line is usually either taken as a [primitive notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion "Primitive notion") with properties given by [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-:0-1): 95  or else defined as a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of points obeying a linear relationship, for instance when [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") are taken to be primitive and geometry is established [analytically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry") in terms of numerical [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system").

In an axiomatic formulation of Euclidean geometry, such as that of [Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms "Hilbert's axioms") (modern mathematicians added to Euclid's original axioms to fill perceived logical gaps),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-:0-1): 108  a line is stated to have certain properties that relate it to other lines and [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)"). For example, for any two distinct points, there is a unique line containing them, and any two distinct lines intersect at most at one point.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-:0-1): 300  In two [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") (i.e., the Euclidean [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)")), two lines that do not intersect are called [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)"). In higher dimensions, two lines that do not intersect are parallel if they are contained in a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)"), or [skew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_lines "Skew lines") if they are not.

On a [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane"), a line can be represented as a boundary between two regions.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-2): 104  Any collection of finitely many lines partitions the plane into [convex polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon "Convex polygon") (possibly unbounded); this partition is known as an [arrangement of lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement_of_lines "Arrangement of lines").

### In higher dimensions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Line_(geometry)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: In higher dimensions")]

In [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"), a [first degree equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_degree_equation "First degree equation") in the variables _x_, _y_, and _z_ defines a plane, so two such equations, provided the planes they give rise to are not parallel, define a line which is the intersection of the planes. More generally, in _n_-dimensional space _n_−1 first-degree equations in the _n_[coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") variables define a line under suitable conditions.

In more general [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), **R**_n_ (and analogously in every other [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space")), the line _L_ passing through two different points _a_ and _b_ is the subset ![Image 2: {\displaystyle L=\left\{(1-t)\,a+tb\mid t\in \mathbb {R} \right\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6741a55f5e74a3296f617f4bd384c9b504f5ef08) The [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_(geometry) "Direction (geometry)") of the line is from a reference point _a_ (_t_ = 0) to another point _b_ (_t_ = 1), or in other words, in the direction of the vector _b_−_a_. Different choices of _a_ and _b_ can yield the same line.

Three or more points are said to be _collinear_ if they lie on the same line. If three points are not collinear, there is exactly one [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") that contains them.

In [affine coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_coordinates "Affine coordinates"), in _n_-dimensional space the points _X_ = (_x_ 1, _x_ 2, ..., _x_ _n_), _Y_ = (_y_ 1, _y_ 2, ..., _y_ _n_), and _Z_ = (_z_ 1, _z_ 2, ..., _z_ _n_) are collinear if the [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)")![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}1&x_{1}&x_{2}&\cdots &x_{n}\\1&y_{1}&y_{2}&\cdots &y_{n}\\1&z_{1}&z_{2}&\cdots &z_{n}\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40a009674dbbcfd643b06780204bec76f1789320) has a [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra) "Rank (linear algebra)") less than 3. In particular, for three points in the plane (_n_ = 2), the above matrix is square and the points are collinear if and only if its [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") is zero.

Equivalently for three points in a plane, the points are collinear if and only if the slope between one pair of points equals the slope between any other pair of points (in which case the slope between the remaining pair of points will equal the other slopes). By extension, _k_ points in a plane are collinear if and only if any (_k_–1) pairs of points have the same pairwise slopes.

In [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance")_d_(_a_,_b_) between two points _a_ and _b_ may be used to express the collinearity between three points by:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-4)

The points _a_, _b_ and _c_ are collinear if and only if _d_(_x_,_a_) = _d_(_c_,_a_) and _d_(_x_,_b_) = _d_(_c_,_b_) implies _x_ = _c_.
However, there are other notions of distance (such as the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance "Manhattan distance")) for which this property is not true.

In the geometries where the concept of a line is a [primitive notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion "Primitive notion"), as may be the case in some [synthetic geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry"), other methods of determining collinearity are needed.

### Relationship with other figures

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Line_(geometry)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Relationship with other figures")]

[![Image 4: see caption](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Tangent_to_a_curve.svg/250px-Tangent_to_a_curve.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tangent_to_a_curve.svg)

Tangent to a curve. The red line is tangential to the curve at the point marked by a red dot.

In Euclidean geometry, all lines are [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)"), meaning that every line can be obtained by moving a specific line. However, lines may play special roles with respect to other [geometric objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_object "Geometric object") and can be classified according to that relationship.

For instance, with respect to a [conic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section") (a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"), [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"), or [hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola")), lines can be:

*   [tangent lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line "Tangent line"), which touch the conic at a single point;
*   [secant lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line "Secant line"), which intersect the conic at two points and pass through its interior;[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-cag-5)
*   exterior lines, which do not meet the conic at any point of the Euclidean plane; or
*   a [directrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directrix_of_a_conic_section "Directrix of a conic section"), whose distance from a point helps to establish whether the point is on the conic.
*   a [coordinate line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_line "Coordinate line"), a linear coordinate dimension

In the context of determining [parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)") in Euclidean geometry, a [transversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversal_(geometry) "Transversal (geometry)") is a line that intersects two other lines that may or not be parallel to each other.

For more general [algebraic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve "Algebraic curve"), lines could also be:

*   _i_-secant lines, meeting the curve in _i_ points counted without multiplicity, or
*   [asymptotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote "Asymptote"), which a curve approaches arbitrarily closely without touching it.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-6)

With respect to [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_triangle "Euclidean triangle") we have:

*   the [Euler line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_line "Euler line"),
*   the [Simson lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simson_line "Simson line"), and
*   [central lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_line_(geometry) "Central line (geometry)").

For a [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon "Convex polygon")[quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral "Quadrilateral") with at most two parallel sides, the [Newton line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_line "Newton line") is the line that connects the midpoints of the two [diagonals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal "Diagonal").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-Alsina-7)

For a [hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon "Hexagon") with vertices lying on a conic we have the [Pascal line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_line "Pascal line") and, in the special case where the conic is a pair of lines, we have the [Pappus line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus%27s_hexagon_theorem "Pappus's hexagon theorem").

[Parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)") are lines in the same plane that never cross. [Intersecting lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-line_intersection "Line-line intersection") share a single point in common. Coincidental lines coincide with each other—every point that is on either one of them is also on the other.

[Perpendicular lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular_lines "Perpendicular lines") are lines that intersect at [right angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-8)

In [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"), [skew lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_lines "Skew lines") are lines that are not in the same plane and thus do not intersect each other.

### In axiomatic systems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Line_(geometry)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: In axiomatic systems")]

In [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry"), the concept of a line is often considered as a [primitive notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion "Primitive notion"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-:0-1): 95  meaning it is not being defined by using other concepts, but it is defined by the properties, called [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom"), that it must satisfy.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-9)

However, the [axiomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic "Axiomatic") definition of a line does not explain the relevance of the concept and is often too abstract for beginners. So, the definition is often replaced or completed by a _mental image_ or _intuitive description_ that allows understanding what is a line. Such descriptions are sometimes referred to as definitions, but are not true definitions since they cannot used in [mathematical proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof "Mathematical proof"). The "definition" of line in [Euclid's Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements") falls into this category;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-:0-1): 95  and is never used in proofs of theorems.

[![Image 5: y = –x + 5 (going down) and y = 0.5x + 2 (rising up slower)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Linear_Function_Graph.svg/250px-Linear_Function_Graph.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Linear_Function_Graph.svg)

Line graphs of linear equations on the Cartesian plane 

Lines in a Cartesian plane or, more generally, in [affine coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_coordinates "Affine coordinates"), are characterized by linear equations. More precisely, every line ![Image 6: {\displaystyle L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8) (including vertical lines) is the set of all points whose [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") (_x_, _y_) satisfy a linear equation; that is, ![Image 7: {\displaystyle L=\{(x,y)\mid ax+by=c\},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b49dffab0006b05fb8da66387669868fd40ede4c) where _a_, _b_ and _c_ are fixed [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") (called [coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient "Coefficient")) such that _a_ and _b_ are not both zero. Using this form, vertical lines correspond to equations with _b_ = 0.

One can further suppose either _c_ = 1 or _c_ = 0, by dividing everything by c if it is not zero.

There are many variant ways to write the equation of a line which can all be converted from one to another by algebraic manipulation. The above form is sometimes called the _standard form_. If the constant term is put on the left, the equation becomes ![Image 8: {\displaystyle ax+by-c=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4c28ba9744dac2063e4d69b5c5fa37027200ff9) and this is sometimes called the _general form_ of the equation. However, this terminology is not universally accepted, and many authors do not distinguish these two forms.

These forms are generally named by the type of information (data) about the line that is needed to write down the form. Some of the important data of a line is its slope, [x-intercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_function "Root of a function"), known points on the line and y-intercept.

The equation of the line passing through two different points ![Image 9: {\displaystyle P_{0}(x_{0},y_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790258f54caa2174829600a72cfe3d9c382bb236) and ![Image 10: {\displaystyle P_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f77f7847f91f2dcff6931e1e2f0a2af86e8e303) may be written as ![Image 11: {\displaystyle (y-y_{0})(x_{1}-x_{0})=(y_{1}-y_{0})(x-x_{0}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e57d9f5eed52df7ee5d785a08e2096ab5b0c9315) If _x_ 0 ≠ _x_ 1, this equation may be rewritten as ![Image 12: {\displaystyle y=(x-x_{0})\,{\frac {y_{1}-y_{0}}{x_{1}-x_{0}}}+y_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7043dd49810b162a61503b5c8a37dfec19c61572) or ![Image 13: {\displaystyle y=x\,{\frac {y_{1}-y_{0}}{x_{1}-x_{0}}}+{\frac {x_{1}y_{0}-x_{0}y_{1}}{x_{1}-x_{0}}}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e9f5c8918819e16bde475c1be53b41455ea8b370)In [two dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)"), the equation for non-vertical lines is often given in the _[slope–intercept form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope%E2%80%93intercept\_form "Slope–intercept form")_:

![Image 14: {\displaystyle y=mx+b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/25e966621217067985694be3afd6801d7d51c5d8) where:

*   _m_ is the [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") or [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") of the line.
*   _b_ is the [y-intercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-intercept "Y-intercept") of the line.
*   _x_ is the [independent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_variable "Independent variable") of the function _y_ = _f_(_x_).

The slope of the line through points ![Image 15: {\displaystyle A(x_{a},y_{a})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/756007ccf0eb7e57f1041876668e4089b50d85c1) and ![Image 16: {\displaystyle B(x_{b},y_{b})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8aa020793b15153eb47b78047ade413fac3a916c), when ![Image 17: {\displaystyle x_{a}\neq x_{b}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c77a3b0f2db84eeabb0c16e97f57c9a8471fe8c), is given by ![Image 18: {\displaystyle m=(y_{b}-y_{a})/(x_{b}-x_{a})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8061feae78adbc20825d09f0c6d043434fea51c8) and the equation of this line can be written ![Image 19: {\displaystyle y=m(x-x_{a})+y_{a}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e6f7afbfdbd3c40cac3d695ed2e7f33a7e5bd24e).

As a note, lines in three dimensions may also be described as the simultaneous solutions of two [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation")![Image 20: {\displaystyle a_{1}x+b_{1}y+c_{1}z-d_{1}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d11e8550aa514f5868a1cdf0cd6ffaf76579ad9c)![Image 21: {\displaystyle a_{2}x+b_{2}y+c_{2}z-d_{2}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dceac197a396bab87e5869c9215c716788c0ca06) such that ![Image 22: {\displaystyle (a_{1},b_{1},c_{1})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/840401a77fbcee727591e87621f05597bf5c48ed) and ![Image 23: {\displaystyle (a_{2},b_{2},c_{2})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2ee2f5e52386ce4de84b40d0ab249073d141182e) are not proportional (the relations ![Image 24: {\displaystyle a_{1}=ta_{2},b_{1}=tb_{2},c_{1}=tc_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e12d0b4bad137b31491a206a04e1dd20afefa7b9) imply ![Image 25: {\displaystyle t=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/43469ec032d858feae5aa87029e22eaaf0109e9c)). This follows since in three dimensions a single linear equation typically describes a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") and a line is what is common to two distinct intersecting planes.

### Parametric equation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Line_(geometry)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Parametric equation")]

Parametric equations are also used to specify lines, particularly in those in [three dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") or more because in more than two dimensions lines _cannot_ be described by a single linear equation.

In three dimensions lines are frequently described by parametric equations: ![Image 26: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=x_{0}+at\\y&=y_{0}+bt\\z&=z_{0}+ct\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d8e35a1cc036bde8aeba3224281797bab938cb9c) where:

*   _x_, _y_, and _z_ are all functions of the independent variable _t_ which ranges over the real numbers.
*   (_x_ 0, _y_ 0, _z_ 0) is any point on the line.
*   _a_, _b_, and _c_ are related to the slope of the line, such that the direction [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)") (_a_, _b_, _c_) is parallel to the line.

Parametric equations for lines in higher dimensions are similar in that they are based on the specification of one point on the line and a direction vector.

[![Image 27](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Hesse_normalenform.svg/250px-Hesse_normalenform.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hesse_normalenform.svg)

Distance from the origin O to the line E calculated with the Hesse normal form. Normal vector in red, line in green, point O shown in blue.

The _normal form_ (also called the _Hesse normal form_,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-10) after the German mathematician [Ludwig Otto Hesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Hesse "Otto Hesse")), is based on the _[normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal\_(geometry) "Normal (geometry)") segment_ for a given line, which is defined to be the line segment drawn from the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)") perpendicular to the line. This segment joins the origin with the closest point on the line to the origin. The normal form of the equation of a straight line on the plane is given by: ![Image 28: {\displaystyle x\cos \varphi +y\sin \varphi -p=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7c6dfb5411ffd27af998705038bd923c8d9c5925) where ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \varphi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e) is the angle of inclination of the normal segment (the oriented angle from the unit vector of the _x_-axis to this segment), and _p_ is the (positive) length of the normal segment. The normal form can be derived from the standard form ![Image 30: {\displaystyle ax+by=c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2a39c048e6c827a005e417be0e1bd5ac314e6fcc) by dividing all of the coefficients by ![Image 31: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4f587e6751cec28b958220527a3e56eafc1dde6) and also multiplying through by ![Image 32: {\displaystyle -1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/704fb0427140d054dd267925495e78164fee9aac) if ![Image 33: {\displaystyle c<0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8011e2d4f5839276962a41c0548f82a06a367f9d)

Unlike the slope-intercept and intercept forms, this form can represent any line but also requires only two finite parameters, ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \varphi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e) and _p_, to be specified.

The vector equation of the line through points A and B is given by ![Image 39: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =\mathbf {OA} +\lambda \,\mathbf {AB} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10605183f37694d67ebdd7105804d594f975582e) (where λ is a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)")).

If **a** is vector **OA** and **b** is vector **OB**, then the equation of the line can be written: ![Image 40: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =\mathbf {a} +\lambda (\mathbf {b} -\mathbf {a} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52f9abe450869e0604f7a415aa53dfc27bba09d8).

A ray starting at point _A_ is described by limiting λ. One ray is obtained if λ ≥ 0, and the opposite ray comes from λ ≤ 0.

A line on polar coordinates without passing though the origin, with the general parametric equation written above

In a [Cartesian plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_plane "Cartesian plane"), [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates "Polar coordinates")(_r_, _θ_) are related to [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") by the parametric equations:[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-11)![Image 42: {\displaystyle x=r\cos \theta ,\quad y=r\sin \theta .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e5ecc44a2fec7caf2dd2dc6189ae31eaa69938ee)

In polar coordinates, the equation of a line not passing through the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)")—the point with coordinates (0, 0)—can be written ![Image 43: {\displaystyle r={\frac {p}{\cos(\theta -\varphi )}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1dc1fc7d0214f9e8ae685dd016f840cf7a9d11e3) with _r_> 0 and ![Image 44: {\displaystyle \varphi -\pi /2<\theta <\varphi +\pi /2.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1694f9a16a0c3a2324ca2068282897fd88f9cadd) Here, p is the (positive) length of the [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") perpendicular to the line and delimited by the origin and the line, and ![Image 45: {\displaystyle \varphi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e) is the (oriented) angle from the x-axis to this segment.

It may be useful to express the equation in terms of the angle ![Image 46: {\displaystyle \alpha =\varphi +\pi /2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c28db914f67e20c12ebedbf900be6d19df969018) between the x-axis and the line. In this case, the equation becomes ![Image 47: {\displaystyle r={\frac {p}{\sin(\theta -\alpha )}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/11ca43cc874d1c19bd50d2e0751a45618f7473da) with _r_> 0 and ![Image 48: {\displaystyle 0<\theta <\alpha +\pi .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ddc2406024931342d6151fbedf13c84f7e9c05d2)

These equations can be derived from the [normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#Normal_form) of the line equation by setting ![Image 49: {\displaystyle x=r\cos \theta ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a49219c64be0e28284ecb8dd2b54ad2dde032eb3) and ![Image 50: {\displaystyle y=r\sin \theta ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c152bfb713a31e032a683af582c243eaa790562c) and then applying the [angle difference identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_difference_identities "Angle difference identities") for sine or cosine.

These equations can also be proven [geometrically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") by applying [right triangle definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions#Right-angled_triangle_definitions "Trigonometric functions") of sine and cosine to the [right triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle") that has a point of the line and the origin as vertices, and the line and its perpendicular through the origin as sides.

The previous forms do not apply for a line passing through the origin, but a simpler formula can be written: the polar coordinates ![Image 51: {\displaystyle (r,\theta )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed8396fdc359fb06c93722137c959e7496e47ed6) of the points of a line passing through the origin and making an angle of ![Image 52: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3) with the x-axis, are the pairs ![Image 53: {\displaystyle (r,\theta )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed8396fdc359fb06c93722137c959e7496e47ed6) such that ![Image 54: {\displaystyle r\geq 0,\qquad {\text{and}}\quad \theta =\alpha \quad {\text{or}}\quad \theta =\alpha +\pi .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/223e27aa7b5ab790c71e2eed0acbadc782508aff)

In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described. For instance, in [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given [linear equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation"), but in a more abstract setting, such as [incidence geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry "Incidence geometry"), a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it.

When a geometry is described by a set of [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom"), the notion of a line is usually left undefined (a so-called [primitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion "Primitive notion") object). The properties of lines are then determined by the axioms which refer to them. One advantage to this approach is the flexibility it gives to users of the geometry. Thus in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), a line may be interpreted as a [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") (shortest path between points), while in some [projective geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"), a line is a 2-dimensional vector space (all linear combinations of two independent vectors). This flexibility also extends beyond mathematics and, for example, permits physicists to think of the path of a light ray as being a line.

### Projective geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Line_(geometry)&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Projective geometry")]

[![Image 55](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Great_circle_hemispheres.png/250px-Great_circle_hemispheres.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Great_circle_hemispheres.png)

A great circle divides the sphere in two equal hemispheres, while also satisfying the "no curvature" property.

In many models of [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"), the representation of a line rarely conforms to the notion of the "straight curve" as it is visualised in Euclidean geometry. In [elliptic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry") we see a typical example of this.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-:0-1): 108  In the spherical representation of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by [great circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle") of a sphere with diametrically opposite points identified. In a different model of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by Euclidean [planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") passing through the origin. Even though these representations are visually distinct, they satisfy all the properties (such as, two points determining a unique line) that make them suitable representations for lines in this geometry.

The "shortness" and "straightness" of a line, interpreted as the property that the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance") along the line between any two of its points is minimized (see [triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality "Triangle inequality")), can be generalized and leads to the concept of [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") in [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space").

[![Image 56: Ray](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Ray_%28A%2C_B%2C_C%29.svg/250px-Ray_%28A%2C_B%2C_C%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ray_(A,_B,_C).svg)

A ray with a terminus at A, with two points B and C on the right

Given a line and any point _A_ on it, we may consider _A_ as decomposing this line into two parts. Each such part is called a **ray** and the point _A_ is called its _initial point_. It is also known as **half-line** (sometimes, a **half-axis** if it plays a distinct role, e.g., as part of a [coordinate axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_axis "Coordinate axis")). It is a one-dimensional [half-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-space_(geometry) "Half-space (geometry)"). The point A is considered to be a member of the ray.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-12) Intuitively, a ray consists of those points on a line passing through _A_ and proceeding indefinitely, starting at _A_, in one direction only along the line. However, in order to use this concept of a ray in proofs a more precise definition is required.

Given distinct points _A_ and _B_, they determine a unique ray with initial point _A_. As two points define a unique line, this ray consists of all the points between _A_ and _B_ (including _A_ and _B_) and all the points _C_ on the line through _A_ and _B_ such that _B_ is between _A_ and _C_.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-13) This is, at times, also expressed as the set of all points _C_ on the line determined by _A_ and _B_ such that _A_ is not between _B_ and _C_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-14) A point _D_, on the line determined by _A_ and _B_ but not in the ray with initial point _A_ determined by _B_, will determine another ray with initial point _A_. With respect to the _AB_ ray, the _AD_ ray is called the _opposite ray_.

Thus, we would say that two different points, _A_ and _B_, define a line and a decomposition of this line into the [disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union "Disjoint union") of an open segment (_A_, _B_) and two rays, _BC_ and _AD_ (the point _D_ is not drawn in the diagram, but is to the left of _A_ on the line _AB_). These are not opposite rays since they have different initial points.

In Euclidean geometry two rays with a common endpoint form an [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-15)

The definition of a ray depends upon the notion of betweenness for points on a line. It follows that rays exist only for geometries for which this notion exists, typically [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") or [affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry") over an [ordered field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field "Ordered field"). On the other hand, rays do not exist in [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry") nor in a geometry over a non-ordered field, like the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") or any [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field").

Drawing of a line segment "AB" on the line "a"

A [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points and contains every point on the line between its end points. Depending on how the line segment is defined, either of the two end points may or may not be part of the line segment. Two or more line segments may have some of the same relationships as lines, such as being parallel, intersecting, or skew, but unlike lines they may be none of these, if they are [coplanar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coplanar "Coplanar") and either do not intersect or are [collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity "Collinearity").

[![Image 58: see caption](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Number_line_with_x_smaller_than_y.svg/250px-Number_line_with_x_smaller_than_y.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Number_line_with_x_smaller_than_y.svg)

A number line, with variable x on the left and y on the right. Therefore, x is smaller than y.

A point on number line corresponds to a [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") and vice versa.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-16) Usually, [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") are evenly spaced on the line, with positive numbers are on the right, negative numbers on the left. As an extension to the concept, an [imaginary line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_line_(mathematics) "Imaginary line (mathematics)") representing [imaginary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number "Imaginary number") can be drawn perpendicular to the number line at zero.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry)#cite_note-17) The two lines forms the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane"), a geometrical representation of the set of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number").
