The northern and southern parts of Randolph are within the White Mountain National Forest and the Ice Gulch Town Forest, while the central part is the settled portion of town. As of the 2020 census , the town had a population of 328.

[ 2 ] Randolph is part of the Berlin, NH-VT Micropolitan Statistical Area .

History [ edit ] Randolph was incorporated in 1824, after being originally granted as "Durand" in 1772. The town was named after John Randolph , a Virginia congressman and senator, and a descendant of Pocahontas .

[ 3 ] Geography [ edit ] View of the Randolph Hill section of town from Dome Rock The Randolph Valley section of town as seen looking south from Mt. Crescent . Mounts Madison and Adams of the Presidential Range rise above the town limits to the south.

According to the United States Census Bureau , the town has a total area of 47.1 square miles (122.0 km 2 ), of which 47.0 square miles (121.8 km 2 ) are land and 0.077 square miles (0.2 km 2 ) are water, comprising 0.13% of the town.

[ 1 ] Randolph's geography is mountainous. The south side of the town includes the northern slopes of the Presidentials. The north side of the town includes four main mountains: Mount Crescent , Black Crescent Mountain , Mount Randolph and Pond Hill. Dividing the northerly slopes from the southerly slopes is U.S. Route 2. There are no trails maintained to the top of Black Crescent Mountain or Pond Hill. The highest point in Randolph is on the town's southern border, atop a 3,950-foot (1,200 m) knob on Howker Ridge, a spur of Mount Madison .

The settled part of Randolph is divided into two main areas: Randolph "valley", where town hall is, and Randolph Hill, which has several roads all connected to a main road called Randolph Hill Road. Randolph Hill has the site of the Mt. Crescent House (hotel), which opened in 1883 as the "Randolph Hill House" and was torn down in 1971. Randolph also had "Ravine House" on Durand Road, straight north of the Appalachia trailhead. Other sections of town include the area west of Durand Road, which includes Valley Road and a number of houses along Route 2, towards Jefferson . The main Randolph train station was at Appalachia. Other, secondary stations included "Randolph East" on the Dolly Copp (or "Pinkham B") Road, and Bowman, at the height of land to the west.

Adjacent municipalities [ edit ] Berlin (north) Gorham (east) Thompson and Meserve's Purchase (southeast) Low and Burbank's Grant (south) Jefferson (west) Kilkenny (northwest) Climate [ edit ] Temperatures in the summer can reach nearly 100 °F (38 °C), though that is exceedingly rare, with summer days seldom getting above the 80s (°F) and summer nights frequently being in the 50s or even the 40s. Temperatures in the winter can be below −40 °F (−40 °C).  Ice Gulch, in the forest in the northern part of Randolph, contains the largest known subalpine cold-air talus barren in New Hampshire , with a microclimate significantly colder than the rest of the town, containing ice blocks that sometimes survive the entire summer without melting.

Many houses in Randolph are summer/vacation homes.  Historically, vacationers tended to visit the hotels, reachable by horse-drawn carriage from the Randolph train station; but as the automobile became more popular, the hotels declined and private vacation homes became more prevalent.  Vacationing in the far north was particularly advantageous before the air conditioner became common, as Randolph summers are rarely very hot—and never hot at all in the higher mountain areas.

[ citation needed ] Parks and recreation [ edit ] The Randolph Mountain Club was founded in 1910, with the primary goal of restoring trails destroyed by logging.

[ 7 ] The club's mission is "to promote the enjoyment of the Randolph area through hiking, trail development and maintenance, upkeep of camps and shelters, and the sharing of the collective knowledge of its members." [ 8 ] The club operates four camps in the White Mountain National Forest—two enclosed cabins and two semi-enclosed shelters—with a caretaker in residence year-round.

There are two artificial lakes (or ponds) in Randolph: Durand Lake is present year-round, and Ravine House Pool exists in summer from the damming of a mountain stream. There are tennis courts near the Ravine House Pool. All of these facilities are owned by the Town of Randolph and maintained in cooperation with the Randolph Foundation.
