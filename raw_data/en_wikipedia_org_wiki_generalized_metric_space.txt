In mathematics, specifically in category theory , a generalized metric space is a metric space but without the symmetry property and some other properties.

[ 1 ] Precisely, it is a category enriched over [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle [0,\infty ]} , the one-point compactification of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } . The notion was introduced in 1973 by Lawvere who noticed that a metric space can be viewed as a particular kind of a category.

The categorical point of view is useful since by Yoneda's lemma , a generalized metric space can be embedded into a much larger category in which, for instance, one can construct the Cauchy completion of the space.

Notes [ edit ] ^ namely, the property that distinct elements have nonzero distance between them and the property that the distance between two elements is always finite.
