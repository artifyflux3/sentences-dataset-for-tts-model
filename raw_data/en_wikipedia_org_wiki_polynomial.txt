In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **polynomial** is a [mathematical expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics) "Expression (mathematics)") consisting of [indeterminates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminate_(variable) "Indeterminate (variable)") (also called [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)")) and [coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient "Coefficient"), that involves only the operations of [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition"), [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction"), [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication") and [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation") to [nonnegative integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonnegative_integer "Nonnegative integer") powers, and has a finite number of terms.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-5) An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate _x_ is _x_ 2 − 4 _x_ + 7. An example with three indeterminates is _x_ 3 + 2 _xyz_ 2 − _yz_ + 1.

Polynomials appear in many areas of mathematics and science. For example, they are used to form [polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation "Polynomial equation"), which encode a wide range of problems, from elementary [word problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_(mathematics_education) "Word problem (mathematics education)") to complicated scientific problems; they are used to define **polynomial functions**, which appear in settings ranging from basic [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") to [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics") and [social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science "Social science"); and they are used in [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") and [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis "Numerical analysis") to approximate other functions. In advanced mathematics, polynomials are used to construct [polynomial rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring "Polynomial ring") and [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety"), which are central concepts in [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") and [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry").

The word _polynomial_[joins two diverse roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_word "Hybrid word"): the Greek _poly_, meaning "many", and the Latin _nomen_, or "name". It was derived from the term _[binomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial\_(polynomial) "Binomial (polynomial)")_ by replacing the Latin root _bi-_ with the Greek _poly-_. That is, it means a sum of many terms (many [monomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial "Monomial")). The word _polynomial_ was first used in the 17th century.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-6)

Notation and terminology
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polynomial&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Notation and terminology")]

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Polynomialdeg3.svg/250px-Polynomialdeg3.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Polynomialdeg3.svg)

The [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of a polynomial function of degree 3

The _x_ occurring in a polynomial is commonly called a _variable_ or an _indeterminate_. When the polynomial is considered as an expression, _x_ is a fixed symbol which does not have any value (its value is "indeterminate"). However, when one considers the [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") defined by the polynomial, then _x_ represents the argument of the function, and is therefore called a "variable". Many authors use these two words interchangeably.

A polynomial _P_ in the indeterminate _x_ is commonly denoted either as _P_ or as _P_(_x_). Formally, the name of the polynomial is _P_, not _P_(_x_), but the use of the [functional notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_notation "Functional notation")_P_(_x_) dates from a time when the distinction between a polynomial and the associated function was unclear. Moreover, the functional notation is often useful for specifying, in a single phrase, a polynomial and its indeterminate. For example, "let _P_(_x_) be a polynomial" is a shorthand for "let _P_ be a polynomial in the indeterminate _x_". On the other hand, when it is not necessary to emphasize the name of the indeterminate, many formulas are much simpler and easier to read if the name(s) of the indeterminate(s) do not appear at each occurrence of the polynomial.

The ambiguity of having two notations for a single mathematical object may be formally resolved by considering the general meaning of the functional notation for polynomials. If _a_ denotes a number, a variable, another polynomial, or, more generally, any expression, then _P_(_a_) denotes, by convention, the result of substituting _a_ for _x_ in _P_. Thus, the polynomial _P_ defines the function ![Image 2: {\displaystyle a\mapsto P(a),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/80ac11962a475fafca00dce1ecc1524986b5afbd) which is the _polynomial function_ associated to _P_. Frequently, when using this notation, one supposes that _a_ is a number. However, one may use it over any domain where addition and multiplication are defined (that is, any [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)")). In particular, if _a_ is a polynomial then _P_(_a_) is also a polynomial.

More specifically, when _a_ is the indeterminate _x_, then the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)") of _x_ by this function is the polynomial _P_ itself (substituting _x_ for _x_ does not change anything). In other words, ![Image 3: {\displaystyle P(x)=P,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb7117c512c36d059063286480e1d9ef81310030) which justifies formally the existence of two notations for the same polynomial.

A _polynomial expression_ is an [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics) "Expression (mathematics)") that can be built from [constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(mathematics) "Constant (mathematics)") and symbols called _variables_ or _indeterminates_ by means of [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition"), [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication") and [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation") to a [non-negative integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_integer "Non-negative integer") power. The constants are generally [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number"), but may be any expression that do not involve the indeterminates, and represent [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") that can be added and multiplied. Two polynomial expressions are considered as defining the same _polynomial_ if they may be transformed, one to the other, by applying the usual properties of [commutativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property "Commutative property"), [associativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property "Associative property") and [distributivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property "Distributive property") of addition and multiplication. For example ![Image 4: {\displaystyle (x-1)(x-2)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8531d6e3eb9f6d3a798cf9593ff8dfeda8475446) and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle x^{2}-3x+2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8a41e6650022d8d264fa45b1eeb530c85d6c8235) are two polynomial expressions that represent the same polynomial; so, one has the [equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics) "Equality (mathematics)")![Image 6: {\displaystyle (x-1)(x-2)=x^{2}-3x+2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe365de84c197cf23ea2aacbe83154f42103c474).

A polynomial in a single indeterminate _x_ can always be written (or rewritten) in the form ![Image 7: {\displaystyle a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dotsb +a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e90604c4b13e7695572308d60f7ecc889484108c) where ![Image 8: {\displaystyle a_{0},\ldots ,a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/403d004cd76aacd38b6432fdc449ddbc226075f7) are constants that are called the _coefficients_ of the polynomial, and ![Image 9: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) is the indeterminate.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-:1-7) The word "indeterminate" means that ![Image 10: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) represents no particular value, although any value may be substituted for it. The mapping that associates the result of this substitution to the substituted value is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)"), called a _polynomial function_.

This can be expressed more concisely by using [summation notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation#Capital-sigma_notation "Summation"): ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \sum _{k=0}^{n}a_{k}x^{k}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/09ed204b80acdcf6f853e704999d24d8a7d4a076) That is, a polynomial can either be zero or can be written as the sum of a finite number of non-zero [terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summand "Summand"). Each term consists of the product of a number– called the [coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient "Coefficient") of the term[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-8)– and a finite number of indeterminates, raised to non-negative integer powers.

The exponent on an indeterminate in a term is called the degree of that indeterminate in that term; the degree of the term is the sum of the degrees of the indeterminates in that term, and the degree of a polynomial is the largest degree of any term with nonzero coefficient.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-:2-9) Because _x_ = _x_ 1, the degree of an indeterminate without a written exponent is one.

A term with no indeterminates and a polynomial with no indeterminates are called, respectively, a [constant term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_term "Constant term") and a **constant polynomial**.[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-10) The degree of a constant term and of a nonzero constant polynomial is 0. The degree of the zero polynomial 0 (which has no terms at all) is generally treated as not defined (but see below).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-Barbeau-2003-pp1-2-11)

For example: ![Image 12: {\displaystyle -5x^{2}y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8437cbad6fdcaf0ccbbc33654f5203b8358f3daf) is a term. The coefficient is −5, the indeterminates are _x_ and _y_, the degree of _x_ is two, while the degree of _y_ is one. The degree of the entire term is the sum of the degrees of each indeterminate in it, so in this example the degree is 2 + 1 = 3.

Forming a sum of several terms produces a polynomial. For example, the following is a polynomial: ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \underbrace {_{\,}3x^{2}} _{\begin{smallmatrix}\mathrm {term} \\\mathrm {1} \end{smallmatrix}}\underbrace {-_{\,}5x} _{\begin{smallmatrix}\mathrm {term} \\\mathrm {2} \end{smallmatrix}}\underbrace {+_{\,}4} _{\begin{smallmatrix}\mathrm {term} \\\mathrm {3} \end{smallmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/519f66849a58f888a09d7e3e079155885d6f7e72) It consists of three terms: the first is degree two, the second is degree one, and the third is degree zero.

Polynomials of small degree have been given specific names. A polynomial of degree zero is a _constant polynomial_, or simply a _constant_. Polynomials of degree one, two or three are respectively _linear polynomials,_ _[quadratic polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_polynomial "Quadratic polynomial")_ and _cubic polynomials_.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-:2-9) For higher degrees, the specific names are not commonly used, although _quartic polynomial_ (for degree four) and _quintic polynomial_ (for degree five) are sometimes used. The names for the degrees may be applied to the polynomial or to its terms. For example, the term 2 _x_ in _x_ 2 + 2 _x_ + 1 is a linear term in a quadratic polynomial.

The polynomial 0, which may be considered to have no terms at all, is called the **zero polynomial**. Unlike other constant polynomials, its degree is not zero. Rather, the degree of the zero polynomial is either left explicitly undefined, or defined as negative (either −1 or −∞).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-12) The zero polynomial is also unique in that it is the only polynomial in one indeterminate that has an infinite number of [roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_function "Root of a function"). The graph of the zero polynomial, _f_(_x_) = 0, is the _x_-axis.

In the case of polynomials in more than one indeterminate, a polynomial is called _homogeneous_ of degree _n_ if _all_ of its non-zero terms have degree _n_. The zero polynomial is homogeneous, and, as a homogeneous polynomial, its degree is undefined.[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-13) For example, _x_ 3 _y_ 2 + 7 _x_ 2 _y_ 3 − 3 _x_ 5 is homogeneous of degree 5. For more details, see [Homogeneous polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial "Homogeneous polynomial").

The [commutative law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_law "Commutative law") of addition can be used to rearrange terms into any preferred order. In polynomials with one indeterminate, the terms are usually ordered according to degree, either in "descending powers of _x_", with the term of largest degree first, or in "ascending powers of _x_". The polynomial 3 _x_ 2 − 5 _x_ + 4 is written in descending powers of _x_. The first term has coefficient 3, indeterminate _x_, and exponent 2. In the second term, the coefficient is −5. The third term is a constant. Because the _degree_ of a non-zero polynomial is the largest degree of any one term, this polynomial has degree two.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-14)

Two terms with the same indeterminates raised to the same powers are called "similar terms" or "like terms", and they can be combined, using the [distributive law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_law "Distributive law"), into a single term whose coefficient is the sum of the coefficients of the terms that were combined. It may happen that this makes the coefficient 0.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-Edwards-1995-p47-15) Polynomials can be classified by the number of terms with nonzero coefficients, so that a one-term polynomial is called a [monomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial "Monomial"),[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-16) a two-term polynomial is called a [binomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_(polynomial) "Binomial (polynomial)"), and a three-term polynomial is called a [trinomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinomial "Trinomial").

A **real polynomial** is a polynomial with [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") coefficients. When it is used to define a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)"), the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(function) "Domain (function)") is not so restricted. However, a **real polynomial function** is a function from the reals to the reals that is defined by a real polynomial. Similarly, an **integer polynomial** is a polynomial with [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") coefficients, and a **complex polynomial** is a polynomial with [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") coefficients.

A polynomial in one indeterminate is called a **univariate polynomial**, a polynomial in more than one indeterminate is called a **multivariate polynomial**. A polynomial with two indeterminates is called a **bivariate polynomial**.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-:1-7) These notions refer more to the kind of polynomials one is generally working with than to individual polynomials; for instance, when working with univariate polynomials, one does not exclude constant polynomials (which may result from the subtraction of non-constant polynomials), although strictly speaking, constant polynomials do not contain any indeterminates at all. It is possible to further classify multivariate polynomials as _bivariate_, _trivariate_, and so on, according to the maximum number of indeterminates allowed. Again, so that the set of objects under consideration be closed under subtraction, a study of trivariate polynomials usually allows bivariate polynomials, and so on. It is also common to say simply "polynomials in _x_, _y_, and _z_", listing the indeterminates allowed.

### Addition and subtraction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polynomial&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Addition and subtraction")]

Polynomials can be added using the [associative law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_law "Associative law") of addition (grouping all their terms together into a single sum), possibly followed by reordering (using the [commutative law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_law "Commutative law")) and combining of like terms.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-Edwards-1995-p47-15)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-17) For example, if ![Image 14: {\displaystyle P=3x^{2}-2x+5xy-2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dd58f2a5833b24767d967d92202ca5d97c64f87f) and ![Image 15: {\displaystyle Q=-3x^{2}+3x+4y^{2}+8}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/63df111693a9c14a89bbac05fe75f5f76530e2e4) then the sum ![Image 16: {\displaystyle P+Q=3x^{2}-2x+5xy-2-3x^{2}+3x+4y^{2}+8}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab6ced222ea3f8d5ae591a7b02dfebaf6ea1338e) can be reordered and regrouped as ![Image 17: {\displaystyle P+Q=(3x^{2}-3x^{2})+(-2x+3x)+5xy+4y^{2}+(8-2)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4cfa0581ff9256f598e15df43b2d26e95229453c) and then simplified to ![Image 18: {\displaystyle P+Q=x+5xy+4y^{2}+6.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3e1ff44450f1e8474afdf0451800d4a128fa075d) When polynomials are added together, the result is another polynomial.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-:0-18)

Subtraction of polynomials is similar.

Polynomials can also be multiplied. To expand the [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics) "Product (mathematics)") of two polynomials into a sum of terms, the distributive law is repeatedly applied, which results in each term of one polynomial being multiplied by every term of the other.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-Edwards-1995-p47-15) For example, if ![Image 19: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\color {Red}P&\color {Red}{=2x+3y+5}\\\color {Blue}Q&\color {Blue}{=2x+5y+xy+1}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b12ff6b2647b96c25f58880ee913305d1e75bd29) then ![Image 20: {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rccrcrcrcr}{\color {Red}{P}}{\color {Blue}{Q}}&{=}&&({\color {Red}{2x}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{2x}})&+&({\color {Red}{2x}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{5y}})&+&({\color {Red}{2x}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{xy}})&+&({\color {Red}{2x}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{1}})\\&&+&({\color {Red}{3y}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{2x}})&+&({\color {Red}{3y}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{5y}})&+&({\color {Red}{3y}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{xy}})&+&({\color {Red}{3y}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{1}})\\&&+&({\color {Red}{5}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{2x}})&+&({\color {Red}{5}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{5y}})&+&({\color {Red}{5}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{xy}})&+&({\color {Red}{5}}\cdot {\color {Blue}{1}})\end{array}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc195210ff9c8de159f149cc8592d152491d73d5) Carrying out the multiplication in each term produces ![Image 21: {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rccrcrcrcr}PQ&=&&4x^{2}&+&10xy&+&2x^{2}y&+&2x\\&&+&6xy&+&15y^{2}&+&3xy^{2}&+&3y\\&&+&10x&+&25y&+&5xy&+&5.\end{array}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9f082545d28b0eff0d4e39f45fd96cb8621d5fd) Combining similar terms yields ![Image 22: {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rcccrcrcrcr}PQ&=&&4x^{2}&+&(10xy+6xy+5xy)&+&2x^{2}y&+&(2x+10x)\\&&+&15y^{2}&+&3xy^{2}&+&(3y+25y)&+&5\end{array}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4a456c047e979efaf41ecc8b0fae753a03675ad3) which can be simplified to ![Image 23: {\displaystyle PQ=4x^{2}+21xy+2x^{2}y+12x+15y^{2}+3xy^{2}+28y+5.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e6792dbf53f6399df0dac6e1fd7845c9de08b54e) As in the example, the product of polynomials is always a polynomial.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-:0-18)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-Barbeau-2003-pp1-2-11)

Given a polynomial ![Image 24: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) of a single variable and another polynomial g of any number of variables, the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition")![Image 25: {\displaystyle f\circ g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2f61ca7838709fbae07dce9c0d513770f10cfae) is obtained by substituting each copy of the variable of the first polynomial by the second polynomial.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-Barbeau-2003-pp1-2-11) For example, if ![Image 26: {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+2x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1639b5547d4cf9dcb437dd018495c196f1a513f0) and ![Image 27: {\displaystyle g(x)=3x+2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d540741ace96ba0a52e9553d483449e75f6b42dd) then ![Image 28: {\displaystyle (f\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))=(3x+2)^{2}+2(3x+2).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cf202107201c88255c32126879d7fa0b174fef2a) A composition may be expanded to a sum of terms using the rules for multiplication and division of polynomials. The composition of two polynomials is another polynomial.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-19)

The division of one polynomial by another is not typically a polynomial. Instead, such ratios are a more general family of objects, called _[rational fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational\_fraction "Rational fraction")_, _rational expressions_, or _[rational functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational\_function "Rational function")_, depending on context.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-20) This is analogous to the fact that the ratio of two [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") is a [rational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"), not necessarily an integer.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-21)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-openstax-22) For example, the fraction 1/(_x_ 2 + 1) is not a polynomial, and it cannot be written as a finite sum of powers of the variable x.

For polynomials in one variable, there is a notion of [Euclidean division of polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division_of_polynomials "Euclidean division of polynomials"), generalizing the [Euclidean division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division "Euclidean division") of integers.[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-23) This notion of the division _a_(_x_)/_b_(_x_) results in two polynomials, a _quotient_ _q_(_x_) and a _remainder_ _r_(_x_), such that _a_ = _b_ _q_ + _r_ and degree(_r_) < degree(_b_). The quotient and remainder may be computed by any of several algorithms, including [polynomial long division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_long_division "Polynomial long division") and [synthetic division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_division "Synthetic division").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-24)

When the denominator _b_(_x_) is [monic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monic_polynomial "Monic polynomial") and linear, that is, _b_(_x_) = _x_ − _c_ for some constant c, then the [polynomial remainder theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_remainder_theorem "Polynomial remainder theorem") asserts that the remainder of the division of _a_(_x_) by _b_(_x_) is the [evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#evaluation)_a_(_c_).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-openstax-22) In this case, the quotient may be computed by [Ruffini's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruffini%27s_rule "Ruffini's rule"), a special case of synthetic division.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-25)

All polynomials with coefficients in a [unique factorization domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_factorization_domain "Unique factorization domain") (for example, the integers or a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")) also have a factored form in which the polynomial is written as a product of [irreducible polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_polynomial "Irreducible polynomial") and a constant. This factored form is unique up to the order of the factors and their multiplication by an invertible constant. In the case of the field of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"), the irreducible factors are linear. Over the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), they have the degree either one or two. Over the integers and the [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") the irreducible factors may have any degree.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-Barbeau-2003-pp80-82-26) For example, the factored form of ![Image 29: {\displaystyle 5x^{3}-5}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db4d1e50aa4cca56c80a7d53c8af5b2fc7140557) is ![Image 30: {\displaystyle 5(x-1)\left(x^{2}+x+1\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b1545345384719a509f7ec5d5b2507d3c785b45) over the integers and the reals, and ![Image 31: {\displaystyle 5(x-1)\left(x+{\frac {1+i{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}\right)\left(x+{\frac {1-i{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/286cd27fa6537dfce68f8621ff6cebb373994446) over the complex numbers.

The computation of the factored form, called _factorization_ is, in general, too difficult to be done by hand-written computation. However, efficient [polynomial factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization_of_polynomials "Factorization of polynomials")[algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") are available in most [computer algebra systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system "Computer algebra system").

Calculating [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") and integrals of polynomials is particularly simple, compared to other kinds of functions. The [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of the polynomial ![Image 32: {\displaystyle P=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots +a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}=\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}x^{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/628d133fbe28d6dfec79d2632a2b972ac133eb10) with respect to x is the polynomial ![Image 33: {\displaystyle na_{n}x^{n-1}+(n-1)a_{n-1}x^{n-2}+\dots +2a_{2}x+a_{1}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}ia_{i}x^{i-1}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cf6926cde23aa4aafe0289c42b5ed85d6f6f540) Similarly, the general [antiderivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiderivative "Antiderivative") (or indefinite integral) of ![Image 34: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) is ![Image 35: {\displaystyle {\frac {a_{n}x^{n+1}}{n+1}}+{\frac {a_{n-1}x^{n}}{n}}+\dots +{\frac {a_{2}x^{3}}{3}}+{\frac {a_{1}x^{2}}{2}}+a_{0}x+c=c+\sum _{i=0}^{n}{\frac {a_{i}x^{i+1}}{i+1}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b459ca530b63bd0a93139abd04299297cb833c4) where c is an arbitrary constant. For example, antiderivatives of _x_ 2 + 1 have the form ⁠1/3⁠_x_ 3 + _x_ + _c_.

For polynomials whose coefficients come from more abstract settings (for example, if the coefficients are integers [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic "Modular arithmetic") some [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number")_p_, or elements of an arbitrary ring), the formula for the derivative can still be interpreted formally, with the coefficient _ka_ _k_ understood to mean the sum of k copies of _a_ _k_. For example, over the integers modulo _p_, the derivative of the polynomial _x_ _p_ + _x_ is the polynomial 1.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-Barbeau-2003-pp64-65-27)

Polynomial functions
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polynomial&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Polynomial functions")]

A _polynomial function_ is a function that can be defined by [evaluating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#evaluation) a polynomial. More precisely, a function _f_ of one [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function "Argument of a function") from a given domain is a polynomial function if there exists a polynomial ![Image 36: {\displaystyle a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots +a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f8d770b4e9a5584c7ffed4fbef6136f5ec9c6ef6) that evaluates to ![Image 37: {\displaystyle f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074) for all x in the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function "Domain of a function") of f (here, _n_ is a non-negative integer and _a_ 0, _a_ 1, _a_ 2, ..., _a n_ are constant coefficients).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVarbergPurcellRigdon2007[httpsarchiveorgdetailsmatematika-a-purcell-calculus-9th-edpage38mode1upviewtheaterqpolynomial_38]-28) Generally, unless otherwise specified, polynomial functions have [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") coefficients, arguments, and values. In particular, a polynomial, restricted to have real coefficients, defines a function from the complex numbers to the complex numbers. If the domain of this function is also [restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_a_function "Restriction of a function") to the reals, the resulting function is a [real function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_function "Real function") that maps reals to reals.

For example, the function _f_, defined by ![Image 38: {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}-x,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39f8e8e71eba342e6991cb75d37a9b27e76195fb) is a polynomial function of one variable. Polynomial functions of several variables are similarly defined, using polynomials in more than one indeterminate, as in ![Image 39: {\displaystyle f(x,y)=2x^{3}+4x^{2}y+xy^{5}+y^{2}-7.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f4a86d490b7f529b65aa3643e151129c513494f5) According to the definition of polynomial functions, there may be expressions that obviously are not polynomials but nevertheless define polynomial functions. An example is the expression ![Image 40: {\displaystyle \left({\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}\right)^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cc70da8873463de7c113e184750c55c152996f75) which takes the same values as the polynomial ![Image 41: {\displaystyle 1-x^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/462243d841fc40a3fe3f8f05c2cf637ea867ad41) on the interval ![Image 42: {\displaystyle [-1,1]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/51e3b7f14a6f70e614728c583409a0b9a8b9de01), and thus both expressions define the same polynomial function on this interval.

Every polynomial function is [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"), [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function"), and [entire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entire_function "Entire function").

The [**evaluation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_evaluation "Polynomial evaluation") of a polynomial is the computation of the corresponding polynomial function; that is, the evaluation consists of substituting a numerical value to each indeterminate and carrying out the indicated multiplications and additions.

For polynomials in one indeterminate, the evaluation is usually more efficient (lower number of arithmetic operations to perform) using [Horner's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method "Horner's method"), which consists of rewriting the polynomial as ![Image 43: {\displaystyle (((((a_{n}x+a_{n-1})x+a_{n-2})x+\dotsb +a_{3})x+a_{2})x+a_{1})x+a_{0}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad945524d5308fc2cfc2682d5fd6f118e2977e2a)

A polynomial function in one real variable can be represented by a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function").

*    The graph of the zero polynomial 
_f_(_x_) = 0

 is the _x_-axis. 
*    The graph of a degree 0 polynomial 
_f_(_x_) = _a_ 0, where _a_ 0 ≠ 0,

 is a horizontal line with _y_-intercept _a_ 0
*    The graph of a degree 1 polynomial (or linear function) 
_f_(_x_) = _a_ 0 + _a_ 1 _x_, where _a_ 1 ≠ 0,

 is an oblique line with _y_-intercept _a_ 0 and [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope")_a_ 1. 
*    The graph of a degree 2 polynomial 
_f_(_x_) = _a_ 0 + _a_ 1 _x_ + _a_ 2 _x_ 2, where _a_ 2 ≠ 0

 is a [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"). 
*    The graph of a degree 3 polynomial 
_f_(_x_) = _a_ 0 + _a_ 1 _x_ + _a_ 2 _x_ 2 + _a_ 3 _x_ 3, where _a_ 3 ≠ 0

 is a [cubic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation "Cubic equation"). 
*    The graph of any polynomial with degree 2 or greater 
_f_(_x_) = _a_ 0 + _a_ 1 _x_ + _a_ 2 _x_ 2 + ⋯ + _a_ _n_ _x_ _n_, where _a_ _n_ ≠ 0 and _n_ ≥ 2

 is a continuous non-linear curve. 

A non-constant polynomial function [tends to infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#Calculus "Infinity") when the variable increases indefinitely (in [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value")). If the degree is higher than one, the graph does not have any [asymptote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote "Asymptote"). It has two [parabolic branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_branch "Parabolic branch") with vertical direction (one branch for positive _x_ and one for negative _x_).

Polynomial graphs are analyzed in calculus using intercepts, slopes, concavity, and end behavior.

A _polynomial equation_, also called an _[algebraic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_equation "Algebraic equation")_, is an [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") of the form[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-29)![Image 52: {\displaystyle a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dotsb +a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/864e0906d8d2aa277214b8d0e96311fdab22bae7) For example, ![Image 53: {\displaystyle 3x^{2}+4x-5=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c3986a6188aeb755a27bf49f2838fc06fd19881) is a polynomial equation.

When considering equations, the indeterminates (variables) of polynomials are also called [unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)"), and the _solutions_ are the possible values of the unknowns for which the equality is true (in general more than one solution may exist). A polynomial equation stands in contrast to a _polynomial [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity\_(mathematics) "Identity (mathematics)")_ like (_x_ + _y_)(_x_ − _y_) = _x_ 2 − _y_ 2, where both expressions represent the same polynomial in different forms, and as a consequence any evaluation of both members gives a valid equality.

In elementary [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"), methods such as the [quadratic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula "Quadratic formula") are taught for solving all first degree and second degree polynomial equations in one variable. There are also formulas for the [cubic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation "Cubic equation") and [quartic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_equation "Quartic equation"). For higher degrees, the [Abel–Ruffini theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem "Abel–Ruffini theorem") asserts that there can not exist a general formula in radicals. However, [root-finding algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding_algorithm "Root-finding algorithm") may be used to find [numerical approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_approximation "Numerical approximation") of the roots of a polynomial expression of any degree.

The number of solutions of a polynomial equation with real coefficients may not exceed the degree, and equals the degree when the [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") solutions are counted with their [multiplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(mathematics) "Multiplicity (mathematics)"). This fact is called the [fundamental theorem of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra "Fundamental theorem of algebra").

A _root_ of a nonzero univariate polynomial _P_ is a value a of x such that _P_(_a_) = 0. In other words, a root of P is a solution of the [polynomial equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation "Polynomial equation")_P_(_x_) = 0 or a [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function") of the polynomial function defined by _P_. In the case of the zero polynomial, every number is a zero of the corresponding function, and the concept of root is rarely considered.

A number _a_ is a root of a polynomial _P_ if and only if the [linear polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#linear_polynomial)_x_ − _a_ divides _P_, that is if there is another polynomial _Q_ such that _P_ = (_x_ − _a_) Q. It may happen that a power (greater than 1) of _x_ − _a_ divides _P_; in this case, _a_ is a _multiple root_ of _P_, and otherwise _a_ is a **simple root** of _P_. If _P_ is a nonzero polynomial, there is a highest power _m_ such that (_x_ − _a_)_m_ divides _P_, which is called the _multiplicity_ of _a_ as a root of _P_. The number of roots of a nonzero polynomial _P_, counted with their respective multiplicities, cannot exceed the degree of _P_,[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-30) and equals this degree if all [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") roots are considered (this is a consequence of the [fundamental theorem of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra "Fundamental theorem of algebra")). The coefficients of a polynomial and its roots are related by [Vieta's formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta%27s_formulas "Vieta's formulas").

Some polynomials, such as _x_ 2 + 1, do not have any roots among the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"). If, however, the set of accepted solutions is expanded to the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"), every non-constant polynomial has at least one root; this is the [fundamental theorem of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra "Fundamental theorem of algebra"). By successively dividing out factors _x_ − _a_, one sees that any polynomial with complex coefficients can be written as a constant (its leading coefficient) times a product of such polynomial factors of degree 1; as a consequence, the number of (complex) roots counted with their multiplicities is exactly equal to the degree of the polynomial.

There may be several meanings of ["solving an equation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_solving "Equation solving"). One may want to express the solutions as explicit numbers; for example, the unique solution of 2 _x_ − 1 = 0 is 1/2. This is, in general, impossible for equations of degree greater than one, and, since the ancient times, mathematicians have searched to express the solutions as [algebraic expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_expression "Algebraic expression"); for example, the [golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio "Golden ratio")![Image 54: {\displaystyle (1+{\sqrt {5}})/2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8834bbd69c7f1eddf70573ed4296941c18c25ee5) is the unique positive solution of ![Image 55: {\displaystyle x^{2}-x-1=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4dce4c0c04b2eedf8f24566b9a8ffc566096fd53) In the ancient times, they succeeded only for degrees one and two. For [quadratic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation "Quadratic equation"), the [quadratic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula "Quadratic formula") provides such expressions of the solutions. Since the 16th century, similar formulas (using cube roots in addition to square roots), although much more complicated, are known for equations of degree three and four (see [cubic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation "Cubic equation") and [quartic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_equation "Quartic equation")). But formulas for degree 5 and higher eluded researchers for several centuries. In 1824, [Niels Henrik Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel "Niels Henrik Abel") proved the striking result that there are equations of degree 5 whose solutions cannot be expressed by a (finite) formula, involving only arithmetic operations and radicals (see [Abel–Ruffini theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem "Abel–Ruffini theorem")). In 1830, [Évariste Galois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois "Évariste Galois") proved that most equations of degree higher than four cannot be solved by radicals, and showed that for each equation, one may decide whether it is solvable by radicals, and, if it is, solve it. This result marked the start of [Galois theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory "Galois theory") and [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory"), two important branches of modern [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"). Galois himself noted that the computations implied by his method were impracticable. Nevertheless, formulas for solvable equations of degrees 5 and 6 have been published (see [quintic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintic_function "Quintic function") and [sextic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextic_equation "Sextic equation")).

When there is no algebraic expression for the roots, and when such an algebraic expression exists but is too complicated to be useful, the unique way of solving it is to compute [numerical approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_approximation "Numerical approximation") of the solutions.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-31) There are many methods for that; some are restricted to polynomials and others may apply to any [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"). The most efficient [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") allow solving easily (on a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer")) polynomial equations of degree higher than 1,000 (see _[Root-finding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding\_algorithm "Root-finding algorithm")_).

For polynomials with more than one indeterminate, the combinations of values for the variables for which the polynomial function takes the value zero are generally called _zeros_ instead of "roots". The study of the sets of zeros of polynomials is the object of [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"). For a set of polynomial equations with several unknowns, there are [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") to decide whether they have a finite number of [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") solutions, and, if this number is finite, for computing the solutions. See [System of polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_polynomial_equations "System of polynomial equations").

The special case where all the polynomials are of degree one is called a [system of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations "System of linear equations"), for which another range of different [solution methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations#Solving_a_linear_system "System of linear equations") exist, including the classical [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination "Gaussian elimination").

A polynomial equation for which one is interested only in the solutions which are [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") is called a [Diophantine equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation "Diophantine equation"). Solving Diophantine equations is generally a very hard task. It has been proved that there cannot be any general [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") for solving them, or even for deciding whether the set of solutions is empty (see [Hilbert's tenth problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem "Hilbert's tenth problem")). Some of the most famous problems that have been solved during the last fifty years are related to Diophantine equations, such as [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem "Fermat's Last Theorem").

Polynomial expressions
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polynomial&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Polynomial expressions")]

Polynomials where indeterminates are substituted for some other mathematical objects are often considered, and sometimes have a special name.

### Trigonometric polynomials

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polynomial&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Trigonometric polynomials")]

A **trigonometric polynomial** is a finite [linear combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination "Linear combination") of [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") sin(_nx_) and cos(_nx_) with _n_ taking on the values of one or more [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-32) The coefficients may be taken as real numbers, for real-valued functions.

If sin(_nx_) and cos(_nx_) are expanded in terms of sin(_x_) and cos(_x_), a trigonometric polynomial becomes a polynomial in the two variables sin(_x_) and cos(_x_) (using the [multiple-angle formulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trigonometric_identities#Multiple-angle_formulae "List of trigonometric identities")). Conversely, every polynomial in sin(_x_) and cos(_x_) may be converted, with [Product-to-sum identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trigonometric_identities#Product-to-sum_and_sum-to-product_identities "List of trigonometric identities"), into a linear combination of functions sin(_nx_) and cos(_nx_). This equivalence explains why linear combinations are called polynomials.

For [complex coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"), there is no difference between such a function and a finite [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series "Fourier series").

Trigonometric polynomials are widely used, for example in [trigonometric interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation "Trigonometric interpolation") applied to the [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation "Interpolation") of [periodic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function "Periodic function"). They are also used in the [discrete Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform "Discrete Fourier transform").

A [matrix polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_polynomial "Matrix polynomial") is a polynomial with [square matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_matrix "Square matrix") as variables.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-33) Given an ordinary, scalar-valued polynomial ![Image 56: {\displaystyle P(x)=\sum _{i=0}^{n}{a_{i}x^{i}}=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+\cdots +a_{n}x^{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fedf00e6d1e4f4c50a92e35bf3fac3c489d1eef2) this polynomial evaluated at a matrix _A_ is ![Image 57: {\displaystyle P(A)=\sum _{i=0}^{n}{a_{i}A^{i}}=a_{0}I+a_{1}A+a_{2}A^{2}+\cdots +a_{n}A^{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66dc9788b5ccf460b7cb64a24fad0592e552ce66) where _I_ is the [identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHornJohnson199036-34)

A **matrix polynomial equation** is an equality between two matrix polynomials, which holds for the specific matrices in question. A **matrix polynomial identity** is a matrix polynomial equation which holds for all matrices _A_ in a specified [matrix ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_ring "Matrix ring")_M n_(_R_).

### Exponential polynomials

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polynomial&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Exponential polynomials")]

A bivariate polynomial where the second variable is substituted for an exponential function applied to the first variable, for example _P_(_x_, _e_ _x_), may be called an [exponential polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_polynomial "Exponential polynomial").

A [rational fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_fraction "Rational fraction") is the [quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient "Quotient") ([algebraic fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_fraction "Algebraic fraction")) of two polynomials. Any [algebraic expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_expression "Algebraic expression") that can be rewritten as a rational fraction is a [rational function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_function "Rational function").

While polynomial functions are defined for all values of the variables, a rational function is defined only for the values of the variables for which the denominator is not zero.

The rational fractions include the Laurent polynomials, but do not limit denominators to powers of an indeterminate.

### Laurent polynomials

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polynomial&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Laurent polynomials")]

[Laurent polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_polynomial "Laurent polynomial") are like polynomials, but allow negative powers of the variable(s) to occur.

[Formal power series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_power_series "Formal power series") are like polynomials, but allow infinitely many non-zero terms to occur, so that they do not have finite degree. Unlike polynomials they cannot in general be explicitly and fully written down (just like [irrational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number "Irrational number") cannot), but the rules for manipulating their terms are the same as for polynomials. Non-formal [power series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series "Power series") also generalize polynomials, but the multiplication of two power series may not converge.

A _polynomial_ _f_ over a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring")_R_ is a polynomial all of whose coefficients belong to _R_. It is straightforward to verify that the polynomials in a given set of indeterminates over _R_ form a commutative ring, called the _polynomial ring_ in these indeterminates, denoted ![Image 58: {\displaystyle R[x]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0ce54622cb380383ab3a42441b056626ea0d2440) in the univariate case and ![Image 59: {\displaystyle R[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/58c388e003e234e12fb55533e35a211c8cf295e5) in the multivariate case.

One has ![Image 60: {\displaystyle R[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]=\left(R[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n-1}]\right)[x_{n}].}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba0bbfe1bccac6aa10e3a7daba9b95381c6f05bd) So, most of the theory of the multivariate case can be reduced to an iterated univariate case.

The map from _R_ to _R_[_x_] sending _r_ to itself considered as a constant polynomial is an injective [ring homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_homomorphism "Ring homomorphism"), by which _R_ is viewed as a subring of _R_[_x_]. In particular, _R_[_x_] is an [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_(ring_theory) "Algebra (ring theory)") over _R_.

One can think of the ring _R_[_x_] as arising from _R_ by adding one new element _x_ to _R_, and extending in a minimal way to a ring in which _x_ satisfies no other relations than the obligatory ones, plus commutation with all elements of _R_ (that is _xr_ = _rx_). To do this, one must add all powers of _x_ and their linear combinations as well.

Formation of the polynomial ring, together with forming factor rings by factoring out [ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)"), are important tools for constructing new rings out of known ones. For instance, the ring (in fact field) of complex numbers, which can be constructed from the polynomial ring _R_[_x_] over the real numbers by factoring out the ideal of multiples of the polynomial _x_ 2 + 1. Another example is the construction of [finite fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field"), which proceeds similarly, starting out with the field of integers modulo some [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number") as the coefficient ring _R_ (see [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic "Modular arithmetic")).

If _R_ is commutative, then one can associate with every polynomial _P_ in _R_[_x_] a _polynomial function_ _f_ with domain and range equal to _R_. (More generally, one can take domain and range to be any same [unital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unital_algebra "Unital algebra")[associative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_algebra "Associative algebra") over _R_.) One obtains the value _f_(_r_) by [substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_(algebra) "Substitution (algebra)") of the value _r_ for the symbol _x_ in _P_. One reason to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that, over some rings, different polynomials may give rise to the same polynomial function (see [Fermat's little theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem "Fermat's little theorem") for an example where _R_ is the integers modulo _p_). This is not the case when _R_ is the real or complex numbers, whence the two concepts are not always distinguished in [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_(mathematics) "Analysis (mathematics)"). An even more important reason to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that many operations on polynomials (like [Euclidean division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division "Euclidean division")) require looking at what a polynomial is composed of as an expression rather than evaluating it at some constant value for _x_.

If _R_ is an [integral domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain "Integral domain") and _f_ and _g_ are polynomials in _R_[_x_], it is said that _f_ _divides_ _g_ or _f_ is a divisor of _g_ if there exists a polynomial _q_ in _R_[_x_] such that _f_ _q_ = _g_. If ![Image 61: {\displaystyle a\in R,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e60ad1d63f653a7249204f2f0f1330a542e0e581) then a is a root of f if and only ![Image 62: {\displaystyle x-a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e32f42f9f52615f0186e3c8f2c25d7cd6f7bd6aa) divides f. In this case, the quotient can be computed using the [polynomial long division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_long_division "Polynomial long division").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-35)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-36)

If _F_ is a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") and _f_ and _g_ are polynomials in _F_[_x_] with _g_ ≠ 0, then there exist unique polynomials _q_ and _r_ in _F_[_x_] with ![Image 63: {\displaystyle f=q\,g+r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dd736cabd100d712293746d60defd82f495f8347) and such that the degree of _r_ is smaller than the degree of _g_ (using the convention that the polynomial 0 has a negative degree). The polynomials _q_ and _r_ are uniquely determined by _f_ and _g_. This is called _[Euclidean division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean\_division\_of\_polynomials "Euclidean division of polynomials"), division with remainder_ or _polynomial long division_ and shows that the ring _F_[_x_] is a [Euclidean domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_domain "Euclidean domain").

Analogously, _prime polynomials_ (more correctly, _[irreducible polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible\_polynomial "Irreducible polynomial")_) can be defined as _non-zero polynomials which cannot be factorized into the product of two non-constant polynomials_. In the case of coefficients in a ring, _"non-constant"_ must be replaced by _"non-constant or non-[unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit\_(ring\_theory) "Unit (ring theory)")"_ (both definitions agree in the case of coefficients in a field). Any polynomial may be decomposed into the product of an invertible constant by a product of irreducible polynomials. If the coefficients belong to a field or a [unique factorization domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_factorization_domain "Unique factorization domain") this decomposition is unique up to the order of the factors and the multiplication of any non-unit factor by a unit (and division of the unit factor by the same unit). When the coefficients belong to integers, rational numbers or a finite field, there are algorithms to test irreducibility and to compute the factorization into irreducible polynomials (see _[Factorization of polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization\_of\_polynomials "Factorization of polynomials")_). These algorithms are not practicable for hand-written computation, but are available in any [computer algebra system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system "Computer algebra system"). [Eisenstein's criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenstein%27s_criterion "Eisenstein's criterion") can also be used in some cases to determine irreducibility.

### Positional notation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polynomial&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Positional notation")]

In modern positional numbers systems, such as the [decimal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal "Decimal"), the digits and their positions in the representation of an integer, for example, 45, are a shorthand notation for a polynomial in the [radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix "Radix") or base, in this case, 4 × 10 1 + 5 × 10 0. As another example, in radix 5, a string of digits such as 132 denotes the (decimal) number 1 × 5 2 + 3 × 5 1 + 2 × 5 0 = 42. This representation is unique. Let _b_ be a positive integer greater than 1. Then every positive integer _a_ can be expressed uniquely in the form

![Image 64: {\displaystyle a=r_{m}b^{m}+r_{m-1}b^{m-1}+\dotsb +r_{1}b+r_{0},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7079ff491ae56656d18a4401e9bd8d3683c47015) where _m_ is a nonnegative integer and the _r'_ s are integers such that

0 <_r_ _m_<_b_ and 0 ≤ _r_ _i_<_b_ for _i_ = 0, 1, . . . , _m_ − 1.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-37)

### Interpolation and approximation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polynomial&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Interpolation and approximation")]

The simple structure of polynomial functions makes them quite useful in analyzing general functions using polynomial approximations. An important example in [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") is [Taylor's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem "Taylor's theorem"), which roughly states that every [differentiable function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function") locally looks like a polynomial function, and the [Stone–Weierstrass theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem "Stone–Weierstrass theorem"), which states that every [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") defined on a [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space")[interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") of the real axis can be approximated on the whole interval as closely as desired by a polynomial function. Practical methods of approximation include [polynomial interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation "Polynomial interpolation") and the use of [splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics) "Spline (mathematics)").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-38)

Polynomials are frequently used to encode information about some other object. The [characteristic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial "Characteristic polynomial") of a matrix or linear operator contains information about the operator's [eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue "Eigenvalue"). The [minimal polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_polynomial_(field_theory) "Minimal polynomial (field theory)") of an [algebraic element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_element "Algebraic element") records the simplest algebraic relation satisfied by that element. The [chromatic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_polynomial "Chromatic polynomial") of a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)") counts the number of proper colourings of that graph.

The term "polynomial", as an adjective, can also be used for quantities or functions that can be written in polynomial form. For example, in [computational complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory "Computational complexity theory") the phrase _[polynomial time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial\_time "Polynomial time")_ means that the time it takes to complete an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") is bounded by a polynomial function of some variable, such as the size of the input.

Determining the roots of polynomials, or "solving algebraic equations", is among the oldest problems in mathematics. However, the elegant and practical notation we use today only developed beginning in the 15th century. Before that, equations were written out in words. For example, an algebra problem from the Chinese [Arithmetic in Nine Sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_Chapters_on_the_Mathematical_Art "The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art"), c. 200 BCE, begins "Three sheafs of good crop, two sheafs of mediocre crop, and one sheaf of bad crop are sold for 29 dou." We would write 3 _x_ + 2 _y_ + _z_ = 29.

### History of the notation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polynomial&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: History of the notation")]

The earliest known use of the equal sign is in [Robert Recorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Recorde "Robert Recorde")'s _[The Whetstone of Witte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Whetstone\_of\_Witte "The Whetstone of Witte")_, 1557. The signs + for addition, − for subtraction, and the use of a letter for an unknown appear in [Michael Stifel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stifel "Michael Stifel")'s _Arithemetica integra_, 1544. [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"), in _La géometrie_, 1637, introduced the concept of the graph of a polynomial equation. He popularized the use of letters from the beginning of the alphabet to denote constants and letters from the end of the alphabet to denote variables, as can be seen above, in the general formula for a polynomial in one variable, where the _a_ s denote constants and _x_ denotes a variable. Descartes introduced the use of superscripts to denote exponents as well.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#cite_note-39)
