It is currently housed in Sage House, the former residence of Henry William Sage . It was first established in 1869, making it the first university publishing enterprise in the United States, but was inactive from 1884 to 1930.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The press was established in the College of the Mechanic Arts, as mechanical engineering was called in the 19th century, because engineers knew more about running steam-powered printing presses than literature professors.

[ 4 ] Since its inception, [ 2 ] The press has offered work-study financial aid : students with previous training in the printing trades were paid for typesetting and running the presses that printed textbooks, pamphlets, a weekly student journal, and official university publications.

[ 5 ] Today, the press is one of the country's largest university presses .

[ 6 ] It produces approximately 150 nonfiction titles each year in various disciplines, including anthropology , Asian studies , biological sciences , classics , history , industrial relations, literary criticism and theory, natural history, philosophy, politics and international relations, veterinary science, and women's studies.

[ 3 ] [ 7 ] Although the press has been subsidized by the university for most of its history, it is now largely dependent on book sales to finance its operations.

[ 8 ] In 2010, the Mellon Foundation , whose President Don Michael Randel is a former Cornell Provost , awarded to the press a $50,000 grant to explore new business models for publishing scholarly works in low-demand humanities subject areas. With this grant, a book series was published titled "Signale: Modern German Letters, Cultures, and Thoughts".

[ 9 ] Only 500 hard copies of each book in the series will be printed, with extra copies manufactured on demand once the original supply is depleted.

[ 8 ] Other currently active series include "Expertise: Cultures and Technologies of Knowledge" [ 10 ] and Police/Worlds: Studies in security, crime and governance .

Domestic distribution for the press is currently provided by the University of North Carolina Press 's Longleaf Services.
