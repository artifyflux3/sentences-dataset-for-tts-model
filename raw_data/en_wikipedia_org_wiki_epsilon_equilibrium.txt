satisfies the condition of Nash equilibrium . In a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to change his
behavior. In an approximate Nash equilibrium, this requirement is weakened to allow the possibility that a
player may have a small incentive to do something different. This may still be considered an adequate
solution concept, assuming for example status quo bias . This solution concept may be preferred to Nash
equilibrium due to being easier to compute, or alternatively due to the possibility that in games of more
than 2 players, the probabilities involved in an exact Nash equilibrium need not be rational numbers .

[ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] There is more than one alternative definition.

The standard definition [ edit ] Given a game and a real non-negative parameter ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } , a strategy profile is said to be an ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } -equilibrium if it is not possible for any player to gain more than ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } in expected payoff by unilaterally deviating from his strategy .

[ 2 ] : 45 Every Nash Equilibrium is equivalent to an ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } -equilibrium where ε ε = 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon =0} .

Formally, let G = ( N , A = A 1 × × ⋯ ⋯ × × A N , u : : A → → R N ) {\displaystyle G=(N,A=A_{1}\times \dotsb \times A_{N},u\colon A\to R^{N})} be an N {\displaystyle N} -player game with action sets A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} for each player i {\displaystyle i} and utility function u {\displaystyle u} .
Let u i ( s ) {\displaystyle u_{i}(s)} denote the payoff to player i {\displaystyle i} when strategy profile s {\displaystyle s} is played.
Let Δ Δ i {\displaystyle \Delta _{i}} be the space of probability distributions over A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} .
A vector of strategies σ σ ∈ ∈ Δ Δ = Δ Δ 1 × × ⋯ ⋯ × × Δ Δ N {\displaystyle \sigma \in \Delta =\Delta _{1}\times \dotsb \times \Delta _{N}} is an ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } -Nash Equilibrium for G {\displaystyle G} if u i ( σ σ ) ≥ ≥ u i ( σ σ i ′ , σ σ − − i ) − − ε ε {\displaystyle u_{i}(\sigma )\geq u_{i}(\sigma _{i}^{'},\sigma _{-i})-\varepsilon } for all σ σ i ′ ∈ ∈ Δ Δ i , i ∈ ∈ N .

{\displaystyle \sigma _{i}^{'}\in \Delta _{i},i\in N.} Well-supported approximate equilibrium [ edit ] The following definition [ 3 ] imposes the stronger requirement that a player may only assign positive probability to a pure strategy a {\displaystyle a} if the payoff of a {\displaystyle a} has expected payoff at most ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } less than the best response payoff.
Let x s {\displaystyle x_{s}} be the probability that strategy profile s {\displaystyle s} is played. For player p {\displaystyle p} let S − − p {\displaystyle S_{-p}} be strategy profiles of players other than p {\displaystyle p} ; for s ∈ ∈ S − − p {\displaystyle s\in S_{-p}} and a pure strategy j {\displaystyle j} of p {\displaystyle p} let j s {\displaystyle js} be the strategy profile where p {\displaystyle p} plays j {\displaystyle j} and other players play s {\displaystyle s} .
Let u p ( s ) {\displaystyle u_{p}(s)} be the payoff to p {\displaystyle p} when strategy profile s {\displaystyle s} is used.
The requirement can be expressed by the formula ∑ ∑ s ∈ ∈ S − − p u p ( j s ) x s > ε ε + ∑ ∑ s ∈ ∈ S − − p u p ( j ′ s ) x s ⟹ ⟹ x j ′ p = 0.

{\displaystyle \sum _{s\in S_{-p}}u_{p}(js)x_{s}>\varepsilon +\sum _{s\in S_{-p}}u_{p}(j's)x_{s}\Longrightarrow x_{j'}^{p}=0.} Results [ edit ] The existence of a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for ε-Nash equilibria is
equivalent to the question of whether there exists one for ε-well-supported
approximate Nash equilibria, [ 4 ] but the existence of a PTAS remains an open problem.
For constant values of ε, polynomial-time algorithms for approximate equilibria
are known for lower values of ε than are known for well-supported
approximate equilibria.
For games with payoffs in the range [0,1] and ε=0.3393, ε-Nash equilibria can
be computed in polynomial time.

[ 5 ] For games with payoffs in the range [0,1] and ε=2/3, ε-well-supported equilibria can
be computed in polynomial time.

[ 6 ] Example [ edit ] The notion of ε-equilibria is important in the theory of stochastic games of potentially infinite duration. There are 
simple examples of stochastic games with no Nash equilibrium but with an ε-equilibrium for any ε strictly bigger than 0.

Perhaps the simplest such example is the following variant of Matching Pennies , suggested by Everett. Player 1 hides a penny and
Player 2 must guess if it is heads up or tails up. If Player 2 guesses correctly, he
wins the penny from Player 1 and the game ends. If Player 2 incorrectly guesses that the penny 
is heads up,
the game ends with payoff zero to both players. If he incorrectly guesses that it is tails up, the game repeats . If the play continues forever, the payoff to both players is zero.

Given a parameter ε > 0, any strategy profile where Player 2 guesses heads up with
probability ε and tails up with probability 1 − ε (at every stage of the game, and independently
from previous stages) is an ε -equilibrium for the game. The expected payoff of Player 2 in
such a strategy profile is at least 1 − ε . However, it is easy to see that there is no
strategy for Player 2 that can guarantee an expected payoff of exactly 1. Therefore, the game
has no Nash equilibrium .

Another simple example is the finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma for T periods, where the payoff is averaged over the T periods. The only Nash equilibrium of this game is to choose Defect in each period. Now consider the two strategies tit-for-tat and grim trigger . Although neither tit-for-tat nor grim trigger are Nash equilibria for the game, both of them are ϵ ϵ {\displaystyle \epsilon } -equilibria for some positive ϵ ϵ {\displaystyle \epsilon } . The acceptable values of ϵ ϵ {\displaystyle \epsilon } depend on the payoffs of the constituent game and on the number T of periods.

In economics, the concept of a pure strategy epsilon-equilibrium is used when the mixed-strategy approach is seen as unrealistic. In a pure-strategy epsilon-equilibrium, each player chooses a pure-strategy that is within epsilon of its best pure-strategy. For example, in the Bertrand–Edgeworth model , where no pure-strategy equilibrium exists, a pure-strategy epsilon equilibrium may exist.
