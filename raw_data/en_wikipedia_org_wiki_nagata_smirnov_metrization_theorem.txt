The theorem states that a topological space X {\displaystyle X} is metrizable if and only if it is regular , Hausdorff and has a countably locally finite (that is, ùúé-locally finite) basis .

A topological space X {\displaystyle X} is called a regular space if every non-empty closed subset C {\displaystyle C} of X {\displaystyle X} and a point p not contained in C {\displaystyle C} admit non-overlapping open neighborhoods.
A collection in a space X {\displaystyle X} is countably locally finite (or ùúé-locally finite) if it is the union of a countable family of locally finite collections of subsets of X .

{\displaystyle X.} Unlike Urysohn's metrization theorem , which provides only a sufficient condition for metrizability, this theorem provides both a necessary and sufficient condition for a topological space to be metrizable. The theorem is named after Junichi Nagata and Yuriƒ≠ Mikhaƒ≠lovich Smirnov , whose (independent) proofs were published in 1950 [ 1 ] and 1951, [ 2 ] respectively.
