925 ) was a maker of scientific instruments who wrote an extant work on vertical sundials , Techniques, Walls, and the Making of Sundials [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ( Kitab takhlTt al-sa v at wa inhiraf al-hTtan wa’l-zilalat wa alTad al-sumut ).

[ 3 ] The manuscript , which is held in the Bibliothèque nationale de France , contains tables that enabled the drawing of lines to show any desired angle of latitude .

[ 1 ] The surviving copy of al-Adami's 10th century manuscript (Arabe 2506,1 (fols. 1r-62r) dates from the 15th century, which King has suggested was written either by al-Adami or by a contemporary, Sa'id ibn Khafif al-Samarqandi. The tables on folios . 31v–33v were intended to be used in the construction of a vertical sundial.

[ 4 ] According to the Iranian polymath al-Biruni , al-Adami was the first to demonstrate solar and lunar eclipses using a "disc of eclipses". Al-Adami was named in the Fihrist , written by the 10th century scholar Ibn al-Nadīm .

[ 1 ] The astronomer Ibn al-Adami , who is thought by scholars to have been al-Adami's son, wrote Naẓm al-ʿiqd (now lost), a zīj that used information obtained from the Sindhind , an Indian source translated into Arabic by the 8th century mathematician and astronomer Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī . The Naẓm al-ʿiqd was first published in 949/950.
