In the 17th century, Morisco refugees from Andalusia formed the Republic of Salé , a base for piracy.

[ 1 ] In 1921, Berber rebels in the Rif established the breakaway Republic of the Rif under Abd el-Krim against Spanish colonial rule. The state lasted until 1925, when the rebels attempted to take the city of Fes , in a failed attempt to expand the republic into the French protectorate in Morocco .

[ 2 ] A failed attempt to establish a republic took place during a coup attempt in 1971 against King Hassan II .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It was ultimately put down by General Mohamed Oufkir . However, the following year Oufkir initiated his own coup d'état ; the Air Force tried multiple times to bring down the king's airplane, attacked the Rabat airport and bombed the royal palace in Rabat. The coup ultimately failed.

[ 5 ] During the 2011–2012 Moroccan protests , a minority of protesters from the Al Adl Wa Al Ihssane Islamist movement and leftist groups such as Ila al-Amam chanted republican slogans.

Current republicanism in Morocco [ edit ] Both inside and outside Morocco there are many active Moroccan anti-monarchy activists and dissidents in exile who openly criticise the monarchy or advocate for the creation of a "Republic of Morocco" and for the abolition of the Moroccan monarchy through a popular revolution.

The Moroccan authorities continue to crack down on any movement or persons who advocate republicanism or question the legitimacy of the monarchy.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] As a result, many Moroccan republicans are active in the diaspora in Europe or North America , often in self-imposed exile.

Currently, the Al Adl Wa Al Ihssane Islamist movement and the Democratic Way Marxist group are the largest republican movements in Morocco.
