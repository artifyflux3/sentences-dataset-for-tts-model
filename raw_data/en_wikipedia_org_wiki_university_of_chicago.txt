Its main campus is in the Hyde Park neighborhood.

The university is composed of an undergraduate college and four graduate divisions: Biological Science, Arts & Humanities, Physical Science, and Social Science, which include various organized departments and institutes. In addition, the university operates eight professional schools in the fields of business , social work , divinity , continuing studies , public policy , law , medicine , and molecular engineering . The university maintains satellite campuses and centers in London, Hong Kong , Paris, Beijing, Delhi, Luxor, and downtown Chicago.

University of Chicago scholars have played a role in the development of many academic disciplines, including economics, law, literary criticism, mathematics, physics, religion, sociology, and political science, establishing the Chicago schools of thought in various fields. Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory produced the world's first human-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction in Chicago Pile-1 beneath the viewing stands of the university's Stagg Field . Advances in chemistry led to the "radiocarbon revolution" in the carbon-14 dating of ancient life and objects. The university research efforts include administration of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory , as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory . The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press , the largest university press in the United States.

As of 2025, the university's students, faculty, and staff has included 101 Nobel laureates . The university's faculty members and alumni also include 10 Fields Medalists , 4 Turing Award winners, 58 MacArthur Fellows , 30 Marshall Scholars , 55 Rhodes Scholars , 27 Pulitzer Prize winners, 20 National Humanities Medalists , and 8 Olympic medalists .

History [ edit ] Main article: History of the University of Chicago Old University of Chicago [ edit ] Further information: Old University of Chicago Albert A. Michelson , Professor of Physics and first American Nobel laureate, delivers the second Convocation Address in front of Goodspeed and Gates-Blake Halls, with President William Rainey Harper , professors, and trustees in attendance, July 1, 1894.

[ 2 ] The first University of Chicago was founded by a small group of Baptist educators in 1856 through a land endowment from Senator Stephen A. Douglas . It closed in 1886 after years of financial struggle and a final annus horribilis in which the campus was badly damaged by fire and the school was foreclosed on by its creditors.

[ 3 ] Several years later, its trustees elected to change the school's name to the " Old University of Chicago " so that a new school could go by the name of the city.

[ 4 ] Early years [ edit ] Wikisource has the text of a 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica article about the founding and early years .

In 1890, the American Baptist Education Society (ABES) incorporated a new University of Chicago as a coeducational [ 5 ] : 137 institution, using $400,000 donated to the ABES to supplement a $600,000 donation from Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller , [ 6 ] and land donated by Marshall Field .

[ 7 ] While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment, it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings. The Hyde Park campus’ construction was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans such as Silas B. Cobb , who provided the funds for the campus's first building, Cobb Lecture Hall , and matched Marshall Field's pledge of $100,000. Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L. Hutchinson (trustee, treasurer and donor of Hutchinson Commons ), Martin A. Ryerson (president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory) Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel, who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall, and George C. Walker of the Walker Museum, a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities.

[ 8 ] The new university acknowledged its predecessor.

[ 9 ] The university's coat of arms has a phoenix rising from the ashes, a reference to the fire and foreclosure of the Old University of Chicago.

[ 10 ] A single stone from the rubble of the original Douglas Hall on 34th Place was set into the wall of the Classics Building. The dean of the college and University of Chicago and professor of history John Boyer has argued that the University of Chicago has "a plausible genealogy as a pre–Civil War institution".

[ 11 ] Alumni from the Old University of Chicago are recognized as alumni of the University of Chicago.

[ 12 ] William Rainey Harper became the university's president on July 1, 1891, and the Hyde Park campus opened for classes on October 1, 1892.

[ 9 ] Harper worked on building up the faculty and in two years had a faculty of 120, including eight former university or college presidents.

[ 13 ] Harper was a Semiticist and a member of the Baptist clergy who believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus.

[ 14 ] To fulfill this commitment, he brought the Baptist seminary that had begun as an independent school "alongside" the Old University of Chicago and separated from the old school decades earlier to Morgan Park. This became the Divinity School in 1891, the first professional school at the University of Chicago.

[ 5 ] : 20–22 In 1892, Harper recruited Yale baseball and football player Amos Alonzo Stagg from the Young Men's Christian Association training school at Springfield to coach the school's football program.

[ 15 ] Stagg was given the position of associate professor in physical education, becoming the first football coach and athletic director in the university's history.

[ 16 ] While coaching at the university, Stagg invented the numbered football jersey and the huddle.

[ 17 ] Stagg is the namesake of the university's Stagg Field .

[ 18 ] In 1894, the university adopted maroon as its official color after initially selecting goldenrod . The Maroons became the university's nickname during the same year.

[ 19 ] The business school was founded in 1898, [ 20 ] and the law school was founded in 1902.

[ 21 ] Harper died in 1906 [ 22 ] and was replaced by a succession of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929.

[ 23 ] During this period, the Oriental Institute was founded to support and interpret archeological work in what was then called the Near East.

[ 24 ] In the 1890s, the university affiliated with several regional colleges and universities. Among other things, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university and to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval. For their part, the university agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and equipment at cost, as well as instructors without cost except for travel expenses. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several university professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program was ended by 1910.

[ 25 ] In 1900, the university co-founded the Association of American Universities with thirteen other universities, including Harvard , Columbia , and Johns Hopkins .

[ 26 ] In 1911, the university adopted a Latin motto of Crescat scientia; vita excolatur , which translates to "Let knowledge grow from more and more; and so be human life enriched." [ 27 ] [ 28 ] 1920s–1980s [ edit ] Some of the University of Chicago team that worked on the production of the world's first human-caused self-sustaining nuclear reaction, including Enrico Fermi in the front row and Leó Szilárd in the second In 1929, the university's fifth president, 30-year-old legal philosophy scholar Robert Maynard Hutchins , took office. The university underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure. Hutchins reformed the undergraduate college's curriculum into a liberal-arts curriculum, which survives today in the form of a Common Core.

[ 29 ] He also organized the university's graduate work into four divisions, and eliminated varsity football from the university in an attempt to emphasize academics over athletics.

[ 30 ] During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called the University of Chicago Medical Center ) finished construction and enrolled their first medical students.

[ 31 ] Furthermore, the philosophy oriented Committee on Social Thought was created.

[ 32 ] Money that had been raised during the 1920s and financial backing from the Rockefeller Foundation helped the school to survive through the Great Depression .

[ 30 ] In 1933, Hutchins proposed a plan to merge the University of Chicago and Northwestern University , though it was ultimately abandoned.

[ 33 ] During World War II, the university's Metallurgical Laboratory contributed to the Manhattan Project .

[ 34 ] The university was the site of the first isolation of plutonium and of the creation of the first artificial, self-sustained nuclear reaction by Enrico Fermi in 1942.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] In the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of an urban renewal project for Hyde Park , [ 36 ] which called for the clearing of 101 acres of land. Of the buildings proposed for demolition, 78% were substandard. During this period the university, and later the affiliated Shimer College, adopted an early entrant program that allowed students with two years of high school education to attend college.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] Front page of Chicago Maroon breaking the news of the university's segregationist off-campus rental policies The university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962 when then-freshman Bernie Sanders helped lead a 15-day sit-in at the college's administration building in a protest over the university's segregationist off-campus rental policies. After continued turmoil, a university committee in 1967 issued what became known as the Kalven Report . The report, a two-page statement of the university's policy in "social and political action," declared that "To perform its mission in the society, a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures." [ 39 ] The report has since been used to justify decisions such as the university's refusal to divest from South Africa in the 1980s and Darfur in the late 2000s.

[ 40 ] In 1969, after the sociology department unanimously declined to rehire assistant professor Marlene Dixon (an open Marxist ), over 400 students occupied the Administration Building for two weeks to protest the perceived politically motivated decision.

[ 41 ] After the sit-in ended when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended, [ 42 ] the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.

[ 43 ] In 1978, history scholar Hanna Holborn Gray , then the provost and acting president of Yale University , became president of the University of Chicago, a position she held for 15 years. She was the first woman in the United States to hold the presidency of a major university.

[ 44 ] In 1989, the Graduate Library School was closed.

[ 45 ] 1990s–2020s [ edit ] View from the Midway Plaisance In 1999, President Hugo Sonnenschein announced plans to relax the university's core curriculum , reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15. When The New York Times , The Economist , and other news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of a national debate on education. The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.

[ 46 ] From the mid-2000s, the university began a number of multi-million dollar expansion projects. In 2008, the University of Chicago announced the establishment of the Milton Friedman Institute , which attracted both support and controversy from faculty members and students.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] The institute was later merged with the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory to form the new Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics .

[ 52 ] In 2008, investor David G. Booth donated $300 million to the university's Booth School of Business , which is the largest gift in the university's history and the largest gift ever to any business school.

[ 53 ] In 2009, planning or construction on several new buildings, half of which cost $100 million or more, was underway.

[ 54 ] Since 2011, major construction projects have included the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research center, and further additions to the medical campus of the University of Chicago Medical Center .

[ 55 ] In 2014, the university launched the public phase of a $4.5 billion fundraising campaign.

[ 56 ] In September 2015, the university received $100 million from The Pearson Family Foundation to establish The Pearson Institute for the Study and Resolution of Global Conflicts and The Pearson Global Forum at the Harris School of Public Policy .

[ 57 ] In 2019, the university created its first school in three decades, the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering .

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] On April 29, 2024, students at the University of Chicago set up an encampment on the university's main quad [ 60 ] as a part of the nationwide movement in support of Palestine at institutions of higher learning across the country. The encampment was cleared by the University of Chicago Police Department on May 7.

[ 61 ] Campus [ edit ] Main campus [ edit ] The campus of the University of Chicago, from the top of Rockefeller Chapel . The Main Quadrangles can be seen on the left (west), the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures, West Asia & North Africa and the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics can be seen in the center (north) and the Booth School of Business and Laboratory Schools can be seen on the right (east), as the panoramic is bounded on both sides by the Midway Plaisance (south).

The main campus of the University of Chicago consists of 217 acres (87.8 ha) in the Chicago neighborhoods of Hyde Park and Woodlawn , approximately eight miles (13 km) south of downtown Chicago .

[ 62 ] The northern and southern portions of campus are separated by the Midway Plaisance , a large, linear park created for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition . In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the university as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.

[ 63 ] Aerial shots from the University of Chicago campus View of university building from the Harper Quadrangle The first buildings of the campus, which make up what is now known as the Main Quadrangles, were part of a master plan conceived by two University of Chicago trustees and plotted by Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb .

[ 64 ] The Main Quadrangles consist of six quadrangles , each surrounded by buildings, bordering one larger quadrangle.

[ 5 ] : 221 The buildings of the Main Quadrangles were designed by Cobb, Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge , Holabird & Roche , and other architectural firms in a mixture of the Victorian Gothic and Collegiate Gothic styles, patterned on the colleges of the University of Oxford.

[ 64 ] (Mitchell Tower, for example, is modeled after Oxford's Magdalen Tower , [ 65 ] and the university Commons, Hutchinson Hall , replicates Christ Church Hall.

[ 66 ] ) In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the University of Chicago Quadrangles [ 67 ] were selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component.

[ 68 ] Many older buildings of the University of Chicago employ Collegiate Gothic architecture like that of the University of Oxford. For example, Chicago's Mitchell Tower (left) was modeled after Oxford's Magdalen Tower (right).

After the 1940s, the campus's Gothic style began to give way to modern styles.

[ 64 ] In 1955, Eero Saarinen was contracted to develop a second master plan, which led to the construction of buildings both north and south of the Midway, including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle (a complex designed by Saarinen); [ 64 ] a series of arts buildings; [ 64 ] Edith Abbott Hall, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe ; [ 69 ] the Keller Center, which is home of the Harris School of Public Policy and was designed by Edward Durrell Stone ; [ 70 ] and the Regenstein Library , the largest building on campus, a brutalist structure designed by Walter Netsch .

[ 71 ] Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004, [ 72 ] produced the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center (2003), [ 72 ] the Max Palevsky Residential Commons (2001), [ 64 ] South Campus Residence Hall and dining commons (2009), a new children's hospital, [ 73 ] and other construction, expansions, and restorations.

[ 74 ] In 2011, the university completed the glass dome-shaped Joe and Rika Mansueto Library , which provides a grand reading room for the university library and prevents the need for an off-campus book depository.

[ 75 ] The site of Chicago Pile-1 is a National Historic Landmark and is marked by the Henry Moore sculpture Nuclear Energy .

[ 76 ] Robie House , a Frank Lloyd Wright building acquired by the university in 1963, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site [ 77 ] [ 78 ] as well as a National Historic Landmark, [ 79 ] as is room 405 of the George Herbert Jones Laboratory , where Glenn T. Seaborg and his team were the first to isolate plutonium.

[ 80 ] Hitchcock Hall , an undergraduate dormitory, is on the National Register of Historic Places .

[ 81 ] Adjacent to the campus in Jackson Park is the home of the Obama Presidential Center , the Presidential Library for the 44th president of the United States [ 82 ] [ 83 ] with expected completion in 2026. The Obamas settled in the university's Hyde Park neighborhood where they raised their children and where Barack Obama began his political career.

Michelle Obama served as an administrator at the university and founded the university's Community Service Center.

[ 84 ] Campus of the University of Chicago Snell-Hitchcock , an undergraduate dormitory constructed in the early 20th century, is part of the Main Quadrangles.

Rockefeller Chapel , constructed in 1928, was designed by Bertram Goodhue in the neo-Gothic style.

The Henry Hinds Laboratory for Geophysical Sciences was built in 1969.

[ 85 ] The Gerald Ratner Athletics Center , opened in 2003 and designed by Cesar Pelli , houses the volleyball, wrestling, swimming, and basketball teams.

[ 86 ] Transportation [ edit ] The Hyde Park campus is served by the CTA Red Line and Green Line , as well as the Metra Electric District Line and the South Shore Line , [ 87 ] all of which provide access to downtown Chicago.

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] The campus is also served by a network of CTA bus routes .

[ 87 ] The university shuttle program includes day-time and night-time routes, most of which operate within Hyde Park.

[ 92 ] In 2022, the university added a Downtown Campus Connector to its shuttle program, which connects the main Hyde Park campus to the Gleacher Center and downtown UChicago Medicine clinics.

[ 93 ] In 2024, the University introduced a Via ride-sharing program ahead of the 2024–2025 school year, which provides unlimited free rides on campus in shared vans.

[ 94 ] Safety [ edit ] In November 2021, a university graduate was robbed and fatally shot on a sidewalk in a residential area in Hyde Park near campus; a total of three University of Chicago students were killed by gunfire incidents in 2021.

[ 95 ] [ 96 ] These incidents prompted student protests and an open letter to university leadership signed by more than 300 faculty members.

[ 97 ] [ 98 ] In response, the university introduced measures including increased foot and vehicular patrols near campus, expanded coordination between the university police department and the CPD , and greater use of security cameras and license plate readers .

[ 99 ] The university continues to maintain one of the largest private police forces in the country.

[ 100 ] Satellite campuses [ edit ] The university also maintains facilities apart from its main campus. The university's Booth School of Business maintains campuses in Hong Kong , London , and downtown Chicago.

[ 112 ] Full-time undergraduate students take three to four courses every quarter [ 113 ] for approximately nine weeks before their quarterly academic breaks. The school year typically begins in late September and ends in late May.

[ 112 ] Undergraduate college [ edit ] Main article: College of the University of Chicago Harper Memorial Library was dedicated in 1912, and its architecture takes inspiration from various colleges in England.

The College of the University of Chicago grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 51 undergraduate courses of study [ 114 ] (since 2005 known as majors ) and 33 secondary courses of study, now known as minors.

[ 115 ] The college's academics are divided into four divisions: the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division, the Physical Sciences Collegiate Division, the Social Sciences Collegiate Division, and the Humanities Collegiate Division. Each division is affiliated with the corresponding graduate division of the university.

[ 116 ] The college introduced a now-widespread model of the liberal arts undergraduate program which featured the Socratic method in undergraduate contexts, the Great Books program, and the core curriculum .

[ 117 ] [ 118 ] [ 119 ] Since the 1999–2000 school year, 15 courses across seven subjects and demonstrated proficiency in a foreign language are required under the core curriculum.
