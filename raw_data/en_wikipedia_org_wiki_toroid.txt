A toroid using a square.

A torus is a type of toroid.

In mathematics , a toroid is a surface of revolution with a hole in the middle. The axis of revolution passes through the hole and so does not intersect the surface.

[ 1 ] For example, when a rectangle is rotated around an axis parallel to one of its edges, then a hollow rectangle-section ring is produced. If the revolved figure is a circle , then the object is called a torus .

The term toroid is also used to describe a toroidal polyhedron . In this context a toroid need not be circular and may have any number of holes. A g -holed toroid can be seen as approximating the surface of a torus having a topological genus , g , of 1 or greater. The Euler characteristic χ of a g holed toroid is 2(1− g ).

[ 2 ] The torus is an example of a toroid, which is the surface of a doughnut . Doughnuts are an example of a solid torus created by rotating a disk, and are not toroids.

Toroidal structures occur in both natural and synthetic materials.

[ 3 ] Equations [ edit ] A toroid is specified by the radius of revolution R measured from the center of the section rotated. For symmetrical sections volume and surface of the body may be computed (with circumference C and area A of the section): Square toroid [ edit ] The volume (V) and surface area (S) of a toroid are given by the following equations, where A is the area of the square section of side, and R is the radius of revolution.

V = 2 π π R A {\displaystyle V=2\pi RA} S = 2 π π R C {\displaystyle S=2\pi RC} Circular toroid [ edit ] The volume (V) and surface area (S) of a toroid are given by the following equations, where r is the radius of the circular section, and R is the radius of the overall shape.

V = 2 π π 2 r 2 R {\displaystyle V=2\pi ^{2}r^{2}R} S = 4 π π 2 r R {\displaystyle S=4\pi ^{2}rR} Pappus's centroid theorem generalizes the formulas here to arbitrary surfaces of revolution.
