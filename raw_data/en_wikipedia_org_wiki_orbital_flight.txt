Orbit of [AMC-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC-8 "AMC-8") satellite around the Earth in 2000, transferring from a [geostationary transfer orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_transfer_orbit "Geostationary transfer orbit") to a [geostationary orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit "Geostationary orbit")

An **orbital spaceflight** (or **orbital flight**) is a [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight") in which a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") is placed on a trajectory where it could remain in [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") for at least one [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit"). To do this [around the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit "Geocentric orbit"), it must be on a free trajectory which has an [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude") at [perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis "Apsis") (altitude at closest approach) around 80 kilometers (50 mi); this is the [boundary of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space#Boundary "Outer space") as defined by [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA"), the [US Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force") and the [FAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration"). To remain in orbit at this altitude requires an [orbital speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed "Orbital speed") of ~7.8 km/s. Orbital speed is slower for higher orbits, but attaining them requires greater [delta-v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "Delta-v"). The [Fédération Aéronautique Internationale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_A%C3%A9ronautique_Internationale "Fédération Aéronautique Internationale") has established the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line") at an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics. This is used because at an altitude of about 100 km (62 mi), as [Theodore von Kármán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n "Theodore von Kármán") calculated, a vehicle would have to travel faster than [orbital velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed "Orbital speed") to derive sufficient [aerodynamic lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic_lift "Aerodynamic lift") from the atmosphere to support itself.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_flight#cite_note-1): 84 [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_flight#cite_note-space_begin-2)

Due to [atmospheric drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic_drag "Aerodynamic drag"), the lowest altitude at which an object in a circular orbit can complete at least one full revolution without propulsion is approximately 150 kilometres (93 mi).

The expression "orbital spaceflight" is mostly used to distinguish from [sub-orbital spaceflights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight "Sub-orbital spaceflight"), which are flights where the [apogee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis "Apsis") of a spacecraft reaches space, but the perigee is too low.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_flight#cite_note-3)

There are three main "bands" of [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") around the Earth: [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") (LEO), [medium Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_Earth_orbit "Medium Earth orbit") (MEO), and [geostationary orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit "Geostationary orbit") (GEO).

According to [orbital mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics "Orbital mechanics"), an orbit lies in a particular, largely fixed plane around the Earth, which coincides with the center of the Earth, and may be inclined with respect to the equator. The relative motion of the spacecraft and the movement of the Earth's surface, as the Earth rotates on its axis, determine the position that the spacecraft appears in the sky from the ground, and which parts of the Earth are visible from the spacecraft.

It is possible to calculate a [ground track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_track "Ground track") that shows which part of the Earth a spacecraft is immediately above; this is useful for helping to visualise the orbit.

Orbital spaceflight from Earth has only been achieved by [launch vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle "Launch vehicle") that use [rocket engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine "Rocket engine") for propulsion. To reach orbit, the rocket must impart to the payload a [delta-v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "Delta-v") of about 9.3–10 km/s. This figure is mainly (~7.8 km/s) for horizontal acceleration needed to reach orbital speed, but allows for [atmospheric drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_drag "Atmospheric drag") (approximately 300 m/s with the [ballistic coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_coefficient "Ballistic coefficient") of a 20 m long dense fueled vehicle), [gravity losses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_drag "Gravity drag") (depending on burn time and details of the trajectory and launch vehicle), and gaining altitude.

The main proven technique involves launching nearly vertically for a few kilometers while performing a [gravity turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_turn "Gravity turn"), and then progressively flattening the trajectory out at an altitude of 170+ km and accelerating on a horizontal trajectory (with the [rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") angled upwards to fight gravity and maintain altitude) for a 5–8-minute burn until orbital velocity is achieved. Currently, 2–4 [stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket "Multistage rocket") are needed to achieve the required delta-v. Most launches are by [expendable launch systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expendable_launch_system "Expendable launch system").

The [Pegasus rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_rocket "Pegasus rocket") for small satellites instead launches from an aircraft at an altitude of 39,000 ft (12 km).

There have been many proposed methods for achieving orbital spaceflight that have the potential of being much more affordable than rockets. Some of these ideas such as the [space elevator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator "Space elevator"), and [rotovator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotovator_(tether_propulsion) "Rotovator (tether propulsion)"), require new materials much stronger than any currently known. Other proposed ideas include ground accelerators such as [launch loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_loop "Launch loop"), rocket-assisted aircraft/spaceplanes such as [Reaction Engines Skylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_Engines_Skylon "Reaction Engines Skylon"), [scramjet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet "Scramjet") powered spaceplanes, and [RBCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBCC "RBCC") powered spaceplanes. Gun launch has been proposed for cargo.

From 2015 [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") have demonstrated significant progress in their more incremental approach to reducing the cost of orbital spaceflight. Their potential for cost reduction comes mainly from pioneering [propulsive landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propulsive_landing "Propulsive landing") with their [reusable rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_reusable_launch_system_development_program "SpaceX reusable launch system development program") booster stage as well as their [Dragon capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon "SpaceX Dragon"), but also includes reuse of the other components such as the [payload fairings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_fairing "Payload fairing") and the use of [3D printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_metal_laser_sintering "Direct metal laser sintering") of a [superalloy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superalloy "Superalloy") to construct more efficient rocket engines, such as their [SuperDraco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperDraco "SuperDraco"). The initial stages of these improvements could reduce the cost of an orbital launch by an order of magnitude.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_flight#cite_note-fp20131209-4)

 The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") during its construction in [Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit "Geocentric orbit") in 2001. It must be periodically re-boosted to maintain its orbit

An object in orbit at an altitude of less than roughly 200 km is considered unstable due to [atmospheric drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_drag "Atmospheric drag"). For a satellite to be in a stable orbit (i.e. sustainable for more than a few months), 350 km is a more standard altitude for [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit"). For example, on 1 February 1958 the [Explorer 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorer_1 "Explorer 1") satellite was launched into an orbit with a [perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perigee "Perigee") of 358 kilometers (222 mi).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_flight#cite_note-5) It remained in orbit for more than 12 years before its [atmospheric reentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_reentry "Atmospheric reentry") over the Pacific Ocean on 31 March 1970.

However, the exact behaviour of objects in orbit depends on [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude"), their [ballistic coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_coefficient "Ballistic coefficient"), and details of [space weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather "Space weather") which can affect the height of the upper atmosphere.

In [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight"), an orbital maneuver is the use of [propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion "Spacecraft propulsion") systems to change the [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") of a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"). For spacecraft far from Earth—for example those in orbits around the Sun—an orbital maneuver is called a _deep-space maneuver (DSM)_.

Deorbit and re-entry
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_spaceflight&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Deorbit and re-entry")]

Returning spacecraft (including all potentially crewed craft) have to find a way of slowing down as much as possible while still in higher atmospheric layers and avoiding hitting the ground ([lithobraking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithobraking "Lithobraking")) or burning up. For many orbital space flights, initial deceleration is provided by the [retrofiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrofire "Retrofire") of the craft's rocket engines, perturbing the orbit (by lowering [perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perigee "Perigee") down into the atmosphere) onto a suborbital trajectory. Many spacecraft in [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") (e.g., [nanosatellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosatellite "Nanosatellite") or spacecraft that have run out of [station keeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_stationkeeping "Orbital stationkeeping") fuel or are otherwise non-functional) solve the problem of deceleration from orbital speeds through using atmospheric drag ([aerobraking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobraking "Aerobraking")) to provide initial deceleration. In all cases, once initial deceleration has lowered the orbital perigee into the [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere"), all spacecraft lose most of the remaining speed, and therefore kinetic energy, through the atmospheric drag effect of [aerobraking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobraking "Aerobraking").

Intentional aerobraking is achieved by orienting the returning space craft so as to present the heat shields forward toward the atmosphere to protect against the high temperatures generated by atmospheric compression and friction caused by passing through the atmosphere at [hypersonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic "Hypersonic") speeds. The thermal energy is dissipated mainly by compression heating the air in a shockwave ahead of the vehicle using a blunt heat shield shape, with the aim of minimising the heat entering the vehicle.

Sub-orbital space flights, being at a much lower speed, do not generate anywhere near as much[_[further explanation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] heat upon re-entry.

Even if the orbiting objects are expendable, most[_[quantify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] space authorities[_[example needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AUDIENCE "Wikipedia:AUDIENCE")_] are pushing toward controlled re-entries to minimize hazard to lives and property on the planet.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
