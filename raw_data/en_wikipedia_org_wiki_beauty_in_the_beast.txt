The album uses alternate musical tunings and scales , influenced by jazz and world music . On the back she includes a quote by Van Gogh : "I am always doing what I cannot do yet, in order to learn how to do it." As the liner notes state, the entire album is synthesized , meaning that "All the music and sounds heard on this recording were directly digitally generated. This eliminates all the limitations of microphones , the weak link necessary in nearly all other digital recordings , including those that use ' sampling ' technologies."

A notable exception is Wendy Carlos, who has composed a great deal of music for synthesizers using many different scales. [Benson] particularly recommend[s] Beauty in the Beast .

[ 2 ] AllMusic noted that "The music on this album cuts through a lot of the conventions and restraints that were used as frameworks for previous releases: instrumentation, tonality , and scaling, to name just a few." [ 3 ] References [ edit ] ^ Carlos, Wendy (1986).
