Education Alma mater University of Chicago Philosophical work Era Contemporary philosophy Region Western philosophy School Analytic philosophy Notable ideas Epistemic justification William Payne Alston (November 29, 1921 – September 13, 2009) was an American philosopher. He is widely considered to be one of the most important epistemologists and philosophers of religion of the twentieth century, [ 1 ] and is also known for his work in metaphysics and the philosophy of language .

[ 2 ] His views on foundationalism , internalism and externalism , speech acts , and the epistemic value of mystical experience, among many other topics, have been very influential.

[ 3 ] He earned his PhD from the University of Chicago and taught at the University of Michigan , Rutgers University , University of Illinois , and Syracuse University .

[ 2 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Alston was born to Eunice Schoolfield and William Alston on November 29, 1921, in Shreveport , Louisiana. He graduated from high school when he was 15 and went on to Centenary College of Louisiana , graduating in 1942 with a Bachelor of Music in piano. During World War II , he played clarinet and bass drum in a military band in California. During this time, he became interested in philosophy, sparked by W. Somerset Maugham 's book The Razor's Edge , and read the works of well-known philosophers such as Jacques Maritain , Mortimer J. Adler , Francis Bacon , Plato , René Descartes , and John Locke .

[ 4 ] Alston was honorably discharged from the US army in 1946, [ 1 ] going on to enter a graduate program for philosophy at the University of Chicago , even though he had never formally taken a class on the subject.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] While he was there, he learned more about philosophy from Richard McKeon and Charles Hartshorne , and he received his PhD in 1951.

[ 4 ] His dissertation was on the subject of the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead .

[ 1 ] Career [ edit ] From 1949 until 1971, Alston was a professor at the University of Michigan , and he became professor of philosophy in 1961.

[ 7 ] He then taught at Rutgers University for five years, followed by the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1976 to 1980 and then Syracuse University from 1980 to 1992.

[ 4 ] Alston's early work was on the philosophy of language , later going on to focus on epistemology and the philosophy of religion from the early 1970s onwards.

[ 1 ] Together with Alvin Plantinga , Nicholas Wolterstorff , Robert Adams , and Michael L. Peterson, Alston helped to found the journal Faith and Philosophy .

[ 8 ] With Plantinga, Wolterstorff, and others, Alston was also responsible for the development of " Reformed epistemology " (a term that Alston, an Episcopalian , never fully endorsed), one of the most important contributions to Christian thought in the twentieth century.

[ 9 ] Alston was president of the Western Division (now the Central Division) of the American Philosophical Association in 1979, the Society for Philosophy and Psychology , and the Society of Christian Philosophers , which he co-founded. He was widely recognized as one of the core figures in the late twentieth-century revival of the philosophy of religion .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990.

[ 12 ] Death [ edit ] Alston died in a nursing home in Jamesville , New York, on September 13, 2009, at the age of 87.
