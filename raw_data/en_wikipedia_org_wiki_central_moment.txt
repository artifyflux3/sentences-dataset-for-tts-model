Find sources: "Central moment" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( September 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In probability theory and statistics , a central moment is a moment of a probability distribution of a random variable about the random variable's mean ; that is, it is the expected value of a specified integer power of the deviation of the random variable from the mean. The various moments form one set of values by which the properties of a probability distribution can be usefully characterized. Central moments are used in preference to ordinary moments, computed in terms of deviations from the mean instead of from zero, because the higher-order central moments relate only to the spread and shape of the distribution, rather than also to its location .

Sets of central moments can be defined for both univariate and multivariate distributions.

Univariate moments [ edit ] The n -th moment about the mean (or n -th central moment ) of a real-valued random variable X is the quantity μ n := E[( X − E[ X ]) n ] , where E is the expectation operator . For a continuous univariate probability distribution with probability density function f ( x ) , the n -th moment about the mean μ is [ 1 ] μ μ n = E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] ) n ] = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ + ∞ ∞ ( x − − μ μ ) n f ( x ) d x .

{\displaystyle \mu _{n}=\operatorname {E} \left[{\left(X-\operatorname {E} [X]\right)}^{n}\right]=\int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }(x-\mu )^{n}f(x)\,\mathrm {d} x.} For random variables that have no mean, such as the Cauchy distribution , central moments are not defined.

The first few central moments have intuitive interpretations: The "zeroth" central moment μ 0 is 1.

The first central moment μ 1 is 0 (not to be confused with the first raw moment or the expected value μ ).

The second central moment μ 2 is called the variance , and is usually denoted σ 2 , where σ represents the standard deviation .

The third and fourth central moments are used to define the standardized moments which are used to define skewness and kurtosis , respectively.

Properties [ edit ] For all n , the n -th central moment is homogeneous of degree n : μ μ n ( c X ) = c n μ μ n ( X ) .

{\displaystyle \mu _{n}(cX)=c^{n}\mu _{n}(X).\,} Only for n such that n equals 1, 2, or 3 do we have an additivity property for random variables X and Y that are independent : μ μ n ( X + Y ) = μ μ n ( X ) + μ μ n ( Y ) {\displaystyle \mu _{n}(X+Y)=\mu _{n}(X)+\mu _{n}(Y)\,} provided n ∈ {1, 2, 3} .

A related functional that shares the translation-invariance and homogeneity properties with the n -th central moment, but continues to have this additivity property even when n ≥ 4 is the n -th cumulant κ n ( X ) . For n = 1 , the n -th cumulant is just the expected value ; for n = either 2 or 3, the n -th cumulant is just the n -th central moment; for n ≥ 4 , the n -th cumulant is an n -th-degree monic polynomial in the first n moments (about zero), and is also a (simpler) n -th-degree polynomial in the first n central moments.

Relation to moments about the origin [ edit ] Sometimes it is convenient to convert moments about the origin to moments about the mean. The general equation for converting the n -th-order moment about the origin to the moment about the mean is μ μ n = E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] ) n ] = ∑ ∑ j = 0 n ( n j ) ( − − 1 ) n − − j μ μ j ′ μ μ n − − j , {\displaystyle \mu _{n}=\operatorname {E} \left[\left(X-\operatorname {E} [X]\right)^{n}\right]=\sum _{j=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{j}}{\left(-1\right)}^{n-j}\mu '_{j}\mu ^{n-j},} where μ is the mean of the distribution, and the moment about the origin is given by μ μ m ′ = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ + ∞ ∞ x m f ( x ) d x = E ⁡ ⁡ [ X m ] = ∑ ∑ j = 0 m ( m j ) μ μ j μ μ m − − j .

{\displaystyle \mu '_{m}=\int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }x^{m}f(x)\,dx=\operatorname {E} [X^{m}]=\sum _{j=0}^{m}{\binom {m}{j}}\mu _{j}\mu ^{m-j}.} For the cases n = 2, 3, 4 — which are of most interest because of the relations to variance , skewness , and kurtosis , respectively — this formula becomes (noting that μ μ = μ μ 1 ′ {\displaystyle \mu =\mu '_{1}} and μ μ 0 ′ = 1 {\displaystyle \mu '_{0}=1} ): μ μ 2 = μ μ 2 ′ − − μ μ 2 {\displaystyle \mu _{2}=\mu '_{2}-\mu ^{2}\,} which is commonly referred to as Var ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) = E ⁡ ⁡ [ X 2 ] − − ( E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] ) 2 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Var} (X)=\operatorname {E} [X^{2}]-\left(\operatorname {E} [X]\right)^{2}} μ μ 3 = μ μ 3 ′ − − 3 μ μ μ μ 2 ′ + 2 μ μ 3 μ μ 4 = μ μ 4 ′ − − 4 μ μ μ μ 3 ′ + 6 μ μ 2 μ μ 2 ′ − − 3 μ μ 4 .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu _{3}&=\mu '_{3}-3\mu \mu '_{2}+2\mu ^{3}\\\mu _{4}&=\mu '_{4}-4\mu \mu '_{3}+6\mu ^{2}\mu '_{2}-3\mu ^{4}.\end{aligned}}} ... and so on, [ 2 ] following Pascal's triangle , i.e.

μ μ 5 = μ μ 5 ′ − − 5 μ μ μ μ 4 ′ + 10 μ μ 2 μ μ 3 ′ − − 10 μ μ 3 μ μ 2 ′ + 4 μ μ 5 .

{\displaystyle \mu _{5}=\mu '_{5}-5\mu \mu '_{4}+10\mu ^{2}\mu '_{3}-10\mu ^{3}\mu '_{2}+4\mu ^{5}.\,} because 5 μ μ 4 μ μ 1 ′ − − μ μ 5 μ μ 0 ′ = 5 μ μ 4 μ μ − − μ μ 5 = 5 μ μ 5 − − μ μ 5 = 4 μ μ 5 {\displaystyle 5\mu ^{4}\mu '_{1}-\mu ^{5}\mu '_{0}=5\mu ^{4}\mu -\mu ^{5}=5\mu ^{5}-\mu ^{5}=4\mu ^{5}} .

The following sum is a stochastic variable having a compound distribution W = ∑ ∑ i = 1 M Y i , {\displaystyle W=\sum _{i=1}^{M}Y_{i},} where the Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} are mutually independent random variables sharing the same common distribution and M {\displaystyle M} a random integer variable independent of the Y k {\displaystyle Y_{k}} with its own distribution. The moments of W {\displaystyle W} are obtained as E ⁡ ⁡ [ W n ] = ∑ ∑ i = 0 n E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( M i ) ] ∑ ∑ j = 0 i ( i j ) ( − − 1 ) i − − j E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( ∑ ∑ k = 1 j Y k ) n ] , {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [W^{n}]=\sum _{i=0}^{n}\operatorname {E} \left[{\binom {M}{i}}\right]\sum _{j=0}^{i}{\binom {i}{j}}{\left(-1\right)}^{i-j}\operatorname {E} \left[\left(\sum _{k=1}^{j}Y_{k}\right)^{n}\right],} where E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( ∑ ∑ k = 1 j Y k ) n ] {\textstyle \operatorname {E} \left[{\left(\sum _{k=1}^{j}Y_{k}\right)}^{n}\right]} is defined as zero for j = 0 {\displaystyle j=0} .

Symmetric distributions [ edit ] In distributions that are symmetric about their means (unaffected by being reflected about the mean), all odd central moments equal zero whenever they exist, because in the formula for the n -th moment, each term involving a value of X less than the mean by a certain amount exactly cancels out the term involving a value of X greater than the mean by the same amount.

Multivariate moments [ edit ] For a continuous bivariate probability distribution with probability density function f ( x , y ) the ( j , k ) moment about the mean μ = ( μ X , μ Y ) is μ μ j , k = E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] ) j ( Y − − E ⁡ ⁡ [ Y ] ) k ] = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ + ∞ ∞ ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ + ∞ ∞ ( x − − μ μ X ) j ( y − − μ μ Y ) k f ( x , y ) d x d y .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu _{j,k}&=\operatorname {E} \left[{\left(X-\operatorname {E} [X]\right)}^{j}{\left(Y-\operatorname {E} [Y]\right)}^{k}\right]\\[2pt]&=\int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }\int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }{\left(x-\mu _{X}\right)}^{j}{\left(y-\mu _{Y}\right)}^{k}f(x,y)\,dx\,dy.\end{aligned}}} Central moment of complex random variables [ edit ] The n -th central moment for a complex random variable X is defined as [ 3 ] α α n = E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] ) n ] , {\displaystyle \alpha _{n}=\operatorname {E} \left[{\left(X-\operatorname {E} [X]\right)}^{n}\right],} The absolute n -th central moment of X is defined as β β n = E ⁡ ⁡ [ | ( X − − E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] ) | n ] .

{\displaystyle \beta _{n}=\operatorname {E} \left[{\left|\left(X-\operatorname {E} [X]\right)\right|}^{n}\right].} The 2nd-order central moment β 2 is called the variance of X whereas the 2nd-order central moment α 2 is the pseudo-variance of X .
