The text under investigation is currently hidden from public view, but is accessible in the page history . Please do not remove this notice or restore blanked content until the issue is resolved by an administrator , copyright clerk , or volunteer response agent .

The purported copyright violation copies text from https://books.google.no/books?id=frt7RDOT1PUC&q=christian+voice+1978&pg=PA99 ( Copyvios report ) ; as such, this page has been listed on the copyright problems page .

Unless the copyright status of the text of this page or section is clarified and determined to be compatible with Wikipedia's content license , the problematic text and revisions or the entire page may be deleted one week after the time of its listing (i.e. after 13:10, 1 June 2025 (UTC)).

What can I do to resolve the issue?

These messages must explicitly permit use under CC BY-SA and the GFDL. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials .

Note that articles on Wikipedia must be written from a neutral point of view and must be verifiable in published third-party sources; consider whether, copyright issues aside, your text is appropriate for inclusion in Wikipedia.

You can demonstrate that this text is in the public domain or is already under a license suitable for Wikipedia.

Please mention the rewrite upon completion on this article's discussion page .

Simply modifying copyrighted text is not sufficient to avoid copyright infringement—if the original copyright violation cannot be cleanly removed or the article reverted to a prior version, it is best to write the article from scratch. (See Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing .)

You may duplicate non-infringing text that you had contributed yourself.

It is always a good idea, if rewriting, to identify the point where the copyrighted content was imported to Wikipedia and to check to make sure that the contributor did not add content imported from other sources. When closing investigations, clerks and administrators may find other copyright problems than the one identified. If this material is in the proposed rewrite and cannot be easily removed, the rewrite may not be usable.

In 1980, Christian Voice claimed 107,000 members including 37,000 pastors from 45 denominations.

[ 1 ] Christian Voice was headquartered at The Heritage Foundation in the 1970s and 1980s and was located in Alexandria, Virginia .

[ 1 ] Christian Voice was among a group of four prominent Christian Right groups formed in 1978 and 1979.

[ 2 ] Christian Voice, Moral Majority , the Religious Roundtable, and the National Christian Action Coalition all enjoyed considerable popularity during Ronald Reagan's Presidency.

[ 2 ] Christian Voice was best known as the originator and developer of the Moral Report Cards [ 2 ] the "Congressional Report Card" and the "Candidates Scorecard" that were issued mainly between 1980 and 1984.

[ 3 ] It helped organize grassroots action through use of its "Church Networking Guide".

History [ edit ] Christian Voice, founded by Reverends Dr.

Robert Grant and Richard Zone in 1978, was formed out of several California anti-gay and anti-pornography organizations.

[ 2 ] Evangelical minister Pat Robertson , who later formed the Christian Coalition , furnished some early financial resources for the organization.

[ 2 ] Paul Weyrich , the leader of the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation , and a chief architect of the Christian right movement, which the Christian Voice was a part of, [ 4 ] met with Grant in 1976 and agreed to let Grant set up headquarters for his future organization at the headquarters of The Heritage Foundation.

[ 5 ] Weyrich, a member of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church , [ 4 ] then recruited former Nixon administration official Howard Phillips , a Jew who converted to Evangelical Christianity , [ 5 ] and was known for leading crusades to "defund the Left," [ 5 ] and direct mail king Richard Viguerie , a Roman Catholic to help develop Grant's organization.

[ 5 ] Christian Voice made its reputation as a lobbying organization, owing mostly to Grant's decision to hire Gary Jarmin, a Washington insider and Republican politico, [ 2 ] to run Christian Voice's lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill. Jarmin, in a Francis Schaeffer and Frank Schaeffer "co-belligerent" strategy also later mimicked by Ralph E. Reed Jr.

of the Christian Coalition, urged Jews, fundamentalists, Roman Catholics, Pentecostals and charismatics, and others to put aside their differences and work together for common notions of political change.

[ 2 ] This stood Christian Voice in contrast to Moral Majority, the Religious Roundtable and the National Christian Action Coalition, all of which were more narrowly fundamentalist in their ideology and were initially less willing to build political bridges to other religious communities.

[ 2 ] Weyrich, Viguerie and Phillips also abandoned the group in 1978 after Grant announced that the Christian Voice was "a sham" that was "controlled by three Catholics and a Jew;" [ 5 ] they then decided to align with rising televangelist Jerry Falwell and form the Moral Majority.

[ 5 ] Ralph Eugene Reed Jr. (formerly of the Christian Coalition of America ), 2011.

[ 2 ] born-again Christian [ 2 ] [ 2 ] Panama Canal Treaty [ 2 ] [ 2 ] [ 2 ] [ 2 ] Christian Voice was the first of the Christian Right groups, pre-dating the Christian Coalition , American Coalition for Traditional Values , Concerned Women for America , Moral Majority , Family Research Council , and other Christian political groups.  Christian Voice has employed hundreds of political organizers, including Susan Hirschman, Chief of Staff to former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay , Congressman Tom Hagadorn, who chaired the organization for several years, and Tim LaHaye , co-author of the Left Behind series.

[ citation needed ] At one point, US Senators Orrin Hatch (Utah), Roger Jespen (Iowa) and James McClure (Idaho) all served on the organization's board of directors.

[ 2 ] Many of the techniques used by current independent and 527 political campaigns were originally developed by Christian Voice (Most notably, a commonly used "Political Report Card" used to inform voters of how their representative voted was created by Christian Voice chief architect Colonel V. Doner).

[ 3 ] Decline [ edit ] The group's bare-knuckle politics angered many Christian Voice supporters, including some of the Congressmen on the board of directors.

[ 2 ] Christian Voice's primary legislative objective, a constitutional amendment to allow prayer in public schools, failed near the end of Reagan's first term.  After Reagan's second term began, Christian Voice shifted its activities away from lobbying and toward the publication of campaign literature, especially the aforementioned "report cards." [ 2 ] The group claimed to have distributed some 30 million report cards during the 1986 election cycle.

[ 2 ] However, funding and leadership flagged after the 1986 elections, [ 2 ] which saw Republicans lose control of the US Senate, [ 2 ] and many of the key members of Christian Voice fled to form the American Freedom Coalition with funding from Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon .

[ 2 ] As of 2012, the Christian Voice was still maintained by the American Service Council as a vehicle for direct mail campaigns both the targeting of voters and contributors and the delivery of petitions to the U.S. federal government.

[ 6 ] The American Service Council did not maintain a separate Christian Voice web site and stopped listing the Christian Voice on its own web site by 2014.

[ 7 ] The American Service Council dissolved in 2024.
