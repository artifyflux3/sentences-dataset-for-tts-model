Latitude 42° 30' N to 47° 05′ N Longitude 86° 46′ W to 92° 54′ W Website www .wisconsin .gov Wisconsin ( / w ɪ ˈ s k ɒ n s ɪ n / ⓘ wih- SKON -sin ) [ 12 ] is a state in the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes regions of the United States. It borders Minnesota to the west, Iowa to the southwest, Illinois to the south, Lake Michigan to the east, Michigan to the northeast, and Lake Superior to the north. With a population of about 6 million [ 9 ] and an area of about 65,500 square miles, Wisconsin is the 20th-largest state by population and the 23rd-largest by area . It has 72 counties . The state's most populous city is Milwaukee . Its capital and second-most populous city is Madison ; other urban areas include Green Bay and the Fox Cities .

Wisconsin's geography is diverse, with dense forests in the north (including Chequamegon–Nicolet National Forest ), rugged unglaciated hills in the western Driftless Area , and wooded plains, lowlands, and farms stretching from the interior east to Lake Michigan. Wisconsin has the third-longest Great Lakes coastline, after Ontario and Michigan. At the time of European contact, the area was inhabited by Algonquian and Siouan nations, and today it is home to eleven federally recognized tribes .

[ 13 ] Originally part of the Northwest Territory , it was admitted as a state in 1848. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, many European settlers entered the state, mostly from Germany and Scandinavia .

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Wisconsin remains a center of German American and Scandinavian American culture, [ 16 ] particularly in its cuisine , with foods such as bratwurst and kringle .

Wisconsin is one of the nation's leading dairy producers and is known as "America's Dairyland"; it is particularly famous for its cheese .

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] The state is also famous for its breweries , with beer in Milwaukee a longstanding industry. Wisconsin has some of the nation's most permissive alcohol laws and is known for its drinking culture .

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Its economy is dominated by manufacturing, healthcare, information technology, and agriculture—specifically dairy, cranberries , and ginseng .

[ 21 ] Tourism is also a major contributor to its economy.

[ 22 ] The gross domestic product in 2020 was $348 billion.

[ 23 ] Wisconsin is home to one UNESCO World Heritage Site , comprising two of the most significant buildings designed by Wisconsin-born architect Frank Lloyd Wright : his studio at Taliesin and his Jacobs I House .

[ 24 ] Politically, it is considered a swing state in national and statewide elections; the Republican Party was founded in Wisconsin in 1854.

Etymology The word Wisconsin originates from the name given to the Wisconsin River by one of the Algonquian -speaking Native American groups living in the region at the time of European colonization .

[ 25 ] The French explorer Jacques Marquette was the first European to reach the Wisconsin River, arriving in 1673 and calling the river Meskousing (likely ᒣᔅᑯᐤᓯᣙ meskowsin ) in his journal.

[ 26 ] Subsequent French writers changed the spelling from Meskousing to Ouisconsin , and over time this became the name for both the Wisconsin River and the surrounding lands. English speakers anglicized the spelling from Ouisconsin to Wisconsin when they began to arrive in large numbers during the early 19th century. The legislature of Wisconsin Territory made the current spelling official in 1845.

[ 27 ] The Algonquian word for Wisconsin and its original meaning have both grown obscure. While interpretations vary, most implicate the river and the red sandstone that lines its banks. One leading theory holds that the name originated from the Miami word Meskonsing , meaning ' it lies red ' , a reference to the setting of the Wisconsin River as it flows through the reddish sandstone of the Wisconsin Dells .

[ 28 ] Other theories include claims that the name originated from one of a variety of Ojibwa words meaning ' red stone place ' , ' where the waters gather ' , or ' great rock ' .

[ 29 ] More recently, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay lecturer and Menominee elder Napos Turney suggested the origin of the name may be the Menominee word Wēskōhsaeh , meaning "good place".

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] History Main article: History of Wisconsin Early history Aztalan State Park marks the site of an ancient Mississippian culture settlement that flourished during the 10th to 13th centuries.

Wisconsin has been home to a wide variety of cultures over the past 14,000 years. The first people arrived around 10,000 BCE during the Wisconsin Glaciation . These early inhabitants, called Paleo-Indians , hunted now-extinct ice age animals such as the Boaz mastodon , a prehistoric mastodon skeleton unearthed along with spear points in southwest Wisconsin.

[ 32 ] After the ice age ended around 8000 BCE, people in the subsequent Archaic period lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering food from wild plants. Agricultural societies emerged gradually over the Woodland period between 1000 BCE to 1000 CE. Toward the end of this period, Wisconsin was the heartland of the " Effigy Mound culture", which built thousands of animal-shaped mounds across the landscape.

[ 33 ] Later, between 1000 and 1500 CE, the Mississippian and Oneota cultures built substantial settlements including the fortified village at Aztalan in southeast Wisconsin.

[ 34 ] The Oneota may be the ancestors of the modern Iowa and Ho-Chunk nations who shared the Wisconsin region with the Menominee at the time of European contact.

[ 35 ] Other Native American groups living in Wisconsin when Europeans first settled included the Ojibwe , Sauk , Meskwaki , Kickapoo , and Potawatomi , who migrated to Wisconsin from the east between 1500 and 1700.

[ 36 ] European settlements Main articles: New France , Canada (New France) , French and Indian War , Treaty of Paris (1763) , Province of Quebec (1763–1791) , and Indian Reserve (1763) Jean Nicolet , depicted in a 1910 painting by Frank Rohrbeck, was probably the first European to explore Wisconsin. The mural is located in the Brown County Courthouse in Green Bay.

The first European to visit what became Wisconsin was probably the French explorer Jean Nicolet . He canoed west from Georgian Bay through the Great Lakes in 1634, and it is traditionally assumed that he came ashore near Green Bay at Red Banks .

[ 37 ] Pierre Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers visited Green Bay again in 1654–1666 and Chequamegon Bay in 1659–1660, where they traded for fur with local Native Americans.

[ 38 ] In 1673, Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet became the first to record a journey on the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway all the way to the Mississippi River near Prairie du Chien .

[ 39 ] Frenchmen like Nicholas Perrot continued to ply the fur trade across Wisconsin through the 17th and 18th centuries, but the French made no permanent settlements in Wisconsin before Great Britain won control of the region following the French and Indian War in 1763. Even so, French traders continued to work in the region after the war, and some, beginning with Charles de Langlade in 1764, settled in Wisconsin permanently, rather than returning to British-controlled Canada.

[ 40 ] The British gradually took over Wisconsin during the French and Indian War, taking control of Green Bay in 1761 and gaining control of all of Wisconsin in 1763. Like the French, the British were interested in little but the fur trade. One notable event in the fur trading industry in Wisconsin occurred in 1791, when two free African Americans set up a fur trading post among the Menominee at present-day Marinette . The first permanent settlers, mostly French Canadians , some Anglo- New Englanders and a few African American freedmen, arrived in Wisconsin while it was under British control. Charles de Langlade is generally recognized as the first settler, establishing a trading post at Green Bay in 1745, and moving there permanently in 1764.

[ 40 ] Settlement began at Prairie du Chien around 1781. The French residents at the trading post in what is now Green Bay, referred to the town as "La Baye". However, British fur traders referred to it as "Green Bay", because the water and the shore assumed green tints in early spring. The old French title was gradually dropped, and the British name of "Green Bay" eventually stuck. The region coming under British rule had virtually no adverse effect on the French residents as the British needed the cooperation of the French fur traders and the French fur traders needed the goodwill of the British. During the French occupation of the region licenses for fur trading had been issued scarcely and only to select groups of traders, whereas the British, in an effort to make as much money as possible from the region, issued licenses for fur trading freely, both to British and to French residents. The fur trade in what is now Wisconsin reached its height under British rule, and the first self-sustaining farms in the state were established as well. From 1763 to 1780, Green Bay was a prosperous community which produced its own foodstuff, built graceful cottages and held dances and festivities.

[ 41 ] Joseph Roi built the Tank Cottage in Green Bay in 1776. Located in Heritage Hill State Historical Park , it is the oldest standing building from Wisconsin's early years and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

[ 42 ] U.S. territory Main articles: American Revolutionary War , Treaty of Paris (1783) , Northwest Ordinance , Northwest Territory , Indiana Territory , Illinois Territory , Michigan Territory , Organic act § List of organic acts , and Wisconsin Territory The Francois Vertefeuille House in Prairie du Chien was built in the 1810s by fur traders.

Wisconsin became a territorial possession of the United States in 1783 after the American Revolutionary War . In 1787, it became part of the Northwest Territory . As territorial boundaries subsequently developed, it was then part of Indiana Territory from 1800 to 1809, Illinois Territory from 1809 to 1818, and Michigan Territory from 1818 to 1836. However, the British remained in control until after the War of 1812 , the outcome of which finally established an American presence in the area.

[ 43 ] Under American control, the economy of the territory shifted from fur trading to lead mining. The prospect of easy mineral wealth drew immigrants from throughout the U.S. and Europe to the lead deposits at Mineral Point , Dodgeville , and nearby areas. Some miners found shelter in the holes they had dug, and earned the nickname "badgers", leading to Wisconsin's identity as the "Badger State".

[ 44 ] The sudden influx of white miners prompted tension with the local Native American population. The Winnebago War of 1827 and the Black Hawk War of 1832 culminated in the forced removal of Native Americans from most parts of the state.

[ 45 ] Following these conflicts, Wisconsin Territory was created by an act of the United States Congress on April 20, 1836. By fall of that year, the best prairie groves of the counties surrounding what is now Milwaukee were occupied by farmers from the New England states.

[ 46 ] Statehood Main articles: Admission to the Union and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union On May 29, 1948, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative stamp celebrating the 100th anniversary of Wisconsin statehood, featuring the state capitol building and map of Wisconsin.

The Erie Canal facilitated the travel of both Yankee settlers and European immigrants to Wisconsin Territory. Yankees from New England and upstate New York seized a dominant position in law and politics, enacting policies that marginalized the region's earlier Native American and French-Canadian residents.

[ 47 ] Yankees also speculated in real estate, platted towns such as Racine, Beloit, Burlington, and Janesville, and established schools, civic institutions, and Congregationalist churches.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] At the same time, many Germans , Irish, Norwegians , and other immigrants also settled in towns and farms across the territory, establishing Catholic and Lutheran institutions.

The growing population allowed Wisconsin to gain statehood on May 29, 1848, as the 30th state. Between 1840 and 1850, Wisconsin's non-Indian population had swollen from 31,000 to 305,000. More than a third of residents (110,500) were foreign born, including 38,000 Germans, 28,000 British immigrants from England, Scotland, and Wales, and 21,000 Irish. Another third (103,000) were Yankees from New England and western New York state. Only about 63,000 residents in 1850 had been born in Wisconsin.

[ 51 ] Nelson Dewey , the first governor of Wisconsin , was a Democrat . Dewey oversaw the transition from the territorial to the new state government.

[ 52 ] He encouraged the development of the state's infrastructure, particularly the construction of new roads, railroads, canals, and harbors, as well as the improvement of the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers .

[ 52 ] During his administration, the State Board of Public Works was organized.

[ 52 ] Dewey, an abolitionist , was the first of many Wisconsin governors to advocate against the spread of slavery into new states and territories.

[ 52 ] Further information: Pioneer Women in Wisconsin Civil War Main article: Wisconsin in the American Civil War The Little White Schoolhouse in Ripon held the nation's first meeting of the Republican Party .

Politics in early Wisconsin were defined by the greater national debate over slavery. A free state from its foundation, Wisconsin became a center of northern abolitionism . The debate became especially intense in 1854 after Joshua Glover , a runaway slave from Missouri , was captured in Racine . Glover was taken into custody under the Federal Fugitive Slave Law , but a mob of abolitionists stormed the prison where Glover was held and helped him escape to Canada. In a trial stemming from the incident, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ultimately declared the Fugitive Slave Law unconstitutional.

[ 53 ] The Republican Party , founded on March 20, 1854, by anti-slavery expansion activists in Ripon, Wisconsin , grew to dominate state politics in the aftermath of these events.

[ 54 ] During the American Civil War , around 91,000 troops from Wisconsin fought for the Union .

[ 55 ] A number of Wisconsin regiments were distinguished, including three that served in the celebrated " Iron Brigade "— the 2nd Wisconsin , 6th Wisconsin , and 7th Wisconsin . The 8th Wisconsin , another hard-fighting regiment, was often accompanied into battle by its mascot, Old Abe , a bald eagle.

19th-century development The Daniel E. Krause Stone Barn in Chase was built in 1903, as dairy farming spread across the state.

Wisconsin's economy also diversified during the early years of statehood. While lead mining diminished, agriculture became a principal occupation in the southern half of the state. Railroads were built across the state to help transport grains to market, and industries like J.I. Case & Company in Racine were founded to build agricultural equipment. Wisconsin briefly became one of the nation's leading producers of wheat during the 1860s.

[ 56 ] Meanwhile, the lumber industry dominated in the heavily forested northern sections of Wisconsin, and sawmills sprang up in cities like La Crosse , Eau Claire , and Wausau . These economic activities had dire environmental consequences. By the close of the 19th century, intensive agriculture had devastated soil fertility, and lumbering had deforested most of the state.

[ 57 ] These conditions forced both wheat agriculture and the lumber industry into a precipitous decline.

Beginning in the 1890s, farmers in Wisconsin shifted from wheat to dairy production to make more sustainable and profitable use of their land. Many immigrants carried cheese-making traditions that, combined with the state's suitable geography and dairy research led by Stephen Babcock at the University of Wisconsin , helped the state build a reputation as "America's Dairyland".

[ 58 ] Meanwhile, conservationists including Aldo Leopold helped re-establish the state's forests during the early 20th century, [ 59 ] paving the way for a more renewable lumber and paper milling industry as well as promoting recreational tourism in the northern woodlands. Manufacturing also boomed in Wisconsin during the early 20th century, driven by an immense immigrant workforce arriving from Europe. Industries in cities like Milwaukee ranged from brewing and food processing to heavy machine production and tool-making, leading Wisconsin to rank 8th among U.S. states in total product value by 1910.

[ 60 ] 20th century Suffragists campaigning, 1916. Wisconsin was among the earliest states to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment .

[ 61 ] The early 20th century was also notable for the emergence of progressive politics championed by Robert M. La Follette . Between 1901 and 1914, Progressive Republicans in Wisconsin created the nation's first comprehensive statewide primary election system, [ 62 ] the first effective workplace injury compensation law, [ 63 ] and the first state income tax , [ 64 ] making taxation proportional to actual earnings.

During World War I , due to the neutrality of Wisconsin and many of its Republicans , Progressives , and Conservatives , including Germans and Scandinavians who were a significant proportion of the state's population, Wisconsin began to be accused of being the "Traitor State" by many "hyper patriots." [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] As the war raged on in Europe, Robert M. La Follette , leader of the anti-war movement in Wisconsin, led a group of progressive senators in blocking a bill by president Woodrow Wilson which would have armed merchant ships with guns. Many Wisconsin politicians such as Emanuel L. Philipp and Irvine Lenroot were accused of having divided loyalties.

[ 69 ] Even with outspoken opponents to the war, at the onset of the war many Wisconsinites would abandon neutrality. Businesses, labor and farms all enjoyed prosperity from the war. With over 118,000 going into military service, Wisconsin was the first state to report for the national drafts conducted by the U.S. military .

[ 70 ] As governor, Philipp was successful in combating anti-German hysteria in the state.

[ 71 ] 1930s - 1950s The progressive Wisconsin Idea also promoted the statewide expansion of the University of Wisconsin through the UW-Extension system at this time.

[ 72 ] Later, UW economics professors John R. Commons and Harold Groves helped Wisconsin create the first unemployment compensation program in the United States in 1932.

[ 73 ] Other Wisconsin Idea scholars at the university generated the plan that became the New Deal's Social Security Act of 1935, with Wisconsin expert Arthur J. Altmeyer playing the key role.

[ 74 ] Governor Philip F. La Follette announces formation of the National Progressives of America , April 28, 1938.

After Robert La Follette died, his two sons, Philip La Follette and Robert La Follette, Jr.

, assumed control of the Wisconsin Republican Party after a brief period of intraparty factional disputes. Following in their father's footsteps, they helped form the Wisconsin Progressive Party , in many ways a spiritual successor to the party La Follette founded in 1924. The party surged in popularity during the mid-1930s during the moderately conservative Schmedeman administration, and gained President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's support. Much of the new party's support owed to the personalities leading it, and the support of Roosevelt and progressive Democrats. The party saw success across Wisconsin's elected offices in the state and Congress. The party eventually declined as Philip, engulfed in scandal and accusations of authoritarianism and fiscal irresponsibility, lost reelection a final time in 1938 to Julius P. Heil . Philip then left electoral politics and joined World War II in the Pacific theater. The National Progressives of America , an organization Philip had hoped would precede a national realignment, then faltered. The Wisconsin Progressives began to tear themselves apart as La Follette's absence led to vicious intraparty fighting that ultimately led to a vote to dissolve itself.

[ 75 ] In World War II's immediate aftermath, Wisconsinites were divided over issues such as creation of the United Nations , support for the European recovery, and the growth of the Soviet Union 's power. But when Europe divided into Communist and capitalist camps , and with the Progressive Party's collapse, Robert La Follette, Jr. rejoined the Republican Party of Wisconsin to run in the 1946 Senate election. He was narrowly defeated by Joseph McCarthy in the Republican primary . After the Chinese Communist Revolution succeeded in 1949, public opinion began to continue move toward support for the protection of democracy and capitalism against Communist expansion.

[ 76 ] 1960s - 1990s In the 20th century, Superior was a major hub for shipping iron ore across the Great Lakes via lake freighters .

( April 2025 ) Wisconsin took part in several political extremes in the mid to late 20th century, ranging from the anti-communist crusades of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s to the radical antiwar protests at UW-Madison that culminated in the Sterling Hall bombing in August 1970. The state undertook welfare reform under Republican Governor Tommy Thompson during the 1990s.

[ 77 ] The state's economy also underwent further transformations towards the close of the 20th century, as heavy industry and manufacturing declined in favor of a service economy based on medicine, education, agribusiness, and tourism.

( April 2025 ) In 2011, Wisconsin became the focus of some controversy when newly elected governor Scott Walker proposed and then successfully passed and enacted 2011 Wisconsin Act 10 , which made large changes in the areas of collective bargaining, compensation, retirement, health insurance, and sick leave of public sector employees, among other changes.

[ 78 ] A series of major protests by union supporters took place that year in protest to the changes, and Walker survived a recall election held the next year , becoming the first governor in United States history to do so.

[ 79 ] Since 2023, five University of Wisconsin branch campuses have closed , one has gone entirely online, and one has stopped using several of its buildings. Many have expressed concerns about the future of the Wisconsin Idea following these closures.

[ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] Geography Main article: Geography of Wisconsin Wisconsin geographic regions Wisconsin is in the Midwestern United States and is part of both the Great Lakes region and the Upper Midwest . The state has a total area of 65,496 square miles (169,630 km 2 ). Wisconsin is bordered by Lake Superior and Michigan to the north; by Lake Michigan to the east; by Illinois to the south; and by Iowa to the southwest and Minnesota to the northwest. A border dispute with Michigan was settled by two cases, both Wisconsin v. Michigan , in 1934 and 1935. The state's boundaries include the Mississippi River and St. Croix River in the west, and the Menominee River and Montreal River in the northeast.

[ 83 ] Lying between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River, Wisconsin has a wide variety of geographical features. The state is divided into five distinct regions. In the north, the Lake Superior Lowland occupies a belt of land along Lake Superior. Just to the south, the Northern Highland has massive mixed hardwood and coniferous forests including the 1,500,000-acre (610,000-hectare) Chequamegon–Nicolet National Forest , as well as thousands of glacial lakes, and the state's highest point, Timms Hill . In the middle of the state, the Central Plain has some unique sandstone formations like the Dells of the Wisconsin River in addition to rich farmland. The Eastern Ridges and Lowlands region in the southeast is home to many of Wisconsin's largest cities. The ridges include the Niagara Escarpment that stretches from New York, the Black River Escarpment and the Magnesian Escarpment .

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] In the southwest, the Western Upland is a rugged landscape with a mix of forest and farmland, including many bluffs on the Mississippi River, and the Baraboo Range . This region is part of the Driftless Area , which also includes parts of Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota. Overall, 46% of Wisconsin's land area is covered by forest.

The Driftless Area is characterized by bluffs carved in sedimentary rock by water from melting Ice age glaciers.

Sea caves are located on the shorelines of the Apostle Islands in Lake Superior .

Wisconsin has geologic formations and deposits that vary in age from over three billion years to several thousand years, with most rocks being millions of years old.

[ 86 ] The oldest geologic formations were created over 600 million years ago during the Precambrian , the majority below the glacial deposits. Much of the Baraboo Range consists of Baraboo Quartzite and other Precambrian metamorphic rock .

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] This area was not covered by glaciers during the most recent ice age, the Wisconsin Glaciation .

Langlade County has a soil rarely found outside the county called Antigo silt loam .

[ 89 ] The state has more than 12,000 named rivers and streams, totaling 84,000 miles (135,000 km) in length.

[ 90 ] It has over 15,000 named lakes, totaling about 1 million acres (4,000 km 2 ).

Lake Winnebago is the largest inland lake, with over 137,700 acres (557 km 2 ), and 88 miles (142 km) of shoreline. Along the two Great Lakes, Wisconsin has over 800 miles (1,300 km) of shoreline (over 500 miles (800 km), not counting minor islands and indentations).

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] Many of the named islands in Wisconsin are in the Great Lakes; many surround the Door Peninsula in Lake Michigan or are part of the Apostle Islands in Lake Superior.

[ 93 ] The Mississippi River and inland lakes and rivers contain the rest of Wisconsin's islands.

[ 105 ] This includes a natural increase since the last census of 150,659 people (i.e., 614,771 births minus 464,112 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 12,755 people. Immigration resulted in a net increase of 59,251 people, and migration from within the U.S. resulted in a net decrease of 72,006 people.

[ 106 ] According to HUD 's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report , there were an estimated 4,775 homeless people in Wisconsin.

[ 117 ] Since its founding, Wisconsin has been ethnically heterogeneous. Following the period of French fur traders, the next wave of settlers were miners, many of whom were Cornish , who settled the southwestern area of the state. The next wave was dominated by "Yankees", migrants of English descent from New England and upstate New York ; in the early years of statehood, they dominated the state's heavy industry, finance, politics, and education. Between 1850 and 1900, the immigrants were mostly Germans , Scandinavians (the largest group being Norwegian ), Irish , and Poles . In the 20th century, a number of African Americans and Mexicans settled in Milwaukee ; and after the end of the Vietnam War came an influx of Hmongs .

The various ethnic groups settled in different areas of the state. Although German immigrants settled throughout the state, the largest concentration was in Milwaukee. Norwegian immigrants settled in lumbering and farming areas in the north and west. Irish, Italian, and Polish immigrants settled primarily in urban areas.

[ 118 ] Menominee County is the only county in the eastern United States with a Native American majority.

African Americans came to Milwaukee, especially from 1940 on. 86% of Wisconsin's African-American population live in four cities: Milwaukee , Racine , Beloit , Kenosha , with Milwaukee home to nearly three-fourths of the state's black Americans. In the Great Lakes region, only Detroit and Cleveland have a higher percentage of African-American residents.

[ 119 ] About 33% of Wisconsin's Asian population is Hmong , with significant communities in Milwaukee , Wausau , Green Bay , Sheboygan , Appleton , Madison , La Crosse , Eau Claire , Oshkosh , and Manitowoc .

[ 120 ] 61,629 people in Wisconsin, or around 1% of the population, identify as Hmong.

[ 121 ] Of the residents of Wisconsin, 71.7% were born in Wisconsin, 23.0% were born in a different US state, 0.7% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 4.6% were foreign born.

[ 122 ] In 2018, the countries of origin for Wisconsin's immigrants came from Mexico, India, China, Laos and the Philippines .

Formerly, Schlitz , Blatz , and Pabst were cornerstone breweries in Milwaukee.

The development and manufacture of healthcare devices and software is a growing sector of the state's economy, with key players such as GE Healthcare , Epic Systems , and TomoTherapy .

Agriculture Main article: Agriculture in Wisconsin See also: Wisconsin dairy industry and Wisconsin cheese Dairy cows at a Wisconsin dairy farm Wisconsin produces about a quarter of America's cheese, leading the nation in cheese production.

[ 148 ] < It is second in milk production, after California , [ 149 ] and third in per-capita milk production, behind California and Vermont .

[ 150 ] Wisconsin is second in butter production, producing about one-quarter of the nation's butter.

[ 151 ] Wisconsin requires cheese and butter makers to hold a license for production, being the only state in the US to require certification for either.

[ 152 ] The state ranks first nationally in the production of corn for silage , cranberries , [ 153 ] ginseng , [ 154 ] and snap beans for processing. It grows more than half the national crop of cranberries.

[ 153 ] and 97% of the nation's ginseng.

[ 154 ] Wisconsin is also a leading producer of oats , potatoes, carrots, tart cherries , maple syrup , and sweet corn for processing.

The significance of the state's agricultural production is exemplified by the depiction of a Holstein cow, an ear of corn, and a wheel of cheese on Wisconsin's state quarter design.

[ 155 ] The state annually selects an " Alice in Dairyland " to promote the state's agricultural products around the world.

[ 156 ] The prominence of the dairy industry in Wisconsin has led to Wisconsin being known as "America's Dairyland", [ 157 ] [ 2 ] which was made the official state slogan in 1940.

[ 158 ] Tourism Further information: Economy of Door County, Wisconsin The Dells of the Wisconsin River form a tourism region focused on river features and nearby theme parks .

The Dells of the Wisconsin River , a gorge noted for its rock formations in south-central Wisconsin, annually attracts more than four million visitors between water tours of the scenery and numerous theme parks in the region.

[ 159 ] Nearby Devil's Lake State Park is one of the most visited of Wisconsin's state parks due to its proximity to the Dells and its own scenery.

The Door Peninsula , which extends off the eastern coast of the state, contains Door County , a popular destination for boaters due to the large number of natural harbors and boat launches on both the Green Bay and Lake Michigan sides of the peninsula. The area draws more than two million visitors yearly to its quaint villages, seasonal cherry picking, and fish boils .

[ 162 ] [ 163 ] Given the large number of lakes and rivers in the state, water recreation is popular. In the Northwoods Lake Country, what had been an industrial area focused on timber has largely been transformed into a vacation destination.

[ 168 ] The most common property tax assessed on Wisconsin residents is the real property tax , or their residential property tax. Wisconsin does not impose a property tax on vehicles, but does levy an annual registration fee. Property taxes are the most important tax revenue source for Wisconsin's local governments, as well as major methods of funding school districts, vocational-technical colleges, special purpose districts and tax incremental finance districts. Equalized values are based on the full market value of all taxable property in the state, except for agricultural land. To provide property tax relief for farmers, the value of agricultural land is determined by its value for agricultural uses, rather than for its possible development value. Equalized values are used to distribute state aid payments to counties, municipalities, and technical colleges. Assessments prepared by local assessors are used to distribute the property tax burden within individual municipalities.

Wisconsin does not assess a tax on intangible property . Wisconsin does not collect inheritance taxes . Until January 1, 2008, Wisconsin's estate tax was decoupled from the federal estate tax laws; therefore the state imposed its own estate tax on certain large estates.

[ 169 ] There are no toll roads in Wisconsin; highway construction and maintenance are funded in part by motor fuel tax revenues, and the remaining balance is drawn from the State General Fund. Non-highway road construction and maintenance are funded by local governments (municipalities or counties).

State symbols See also: List of Wisconsin state symbols The American badger is the state animal of Wisconsin.

Wisconsin is traditionally known as the "Badger State" due to its early history in lead mining . Many of the state's first settlers were drawn by the prospect of mining in southwest Wisconsin, a mineral-rich region which had been contested between Native Americans and the U.S. Some of the miners lived burrowed within hillsides either due to lack of time or finances to build above-ground structures during the winter. Similar to the American badger using its claws to dig holes, the miners were nicknamed "badgers". The University of Wisconsin–Madison adopted the badger as a mascot in 1889 after the nickname; the badger was named Wisconsin's state animal in 1957.
