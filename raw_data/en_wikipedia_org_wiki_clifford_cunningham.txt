Cunningham is a Canadian -Scottish professional astronomer and author of numerous books on asteroids .

[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] He obtained his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Waterloo ; upon enrollment, at age 15, he was the youngest student ever to attend UW.

[ 2 ] In 1991 he earned his BA in Classical Studies. For his book Introduction to Asteroids (1988) and development of The Minor Planet Index to Scientific Papers (currently on the small bodies node of the Planetary Data System managed by NASA), an asteroid was named in his honour. Asteroid 4276 was named Clifford.

[ 1 ] His work after graduation included astronomical observations at Lowell Observatory; studies in the microbiology department of the University of Guelph; software analysis for Computing Canada; and senior writer in multimedia for the Ontario Lottery Corporation. He is a contributing editor to Mercury magazine (since 2001), and a contributor to The Astronomical Calendar (1988–2013). In 1999 he appeared as a Starfleet officer on the TV show Star Trek: Deep Space Nine . In 2013 he became affiliated with NARIT, the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand. In 2016 he was appointed an associate editor of the Journal of Astronomical History & Heritage, and in 2014 a contributor to Encyclopædia Britannica.

[ 3 ] In 2020 he was one of 100 world experts commissioned by Britannica to write its Kid's Encyclopedia . He earned his PhD in the history of astronomy at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) in Australia in 2015. He is now a Research Fellow at USQ, and became one of three Series Editors of Historical and Cultural Astronomy books for Springer in June 2019. In 2020 he was elected to membership in the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and as of 2022 is a member of Commission 3 (History of Astronomy).

After years of research, Dr. Cunningham finally discovered who coined the word 'asteroid'. Although 'asteroid' has been attributed to the famous astronomer William Herschel , Cunningham found evidence that it was proposed by Greek expert Charles Burney Jr., the son of a friend of Herschel.

[ 4 ] In 2014 he discovered a previously unrecognised allusion to the aurora borealis in Milton's Paradise Lost . In 2020 he published evidence that Manilius, not Hipparchus, developed the numerical stellar magnitude system. His seventh asteroid book was published in 2021. In development are three edited books on history of astronomy, which will be published by Springer, Reaktion and Bloomsbury.

Awards and honors [ edit ] In 1990, the Mars-crossing asteroid 4276 Clifford , discovered by American astronomer Edward Bowell in 1981, was named in his honor. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 10 April 1990 ( M.P.C.

16248 ).
