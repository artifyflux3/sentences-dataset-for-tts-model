[ 7 ] ^ VI as duke of Carinthia.

References [ edit ] ^ Between 1112 and 1123 Znojmo was part of Brno.

^ According to a bold hypothesis by historian Jaroslav Zástěra , the Premyslid dynasty was a possible direct descendant of the ruling family of Great Moravia , being Borivoj a son of Rastislav of Moravia .

^ The intermission of other feudal lords of different branches could be seen as regencies, as it would happen, for example, in the 15-century Duchy of Austria , where Duke Frederick V exerted regency for his minor cousin, Ladislaus the Posthumous . However, these intermissions could be also similar, for example, to Kievan Rus' , where rulers apparently "jumped" from place to place. Albeit this, nothing is proved.

^ The note referring to the regencies could apply here as well. The reason Conrad did not receive his duchy right after his father's death could be related to a possible minority that stopped him for assuming his power sooner.

^ The regency referred in previous notes may be proven here: in 1126, when his father died, he was too young to assume power. The rulers appointed by Sobeslaus I in the period 1126–40 could be functioning as regents.
