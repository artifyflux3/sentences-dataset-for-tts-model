Yinyu Ye ( Chinese : 叶荫宇 ; pinyin : Yè Yīnyǔ ; born 1948) is a Chinese American theoretical computer scientist working on mathematical optimization . He is a specialist in interior point methods , especially in convex minimization and linear programming . He is a professor of Management Science and Engineering and Kwoh-Ting Li Chair Professor of Engineering at Stanford University . He also holds a courtesy appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering . Ye also is a co-founder of  minMax Optimization Inc.

Education [ edit ] Yinyu Ye was born in 1948 in Wuhan , Hubei , China. He attended Huazhong University of Science and Technology and graduated with a B.S. in Systems and Control in 1982. He received a Ph.D in Engineering Economic Systems from Stanford University in 1988, under the supervision of George B. Dantzig .

Research publications [ edit ] Ye wrote Interior-Point Algorithms: Theory and Analysis . He joined David Luenberger for the third edition of Luenberger's Linear and Nonlinear Programming .

[ 1 ] In recent years, Ye has developed computational methods and theory using semidefinite programming for practical problems like the localization of network sensors. In computational economics , Ye has also established new complexity results for problems concerning the computation of an economic equilibrium .

[ 2 ] Awards [ edit ] Ye was a 2009 co-recipient of the John von Neumann Theory Prize .

[ 2 ] He was elected to the 2006 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences .

[ 3 ] Positions [ edit ] Before joining Stanford University , Ye was a Henry B. Tippie Research Professor at the University of Iowa . Ye is a co-founder of minMax Optimization, a technology company based in Palo Alto and Shanghai focused on creating optimization tools for geospatial and financial problems.
