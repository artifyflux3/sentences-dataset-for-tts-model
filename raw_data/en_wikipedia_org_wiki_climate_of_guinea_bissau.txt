The country borders Senegal in the north and Guinea in the southeast.

Terrain and ecology [ edit ] Guinea-Bissau's topography.

The terrain of Guinea-Bissau is mostly low coastal plain with swamps of Guinean mangroves rising to Guinean forest-savanna mosaic in the east.

[ 1 ] A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,203km² of tidal flats in Guinea-Bissau, making it the 28th ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.

[ 2 ] Around 66 million years ago, an asteroid impact occurred 400 km of the west-African coast. The 2022 discovered Nadir buried Crater has a diameter of 9 km. The impact caused an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude and created a 1 km high tsunami. The combined forces could be an explanation for the extremely scarred coastline of Guinea-Bissau.

The lowest point on Guinea-Bissau is at sea level at the Atlantic Ocean.

[ 1 ] The highest point in Guinea-Bissau is Dongol Ronde with an elevation of 277 m (909 ft).

[ 1 ] The Conservation Atlas of Tropical Forests: Africa authored in 1992 cites Fouta Djallon at 262 m (860 ft) as the highest.

[ 3 ] Natural resources found in Guinea-Bissau include fish, timber , phosphates , bauxite , clay, granite , limestone and unexploited deposits of petroleum .

[ 1 ] 10.67% of the land is arable and 235.6 square kilometres are irrigated.

[ 1 ] Natural hazards include a hot, dry, dusty harmattan haze that may reduce visibility during the dry season and brush fires.

[ 1 ] Severe environmental issues include deforestation ; soil erosion ; overgrazing and overfishing .

[ 1 ] Near the Senegal border there have been historic sightings of the painted hunting dog , Lycaon pictus , but that endangered canid may now be extirpated in that locale.

[ 4 ] Climate [ edit ] Further information: Climate change in Africa Guinea-Bissau's climate is tropical . This means it is generally hot and humid. It has a monsoonal -type rainy season (June to November) with southwesterly winds and a dry season (December to May) with northeasterly harmattan winds.

[ 1 ] Köppen–Geiger climate classification map at 1-km resolution for Guinea-Bissau (1991–2020) Guinea-Bissau is warm all year around and there is little temperature fluctuation; it averages 26.3 °C (79.3 °F). The average rainfall for the capital city Bissau is 2,024 millimetres (79.7 in) although this is almost entirely accounted for during the rainy season which falls between June and September/October. From December through April, the country receives very little rainfall.
