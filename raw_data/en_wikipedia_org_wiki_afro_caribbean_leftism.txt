Spenceans [ edit ] During the early nineteenth century, the Jamaican -born activists William Davidson and Robert Wedderburn were drawn to the politics of Thomas Spence .

Interwar era [ edit ] Many Afro-Caribbean soldiers who served in the British West Indies Regiment (BWIR) became left-wing activists after the war during the interwar era . While serving in European and Middle Eastern fronts of the First World War , experiences of discrimination from white servicemen inspired a resurgence in anti-colonial nationalism among the British West Indian islands .

[ 1 ] The 9th Battalion of the BWIR initiated the Taranto Revolt , a mutiny against poor working conditions and a wage increase awarded to white but not black servicemen by the War Office . In response, the Worcestershire Regiment was dispatched to Taranto to suppress the mutiny; sixty BWIR servicemen were tried for mutiny, with one serviceman being sentenced to death by firing squad . Between 50 and 60 BWIR sergeants met on 17 December, 1918 to form the left-wing Caribbean League , which held four meetings in the following weeks. Aside from discussing various grievances held by the servicemen, the Caribbean League also discussed Caribbean nationalism and plans for a West Indian independence movement. Members of the League made plans to establish an office in Kingston, Jamaica , and organise strikes. After the colonial government started to crack down on the League, it disbanded. In February 1919, Army Order No. 1 was issued, extending the wage increase to the BWIR.
