It is formed by the basal bodies and several other structures composed of fibrils . Their function is not fully understood.

[ 1 ] The system is studied and visualised mainly through techniques such as plasma membrane extraction, high-voltage electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, the cell-sandwich technique, freeze-etching, and immunocytochemistry .

Composition [ edit ] The main structures that compose the Mastigont system include: [ 2 ] the pelta-axostyle system, made of microtubules ; it supports the cell axis and is involved in karyokinesis . The pelta is a microtubular structure that holds the flagellar canal.

The costa , a rootlet; it supports flagellar movements and provides an anchoring system for the nucleus and Golgi.

The parabasal and sigmoid filaments ; Other filaments.
