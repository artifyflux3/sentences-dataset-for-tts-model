They had five children: Helena (1913–1994), who married Joseph L. Henderson in 1934 [ 3 ] John (1915–1936), poet and Communist killed in the Spanish Civil War Christopher (1917–1993), artist and writer, the father of Adam Cornford Hugh Wordsworth (1921–1997), medical doctor [ 4 ] Ruth Clare (1923–1992), mother of Matthew Chapman Career [ edit ] Cornford was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge , where he was a Fellow from 1899 and held a teaching post from 1902.

[ 5 ] He became the first Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy in 1931 and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1937.

[ 2 ] He used wit and satire to propagate proposals for reforming the teaching of the classics at Cambridge, in Microcosmographia Academica (1908).

[ 2 ] Works [ edit ] Thucydides Mythistoricus (1907) put the argument that Thucydides 's History of the Peloponnesian War was informed by Thucydides's tragic view.

From Religion to Philosophy: A Study in the Origins of Western Speculation (1912) sought the deep religious and social concepts that informed the early Greek philosophers. He returned to this in Principium Sapientiae: The Origins of Greek Philosophical Thought (posthumous, 1952).

Microcosmographia Academica (1908) was an insider's satire on academic politics. It was the source of catch phrases such as the "doctrine of unripeness of time", the "principle of the wedge" and the "principle of the dangerous precedent".

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Before and After Socrates (1932) Plato's Cosmology : The Timaeus of Plato.

Hackett Publishing Company (1935) According to the preface to The Republic of Plato , translated with an introduction and notes (OUP, 1941), it "aims at conveying... as much as possible of the thought of the Republic in the most convenient and least misleading form."
