A [wine glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_glass "Wine glass") in an [LCD projector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCD_projector "LCD projector")'s light beam makes the beam scatter.

In physics, **scattering** is a wide range of physical processes where moving particles or radiation of some form, such as [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") or [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound "Sound"), are forced to deviate from a straight [trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory") by localized non-uniformities (including particles and radiation) in the medium through which they pass. In conventional use, this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the [law of reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_reflection "Law of reflection"). Reflections of radiation that undergo scattering are often called _[diffuse reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse\_reflection "Diffuse reflection")_ and unscattered reflections are called _[specular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular "Specular")_ (mirror-like) reflections. Originally, the term was confined to light scattering (going back at least as far as [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") in the 17th century[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-1)). As more "ray"-like phenomena were discovered, the idea of scattering was extended to them, so that [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel "William Herschel") could refer to the scattering of "heat rays" (not then recognized as electromagnetic in nature) in 1800.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-2)[John Tyndall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyndall "John Tyndall"), a pioneer in light scattering research, noted the connection between light scattering and acoustic scattering in the 1870s.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-3) Near the end of the 19th century, the scattering of [cathode rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray "Cathode ray") (electron beams)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-4) and X-rays[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-5) was observed and discussed. With the discovery of subatomic particles (e.g. [Ernest Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford "Ernest Rutherford") in 1911[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-6)) and the development of quantum theory in the 20th century, the sense of the term became broader as it was recognized that the same mathematical frameworks used in light scattering could be applied to many other phenomena.

Scattering can refer to the consequences of [particle-particle collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_collision "Particle collision") between molecules, atoms, [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), photons and other particles. Examples include: [cosmic ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray") scattering in the Earth's upper atmosphere; particle collisions inside [particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator "Particle accelerator"); electron scattering by gas atoms in fluorescent lamps; and [neutron scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_scattering "Neutron scattering") inside [nuclear reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor "Nuclear reactor").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-7)

The types of non-uniformities which can cause scattering, sometimes known as _scatterers_ or _scattering centers_, are too numerous to list, but a small sample includes [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle"), [bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_bubble "Liquid bubble"), [droplets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droplet "Droplet"), [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density") fluctuations in [fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid"), [crystallites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallite "Crystallite") in [polycrystalline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycrystal "Polycrystal") solids, defects in [monocrystalline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocrystal "Monocrystal") solids, [surface roughness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_roughness "Surface roughness"), [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)") in organisms, and textile [fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber "Fiber") in clothing. The effects of such features on the path of almost any type of propagating wave or moving particle can be described in the framework of [scattering theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_theory "Scattering theory").

Some areas where scattering and scattering theory are significant include radar sensing, [medical ultrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasound "Medical ultrasound"), [semiconductor wafer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_wafer "Semiconductor wafer") inspection, [polymerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization "Polymerization") process monitoring, acoustic tiling, free-space communications and [computer-generated imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery "Computer-generated imagery").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-8) Particle-particle scattering theory is important in areas such as [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), [atomic, molecular, and optical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics "Atomic, molecular, and optical physics"), [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics") and [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics"). In particle physics the quantum interaction and scattering of fundamental particles is described by the Scattering Matrix or [S-Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Matrix "S-Matrix"), introduced and developed by [John Archibald Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler "John Archibald Wheeler") and [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-9)

Scattering is quantified using many different concepts, including [scattering cross section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(physics) "Cross section (physics)") (σ), [attenuation coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation_coefficient "Attenuation coefficient"), the [bidirectional scattering distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_scattering_distribution_function "Bidirectional scattering distribution function") (BSDF), [S-matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-matrix "S-matrix"), and [mean free path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path "Mean free path").

Single and multiple scattering
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scattering&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Single and multiple scattering")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Zodiacal_Glow_Lightens_Paranal_Sky.jpg/250px-Zodiacal_Glow_Lightens_Paranal_Sky.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zodiacal_Glow_Lightens_Paranal_Sky.jpg)

[Zodiacal light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light "Zodiacal light") is a faint, diffuse glow visible in the [night sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_sky "Night sky"). The phenomenon stems from the [scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_scattering_by_particles "Light scattering by particles") of [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight") by [interplanetary dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_dust_cloud "Interplanetary dust cloud") spread throughout [the plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariable_plane "Invariable plane") of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-10)

When radiation is only scattered by one localized scattering center, this is called _single scattering_. It is more common that scattering centers are grouped together; in such cases, radiation may scatter many times, in what is known as _multiple scattering_.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-11) The main difference between the effects of single and multiple scattering is that single scattering can usually be treated as a random phenomenon, whereas multiple scattering, somewhat counterintuitively, can be modeled as a more deterministic process because the combined results of a large number of scattering events tend to average out. Multiple scattering can thus often be modeled well with [diffusion theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_theory "Diffusion theory").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-12)

Because the location of a single scattering center is not usually well known relative to the path of the radiation, the outcome, which tends to depend strongly on the exact incoming trajectory, appears random to an observer. This type of scattering would be exemplified by an electron being fired at an atomic nucleus. In this case, the atom's exact position relative to the path of the electron is unknown and would be unmeasurable, so the exact trajectory of the electron after the collision cannot be predicted. Single scattering is therefore often described by probability distributions.

With multiple scattering, the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by a large number of scattering events, so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity. This is exemplified by a [light beam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_beam "Light beam") passing through thick [fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog "Fog"). Multiple scattering is highly analogous to [diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion "Diffusion"), and the terms _multiple scattering_ and _diffusion_ are interchangeable in many contexts. Optical elements designed to produce multiple scattering are thus known as _diffusers_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-13)[Coherent backscattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_backscattering "Coherent backscattering"), an enhancement of [backscattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscattering "Backscattering") that occurs when coherent radiation is multiply scattered by a random medium, is usually attributed to [weak localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_localization "Weak localization").

Not all single scattering is random, however. A well-controlled laser beam can be exactly positioned to scatter off a microscopic particle with a deterministic outcome, for instance. Such situations are encountered in [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar") scattering as well, where the targets tend to be macroscopic objects such as people or aircraft.

Similarly, multiple scattering can sometimes have somewhat random outcomes, particularly with coherent radiation. The random fluctuations in the multiply scattered intensity of coherent radiation are called [speckles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_pattern "Speckle pattern"). Speckle also occurs if multiple parts of a coherent wave scatter from different centers. In certain rare circumstances, multiple scattering may only involve a small number of interactions such that the randomness is not completely averaged out. These systems are considered to be some of the most difficult to model accurately.

The description of scattering and the distinction between single and multiple scattering are tightly related to [wave–particle duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality "Wave–particle duality").

Scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the scattering of [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave") and [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle"). Wave scattering corresponds to the collision and scattering of a wave with some material object, for instance (sunlight) scattered by [rain drops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_drop "Rain drop") to form a [rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow "Rainbow"). Scattering also includes the interaction of [billiard balls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiard_balls "Billiard balls") on a table, the [Rutherford scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_scattering "Rutherford scattering") (or angle change) of [alpha particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle "Alpha particle") by [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold")[nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"), the Bragg scattering (or diffraction) of electrons and X-rays by a cluster of atoms, and the [inelastic scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inelastic_scattering "Inelastic scattering") of a fission fragment as it traverses a thin foil. More precisely, scattering consists of the study of how solutions of [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equations "Partial differential equations"), propagating freely "in the distant past", come together and interact with one another or with a [boundary condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_condition "Boundary condition"), and then propagate away "to the distant future".

The **direct scattering problem** is the problem of determining the distribution of scattered radiation/particle flux basing on the characteristics of the scatterer. The [inverse scattering problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_scattering_problem "Inverse scattering problem") is the problem of determining the characteristics of an object (e.g., its shape, internal constitution) from measurement data of radiation or particles scattered from the object.

### Attenuation due to scattering

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scattering&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Attenuation due to scattering")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Xsection2.png/330px-Xsection2.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xsection2.png)

Equivalent quantities used in the theory of scattering from composite specimens, but with a variety of units

When the target is a set of many scattering centers whose relative position varies unpredictably, it is customary to think of a range equation whose arguments take different forms in different application areas. In the simplest case consider an interaction that removes particles from the "unscattered beam" at a uniform rate that is proportional to the incident number of particles per unit area per unit time (![Image 4: {\displaystyle I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f)), i.e. that

![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\frac {dI}{dx}}=-QI\,\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02f635379cb0102cb002e4fd8d01ef2286977896)

where _Q_ is an interaction coefficient and _x_ is the distance traveled in the target.

The above ordinary first-order [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") has solutions of the form:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle I=I_{o}e^{-Q\Delta x}=I_{o}e^{-{\frac {\Delta x}{\lambda }}}=I_{o}e^{-\sigma (\eta \Delta x)}=I_{o}e^{-{\frac {\rho \Delta x}{\tau }}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/24a67318bcb33c434092304b2e08b4c214ad2f33)

where _I_ o is the initial flux, path length Δx≡_x_−_x_ o, the second equality defines an interaction [mean free path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path "Mean free path") λ, the third uses the number of targets per unit volume η to define an area [cross-section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(physics) "Cross section (physics)") σ, and the last uses the target mass density ρ to define a density mean free path τ. Hence one converts between these quantities via _Q_ =1/_λ_ =_ησ_ =_ρ/τ_, as shown in the figure at left.

In electromagnetic absorption spectroscopy, for example, interaction coefficient (e.g. Q in cm−1) is variously called [opacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics) "Opacity (optics)"), [absorption coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_coefficient "Absorption coefficient"), and [attenuation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation_coefficient "Attenuation coefficient"). In nuclear physics, area cross-sections (e.g. σ in [barns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_(unit) "Barn (unit)") or units of 10−24 cm 2), density mean free path (e.g. τ in grams/cm 2), and its reciprocal the [mass attenuation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_attenuation_coefficient "Mass attenuation coefficient") (e.g. in cm 2/gram) or _area per nucleon_ are all popular, while in electron microscopy the [inelastic mean free path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inelastic_mean_free_path "Inelastic mean free path")[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-14) (e.g. λ in nanometers) is often discussed[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-15) instead.

### Elastic and inelastic scattering

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scattering&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Elastic and inelastic scattering")]

The term "elastic scattering" implies that the internal states of the scattering particles do not change, and hence they emerge unchanged from the scattering process. In inelastic scattering, by contrast, the particles' internal state is changed, which may amount to exciting some of the electrons of a scattering atom, or the complete annihilation of a scattering particle and the creation of entirely new particles.

The example of scattering in [quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry "Quantum chemistry") is particularly instructive, as the theory is reasonably complex while still having a good foundation on which to build an intuitive understanding. When two atoms are scattered off one another, one can understand them as being the [bound state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state "Bound state") solutions of some differential equation. Thus, for example, the [hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom "Hydrogen atom") corresponds to a solution to the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation") with a negative inverse-power (i.e., attractive Coulombic) [central potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_potential "Central potential"). The scattering of two hydrogen atoms will disturb the state of each atom, resulting in one or both becoming excited, or even [ionized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization "Ionization"), representing an inelastic scattering process.

The term "[deep inelastic scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_inelastic_scattering "Deep inelastic scattering")" refers to a special kind of scattering experiment in particle physics.

### Mathematical framework

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scattering&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Mathematical framework")]

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), scattering theory deals with a more abstract formulation of the same set of concepts. For example, if a [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") is known to have some simple, localized solutions, and the solutions are a function of a single parameter, that parameter can take the conceptual role of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"). One then asks what might happen if two such solutions are set up far away from each other, in the "distant past", and are made to move towards each other, interact (under the constraint of the differential equation) and then move apart in the "future". The scattering matrix then pairs solutions in the "distant past" to those in the "distant future".

Solutions to differential equations are often posed on [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"). Frequently, the means to the solution requires the study of the [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(functional_analysis) "Spectrum (functional analysis)") of an [operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_theory "Operator theory") on the manifold. As a result, the solutions often have a spectrum that can be identified with a [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space"), and scattering is described by a certain map, the [S matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_matrix "S matrix"), on Hilbert spaces. Solutions with a [discrete spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_spectrum_(physics) "Discrete spectrum (physics)") correspond to [bound states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state "Bound state") in quantum mechanics, while a [continuous spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_spectrum "Continuous spectrum") is associated with scattering states. The study of inelastic scattering then asks how discrete and continuous spectra are mixed together.

An important, notable development is the [inverse scattering transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_scattering_transform "Inverse scattering transform"), central to the solution of many [exactly solvable models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exactly_solvable_model "Exactly solvable model").

Theoretical physics
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scattering&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Theoretical physics")]

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Scattering_theory_illust.png/250px-Scattering_theory_illust.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scattering_theory_illust.png)

Top: the [real part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_part "Real part") of a [plane wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_wave "Plane wave") travelling upwards. Bottom: The real part of the field after inserting in the path of the plane wave a small transparent disk of [index of refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_refraction "Index of refraction") higher than the index of the surrounding medium. This object scatters part of the wave field, although at any individual point, the wave's frequency and wavelength remain intact.

In [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics"), **scattering theory** is a framework for studying and understanding the interaction or scattering of solutions to [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"). In [acoustics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics "Acoustics"), the differential equation is the [wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation "Wave equation"), and scattering studies how its solutions, the [sound waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_wave "Sound wave"), scatter from solid objects or propagate through non-uniform media (such as sound waves, in [sea water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_water "Sea water"), coming from a [submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine "Submarine")). In the case of classical [electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamics "Electrodynamics"), the differential equation is again the wave equation, and the scattering of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") or [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave") is studied. In [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), the equations are those of [Quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics"), [Quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics") and the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model"), the solutions of which correspond to [fundamental particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_particle "Fundamental particle").

In regular [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), which includes [quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry "Quantum chemistry"), the relevant equation is the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation"), although equivalent formulations, such as the [Lippmann-Schwinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lippmann-Schwinger_equation "Lippmann-Schwinger equation") and the [Faddeev equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faddeev_equation "Faddeev equation"), are also largely used. The solutions of interest describe the long-term motion of free atoms, molecules, photons, electrons, and protons. The scenario is that several particles come together from an infinite distance away. These reagents then collide, optionally reacting, getting destroyed or creating new particles. The products and unused reagents then fly away to infinity again. (The atoms and molecules are effectively particles for our purposes. Also, under everyday circumstances, only photons are being created and destroyed.) The solutions reveal which directions the products are most likely to fly off to and how quickly. They also reveal the probability of various reactions, creations, and decays occurring. There are two predominant techniques of finding solutions to scattering problems: [partial wave analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_wave_analysis "Partial wave analysis"), and the [Born approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_approximation "Born approximation").

A [Feynman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram "Feynman diagram") of scattering between two electrons by emission of a virtual [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon")

[Electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") are one of the best known and most commonly encountered forms of radiation that undergo scattering.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-16) Scattering of light and radio waves (especially in radar) is particularly important. Several different aspects of electromagnetic scattering are distinct enough to have conventional names. Major forms of elastic light scattering (involving negligible energy transfer) are [Rayleigh scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering "Rayleigh scattering") and [Mie scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_theory "Mie theory"). Inelastic scattering includes [Brillouin scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brillouin_scattering "Brillouin scattering"), [Raman scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_scattering "Raman scattering"), inelastic [X-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray") scattering and [Compton scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering "Compton scattering").

Light scattering is one of the two major physical processes that contribute to the visible appearance of most objects, the other being absorption. Surfaces described as _white_ owe their appearance to multiple scattering of light by internal or surface inhomogeneities in the object, for example by the boundaries of transparent microscopic crystals that make up a stone or by the microscopic fibers in a sheet of paper. More generally, the [gloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloss_(material_appearance) "Gloss (material appearance)") (or [lustre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(mineralogy) "Lustre (mineralogy)") or [sheen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloss_(paint) "Gloss (paint)")) of the surface is determined by scattering. Highly scattering surfaces are described as being dull or having a matte finish, while the absence of surface scattering leads to a glossy appearance, as with polished metal or stone.

Spectral absorption, the selective absorption of certain colors, determines the color of most objects with some modification by [elastic scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_scattering "Elastic scattering"). The apparent blue color of [veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veins "Veins") in skin is a common example where both spectral absorption and scattering play important and complex roles in the coloration. Light scattering can also create color without absorption, often shades of blue, as with the sky (Rayleigh scattering), the human blue [iris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy) "Iris (anatomy)"), and the feathers of some birds (Prum et al. 1998). However, resonant light scattering in [nanoparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticles "Nanoparticles") can produce many different highly saturated and vibrant hues, especially when [surface plasmon resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_plasmon_resonance "Surface plasmon resonance") is involved (Roqué et al. 2006).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-18)

Models of light scattering can be divided into three domains based on a dimensionless size parameter, _α_ which is defined as: ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \alpha =\pi D_{\text{p}}/\lambda ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b71643594b110b96f5186ddce3f89bad5bed8e4f) where _πD_ p is the circumference of a particle and _λ_ is the wavelength of incident radiation in the medium. Based on the value of _α_, these domains are:

*   _α_ ≪ 1: [Rayleigh scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering "Rayleigh scattering") (small particle compared to wavelength of light);
*   _α_ ≈ 1: [Mie scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering "Mie scattering") (particle about the same size as wavelength of light, valid only for spheres);
*   _α_ ≫ 1: geometric scattering (particle much larger than wavelength of light).

Rayleigh scattering is a process in which electromagnetic radiation (including light) is scattered by a small spherical volume of variant refractive indexes, such as a particle, bubble, droplet, or even a density fluctuation. This effect was first modeled successfully by [Lord Rayleigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Rayleigh "Lord Rayleigh"), from whom it gets its name. In order for Rayleigh's model to apply, the sphere must be much smaller in diameter than the [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength") (_λ_) of the scattered wave; typically the upper limit is taken to be about 1/10 the wavelength. In this size regime, the exact shape of the scattering center is usually not very significant and can often be treated as a sphere of equivalent volume. The inherent scattering that radiation undergoes passing through a pure gas is due to microscopic density fluctuations as the gas molecules move around, which are normally small enough in scale for Rayleigh's model to apply. This scattering mechanism is the primary cause of the blue color of the Earth's sky on a clear day, as the shorter blue wavelengths of sunlight passing overhead are more strongly scattered than the longer red wavelengths according to Rayleigh's famous 1/_λ_ 4 relation. Along with absorption, such scattering is a major cause of the attenuation of radiation by the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-19) The degree of scattering varies as a function of the ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of the radiation, along with many other factors including [polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves) "Polarization (waves)"), angle, and [coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics) "Coherence (physics)").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-20)

For larger diameters, the problem of electromagnetic scattering by spheres was first solved by [Gustav Mie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Mie "Gustav Mie"), and scattering by spheres larger than the Rayleigh range is therefore usually known as Mie scattering. In the Mie regime, the shape of the scattering center becomes much more significant and the theory only applies well to spheres and, with some modification, [spheroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroids "Spheroids") and [ellipsoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoids "Ellipsoids"). Closed-form solutions for scattering by certain other simple shapes exist, but no general closed-form solution is known for arbitrary shapes.

Both Mie and Rayleigh scattering are considered elastic scattering processes, in which the energy (and thus wavelength and frequency) of the light is not substantially changed. However, electromagnetic radiation scattered by moving scattering centers does undergo a [Doppler shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_shift "Doppler shift"), which can be detected and used to measure the velocity of the scattering center/s in forms of techniques such as [lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar "Lidar") and [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar"). This shift involves a slight change in energy.

At values of the ratio of particle diameter to wavelength more than about 10, the laws of [geometric optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_optics "Geometric optics") are mostly sufficient to describe the interaction of light with the particle. Mie theory can still be used for these larger spheres, but the solution often becomes numerically unwieldy.

For modeling of scattering in cases where the Rayleigh and Mie models do not apply such as larger, irregularly shaped particles, there are many numerical methods that can be used. The most common are [finite-element methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method "Finite element method") which solve [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") to find the distribution of the scattered electromagnetic field. Sophisticated software packages exist which allow the user to specify the refractive index or indices of the scattering feature in space, creating a 2- or sometimes 3-dimensional model of the structure. For relatively large and complex structures, these models usually require substantial execution times on a computer.

[Electrophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis "Electrophoresis") involves the migration of [macromolecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecule "Macromolecule") under the influence of an electric field.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-ElectrophoresisWyatt-21)[Electrophoretic light scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoretic_light_scattering "Electrophoretic light scattering") involves passing an electric field through a liquid which makes particles move. The bigger the charge is on the particles, the faster they are able to move.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering#cite_note-ElectrophoreticMalvPan-22)
