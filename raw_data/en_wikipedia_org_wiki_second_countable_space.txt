More explicitly, a topological space T {\displaystyle T} is second-countable if there exists some countable collection U = { U i } i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}=\{U_{i}\}_{i=1}^{\infty }} of open subsets of T {\displaystyle T} such that any open subset of T {\displaystyle T} can be written as a union of elements of some subfamily of U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}} . A second-countable space is said to satisfy the second axiom of countability . Like other countability axioms , the property of being second-countable restricts the number of open subsets that a space can have.

Many " well-behaved " spaces in mathematics are second-countable. For example, Euclidean space ( R n ) with its usual topology is second-countable. Although the usual base of open balls is uncountable , one can restrict this to the collection of all open balls with rational radii and whose centers have rational coordinates. This restricted collection is countable and still forms a basis.

Properties [ edit ] Second-countability is a stronger notion than first-countability . A space is first-countable if each point has a countable local base . Given a base for a topology and a point x , the set of all basis sets containing x forms a local base at x . Thus, if one has a countable base for a topology then one has a countable local base at every point, and hence every second-countable space is also a first-countable space. However any uncountable discrete space is first-countable but not second-countable.

Second-countability implies certain other topological properties. Specifically, every second-countable space is separable (has a countable dense subset) and Lindelöf (every open cover has a countable subcover). The reverse implications do not hold. For example, the lower limit topology on the real line is first-countable, separable, and Lindelöf, but not second-countable. For metric spaces , however, the properties of being second-countable, separable, and Lindelöf are all equivalent.

[ 1 ] Therefore, the lower limit topology on the real line is not metrizable.

In second-countable spaces—as in metric spaces— compactness , sequential compactness, and countable compactness are all equivalent properties.

Urysohn's metrization theorem states that every second-countable, Hausdorff regular space is metrizable . It follows that every such space is completely normal as well as paracompact . Second-countability is therefore a rather restrictive property on a topological space, requiring only a separation axiom to imply metrizability.

Other properties [ edit ] A continuous, open image of a second-countable space is second-countable.

Every subspace of a second-countable space is second-countable.

Quotients of second-countable spaces need not be second-countable; however, open quotients always are.

Any countable product of a second-countable space is second-countable, although uncountable products need not be.

The topology of a second-countable T 1 space has cardinality less than or equal to c (the cardinality of the continuum ).

Any base for a second-countable space has a countable subfamily which is still a base.

Every collection of disjoint open sets in a second-countable space is countable.

Examples [ edit ] Consider the disjoint countable union X = [ 0 , 1 ] ∪ ∪ [ 2 , 3 ] ∪ ∪ [ 4 , 5 ] ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ ∪ ∪ [ 2 k , 2 k + 1 ] ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle X=[0,1]\cup [2,3]\cup [4,5]\cup \dots \cup [2k,2k+1]\cup \dotsb } . Define an equivalence relation and a quotient topology by identifying the left ends of the intervals - that is, identify 0 ~ 2 ~ 4 ~ … ~ 2k and so on.

X is second-countable, as a countable union of second-countable spaces. However, X /~ is not first-countable at the coset of the identified points and hence also not second-countable.

The above space is not homeomorphic to the same set of equivalence classes endowed with the obvious metric: i.e. regular Euclidean distance for two points in the same interval, and the sum of the distances to the left hand point for points not in the same interval -- yielding a strictly coarser topology than the above space.  It is a separable metric space (consider the set of rational points), and hence is second-countable.

The long line is not second-countable, but is first-countable.
