[ 1 ] This bond is a covalent , single bond , meaning that carbon shares its outer valence electrons with up to four hydrogens.  This completes both of their outer shells , making them stable.

[ 2 ] Carbon–hydrogen bonds have a bond length of about 1.09 Å (1.09 × 10 −10 m) and a bond energy of about 413 kJ / mol (see table below).  Using Pauling's scale —C (2.55) and H (2.2)—the electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.35. Because of this small difference in electronegativities, the C−H bond is generally regarded as being non-polar . In structural formulas of molecules, the hydrogen atoms are often omitted. Compound classes consisting solely of C−H bonds and C−C bonds are alkanes , alkenes , alkynes , and aromatic hydrocarbons . Collectively they are known as hydrocarbons .

In October 2016, astronomers reported that the very basic chemical ingredients of life —the carbon–hydrogen molecule (CH, or methylidyne radical ), the carbon–hydrogen positive ion ( CH + ) and the carbon ion ( C + )—are created, in large part, using energy from the ultraviolet light of nearby stars , rather than in other ways, such as turbulent events related to supernovae and young stars , as thought earlier.

[ 3 ] Bond length [ edit ] The length of the carbonhydrogen bond varies slightly with the hybridisation of the carbon atom. A bond between a hydrogen atom and an sp 2 hybridised carbon atom is about 0.6% shorter than between hydrogen and sp 3 hybridised carbon. A bond between hydrogen and sp hybridised carbon is shorter still, about 3% shorter than sp 3 C–H. This trend is illustrated by the molecular geometry of ethane, ethylene and acetylene.

In several compound classes, collectively called carbon acids , the C−H bond can be sufficiently acidic for proton removal. Unactivated C−H bonds are found in alkanes and are not adjacent to a heteroatom (O, N, Si, etc.). Such bonds usually only participate in radical substitution .  Many enzymes are known, however, to effect these reactions.

[ 5 ] Although the C−H bond is one of the strongest, it varies over 30% in magnitude for fairly stable organic compounds, even in the absence of heteroatoms .
