In mathematics , particularly abstract algebra , an algebraic closure of a field K is an algebraic extension of K that is algebraically closed .  It is one of many closures in mathematics.

Using Zorn's lemma [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] or the weaker ultrafilter lemma , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] it can be shown that every field has an algebraic closure , and that the algebraic closure of a field K is unique up to an isomorphism that fixes every member of K . Because of this essential uniqueness, we often speak of the algebraic closure of K , rather than an algebraic closure of K .

The algebraic closure of a field K can be thought of as the largest algebraic extension of K .
To see this, note that if L is any algebraic extension of K , then the algebraic closure of L is also an algebraic closure of K , and so L is contained within the algebraic closure of K .
The algebraic closure of K is also the smallest algebraically closed field containing K ,
because if M is any algebraically closed field containing K , then the elements of M that are algebraic over K form an algebraic closure of K .

The algebraic closure of a field K has the same cardinality as K if K is infinite, and is countably infinite if K is finite.

[ 3 ] Examples [ edit ] The fundamental theorem of algebra states that the algebraic closure of the field of real numbers is the field of complex numbers .

The algebraic closure of the field of rational numbers is the field of algebraic numbers .

There are many countable algebraically closed fields within the complex numbers, and strictly containing the field of algebraic numbers; these are the algebraic closures of transcendental extensions of the rational numbers, e.g. the algebraic closure of Q (π).

For a finite field of prime power order q , the algebraic closure is a countably infinite field that contains a copy of the field of order q n for each positive integer n (and is in fact the union of these copies).

[ 6 ] Existence of an algebraic closure and splitting fields [ edit ] Let S = { f λ λ | λ λ ∈ ∈ Λ Λ } {\displaystyle S=\{f_{\lambda }|\lambda \in \Lambda \}} be the set of all monic irreducible polynomials in K [ x ].
For each f λ λ ∈ ∈ S {\displaystyle f_{\lambda }\in S} , introduce new variables u λ λ , 1 , … … , u λ λ , d {\displaystyle u_{\lambda ,1},\ldots ,u_{\lambda ,d}} where d = d e g r e e ( f λ λ ) {\displaystyle d={\rm {degree}}(f_{\lambda })} .
Let R be the polynomial ring over K generated by u λ λ , i {\displaystyle u_{\lambda ,i}} for all λ λ ∈ ∈ Λ Λ {\displaystyle \lambda \in \Lambda } and all i ≤ ≤ d e g r e e ( f λ λ ) .

{\displaystyle i\leq {\rm {degree}}(f_{\lambda }).} Write f λ λ − − ∏ ∏ i = 1 d ( x − − u λ λ , i ) = ∑ ∑ j = 0 d − − 1 r λ λ , j ⋅ ⋅ x j ∈ ∈ R [ x ] {\displaystyle f_{\lambda }-\prod _{i=1}^{d}(x-u_{\lambda ,i})=\sum _{j=0}^{d-1}r_{\lambda ,j}\cdot x^{j}\in R[x]} with r λ λ , j ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle r_{\lambda ,j}\in R} .
Let I be the ideal in R generated by the r λ λ , j {\displaystyle r_{\lambda ,j}} . Since I is strictly smaller than R ,
Zorn's lemma implies that there exists a maximal ideal M in R that contains I .
The field K 1 = R / M has the property that every polynomial f λ λ {\displaystyle f_{\lambda }} with coefficients in K splits as the product of x − − ( u λ λ , i + M ) , {\displaystyle x-(u_{\lambda ,i}+M),} and hence has all roots in K 1 . In the same way, an extension K 2 of K 1 can be constructed, etc. The union of all these extensions is the algebraic closure of K , because any polynomial with coefficients in this new field has its coefficients in some K n with sufficiently large n , and then its roots are in K n +1 , and hence in the union itself.

It can be shown along the same lines that for any subset S of K [ x ], there exists a splitting field of S over K .

Separable closure [ edit ] An algebraic closure K alg of K contains a unique separable extension K sep of K containing all (algebraic) separable extensions of K within K alg .  This subextension is called a separable closure of K . Since a separable extension of a separable extension is again separable, there are no finite separable extensions of K sep , of degree > 1. Saying this another way, K is contained in a separably-closed algebraic extension field. It is  unique ( up to isomorphism).

[ 7 ] The separable closure is the full algebraic closure if and only if K is a perfect field . For example, if K is a field of characteristic p and if X is transcendental over K , K ( X ) ( X p ) ⊃ ⊃ K ( X ) {\displaystyle K(X)({\sqrt[{p}]{X}})\supset K(X)} is a non-separable algebraic field extension.

In general, the absolute Galois group of K is the Galois group of K sep over K .
