Established in 1881, [ 2 ] the district serves most of the City of Austin, the neighboring municipalities of Sunset Valley and San Leanna , and unincorporated areas in Travis County (including Manchaca ). The district operates 116 schools including 78 elementary schools, 19 middle schools, and 17 high schools.

[ 9 ] As of 2013 [update] , AISD covers 54.1% of the City of Austin by area and serves 73.5% of its residents.

[ 10 ] Academic achievement [ edit ] In 2018-19, the school district was rated a B by the Texas Education Agency (TEA.) [ 11 ] No state accountability ratings were given to districts for the 2019–20 and 2020-21 school years. Prior to the 2011-12 school year, school districts in Texas could receive one of four possible rankings from the Texas Education Agency: Exemplary (the highest possible ranking), Recognized, Academically Acceptable, and Academically Unacceptable (the lowest possible ranking). For the 2012-13 school year, the TEA moved to a Pass/Fail system. In 2017, the TEA adopted an A-F accountability system.

[ 13 ] The district also funds some facilities construction and improvements through the issuance of debt by bond elections; AISD's most recent bond elections have been held in 2013, 2017, and 2022.

[ 14 ] Board of Trustees [ edit ] Members are elected in nonpartisan elections and serve four year terms. Positions 1-7 are elected in single-member districts, while positions 8 and 9 are elected at-large .

( June 2016 ) In the 1970s white flight to Westlake and other suburbs of Austin that were majority white began. In 1970 the student body of AISD was 65% non-Hispanic (Anglo) white.

[ 16 ] In the late 1970s the student body was 57% non-Hispanic white, 26% Hispanic and Latino, and 15% African-American.

[ 17 ] Until 1978 AISD categorized Hispanics and Latinos as "white" so they could integrate them with African-Americans while leaving non-Hispanic whites out of integration. That year it was forced to integrate Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites.

[ 18 ] In 2000 the student body of AISD was 37% non-Hispanic white.

[ 16 ] The Hispanic student population peaked in 2011, at 52,398 students.

[ 19 ] As of the 2016-17 school year, there are 48,386 Hispanic students, 22,761 non-Hispanic white students, and 6,578 African-American students.

[ 19 ] On November 18, 2019 the AISD board of Trustees voted 6-3 in favor of a plan closing four elementary schools. This vote was criticized by many, including AISD Chief Equity Officer, Dr. Hawley who stated that the "map that you have of the closures is a map of what 21st century racism looks like. ... Our process for selecting schools was flawed. It was inequitable." The six Trustees who voted to close the schools were Cindy Anderson, Amber Elenz, Geronimo Rodriguez, Jayme Mathias, Yasmin Wagner and Kristen Ashy.

[ 61 ] For a period prior to 1989, the Austin ISD headquarters were on Guadalupe Street, adjacent to the Texas Department of Public Safety headquarters. In 1989, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill allowing DPS to acquire the former Austin ISD headquarters.

[ 62 ] That building was known as the Irby B. Carruth Administration Building.

[ 63 ] From circa 1994 to 2019, the headquarters were at the Carruth Administration Center, on 1111 West Sixth Street. That building was sold, along with another AISD facility, in 2017.

[ 61 ] The Schlosser Development Corporation purchased the West Sixth facility.

[ 64 ] The district used the money from those sales to buy the current headquarters. From around July to September 2019 the headquarters moved to the current location. The employees who went to the current headquarters came from those two sold properties and one other property.
