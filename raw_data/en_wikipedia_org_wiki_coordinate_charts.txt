In mathematics , particularly topology , an atlas is a concept used to describe a manifold . An atlas consists of individual charts that, roughly speaking, describe individual regions of the manifold. In general, the notion of atlas underlies the formal definition of a manifold and related structures such as vector bundles and other fiber bundles .

Charts [ edit ] "Coordinate patch" redirects here; not to be confused with Surface patch .

"Local coordinate system" redirects here; not to be confused with Local geodetic coordinate system .

See also: Topological manifold § Coordinate charts The definition of an atlas depends on the notion of a chart . A chart for a topological space M is a homeomorphism φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } from an open subset U of M to an open subset of a Euclidean space . The chart is traditionally recorded as the ordered pair ( U , φ φ ) {\displaystyle (U,\varphi )} .

[ 1 ] When a coordinate system is chosen in the Euclidean space, this defines coordinates on U {\displaystyle U} : the coordinates of a point P {\displaystyle P} of U {\displaystyle U} are defined as the coordinates of φ φ ( P ) .

{\displaystyle \varphi (P).} The pair formed by a chart and such a coordinate system is called a local coordinate system , coordinate chart , coordinate patch , coordinate map , or local frame .

Formal definition of atlas [ edit ] An atlas for a topological space M {\displaystyle M} is an indexed family { ( U α α , φ φ α α ) : α α ∈ ∈ I } {\displaystyle \{(U_{\alpha },\varphi _{\alpha }):\alpha \in I\}} of charts on M {\displaystyle M} which covers M {\displaystyle M} (that is, ⋃ ⋃ α α ∈ ∈ I U α α = M {\textstyle \bigcup _{\alpha \in I}U_{\alpha }=M} ). If for some fixed n , the image of each chart is an open subset of n -dimensional Euclidean space , then M {\displaystyle M} is said to be an n -dimensional manifold .

The plural of atlas is atlases , although some authors use atlantes .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] An atlas ( U i , φ φ i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left(U_{i},\varphi _{i}\right)_{i\in I}} on an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold M {\displaystyle M} is called an adequate atlas if the following conditions hold: [ clarification needed ] The image of each chart is either R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} or R + n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{+}^{n}} , where R + n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{+}^{n}} is the closed half-space , [ clarification needed ] ( U i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left(U_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} is a locally finite open cover of M {\displaystyle M} , and M = ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I φ φ i − − 1 ( B 1 ) {\textstyle M=\bigcup _{i\in I}\varphi _{i}^{-1}\left(B_{1}\right)} , where B 1 {\displaystyle B_{1}} is the open ball of radius 1 centered at the origin.

Every second-countable manifold admits an adequate atlas.

[ 4 ] Moreover, if V = ( V j ) j ∈ ∈ J {\displaystyle {\mathcal {V}}=\left(V_{j}\right)_{j\in J}} is an open covering of the second-countable manifold M {\displaystyle M} , then there is an adequate atlas ( U i , φ φ i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left(U_{i},\varphi _{i}\right)_{i\in I}} on M {\displaystyle M} , such that ( U i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left(U_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} is a refinement of V {\displaystyle {\mathcal {V}}} .

[ 4 ] Transition maps [ edit ] M {\displaystyle M} U α α {\displaystyle U_{\alpha }} U β β {\displaystyle U_{\beta }} φ φ α α {\displaystyle \varphi _{\alpha }} φ φ β β {\displaystyle \varphi _{\beta }} τ τ α α , β β {\displaystyle \tau _{\alpha ,\beta }} τ τ β β , α α {\displaystyle \tau _{\beta ,\alpha }} R n {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}} R n {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}} Two charts on a manifold, and their respective transition map A transition map provides a way of comparing two charts of an atlas. To make this comparison, we consider the composition of one chart with the inverse of the other. This composition is not well-defined unless we restrict both charts to the intersection of their domains of definition. (For example, if we have a chart of Europe and a chart of Russia, then we can compare these two charts on their overlap, namely the European part of Russia.) To be more precise, suppose that ( U α α , φ φ α α ) {\displaystyle (U_{\alpha },\varphi _{\alpha })} and ( U β β , φ φ β β ) {\displaystyle (U_{\beta },\varphi _{\beta })} are two charts for a manifold M such that U α α ∩ ∩ U β β {\displaystyle U_{\alpha }\cap U_{\beta }} is non-empty .
The transition map τ τ α α , β β : φ φ α α ( U α α ∩ ∩ U β β ) → → φ φ β β ( U α α ∩ ∩ U β β ) {\displaystyle \tau _{\alpha ,\beta }:\varphi _{\alpha }(U_{\alpha }\cap U_{\beta })\to \varphi _{\beta }(U_{\alpha }\cap U_{\beta })} is the map defined by τ τ α α , β β = φ φ β β ∘ ∘ φ φ α α − − 1 .

{\displaystyle \tau _{\alpha ,\beta }=\varphi _{\beta }\circ \varphi _{\alpha }^{-1}.} Note that since φ φ α α {\displaystyle \varphi _{\alpha }} and φ φ β β {\displaystyle \varphi _{\beta }} are both homeomorphisms, the transition map τ τ α α , β β {\displaystyle \tau _{\alpha ,\beta }} is also a homeomorphism.

More structure [ edit ] One often desires more structure on a manifold than simply the topological structure. For example, if one would like an unambiguous notion of differentiation of functions on a manifold, then it is necessary to construct an atlas whose transition functions are differentiable . Such a manifold is called differentiable . Given a differentiable manifold, one can unambiguously define the notion of tangent vectors and then directional derivatives .

If each transition function is a smooth map , then the atlas is called a smooth atlas , and the manifold itself is called smooth . Alternatively, one could require that the transition maps have only k continuous derivatives in which case the atlas is said to be C k {\displaystyle C^{k}} .

Very generally, if each transition function belongs to a pseudogroup G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} of homeomorphisms of Euclidean space, then the atlas is called a G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -atlas.  If the transition maps between charts of an atlas preserve a local trivialization , then the atlas defines the structure of a fibre bundle.
