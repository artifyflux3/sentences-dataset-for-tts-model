Water appearing to run uphill at Magnetic Hill in New Brunswick Magnetic Hill in Moncton , New Brunswick A gravity hill , also known as a magnetic hill , mystery hill , mystery spot , gravity road , or anti-gravity hill , is a place where the layout of the surrounding land produces an illusion , making a slight downhill slope appear to be an uphill slope. Thus, a car left out of gear will appear to be rolling uphill against gravity .

[ 1 ] Although the slope of gravity hills is an illusion, [ 2 ] sites are often accompanied by claims that magnetic or supernatural forces are at work. The most important factor contributing to the illusion is a completely or mostly obstructed horizon . Without a horizon, it becomes difficult for a person to judge the slope of a surface, as a reliable reference point is missing, and misleading visual cues can adversely affect the sense of balance . Objects which one would normally assume to be more or less perpendicular to the ground, such as trees, may be leaning, offsetting the visual reference.

[ 3 ] A 2003 study looked into how the absence of a horizon can skew the perspective on gravity hills, by recreating a number of antigravity places in the lab to see how volunteers would react. In conclusion, researchers from the Universities of Padua and Pavia in Italy found that without a true horizon in sight, the human brain could be tricked by common landmarks such as trees and signs.

[ 4 ] The illusion is similar to the Ames room , in which objects can also appear to roll against gravity.

The opposite phenomenon—an uphill road that appears flat—is known in bicycle racing as a " false flat ".
