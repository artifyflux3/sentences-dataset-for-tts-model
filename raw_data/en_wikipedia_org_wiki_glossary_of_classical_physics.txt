The amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by its [gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#gain): the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input. An amplifier is a circuit that has a [power gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_gain "Power gain") greater than one.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#cite_note-Crecraft-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#cite_note-Agarwal-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#cite_note-Glisson-11)[amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude "Amplitude")The height of a [wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#wave) as measured from its center (normal) position.[angle of incidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence_(optics) "Angle of incidence (optics)")In [geometric optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_optics "Geometric optics"), the angle between a [ray incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_ray "Incident ray") on a surface and the line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence, called the [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal "Surface normal").

Common examples include the reflection of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#light), [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#sound), and [water waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_wave "Water wave"). The _law of reflection_ says that for [specular reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection "Specular reflection") the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected. [Mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror "Mirror") exhibit specular reflection.[ångström](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85ngstr%C3%B6m "Ångström") (Å)A unit of length primarily used to measure [subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#subatomic_particle) that is equal to 10−10 metres (one ten-billionth of a metre) or 0.1 nanometres.[angular acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_acceleration "Angular acceleration")The time rate of change of [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#angular_velocity). In three dimensions, it is a [pseudovector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector "Pseudovector"). In [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI") units, it is measured in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radians "Radians") per second squared (rad/s 2), and is usually denoted by the Greek letter [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(letter) "Alpha (letter)") (α).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#cite_note-12) Just like angular velocity, there are two types of angular acceleration: spin angular acceleration and orbital angular acceleration, representing the time rate of change of spin angular velocity and orbital angular velocity, respectively. Unlike linear acceleration, angular acceleration need not be caused by a net external [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#torque). For example, a figure skater can speed up her rotation (thereby obtaining an angular acceleration) simply by contracting her arms inwards, which involves no _external_ torque.[angular displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_displacement "Angular displacement")The angle (in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian"), [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)"), or [revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry) "Turn (geometry)")) through which a point revolving around a centre or line has been rotated in a specified sense about a specified [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation").[angular frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency "Angular frequency") (_ω_)
Also **angular speed**, **radial frequency**, **circular frequency**, **orbital frequency**, **radian frequency**, and **pulsatance**.

A scalar measure of rotation rate. It refers to the [angular displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#angular_displacement) per unit time (e.g. in rotation) or the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform (e.g. in oscillations and waves), or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function. Angular frequency (or angular speed) is the magnitude of the vector quantity that is [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#angular_velocity). The term **angular frequency vector**![Image 2: {\displaystyle {\vec {\omega }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f4e066a68ceb355e3314fb2b97f1c0c421ca6074) is sometimes used as a synonym for the vector quantity angular velocity.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#cite_note-UP1-13) One [revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry) "Turn (geometry)") is equal to 2π [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian"), hence[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#cite_note-UP1-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#cite_note-14)![Image 3: {\displaystyle \omega ={{2\pi } \over T}={2\pi f},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74dbb41e79e1216542ae1d7f4f68dd20f097cdca) where: _ω_ is the angular frequency or angular speed (measured in [radians per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radians_per_second "Radians per second")),_T_ is the [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") (measured in [seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second")),_f_ is the [ordinary frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_frequency "Ordinary frequency") (measured in [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz "Hertz")) (sometimes symbolised with [_ν_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_(letter) "Nu (letter)")).[angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum")
Also (rarely) **moment of momentum** or **rotational momentum**.

The rotational equivalent of [linear momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#linear_momentum). It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [conserved quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law "Conservation law")–that is, the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant.[angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity") (ω)How fast an object rotates or revolves relative to another point, i.e. how fast the angular position or orientation of an object changes with time. There are two types of angular velocity: orbital angular velocity and spin angular velocity. Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with respect to its centre of rotation. Orbital angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body's centre of rotation revolves about a fixed origin, i.e. the time rate of change of its angular position relative to the origin. In general, angular velocity is measured in angle per unit time, e.g. [radians per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radians_per_second "Radians per second"). The [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI") unit of angular velocity is expressed as radians/sec with the radian having a dimensionless value of unity, thus the SI units of angular velocity are listed as _1/sec_. Angular velocity is usually represented by the Greek letter [omega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega "Omega") (ω, sometimes Ω). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.[anion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anion "Anion")A negatively charged [ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#ion). Contrast _[cation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary\_of\_classical\_physics#cation)_.[annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation "Annihilation")In [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#particle_physics), the process that occurs when a [subatomic particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#subatomic_particle) collides with its respective [antiparticle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle "Antiparticle") to produce other particles, such as an [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#electron) colliding with a [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#positron) to produce two [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#photon).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#cite_note-15) The total [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#energy) and [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#momentum) of the initial pair are conserved in the process and distributed among a set of other particles in the final state. Antiparticles have exactly opposite additive [quantum numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_number "Quantum number") from particles, so the sums of all quantum numbers of such an original pair are zero. Hence, any set of particles may be produced whose total quantum numbers are also zero as long as [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy") and [conservation of momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_momentum "Conservation of momentum") are obeyed.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#cite_note-Particleadventure.org-16)[anode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anode "Anode")The electrode through which a conventional [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#current) flows into a [polarized electrical device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarized_electrical_device "Polarized electrical device"); the direction of current flow is, by convention, opposite to the direction of [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#electron) flow, and so electrons flow _out of_ the anode. In a [galvanic cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_cell "Galvanic cell"), the anode is the negative terminal or pole which emits electrons toward the external part of an [electrical circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#electrical_circuit). However, in an [electrolytic cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#electrolytic_cell), the anode is the wire or plate having excess _positive_ charge, so named because negatively charged [anions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#anion) tend to move towards it. Contrast _[cathode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary\_of\_classical\_physics#cathode)_.[anti-gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gravity "Anti-gravity")A theory of creating a place or object that is free from the force of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_physics#gravity).
