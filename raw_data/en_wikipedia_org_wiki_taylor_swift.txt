[ 194 ] Two other singles, " Lavender Haze " and " Karma ", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.

[ 195 ] In 2023, Swift released two re-recorded albums: Speak Now (Taylor's Version) in July and 1989 (Taylor's Version) in October. The former made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand , [ 196 ] and the latter was her sixth album to sell one million US first-week copies.

[ 197 ] The single " Is It Over Now?

" from 1989 (Taylor's Version) peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

[ 198 ] Swift featured on Big Red Machine 's " Renegade " and "Birch" (2021), [ 199 ] Haim 's " Gasoline " (2021), [ 200 ] Ed Sheeran 's " The Joker and the Queen " (2022), [ 201 ] and the National 's " The Alcott " (2023).

[ 202 ] She wrote and recorded " Carolina " for the soundtrack of the 2022 mystery film Where the Crawdads Sing , [ 203 ] and had a supporting role in the 2022 period comedy film Amsterdam .

[ 204 ] In 2022, Swift won Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards [ 205 ] and Video of the Year for All Too Well: The Short Film , her self-directed short film that accompanies "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" at the MTV Video Music Awards; All Too Well also won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video.

[ 206 ] [ 207 ] The following year, she again won the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year with "Anti-Hero", [ 208 ] became the first musician to rank at number one on Billboard 's year-end top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023), [ 209 ] and had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of the year in the US, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.

[ 210 ] At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards in 2025, Midnights made Swift the first artist to win Album of the Year four times; it also won Best Pop Vocal Album.

[ 211 ] 2023–present: The Eras Tour, The Tortured Poets Department , and The Life of a Showgirl Swift on the Eras Tour in 2023 In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour , which she conceived as a tribute to her entire discography. The tour spanned five continents through December 2024.

[ 212 ] It exerted a global cultural, economic, and political impact and culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity for Swift, [ 213 ] [ 214 ] [ 215 ] resulting in a phenomenon that the media dubbed "Swiftmania".

[ 216 ] [ 217 ] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history , with $2 billion in revenue.

[ 218 ] Its concert film grossed $250 million to become the highest-grossing of its kind, [ 219 ] and its photobook sold nearly a million copies in its first week in the US.

[ 220 ] The tour inspired Swift's eleventh and twelfth studio albums, The Tortured Poets Department (2024) and The Life of a Showgirl (2025), respectively.

[ 221 ] [ 222 ] During the run of the Eras Tour, there were controversies surrounding Ticketmaster 's monopoly that led to political scrutiny in the US , [ 223 ] venue mismanagement that led to a death in Brazil , [ 224 ] and Singapore's exclusivity deal that led to political tension in Southeast Asia.

[ 225 ] In July 2024, three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport , England, leading to civil unrest in the UK .

[ 226 ] The following month, the Vienna concerts were canceled following the arrest of suspects who planned a terrorist attack .

[ 227 ] The Tortured Poets Department was released on April 19, 2024.

[ 228 ] It became the first album to accumulate one billion streams on Spotify within one week and topped charts of various countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the UK.

[ 229 ] [ 230 ] In the US, The Tortured Poets Department debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 2.6 million first-week units and stayed at number one for 17 weeks, becoming Swift's longest-running number-one album.

[ 231 ] The album was the global best-seller of 2024, with 5.6 million pure copies sold.

[ 232 ] Its songs, led by the single " Fortnight ", made her the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 the same week; [ 229 ] the second single, " I Can Do It with a Broken Heart ", peaked at number three.

[ 233 ] Swift began dating the football player Travis Kelce in 2023; their high-profile relationship resulted in their status as a supercouple .

[ 234 ] [ 235 ] In January 2024, AI-generated pornographic images portraying Swift in a football context were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.

[ 236 ] On May 30, 2025, Swift finalized the purchase of the masters to her first six original studio albums from Shamrock Holdings , which had acquired them from Braun in 2020.

[ 237 ] Three months later, Swift announced The Life of a Showgirl , set for release on October 3, 2025.

[ 222 ] Artistry Musical styles With continuous musical reinventions, Swift was described as a musical "chameleon" by publications such as Time and the BBC .

[ 238 ] [ 239 ] [ 240 ] Her discography spans styles of pop, [ 241 ] [ 242 ] country, [ 243 ] [ 244 ] folk , [ 245 ] [ 246 ] and rock, [ 247 ] [ 248 ] with elements of R&B, hip-hop, and indie pop .

[ 249 ] [ 250 ] She self-identified as a country musician with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red .

[ 251 ] [ 252 ] Her influences were female country artists of the 1990s such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes , the Dixie Chicks, [ 253 ] and Keith Urban's country crossover sound with elements rock, pop, and blues .

[ 254 ] The albums feature a country pop sound defined by instruments such as six-string banjo , mandolin , fiddle , a slight twang in Swift's vocals, and pop-rock melodies; [ 255 ] [ 256 ] Speak Now draws on rock styles of the 1970s and 1980s such as pop rock , pop-punk , and arena rock .

[ 88 ] [ 257 ] Some critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's songwriting rather than musical style [ 258 ] [ 259 ] and accused her of causing mainstream country to stray away from its roots.

[ 260 ] [ 261 ] After the critical debate around Red 's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins , Annie Lennox , Peter Gabriel , and Madonna .

[ 262 ] [ 263 ] 1989 , the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines.

[ 264 ] Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums.

[ 265 ] Reputation consists of hip-hop, R&B, and EDM influences; maximalist arrangements of heavy bass and manipulated vocals; and an emphasis on rhythm.

[ 148 ] [ 149 ] [ 266 ] Lover incorporates eclectic sounds from country, pop-punk, and folk rock .

[ 267 ] Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both have a minimalist synth-pop sound characterized by analog synthesizers , sustained bass notes , and simple drum machine patterns.

[ 268 ] [ 269 ] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded it as an erosion of her country songwriting authenticity, [ 270 ] but others considered it necessary for her artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism .

[ 271 ] [ 272 ] Her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore , described by some critics as "alternative", [ 273 ] [ 274 ] explore indie folk and rock styles. They incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestrations, muted synthesizers, and drum pads.

[ 177 ] [ 275 ] [ 276 ] Evermore experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures , and diverse instruments.

[ 277 ] [ 278 ] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's singer-songwriter status and credited her with popularizing "alternative" music, although there were disagreements on this description.

[ 279 ] Voice "Our Song" (2006) Swift sings with a Southern accent and a light country twang in " Our Song ".

[ 280 ] [ 281 ] "Cardigan" (2020) Swift uses her lower register in the indie folk ballad " Cardigan ".

[ 282 ] "Lavender Haze" (2022) The R&B -leaning pop track " Lavender Haze " features Swift's falsetto vocals in the refrain .

[ 283 ] Problems playing these files? See media help .

Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range , [ 284 ] but she mostly sings in her alto range.

[ 285 ] [ 286 ] [ 287 ] Reviews of her early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers.

[ 288 ] Defenders of Swift appreciated that she refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized intimacy and emotionality to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience [ 289 ] —a style that critics have described as conversational.

[ 285 ] [ 290 ] According to the critic Ann Powers , this singing style is demonstrated through Swift's attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—"the subtle adjustment of words and phrases to suggest moods like doubt, hope, and intimacy".

[ 285 ] [ 291 ] On Red and 1989 , Swift's vocals are processed with electronic effects such as synthesizer tweaking, looping, and multitracking, to accompany the pop production.

[ 292 ] [ 285 ] Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near- rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody.

[ 249 ] [ 293 ] She uses her lower register vocals extensively in Folklore [ 294 ] and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore ; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as "breathy and bright" and the lower register as "full and dark".

[ 278 ] Reception of Swift's vocals has been more positive since the release of Folklore . The critic Amanda Petrusich commented in 2023 that her singing became richer with stronger clarity and tone, even in live performances.

[ 295 ] Rolling Stone ranked her 102nd on their 2023 list " 200 Greatest Singers of All Time "; the magazine argued that her breathy timbre allows for a broad range of delivery and commented: "A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore , Evermore , and Midnights officially settled the argument." [ 296 ] For Powers, Swift's versatile vocals are a result of her evolving artistry, combining "subtle interpolations of hip-hop's cadences and country crooners' relaxed timbre".

[ 249 ] Songwriting Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood; she credited her mother with igniting early interests by helping her prepare for class presentations, [ 297 ] [ 298 ] and would make up lyrics to Disney soundtrack songs once she had run out of words singing them.

[ 299 ] In her early career, her influences were the country musicians Patsy Cline , Loretta Lynn , Tammy Wynette , and Dolly Parton; [ 18 ] [ 94 ] and the 1990s female singer-songwriters Melissa Etheridge , Sarah McLachlan , and Alanis Morissette .

[ 300 ] In later interviews, she listed Joni Mitchell and Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy as additional influences; [ 301 ] [ 302 ] and Paul McCartney , Bruce Springsteen , Emmylou Harris , and Kris Kristofferson as career role models for their evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.

[ 27 ] [ 303 ] Swift considers herself a songwriter first and foremost.

[ 27 ] [ 304 ] She divides her lyrics into three types: " quill lyrics", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; " fountain pen lyrics", based on modern and vivid storylines; and "glitter gel pen lyrics", which are lively and frivolous.

[ 305 ] Using songwriting to cope with personal experiences, her songs are largely autobiographical and feature narratives that mostly revolve around love and romantic relationships.

[ 28 ] [ 306 ] [ 307 ] She would start writing by identifying an emotion she wanted to convey, and the story and melody would follow.

[ 308 ] Where Taylor Swift and Fearless are rooted in adolescent feelings and detail optimistic romance inspired by fairy tales, Speak Now reflects her young adulthood with newfound wisdom on real-life heartbreak.

[ 309 ] [ 88 ] Red explores the tumult of an intense breakup, and 1989 reflects on failed relationships with a wistful perspective; both albums incorporate lyrics that hint at sex, reflecting her personal growth.

[ 286 ] Swift described Lover as a "love letter to love", inspired by her realization of "love that was very real".

[ 310 ] As her career progressed, Swift wrote about self-perception and confrontation against her critics, influenced by fame, sexism , and scrutiny on her personal life by the press.

[ 311 ] This was first exhibited in Speak Now , which set the precedent for the frantic media speculations on the subjects of Swift's songs, specifically concerning her dating history; [ 312 ] Swift considers this practice sexist.

[ 313 ] Reputation both tackles the public controversies that tarnished her wholesome image and addresses a blossoming romance with intimacy and vulnerability; its extensive references to sex and alcohol set it apart from the youthful innocence that had informed Swift's past albums.

[ 148 ] [ 314 ] [ 315 ] The nocturnal ruminations addressed in Midnights encompass regrets and fantasies, informed by Swift's self-awareness of her fame.

[ 190 ] The Tortured Poets Department was conceived amidst her heightened fame brought by the Eras Tour and intensely publicized love life during 2023.

[ 221 ] It explores heartbreak and other themes to the extremes: erotic desires, forbidden love, and escaping from the public spotlight.

[ 250 ] [ 316 ] On Folklore and Evermore , Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives, deviating from the autobiographical songwriting that had characterized her artistry.

[ 317 ] She imposed her emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, inspired by authors and poets of romantic and modernist literature like F. Scott Fitzgerald , Robert Frost , William Wordsworth , and Emily Dickinson ; [ 318 ] [ 319 ] the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.

[ 320 ] The characters of Folklore and Evermore construct their narratives based on fragments of memory, symbolizing the nature of folktales and oral traditions that pass through time.

[ 321 ] Swift considers her songwriting "confessional", [ 313 ] [ 322 ] and academics have connected her style to that of confessional poetry , in that her songs reference personal events and publicize internal feelings to her audience.

[ 307 ] [ 323 ] Critical reception of her songwriting has been largely positive, [ 27 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] and her melodic compositions have been highlighted for optimizing the verse-chorus form with memorable bridges .

[ 285 ] [ 326 ] [ 327 ] Several scholars have credited her with taking the confessional singer-songwriter tradition to new heights, [ 328 ] [ 329 ] and she has been variedly described by journalists as a " poet laureate "—of puberty, [ 27 ] [ 330 ] of romance, [ 331 ] and of her generation.

[ 332 ] [ 333 ] Some critics have dismissed her "confessional" style as material for tabloid gossip.

[ 334 ] Objection to the perceived poetic value of her songs, mostly from rockist critics, views her as a pop star using literary subtexts as a commercial ploy, with metaphors that are at times imprecise or self-indulgent.

[ 335 ] Scholars have attributed criticisms of Swift's songwriting to sexism. The musicologist Travis Stimeling argued that whereas Swift's autobiographical authenticity conforms to country and rock standards, her detractors, mostly male, view her lyrical depictions of a young woman's experiences as trivial and unworthy of serious merit.

[ 336 ] According to the English-language academic Ryan Hibbett, this gendered criticism bars Swift from receiving full artistic credentials as does Bob Dylan , whose reliance on romantic themes and occasional literary imprecisions are not as harshly criticized.

[ 337 ] In the views of the literary critic Stephanie Burt , although Swift's writing is not poetry in its traditional sense, it is proficient at "placing inventive, evocative language into pop melodies designed to be sung".

[ 338 ] Performances and stage Swift playing a six-string banjo on the Speak Now World Tour (left, pictured in 2011) and a piano on the Reputation Stadium Tour (right, 2018) Swift's concerts are equipped with elaborate settings, incorporating elements from Broadway theatre and high tech .

[ 339 ] [ 340 ] [ 341 ] She does not rely on elaborate choreography and instead emphasizes on connecting emotionally with her audience through storytelling and vocal delivery.

[ 342 ] Since 2007, she has toured with the same live band.

[ 343 ] She plays four instruments live: guitar (including electric , acoustic six-string, and twelve-string ), six-string banjo, piano, and ukulele .

[ 344 ] [ 345 ] [ 346 ] Critics have praised her stage presence, stamina, [ 347 ] [ 348 ] and ability to bring forth an intimate atmosphere for her audience, even in stadium settings.

[ 295 ] [ 349 ] [ 350 ] Sasha Frere-Jones , in a 2008 article for The New Yorker , hailed her as a "preternaturally skilled" entertainer who exerted professionalism with a vibrant energy.

[ 259 ] In Time 's 2023 Person of the Year piece, Sam Lansky wrote: "Swift is many things onstage—vulnerable and triumphant, playful and sad—but the intimacy of her songcraft is front and center." [ 325 ] Videos and filmmaking Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music.

[ 351 ] She established her production company, Taylor Swift Productions , in 2008.

[ 352 ] Her directorial debut was the music video for "Mine", co-directed with Roman White , in 2010; [ 353 ] and she developed the concept and treatment for "Mean" in 2011.

[ 354 ] For the music videos of the 1989 and Reputation singles, she had an extensive collaboration with the director Joseph Kahn on eight videos; [ 355 ] among them, she produced "Bad Blood", which won Best Music Video at the Grammy Awards in 2016.

[ 356 ] She worked with American Express for the "Blank Space" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience , for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.

[ 357 ] As of May 2025, Swift has directed 13 of her music videos .

[ 358 ] Her first solo directorial role was for "The Man", which made her the first female artist to win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction .

[ 359 ] All Too Well: The Short Film marked her filmmaking debut, [ 193 ] and it made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a solo director.

[ 360 ] In June 2023, Swift was invited to the Academy of Motion Pictures .

[ 361 ] She has cited Joseph Kahn, Chloé Zhao , Greta Gerwig , Nora Ephron , Guillermo del Toro , John Cassavetes , and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.

[ 240 ] Her career trajectory from a country singer-songwriter to a pop star in the 2000s and 2010s was the subject of extensive commentary.

[ 251 ] [ 402 ] Deemed "America's Sweetheart" in her early career, she was described in the press as a "media darling" with a girl next door 's polite demeanor and open-hearted conversations.

[ 403 ] [ 404 ] Swift displayed a feminine image but refrained from the "aggressively sexualized feminist pop" of her contemporaries, leading publications to comment that her sex appeal was modest, subtle, and sophisticated.

[ 251 ] [ 405 ] [ 406 ] The adolescent themes of Swift's music contributed to her status as a teen idol , [ 407 ] [ 408 ] although several feminist authors took issue with her songs about romantic relationships as narrow-minded and detrimental to girls and women, who made up the majority of her fanbase known as Swifties .

[ 409 ] Upon recalibrating her artistry to pop music, Swift has identified as a feminist and achieved a pop icon status.

[ 265 ] [ 404 ] The author Jody Rosen in 2013 labelled Swift the "Queen of Pop", citing her popularity that defied traditional boundaries between "genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends".

[ 251 ] Her feminist identity received contrarian views: there were praises that regarded her success in a male-dominated music industry as an inspiration for girls and women, and criticisms that dismissed her feminist adoption as superficial and self-interested.

[ 410 ] The 2016 dispute with Kanye West bolstered the narrative by her detractors that she was a calculating and manipulative woman despite her sweetheart image, and deepened their feud that has resonated in their respective careers.
