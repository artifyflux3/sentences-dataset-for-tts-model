[ 1 ] [ 2 ] This system is specifically designed to detect the optical counterparts from gravitational wave sources detected with Virgo and LIGO . Principal investigator of the array is Paul Groot .

Characteristics [ edit ] Prototype BlackGEM telescope in the dome in Nijmegen , The Netherlands.

[ 3 ] The BlackGEM array will consist of 10-15 telescopes each 65 cm in diameter when completed. This configuration uniquely allows the pointing of the combined telescope to be matched to the often elongated ellipse-shaped source-location estimates provided by gravitational wave detectors. Once an optical counterpart has been detected, all telescopes are pointed at the target giving a light-collecting area and sensitivity equivalent to that of a single 3.5 m diameter telescope, but with a larger two-square-degree field of view .

Each telescope is equipped with a 10,000 by 10,000 pixel CCD with 9 micron pixel size that samples the full focal plane of the telescope. This, combined with the (f/5.5) focal length of the telescope, means that the angular resolution of the instrument is limited only by the seeing (which is about 1 arcsecond at La Silla). Being located at this longitude enables rapid spectroscopic follow-up of any detected gravitational wave source with, for instance, the Very Large Telescope .

Operational phases [ edit ] The array will eventually comprise 15 telescopes, each of 65cm diameter, making BlackGEM a powerful survey instrument. The first phase of operations will therefore perform a complete survey of the southern sky in 6 different filters, to generate the necessary templates for image subtraction . In parallel to this phase, multi- epoch imaging will give a characterization of any fast (shorter than one day) transient sources down to 23rd magnitude . In parallel, the BlackGEM array will act on triggers from the gravitational wave detectors to look for optical emission from such events as merging black holes and neutron stars .

As of 2022, three (of a planned 15) telescopes are in place at ESO's La Silla Observatory. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic , on-site work on the telescopes is currently on pause.

[ 4 ] As of 2024, some discoveries are beginning to be made by BlackGEM.
