A solution in radicals or algebraic solution is an expression of a solution of a polynomial equation that is algebraic , that is, relies only on addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , raising to integer powers , and extraction of n th roots ( square roots , cube roots , etc.).

A well-known example is the quadratic formula x = − − b ± ± b 2 − − 4 a c 2 a , {\displaystyle x={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac\ }}}{2a}},} which expresses the solutions of the quadratic equation a x 2 + b x + c = 0.

{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0.} There exist algebraic solutions for cubic equations [ 1 ] and quartic equations , [ 2 ] which are more complicated than the quadratic formula. The Abel–Ruffini theorem , [ 3 ] : 211 and, more generally Galois theory , state that some quintic equations , such as x 5 − − x + 1 = 0 , {\displaystyle x^{5}-x+1=0,} do not have any algebraic solution. The same is true for every higher degree. However, for any degree there are some polynomial equations that have algebraic solutions; for example, the equation x 10 = 2 {\displaystyle x^{10}=2} can be solved as x = ± ± 2 10 .

{\displaystyle x=\pm {\sqrt[{10}]{2}}.} The eight other solutions are nonreal complex numbers , which are also algebraic and have the form x = ± ± r 2 10 , {\displaystyle x=\pm r{\sqrt[{10}]{2}},} where r is a fifth root of unity , which can be expressed with two nested square roots . See also Quintic function § Other solvable quintics for various other examples in degree 5.

Évariste Galois introduced a criterion allowing one to decide which equations are solvable in radicals. See Radical extension for the precise formulation of his result.
