Two-time space voter [Kathleen Rubins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Rubins "Kathleen Rubins")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-Gerken-2) posing in front of a "[voting booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_booth "Voting booth")" on the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station"), 2020

Many people have **cast votes during spaceflight**. Voting from space has some inherent difficulties, as delivering paper ballots to and from a space station—as one would do for a soldier stationed overseas—would be cost prohibitive. Some astronauts vote electronically, while others communicate their voting intentions to a [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting "Proxy voting").

[John Blaha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Blaha "John Blaha"), an astronaut stationed aboard the _[Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir")_ space station, requested permission to vote in the [1996 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_presidential_election "1996 United States presidential election"). A [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") plan to allow Blaha to vote electronically was stopped when the [Secretary of State of Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_of_Texas "Secretary of State of Texas") pointed out that the state had no provision for any electronic voting.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-3) The following year, Governor [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush") signed a bill originally sponsored by Representative [Mike Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Jackson_(Texas_politician) "Mike Jackson (Texas politician)"), whose district included [Johnson Space Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center "Johnson Space Center"), that allowed astronauts to vote electronically. The first person to vote using this method was [David Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wolf_(astronaut) "David Wolf (astronaut)"), who voted in [Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston "Houston")'s 1997 local elections while on board _Mir_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-4)

Since 2004, astronauts on board the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") (ISS) have voted in all but one presidential election.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-9) In order to vote while on board, astronauts must fill out the Federal Post Card Application prior to departure, the same application used by military members stationed overseas. During the election, Johnson Space Center transmits a secure electronic ballot, and the astronauts are emailed credentials by their local county clerk. The ballot is then filled out, downlinked to Earth, and e-mailed to the relevant county clerk.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-10) The first American to vote for president in space was [Leroy Chiao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroy_Chiao "Leroy Chiao") in 2004 who was onboard the ISS in 2004.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-11) American astronaut [Kathleen Rubins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Rubins "Kathleen Rubins") voted on the ISS on two occasions, in 2016 and 2020.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-Gerken-2)

While most astronauts live in, and are registered to vote in, [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas"), some are registered elsewhere in the country. [Andrew R. Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_R._Morgan "Andrew R. Morgan"), for instance, was registered to vote in [Lawrence County, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_County,_Pennsylvania "Lawrence County, Pennsylvania"); that county's Department of Voter Services collaborated with NASA to allow Morgan to vote in the 2019 local elections.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-12)

In 1971, the crew of the [Soyuz 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_11 "Soyuz 11") ([Georgy Dobrovolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Dobrovolsky "Georgy Dobrovolsky"), [Vladislav Volkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Volkov "Vladislav Volkov"), and [Viktor Patsayev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Patsayev "Viktor Patsayev")) broadcast their votes from the [Salyut 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_1 "Salyut 1") space station in the election for the [24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_Congress_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"). A contemporary report from [UPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPI "UPI") stated that their votes were the first to be cast from space.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-ap1971-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-upi1971-14) Three cosmonauts ([Sergei Krikalev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Krikalev "Sergei Krikalev"), [Valery Polyakov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Polyakov "Valeri Polyakov") and [Alexander Volkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Aleksandrovich_Volkov "Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Volkov")) onboard the [Mir space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir") voted in the 1989 Soviet parliamentary elections "without a [secret ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot "Secret ballot")" with [TASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS "TASS") reporting they announced their choice of candidates when communicating with ground control.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-15)

In Russia, cosmonauts generally vote by proxy; for example, in the [2011 legislative election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Russian_legislative_election "2011 Russian legislative election"), [Anton Shkaplerov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Shkaplerov "Anton Shkaplerov") and [Anatoli Ivanishin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Ivanishin "Anatoli Ivanishin") gave their vote to [Cosmonaut Training Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin_Cosmonaut_Training_Center "Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center") employee Dmitry Zhukov.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-16)

During the [2020 Russian constitutional referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Russian_constitutional_referendum "2020 Russian constitutional referendum"), [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow") allowed for online voting. This allowed Anatoli Ivanishin, stationed on the [ISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISS "ISS") and registered to vote in Moscow, to vote electronically. [Ivan Vagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Vagner "Ivan Vagner"), stationed alongside Ivanishin, voted by proxy.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-17)

French astronaut [Thomas Pesquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pesquet "Thomas Pesquet") voted from space in 2017.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_space#cite_note-18)
