( August 2019 ) Cellulose is an example of a (1→4)-β- D -glucan composed of glucose units Beta-glucans , β-glucans comprise a group of β- D -glucose polysaccharides ( glucans ) naturally occurring in the cell walls of cereals , bacteria , and fungi , with significantly differing physicochemical properties dependent on source. Typically, β-glucans form a linear backbone with 1–3 β- glycosidic bonds but vary with respect to molecular mass, solubility, viscosity, branching structure, and gelation properties, causing diverse physiological effects in animals.

At dietary intake levels of at least 3 g per day, oat fiber β-glucan decreases blood levels of LDL cholesterol and so may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases .

[ 1 ] β-glucans are natural gums and are used as texturing agents in various nutraceutical and cosmetic products, and as soluble fiber supplements.

History [ edit ] Cereal and fungal products have been used for centuries for medicinal and cosmetic purposes; however, the specific role of β-glucan was not explored until the 20th century.  β-glucans were first discovered in lichens, and shortly thereafter in barley. A particular interest in oat β-glucan arose after a cholesterol lowering effect from oat bran reported in 1981.

[ 2 ] In 1997, the FDA approved of a claim that intake of at least 3.0 g of β-glucan from oats per day decreased absorption of dietary cholesterol and reduced the risk of coronary heart disease . The approved health claim was later amended to include these sources of β-glucan: rolled oats (oatmeal), oat bran, whole oat flour, oatrim (the soluble fraction of alpha-amylase hydrolyzed oat bran or whole oat flour), whole grain barley and barley beta-fiber. An example of an allowed label claim: "Soluble fiber from foods such as oatmeal, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A serving of oatmeal supplies 0.75 grams of the 3.0 g of β-glucan soluble fiber necessary per day to have this effect." The claim language is in the Federal Register 21 CFR 101.81 Health Claims: "Soluble fiber from certain foods and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD)".

[ 3 ] Structure [ edit ] Glucans are arranged in six-sided D -glucose rings connected linearly at varying carbon positions depending on the source, although most commonly β-glucans include a 1-3 glycosidic link in their backbone. Although technically β-glucans are chains of D -glucose polysaccharides linked by β-type glycosidic bonds , by convention not all β- D -glucose polysaccharides are categorized as β-glucans.

[ 4 ] Cellulose is not conventionally considered a β-glucan, as it is insoluble and does not exhibit the same physicochemical properties as other cereal or yeast β-glucans.

[ 5 ] Glucose molecule, showing carbon numbering notation and β orientation.

Some β-glucan molecules have branching glucose side-chains attached to other positions on the main D -glucose chain, which branch off the β-glucan backbone. In addition, these side-chains can be attached to other types of molecules, like proteins, as in polysaccharide-K .

The most common forms of β-glucans are those comprising D -glucose units with β-1,3 links.  Yeast and fungal β-glucans contain 1-6 side branches, while cereal β-glucans contain both β-1,3 and β-1,4 backbone bonds, but no β-1,3 branching.

[ 6 ] Seaweeds consist of a backbone that is primarily β-1,3-glucan, but with some β-1,6-glucan in the backbone as well as in side chains.

[ 6 ] The frequency, location, and length of the side-chains may play a role in immunomodulation. Differences in molecular weight, shape, and structure of β-glucans dictate the differences in biological activity.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] In general, β-1,3 linkages are created by 1,3-beta-glucan synthase , and β-1,4 linkages are created by cellulose synthase . The process leading to β-1,6 linkages is poorly understood: although genes important in the process have been identified, not much is known about what each of them do.

[ 9 ] β-Glucan Structure by Source Source (Example) Backbone Branching Solubility in Water Bacteria ( Curdlan ) None Insoluble [ 10 ] Fungus Short β-1,6 branching Insoluble [ 11 ] Yeast Long β-1,6 branching Insoluble [ 8 ] Cereal ( Oat beta-glucan ) None Soluble [ 7 ] β-glucan types [ edit ] β-glucans form a natural component of the cell walls of bacteria, fungi, yeast, and cereals such as oat and barley. Each type of beta-glucan comprises a different molecular backbone, level of branching, and molecular weight which affects its solubility and physiological impact. One of the most common sources of β(1,3)D-glucan for supplement use is derived from the cell wall of baker's yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ). β-glucans found in the cell walls of yeast contain a 1,3 glucose backbone with elongated 1,6 glucose branches.

[ 12 ] Other sources include seaweed , [ 13 ] and various mushrooms, such as lingzhi , shiitake , chaga , and maitake , which are under preliminary research for their potential immune effects.

[ 14 ] Fermentable fiber [ edit ] Main article: Dietary fiber In the diet, β-glucans are a source of soluble, fermentable fiber – also called prebiotic fiber – which provides a substrate for microbiota within the large intestine , increasing fecal bulk and producing short-chain fatty acids as byproducts with wide-ranging physiological activities.

[ 15 ] This fermentation impacts the expression of many genes within the large intestine, [ 16 ] which further affects digestive function and cholesterol and glucose metabolism, as well as the immune system and other systemic functions.

[ 15 ] [ 17 ] Oatmeal is a common food source of β-glucans Cereal [ edit ] Main article: Oat beta-glucan Cereal β-glucans from oat, barley, wheat, and rye have been studied for their effects on cholesterol levels in people with normal cholesterol levels and in those with hypercholesterolemia .

[ 1 ] Intake of oat β-glucan at daily amounts of at least 3 grams lowers total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 5 to 10% in people with normal or elevated blood cholesterol levels.

[ 18 ] Oats and barley differ in the ratio of trimer and tetramer 1-4 linkages. Barley has more 1-4 linkages with a degree of polymerization higher than 4. However, the majority of barley blocks remain trimers and tetramers. In oats, β-glucan is found mainly in the endosperm of the oat kernel, especially in the outer layers of that endosperm.

[ 7 ] β-glucan absorption [ edit ] Enterocytes facilitate the transportation of β(1,3)-glucans and similar compounds across the intestinal cell wall into the lymph, where they begin to interact with macrophages to activate immune function.

[ 19 ] Radiolabeled studies have verified that both small and large fragments of β-glucans are found in the serum, which indicates that they are absorbed from the intestinal tract.

[ 20 ] M cells within the Peyer's patches physically transport the insoluble whole glucan particles into the gut-associated lymphoid tissue .

[ 21 ] (1,3)-β- D -glucan medical application [ edit ] An assay to detect the presence of (1,3)-β- D -glucan in blood is marketed as a means of identifying invasive or disseminated fungal infections.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] This test should be interpreted within the broader clinical context, however, as a positive test does not render a diagnosis, and a negative test does not rule out infection.  False positives may occur because of fungal contaminants in the antibiotics amoxicillin-clavulanate , [ 25 ] and piperacillin/tazobactam . False positives can also occur with contamination of clinical specimens with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Alcaligenes faecalis , which also produce (1→3)β- D -glucan.

[ 26 ] This test can aid in the detection of Aspergillus , Candida , and Pneumocystis jirovecii .

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] This test cannot be used to detect Mucor or Rhizopus , the fungi responsible for mucormycosis , as they do not produce (1,3)-beta- D -glucan.
