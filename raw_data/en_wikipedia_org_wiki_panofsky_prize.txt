It is given to recognize and encourage outstanding achievements in experimental particle physics , and is open to scientists of any nation. It was established in 1985 by friends of Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky and by the Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society. Panofsky was a physics professor at Stanford University and the first director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) . Several of the prize winners have subsequently won the Nobel Prize in Physics . As of 2021, the prize included a $10,000 award.
