( November 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In Caspar Hare's theory of perspectival realism , [ 1 ] there is a defining intrinsic property that the things that are in perceptual awareness have.  Consider seeing object A but not object B.  Of course, we can say that the visual experience of A is present to you , and no visual experience of B is present to you .  But, it can be argued, this misses the fact that the visual experience of A is simply present, not relative to anything.  This is what Hare's perspectival realism attempts to capture, resulting in a weak version of metaphysical solipsism .

As Hare points out, the same type of argument is often used in the philosophy of time to support theories such as presentism .  Of course, we can say that A is happening on [insert today's date].  But, it can be argued, this misses the fact that A is simply happening (right now), not relative to anything.

Hare's theory of perspectival realism is closely related to his theory of egocentric presentism .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Several other philosophers have written reviews of Hare's work on this topic.
