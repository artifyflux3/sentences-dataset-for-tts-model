Campuses [ edit ] The Fall River campus is located on 65 acres (260,000 m 2 ) of land at 777 Elsbree Street. There are three additional campuses in New Bedford located at 800 Purchase Street, Attleboro located at 11 Field Road (which is shared with Bridgewater State University ) and Taunton located at 2 Hamilton St.
