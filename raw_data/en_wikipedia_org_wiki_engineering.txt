The [steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine"), the major driver in the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution"), underscores the importance of engineering in modern history. This [beam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_engine "Beam engine") is on display in the [Technical University of Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Madrid "Technical University of Madrid").

**Engineering** is the practice of using [natural science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science"), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), and the [engineering design process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_design_process "Engineering design process")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-EngineeringMethod-1) to [solve problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving#Engineering "Problem solving") within [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"), increase [efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency "Efficiency") and [productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity "Productivity"), and improve [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering "Systems engineering"). Modern engineering comprises many subfields which include [designing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design "Design") and improving [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure "Infrastructure"), [machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinery "Machinery"), [vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles"), [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"), [materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_engineering "Materials engineering"), and [energy systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_system "Energy system").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-2)

The [discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline "Academic discipline") of engineering encompasses a broad range of more [specialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_specialization "Academic specialization")[fields of engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_of_engineering "Fields of engineering"), each with a more specific emphasis for applications of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics "Applied mathematics") and [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_science "Applied science"). See [glossary of engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_engineering "Glossary of engineering").

The word _[engineering](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/engineering "wikt:engineering")_ is derived from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin")_[ingenium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ingenium "wikt:ingenium")_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-3)

The [American Engineers' Council for Professional Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Engineers%27_Council_for_Professional_Development "American Engineers' Council for Professional Development") (the predecessor of the [Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accreditation_Board_for_Engineering_and_Technology "Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology") aka ABET)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-ABET_History-4) has defined "engineering" as:

> The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or [manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing "Manufacturing") processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(engineering) "Function (engineering)"), economics of operation and [safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety#Types "Safety") to life and property.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-ECPD_Canons-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-ECPD_Definition_on_Britannica-6)

History
-------

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Grondplan_citadel_Lille.JPG/250px-Grondplan_citadel_Lille.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Grondplan_citadel_Lille.JPG)

[Relief map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raised-relief_map "Raised-relief map") of the [Citadel of Lille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_of_Lille "Citadel of Lille"), designed in 1668 by [Vauban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vauban "Vauban"), the foremost military engineer of his age

Engineering has existed since ancient times, when [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans "Humans") devised inventions such as the [wedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge "Wedge"), [lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever "Lever"), [wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel "Wheel") and [pulley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulley "Pulley"), etc.

The term _engineering_ is derived from the word _engineer_, which itself dates back to the 14th century when an _engine'er_ (literally, one who builds or operates a _[siege engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege\_engine "Siege engine")_) referred to "a constructor of military engines".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-7) In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, _i.e._, a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [catapult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catapult "Catapult")). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, _e.g._, the [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army_Corps_of_Engineers "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers").

The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin _ingenium_ (c. 1250), meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-8)

Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term [civil engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering "Civil engineering")[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-ECPD_Definition_on_Britannica-6) entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of [military engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_engineering "Military engineering").

### Ancient era

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Pont_du_Gard_BLS.jpg/250px-Pont_du_Gard_BLS.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pont_du_Gard_BLS.jpg)

The Ancient Romans built [aqueducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct_(watercourse) "Aqueduct (watercourse)") to bring a steady supply of clean and fresh water to cities and towns in the empire.

The [pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_pyramids "Egyptian pyramids") in [ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt"), [ziggurats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurats "Ziggurats") of [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia"), the [Acropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens "Acropolis of Athens") and [Parthenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon "Parthenon") in [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"), the [Roman aqueducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_aqueduct "Roman aqueduct"), [Via Appia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Appia "Via Appia") and [Colosseum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum "Colosseum"), [Teotihuacán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuac%C3%A1n "Teotihuacán"), and the [Brihadeeswarar Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihadeeswarar_Temple "Brihadeeswarar Temple") of [Thanjavur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanjavur "Thanjavur"), among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the [Hanging Gardens of Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon "Hanging Gardens of Babylon") and the [Pharos of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharos_of_Alexandria "Pharos of Alexandria"), were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the [Seven Wonders of the Ancient World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World "Seven Wonders of the Ancient World").

The six classic [simple machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machines "Simple machines") were known in the [ancient Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Near_East "Ancient Near East"). The [wedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge "Wedge") and the [inclined plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclined_plane "Inclined plane") (ramp) were known since [prehistoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric "Prehistoric") times.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-9) The [wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel "Wheel"), along with the [wheel and axle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_and_axle "Wheel and axle") mechanism, was invented in [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia") (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-10) The [lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever "Lever") mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the [Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East "Near East"), where it was used in a simple [balance scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_scale "Balance scale"),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Paipetis-11) and to move large objects in [ancient Egyptian technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_technology "Ancient Egyptian technology").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-12) The lever was also used in the [shadoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadoof "Shadoof") water-lifting device, the first [crane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(machine) "Crane (machine)") machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia c. 3000 BC,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Paipetis-11) and then in [ancient Egyptian technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_technology "Ancient Egyptian technology")c. 2000 BC.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-13) The earliest evidence of [pulleys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulley "Pulley") date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Eisenbrauns-14) and [ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") during the [Twelfth Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Dynasty "Twelfth Dynasty") (1991–1802 BC).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-15) The [screw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_(simple_machine) "Screw (simple machine)"), the last of the simple machines to be invented,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Woods-16) first appeared in Mesopotamia during the [Neo-Assyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian "Neo-Assyrian") period (911–609) BC.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Eisenbrauns-14) The [Egyptian pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_pyramids "Egyptian pyramids") were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like the [Great Pyramid of Giza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza "Great Pyramid of Giza").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-17)

The earliest civil engineer known by name is [Imhotep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imhotep "Imhotep").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-ECPD_Definition_on_Britannica-6) As one of the officials of the [Pharaoh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh "Pharaoh"), [Djosèr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djoser "Djoser"), he probably designed and supervised the construction of the [Pyramid of Djoser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser "Pyramid of Djoser") (the [Step Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_Pyramid "Step Pyramid")) at [Saqqara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqqara "Saqqara") in Egypt around 2630–2611 BC.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Barry-18) The earliest practical [water-powered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water-power "Water-power") machines, the [water wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_wheel "Water wheel") and [watermill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermill "Watermill"), first appeared in the [Persian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Empire "Persian Empire"), in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-19)

[Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush "Kingdom of Kush") developed the [Sakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakia "Sakia") during the 4th century BC, which relied on animal power instead of human energy.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-20)[Hafirs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafirs "Hafirs") were developed as a type of [reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir "Reservoir") in Kush to store and contain water as well as boost irrigation.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Hinkel-21)[Sappers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sappers "Sappers") were employed to build [causeways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeways "Causeways") during military campaigns.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-22) Kushite ancestors built [speos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speos "Speos") during the Bronze Age between 3700 and 3250 BC.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-23)[Bloomeries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomeries "Bloomeries") and [blast furnaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace "Blast furnace") were also created during the 7th centuries BC in Kush.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Humphris-27)

[Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") developed machines in both civilian and military domains. The [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism "Antikythera mechanism"), an early known mechanical [analog computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_computer "Analog computer"),[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-29) and the mechanical [inventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#Discoveries_and_inventions "Archimedes") of [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes"), are examples of Greek mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions, as well as the Antikythera mechanism, required sophisticated knowledge of [differential gearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device) "Differential (mechanical device)") or [epicyclic gearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicyclic_gearing "Epicyclic gearing"), two key principles in machine theory that helped design the [gear trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_train "Gear train") of the Industrial Revolution, and are widely used in fields such as [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics") and [automotive engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_engineering "Automotive engineering").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-30)

Ancient Chinese, Greek, Roman and [Hunnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns "Huns") armies employed military machines and inventions such as [artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery "Artillery") which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC,[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-31) the [trireme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trireme "Trireme"), the [ballista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballista "Ballista") and the [catapult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catapult "Catapult"), the [trebuchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet "Trebuchet") by Chinese circa 6th-5th century BCE.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-32)

### Middle Ages

The earliest practical [wind-powered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind-power "Wind-power") machines, the [windmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windmill "Windmill") and [wind pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_pump "Wind pump"), first appeared in the [Muslim world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world "Muslim world") during the [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age"), in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-36) The earliest practical [steam-powered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam-power "Steam-power") machine was a [steam jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_jack "Steam jack") driven by a [steam turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_turbine "Steam turbine"), described in 1551 by [Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taqi_al-Din_Muhammad_ibn_Ma%27ruf "Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf") in [Ottoman Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Egypt "Ottoman Egypt").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-38)

The [cotton gin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_gin "Cotton gin") was invented in India by the 6th century AD,[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-39) and the [spinning wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_wheel "Spinning wheel") was invented in the [Islamic world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_world "Islamic world") by the early 11th century,[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Pacey-40) both of which were fundamental to the growth of the [cotton industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_industry "Cotton industry"). The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the [spinning jenny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_jenny "Spinning jenny"), which was a key development during the early [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") in the 18th century.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-41)

The earliest [programmable machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_(machine) "Program (machine)") were developed in the Muslim world. A [music sequencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_sequencer "Music sequencer"), a programmable [musical instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument "Musical instrument"), was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated [flute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flute "Flute") player invented by the [Banu Musa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Musa "Banu Musa") brothers, described in their _[Book of Ingenious Devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Ingenious\_Devices "Book of Ingenious Devices")_, in the 9th century.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Koetsier-42)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-43) In 1206, Al-Jazari invented programmable [automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata "Automata")/[robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot "Robot"). He described four [automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton "Automaton") musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable [drum machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine "Drum machine"), where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Sharkey-44)

A water-powered [mine hoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_hoist "Mine hoist") used for raising ore, Germany, c. 1556

Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [millwrights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millwright "Millwright"), [clockmakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockmaker "Clockmaker"), instrument makers and surveyors. Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Robinson-Musnon-45): 32

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise _[De re metallica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_re\_metallica "De re metallica")_ (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining, and chemistry. _De re metallica_ was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Robinson-Musnon-45)

### Modern era

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/The_world%27s_first_iron_bridge.jpg/330px-The_world%27s_first_iron_bridge.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_world%27s_first_iron_bridge.jpg)

The application of the steam engine allowed coke to be substituted for charcoal in [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron") making, lowering the cost of iron, which provided engineers with a new material for building bridges. This bridge was made of [cast iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron "Cast iron"), which was soon displaced by less brittle [wrought iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrought_iron "Wrought iron") as a structural material.

The science of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Robinson-Musnon-45) With the rise of engineering as a [profession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession "Profession") in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the [mechanic arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanic_arts "Mechanic arts") became incorporated into engineering.

[Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal "Canal") building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-46)

[John Smeaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smeaton "John Smeaton") was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the "father" of civil engineering. He was an English civil engineer responsible for the design of [bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge "Bridge"), canals, [harbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor "Harbor"), and [lighthouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse "Lighthouse"). He was also a capable [mechanical engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineer "Mechanical engineer") and an eminent [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist"). Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-University_Of_Chicago_Press-47): 127  Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Robinson-Musnon-45): 69  Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the [Newcomen steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomen_steam_engine "Newcomen steam engine"). Smeaton designed the third [Eddystone Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddystone_Lighthouse "Eddystone Lighthouse") (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of '[hydraulic lime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_lime "Hydraulic lime")' (a form of [mortar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_(masonry) "Mortar (masonry)") which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern [cement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement "Cement"), because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain "hydraulicity" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of [Portland cement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement "Portland cement").

Applied science led to the development of the steam engine. The sequence of events began with the invention of the [barometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer "Barometer") and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by [Evangelista Torricelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelista_Torricelli "Evangelista Torricelli") in 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by [Otto von Guericke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Guericke "Otto von Guericke") using the [Magdeburg hemispheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdeburg_hemispheres "Magdeburg hemispheres") in 1656, laboratory experiments by [Denis Papin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Papin "Denis Papin"), who built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a [piston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston "Piston"), which he published in 1707. [Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Somerset,_2nd_Marquess_of_Worcester "Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester") published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a [coffee percolator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator "Coffee percolator"). [Samuel Morland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morland "Samuel Morland"), a mathematician and inventor who worked on [pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump "Pump"), left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that [Thomas Savery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Savery "Thomas Savery") read. In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called "The Miner's Friend". It employed both vacuum and pressure.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-48) Iron merchant [Thomas Newcomen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Newcomen "Thomas Newcomen"), who built the first commercial piston steam engine in 1712, was not known to have any scientific training.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-University_Of_Chicago_Press-47): 32

The application of steam-powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for [blast furnaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace "Blast furnace") lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century. The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam-powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in [blast furnaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace "Blast furnace"), which enabled the transition from charcoal to [coke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel) "Coke (fuel)").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-49) These innovations lowered the cost of iron, making [horse railways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagonway "Wagonway") and iron bridges practical. The [puddling process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puddling_process "Puddling process"), patented by [Henry Cort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cort "Henry Cort") in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron. [Hot blast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_blast "Hot blast"), patented by [James Beaumont Neilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Beaumont_Neilson "James Beaumont Neilson") in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron. With the development of the high pressure steam engine, the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-HunterIndustrialPower-50) New steel making processes, such as the [Bessemer process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessemer_process "Bessemer process") and the open hearth furnace, ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century.

One of the most famous engineers of the mid-19th century was [Isambard Kingdom Brunel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel "Isambard Kingdom Brunel"), who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.

The [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") created a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several [machine tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_tools "Machine tools"). Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until [John Wilkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkinson_(industrialist) "John Wilkinson (industrialist)") invented his [boring machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkinson_(industrialist)#Boring_machine_for_steam_engines "John Wilkinson (industrialist)"), which is considered the first [machine tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_tool "Machine tool").[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-51) Other machine tools included the [screw cutting lathe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_cutting_lathe "Screw cutting lathe"), [milling machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milling_machine "Milling machine"), [turret lathe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turret_lathe "Turret lathe") and the [metal planer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planer_(metalworking) "Planer (metalworking)"). Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century. These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position. Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing [interchangeable parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchangeable_parts "Interchangeable parts") lead to [large scale factory production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production "Mass production") by the late 19th century.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-52)

The United States Census of 1850 listed the occupation of "engineer" for the first time with a count of 2,000.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-53) There were fewer than 50 engineering graduates in the U.S. before 1865. The first [PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhD "PhD") in engineering (technically, _applied science and engineering_) awarded in the United States went to [Josiah Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs "Josiah Willard Gibbs") at [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University") in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-54) In 1870 there were a dozen U.S. mechanical engineering graduates, with that number increasing to 43 per year in 1875. In 1890, there were 6,000 engineers in civil, [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining "Mining"), mechanical and electrical.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-HunterIndustrialPower-50) There was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at Cambridge until 1875, and no chair of engineering at Oxford until 1907. Germany established technical universities earlier.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-55)

The foundations of [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering") in the 1800s included the experiments of [Alessandro Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta "Alessandro Volta"), [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday"), [Georg Ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm "Georg Ohm") and others and the invention of the [electric telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_telegraph "Electric telegraph") in 1816 and the [electric motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor "Electric motor") in 1872. The theoretical work of [James Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") (see: [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations")) and [Heinrich Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz "Heinrich Hertz") in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"). The later inventions of the [vacuum tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube") and the [transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor "Transistor") further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-ECPD_Definition_on_Britannica-6)[Chemical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering "Chemical engineering") developed in the late nineteenth century.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-ECPD_Definition_on_Britannica-6) Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-ECPD_Definition_on_Britannica-6) The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-ECPD_Definition_on_Britannica-6) Originally deriving from the manufacture of [ceramics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic "Ceramic") and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-:1-56) Modern materials science evolved directly from [metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy "Metallurgy"), which itself evolved from the use of fire. Important elements of modern materials science were products of the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race"); the understanding and engineering of the metallic [alloys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy "Alloy"), and [silica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica "Silica") and [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon") materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as [rubbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber "Rubber"), [plastics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic "Plastic"), [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor "Semiconductor"), and [biomaterials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomaterial "Biomaterial").

The [solar furnace at Odeillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeillo_solar_furnace "Odeillo solar furnace") in the [Pyrénées-Orientales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales "Pyrénées-Orientales") in [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") can reach temperatures up to 3,500°C (6,330°F).

Aeronautical engineering deals with [aircraft design process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_design_process "Aircraft design process") design while [aerospace engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering") is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of [Sir George Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Cayley "Sir George Cayley") has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-americana-57) Only a [decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade "Decade") after the successful flights by the [Wright brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers"), there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"). Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") with experiments.

[Hoover Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_Dam "Hoover Dam")

Engineering is a broad discipline that is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. Although most engineers will usually be trained in a specific discipline, some engineers become multi-disciplined through experience. Engineering is often characterized as having five main branches:[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-58)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-UK_Council-59)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Ramchandani2000-60) chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, materials science and engineering, and mechanical engineering.

It is distinct from [computer engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering "Computer engineering"). |

Interdisciplinary engineering
-----------------------------

Interdisciplinary engineering draws from more than one of the principle branches of the practice. Historically, [naval engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_engineering "Naval engineering") and [mining engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_engineering "Mining engineering") were major branches. Other engineering fields are [manufacturing engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_engineering "Manufacturing engineering"), [acoustical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustical_engineering "Acoustical engineering"), [corrosion engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_engineering "Corrosion engineering"), [instrumentation and control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_and_control "Instrumentation and control"), [automotive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_engineering "Automotive engineering"), [information engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_engineering "Information engineering"), [petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_engineering "Petroleum engineering"), [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering "Systems engineering"), [audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineering "Audio engineering"), [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering "Software engineering"), [architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_engineering "Architectural engineering"), [biosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosystems_engineering "Biosystems engineering"), and [textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacturing "Textile manufacturing")[engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering "Nuclear engineering").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-61) These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK [Engineering Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_Council "Engineering Council").

New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, [Earth systems engineering and management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_systems_engineering_and_management "Earth systems engineering and management") involves a wide range of subject areas including [engineering studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_studies "Engineering studies"), [environmental science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_science "Environmental science"), [engineering ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_ethics "Engineering ethics") and [philosophy of engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_engineering "Philosophy of engineering").

Practice
--------

One who practices engineering is called an [engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer "Engineer"), and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as Professional Engineer, Chartered Engineer, [Incorporated Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporated_Engineer "Incorporated Engineer"), [Ingenieur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenieur "Ingenieur"), [European Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Engineer "European Engineer"). There can also be what is called by the [FAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAA "FAA") a [Designated Engineering Representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration#Designated_Engineering_Representative "Federal Aviation Administration").[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-62)

Methodology

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg/250px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg)

Design of a [turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine "Turbine") requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [blades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine_blade "Turbine blade"), [rotor and stator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stator "Stator") as well as the [steam cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_cycle "Steam cycle") all need to be carefully designed and optimized.

In the [engineering design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_design "Engineering design") process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. Engineers need proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their careers.

If multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.

Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_engineering "Safety engineering"), marketability, productivity, and [serviceability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serviceability_(computer) "Serviceability (computer)"). By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specifications "Specifications") for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.

### Problem solving

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Booster-Layout.jpg/330px-Booster-Layout.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Booster-Layout.jpg)

A drawing for a [steam locomotive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_locomotive "Steam locomotive"). Engineering is applied to [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design "Design"), with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.

Engineers use their knowledge of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), and [appropriate experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_knowledge "Empirical knowledge") or [tacit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge "Tacit knowledge") to find suitable solutions to a particular problem. Creating an appropriate [mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-63)

More than one solution to a design problem usually exists so the different [design choices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_choice "Design choice") have to be evaluated on their merits before the one judged most suitable is chosen. [Genrich Altshuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genrich_Altshuller "Genrich Altshuller"), after gathering statistics on a large number of [patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent "Patent"), suggested that [compromises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise "Compromise") are at the heart of "[low-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_invention "Level of invention")" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-64)

Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [prototypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype "Prototype"), [scale models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model "Scale model"), [simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation "Simulation"), [destructive tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructive_testing "Destructive testing"), [nondestructive tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondestructive_testing "Nondestructive testing"), and [stress tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_testing "Stress testing"). Testing ensures that products will perform as expected but only in so far as the testing has been representative of use in service. For products, such as aircraft, that are used differently by different users failures and unexpected shortcomings (and necessary design changes) can be expected throughout the operational life of the product.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-65)

Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and, except those employed in specific areas of the [arms industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry "Arms industry"), will not harm people. Engineers typically include a [factor of safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_of_safety "Factor of safety") in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure.

The study of failed products is known as [forensic engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_engineering "Forensic engineering"). It attempts to identify the cause of failure to allow a redesign of the product and so prevent a re-occurrence. Careful analysis is needed to establish the cause of failure of a product. The consequences of a failure may vary in severity from the minor cost of a machine breakdown to large loss of life in the case of accidents involving aircraft and large stationary structures like buildings and dams.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-66)

### Computer use

A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [Space Shuttle orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_orbiter "Space Shuttle orbiter") during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method "Finite element method") of the combined effects of [fluid flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations "Navier–Stokes equations") and the [heat equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation "Heat equation").

As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [application software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software") there are a number of computer aided applications ([computer-aided technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_technologies "Computer-aided technologies")) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [numerical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_method "Numerical method").

Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink "Hyperlink")

One of the most widely used [design tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_tool "Design tool") in the profession is [computer-aided design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design "Computer-aided design") (CAD) software. It enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [digital mockup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mockup "Digital mockup") (DMU) and [CAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering "Computer-aided engineering") software such as [finite element method analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method "Finite element method") or [analytic element method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_element_method "Analytic element method") allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.

These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [product data management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_data_management "Product data management") software.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-67)

There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as [computer-aided manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing "Computer-aided manufacturing") (CAM) software to generate [CNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNC "CNC") machining instructions; [manufacturing process management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_process_management "Manufacturing process management") software for production engineering; [EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation "Electronic design automation") for [printed circuit board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board "Printed circuit board") (PCB) and circuit [schematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schematic "Schematic") for electronic engineers; [MRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations "Maintenance, repair, and operations") applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.

In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as [product lifecycle management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_lifecycle_management "Product lifecycle management") (PLM).[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-68)

The engineering profession engages in a range of activities, from collaboration at the societal level, and smaller individual projects. Almost all engineering projects are obligated to a funding source: a company, a set of investors, or a government. The types of engineering that are less constrained by such a funding source, are _[pro bono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro\_bono "Pro bono")_, and [open-design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-design "Open-design") engineering.

Engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior. Most products and constructions used by modern society, are influenced by engineering. Engineering activities have an impact on the environment, society, economies, and public safety.

Engineering projects can be controversial. Examples from different engineering disciplines include: the development of [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon"), the [Three Gorges Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam "Three Gorges Dam"), the design and use of [sport utility vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle "Sport utility vehicle") and the extraction of [oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_oil "Fuel oil"). In response, some engineering companies have enacted serious [corporate and social responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility "Corporate social responsibility") policies.

The attainment of many of the [Millennium Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals "Millennium Development Goals") requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-MDG-69)

Overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers, to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. Some charitable organizations use engineering directly for development:

*   [Engineers Against Poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers_Against_Poverty "Engineers Against Poverty")
*   Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief
*   [Engineers for a Sustainable World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers_for_a_Sustainable_World "Engineers for a Sustainable World")
*   [Engineering for Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_for_Change "Engineering for Change")
*   Engineering Ministries International[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-EMI-70)

Engineering companies in more developed economies face challenges with regard to the number of engineers being trained, compared with those retiring. This problem is prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-71) There are negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-72) It is agreed the engineering profession faces an "image crisis".[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-73) The UK holds the [most engineering companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Engineering_companies_by_country "Category:Engineering companies by country") compared to other European countries, together with the United States.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Code of ethics

Many [engineering societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_societies "Engineering societies") have established codes of practice and [codes of ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_ethics "Engineering ethics") to guide members and inform the public at large. The [National Society of Professional Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Society_of_Professional_Engineers "National Society of Professional Engineers") code of ethics states:

> Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-74)

In Canada, engineers wear the [Iron Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Ring "Iron Ring") as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-75)

Relationships with other disciplines
------------------------------------

### Science

> _Scientists study the world as it is; engineers create the world that has never been._

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Worker_inside_the_target_chamber_of_the_National_Ignition_Facility.jpg/330px-Worker_inside_the_target_chamber_of_the_National_Ignition_Facility.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Worker_inside_the_target_chamber_of_the_National_Ignition_Facility.jpg)

Engineers, scientists and technicians at work on target positioner inside [National Ignition Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility "National Ignition Facility") (NIF) target chamber

There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena. Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology, engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely "engineering scientists".[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-79)

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/The_station_pictured_from_the_SpaceX_Crew_Dragon_5_%28cropped%29.jpg/330px-The_station_pictured_from_the_SpaceX_Crew_Dragon_5_%28cropped%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_station_pictured_from_the_SpaceX_Crew_Dragon_5_(cropped).jpg)

The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") is used to conduct science experiments in space.

In the book _[What Engineers Know and How They Know It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What\_Engineers\_Know\_and\_How\_They\_Know\_It "What Engineers Know and How They Know It")_,[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-vincenti-80)[Walter Vincenti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Vincenti "Walter Vincenti") asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research. First, it often deals with areas in which the basic [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") or [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.

There is a "real and important" difference between engineering and physics as similar to any science field has to do with technology.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-81)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-82) Physics is an exploratory science that seeks knowledge of principles while engineering uses knowledge for practical applications of principles. The former equates an understanding into a mathematical principle while the latter measures variables involved and creates technology.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-83)[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-84)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-85) For technology, physics is an auxiliary and in a way technology is considered as applied physics.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-86) Though physics and engineering are interrelated, it does not mean that a physicist is trained to do an engineer's job. A physicist would typically require additional and relevant training.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-87) Physicists and engineers engage in different lines of work.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-88) But PhD physicists who specialize in sectors of [engineering physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics "Engineering physics") and [applied physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_physics "Applied physics") are titled as Technology officer, R&D Engineers and System Engineers.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-89)

An example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the [Navier–Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations "Navier–Stokes equations") to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of the [finite element method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method "Finite element method") to calculate the stresses in complex components. Second, engineering research employs many semi-[empirical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_methods "Empirical methods") that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-90)

As stated by Fung _et al._ in the revision to the classic engineering text _Foundations of Solid Mechanics_:

> Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined. In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") and [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"). Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Fung-91)

Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-92)

### Medicine and biology

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Modern_3T_MRI.JPG/250px-Modern_3T_MRI.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Modern_3T_MRI.JPG)

A 3 tesla clinical [MRI scanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI_scanner "MRI scanner")

The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. [Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine") aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the [human body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body "Human body"), if necessary, through the use of [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology").

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/GFP_Mice_01.jpg/250px-GFP_Mice_01.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GFP_Mice_01.jpg)

Genetically engineered mice expressing [green fluorescent protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein "Green fluorescent protein"), which glows green under blue light. The central mouse is [wild-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild-type "Wild-type").

Modern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, [brain implants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_implant "Brain implant") and [pacemakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacemakers "Pacemakers").[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Boston_U-93)[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-IEEE_foreign_parts-94) The fields of [bionics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionics "Bionics") and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.

Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") with technology. This has led to fields such as [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"), [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network"), [fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic "Fuzzy logic"), and [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot "Robot"). There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-IME-95)[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-IEEE-96)

Both fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and empirical knowledge is an integral part of both.

Medicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Royal_Academy-97)

The heart for example functions much like a pump,[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Science_Museum_of_Minnesota-98) the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers,[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Minnesota_State_University_emuseum-99) the brain produces [electrical signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electrical_engineering) "Signal (electrical engineering)") etc.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-UC_Berkeley_News-100) These similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine, led to the development of the field of [biomedical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering "Biomedical engineering") that uses concepts developed in both disciplines.

Newly emerging branches of science, such as [systems biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology "Systems biology"), are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Royal_Academy-97)

### Art

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_presumed_self-portrait_-_WGA12798.jpg/250px-Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_presumed_self-portrait_-_WGA12798.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_presumed_self-portrait_-_WGA12798.jpg)

[Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci"), seen here in a self-portrait, has been described as the epitome of the artist/engineer.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Bjerklie,_David-101) He is also known for his studies on [human anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomy "Human anatomy") and [physiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology "Physiology").

There are connections between engineering and art, for example, [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture "Architecture"), [landscape architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_architecture "Landscape architecture") and [industrial design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design "Industrial design") (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's [Faculty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division) "Faculty (division)") of Engineering).[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-National_Science_Foundation:The_Art_of_Engineering-102)[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-MIT_World:The_Art_of_Engineering-103)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-University_of_Texas_at_Dallas-104)

The [Art Institute of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Institute_of_Chicago "Art Institute of Chicago"), for instance, held an exhibition about the art of [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s aerospace design.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-NASA-105)[Robert Maillart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Maillart "Robert Maillart")'s bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Princeton_U-106) At the [University of South Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Florida "University of South Florida"), an engineering professor, through a grant with the [National Science Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation "National Science Foundation"), has developed a course that connects art and engineering.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-National_Science_Foundation:The_Art_of_Engineering-102)[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Chief_engineer-107)

Among famous historical figures, [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci") is a well-known [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Bjerklie,_David-101)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#cite_note-Drew_U-108)

### Business

[Business engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_engineering "Business engineering") deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and [change management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management "Change management"). [Engineering management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_management "Engineering management") or "Management engineering" is a specialized field of [management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management "Management") concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector. The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [industrial engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_engineering "Industrial engineering") skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking. Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [industrial and organizational psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology "Industrial and organizational psychology") principles and methods. Professional engineers often train as [certified management consultants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_management_consultant "Certified management consultant") in the very specialized field of [management consulting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_consulting "Management consulting") applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector. This work often deals with large scale complex [business transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_transformation "Business transformation") or [business process management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management "Business process management") initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical and electronics, power distribution and generation, utilities and transportation systems. This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.

### Other fields

In [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science"), the term _engineering_ has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(political_science) "Social engineering (political science)") and [political engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_engineering "Political engineering"), which deal with forming [political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_structure "Political structure") and [social structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structure "Social structure") using engineering methodology coupled with [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science") principles. [Marketing engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_engineering "Marketing engineering") and [financial engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_engineering "Financial engineering") have similarly borrowed the term.
