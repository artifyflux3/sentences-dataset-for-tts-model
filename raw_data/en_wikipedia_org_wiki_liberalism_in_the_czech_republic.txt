It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that parties label themselves as a liberal party.

Background [ edit ] When liberalism started in the Czech lands , they were member states of Austria-Hungary . Liberals in the region started as part of the conservative nationalist National Party ( Národní strana ) or Old Czechs , but from 1874 they formed their own party: the National Liberal Party ( Národní strana svobodomyslná ), also known as the Young Czechs .

[ 1 ] : 75 Czech liberals usually do not call themselves liberals, but prefer labels such as progressive or even national socialist (which has nothing to do with the German variant ).
