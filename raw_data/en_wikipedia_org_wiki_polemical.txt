The practice of such argumentation is called polemics , which are seen in arguments on controversial topics. A person who writes polemics, or speaks polemically, is called a polemicist .

[ 1 ] The word derives from Ancient Greek πολεμικός ( polemikos ) ' warlike, hostile ' , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] from πόλεμος ( polemos ) ' war ' .

[ 3 ] Polemics often concern questions in religion or politics. A polemical style of writing was common in Ancient Greece , as in the writings of the historian Polybius . Polemic again became common in medieval and early modern times. Since then, famous polemicists have included satirist Jonathan Swift , Italian physicist and mathematician Galileo , French theologian Jean Calvin , French Enlightenment writer, historian, and philosopher Voltaire , Russian author Leo Tolstoy , socialist philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels , novelist George Orwell , playwright George Bernard Shaw , communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin , linguist Noam Chomsky , social critics H.L. Mencken , Christopher Hitchens and Peter Hitchens , and existential philosophers Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche .

Polemical journalism was common in continental Europe when libel laws were not as stringent as they are now.

[ 4 ] To support study of 17th to 19th century controversies, a British research project has placed online thousands of polemical pamphlets from that period.

[ 5 ] Discussions of atheism, humanism, and Christianity have remained open to polemic into the 21st century.

History [ edit ] In Ancient Greece , writing was characterised by what Geoffrey Lloyd and Nathan Sivin called "strident adversariality" and "rationalistic aggressiveness", summed up by McClinton as polemic.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] For example, the ancient historian Polybius practiced "quite bitter self-righteous polemic" against some twenty philosophers, orators, and historians.

[ 8 ] Polemical writings were common in medieval and early modern times.

[ 9 ] During the Middle Ages, polemic had a religious dimension, as in Jewish texts written to protect and dissuade Jewish communities from converting to other religions .

[ 10 ] Medieval Christian writings were also often polemical; for example in their disagreements on Islam [ 11 ] or in the vast corpus aimed at converting the Jews.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Martin Luther 's 95 Theses was a polemic launched against the Catholic Church.

[ 6 ] [ note 1 ] Robert Carliell 's 1619 defence of the new Church of England and diatribe against the Roman Catholic Church – Britaine's glorie, or An allegoricall dreame with the exposition thereof: containing The Heathens infidelitie in religion ...

– took the form of a 250-line poem.

[ 14 ] Major political polemicists of the 18th century include Jonathan Swift , with pamphlets such as his A Modest Proposal , Alexander Hamilton , with pieces such as A Full Vindication of the Measures of Congress and A Farmer Refuted , and Edmund Burke , with his attack on the Duke of Bedford .

[ 15 ] In the 19th century, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels 's 1848 Communist Manifesto was extremely polemical.

[ 6 ] Both Marx and Engels would publish further polemical works, with Engels's work Anti-Dühring serving as a polemic against Eugen Dühring , and Marx's Critique of the Gotha Programme against Ferdinand Lasalle .

Vladimir Lenin published polemics against political opponents.

The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky was notably directed against Karl Kautsky , and other works such as The State and Revolution attacked figures including Eduard Bernstein .

In the 20th century, George Orwell 's Animal Farm was a polemic against totalitarianism , in particular of Stalinism in the Soviet Union .  According to McClinton, other prominent polemicists of the same century include such diverse figures as Herbert Marcuse , Noam Chomsky , John Pilger , and Michael Moore .

[ 6 ] Conservative Jewish Austrian writer and journalist Karl Kraus (1890-1935) considers the topic of moral collapse in his polemic writings. Karl Kraus produced and published 922 issues of the fifteen-daily magazine called Die Fackel (The Torch) until his death. Ludwig Wittgenstein, Sigmund Freud, Ernest Mach write in a similar manner and style to Kraus; In 2007 Brian McClinton argued in Humani that anti-religious books such as Richard Dawkins 's The God Delusion are part of the polemic tradition.

[ 6 ] In 2008 the humanist philosopher A. C. Grayling published a book, Against All Gods: Six Polemics on Religion and an Essay on Kindness .
