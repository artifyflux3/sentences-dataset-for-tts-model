( February 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Open source software demonstrations One of the Demonstrations about surface tangents The Wolfram Demonstrations Project is an open-source collection of interactive programmes called Demonstrations. It is hosted by Wolfram Research . At its launch, it contained 1300 demonstrations but has grown to over 10,000. The site won a Parents' Choice Award in 2008.

Wolfram Research 's staff organizes and edits the Demonstrations, which may be created by any user of Mathematica , then freely published [ 1 ] and freely downloaded.

Technology [ edit ] The Demonstrations run in Mathematica 6 or above and in Wolfram CDF Player , which is a free modified version of Wolfram Mathematica [ 2 ] and available for Windows , Linux , and macOS [ 3 ] and can operate as a web browser plugin . Demonstrations can also be embedded into a website.

[ 4 ] Each Demonstration page includes a snippet of JavaScript code in the Share section of the sidebar.

The Demonstrations typically consist of a direct user interface to a graphic or visualization that dynamically responds to user actions. Each Demonstration also has a description of the concept. The website is organized by topic, for example: science, [ 5 ] art, and biology.
