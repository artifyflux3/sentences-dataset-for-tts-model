In [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), a **field** is a [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity"), represented by a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)"), [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics) "Vector (mathematics and physics)"), or [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor"), that has a value for each [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") in [space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Gribbin-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Feynman2Ch1S2-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-3) An example of a [scalar field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field "Scalar field") is a weather map, with the surface [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") described by assigning a [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") to each point on the map. A surface wind map,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-4) assigning an arrow to each point on a map that describes the wind [speed and direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") at that point, is an example of a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field"), i.e. a 1-dimensional (rank-1) tensor field. Field theories, mathematical descriptions of how field values change in space and time, are ubiquitous in physics. For instance, the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") is another rank-1 tensor field, while [electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamics "Electrodynamics") can be formulated in terms of [two interacting vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_descriptions_of_the_electromagnetic_field "Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field") at each point in spacetime, or as a [single-rank 2-tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_formulation_of_classical_electromagnetism "Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism") field.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Feynman102-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Feynman204-7)

In the modern framework of the [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), even without referring to a test particle, a field occupies space, contains energy, and its presence precludes a classical "true vacuum".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Wheeler-8) This has led physicists to consider [electromagnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field") to be a physical entity, making the field concept a supporting [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm "Paradigm") of the edifice of modern physics. [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman") said, "The fact that the electromagnetic field can possess momentum and energy makes it very real, and [...] a particle makes a field, and a field acts on another particle, and the field has such familiar properties as energy content and momentum, just as particles can have."[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Feynman110-9) In practice, the strength of most fields diminishes with distance, eventually becoming undetectable. For instance the strength of many relevant classical fields, such as the gravitational field in [Newton's theory of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation") or the [electrostatic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_field "Electrostatic field") in classical electromagnetism, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source (i.e. they follow [Gauss's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law "Gauss's law")).

A field can be classified as a scalar field, a vector field, a [spinor field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor_field "Spinor field") or a [tensor field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field "Tensor field") according to whether the represented physical quantity is a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)"), a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector"), a [spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor "Spinor"), or a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor"), respectively. A field has a consistent tensorial character wherever it is defined: i.e. a field cannot be a scalar field somewhere and a vector field somewhere else. For example, the [Newtonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_gravity "Newtonian gravity")[gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field") is a vector field: specifying its value at a point in spacetime requires three numbers, the components of the gravitational field vector at that point. Moreover, within each category (scalar, vector, tensor), a field can be either a _classical field_ or a _quantum field_, depending on whether it is characterized by numbers or [quantum operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics) "Operator (physics)") respectively. In this theory an equivalent representation of field is a [field particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_particle "Field particle"), for instance a [boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson "Boson").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-10)

To [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), his [law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_universal_gravitation "Law of universal gravitation") simply expressed the gravitational [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") that acted between any pair of massive objects. When looking at the motion of many bodies all interacting with each other, such as the planets in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), dealing with the force between each pair of bodies separately rapidly becomes computationally inconvenient. In the eighteenth century, a new quantity was devised to simplify the bookkeeping of all these gravitational forces. This quantity, the [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field"), gave at each point in space the total gravitational acceleration which would be felt by a small object at that point. This did not change the physics in any way: it did not matter if all the gravitational forces on an object were calculated individually and then added together, or if all the contributions were first added together as a gravitational field and then applied to an object.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Weinberg1977-11) His idea in _[Opticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opticks "Opticks")_ that optical [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)") and [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction") arise from interactions across the entire surface is arguably the beginning of the field theory of electric force.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-12)

The development of the independent concept of a field truly began in the nineteenth century with the development of the theory of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"). In the early stages, [André-Marie Ampère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie_Amp%C3%A8re "André-Marie Ampère") and [Charles-Augustin de Coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb "Charles-Augustin de Coulomb") could manage with Newton-style laws that expressed the forces between pairs of [electric charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") or [electric currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current"). However, it became much more natural to take the field approach and express these laws in terms of [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") and [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"); in 1845 [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") became the first to coin the term "magnetic field".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-13) And Lord Kelvin provided a formal definition for a field in 1851.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-14)

The independent nature of the field became more apparent with [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell")'s discovery that waves in these fields, called [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_waves "Electromagnetic waves"), propagated at a finite speed. Consequently, the forces on charges and currents no longer just depended on the positions and velocities of other charges and currents at the same time, but also on their positions and velocities in the past.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Weinberg1977-11)

Maxwell, at first, did not adopt the modern concept of a field as a fundamental quantity that could independently exist. Instead, he supposed that the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field") expressed the deformation of some underlying medium—the [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether "Luminiferous aether")—much like the tension in a rubber membrane. If that were the case, the observed velocity of the electromagnetic waves should depend upon the velocity of the observer with respect to the aether. Despite much effort, no experimental evidence of such an effect was ever found; the situation was resolved by the introduction of the [special theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_theory_of_relativity "Special theory of relativity") by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") in 1905. This theory changed the way the viewpoints of moving observers were related to each other. They became related to each other in such a way that velocity of electromagnetic waves in Maxwell's theory would be the same for all observers. By doing away with the need for a background medium, this development opened the way for physicists to start thinking about fields as truly independent entities.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Weinberg1977-11)

In the late 1920s, the new rules of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") were first applied to the electromagnetic field. In 1927, [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac") used [quantum fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field "Quantum field") to successfully explain how the decay of an [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") to a lower [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state") led to the [spontaneous emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_emission "Spontaneous emission") of a [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), the quantum of the electromagnetic field. This was soon followed by the realization (following the work of [Pascual Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascual_Jordan "Pascual Jordan"), [Eugene Wigner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Wigner "Eugene Wigner"), [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg"), and [Wolfgang Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli "Wolfgang Pauli")) that all particles, including [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton"), could be understood as the quanta of some quantum field, elevating fields to the status of the most fundamental objects in nature.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Weinberg1977-11) That said, [John Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler "John Archibald Wheeler") and [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman") seriously considered Newton's pre-field concept of [action at a distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_(physics) "Action at a distance (physics)") (although they set it aside because of the ongoing utility of the field concept for research in [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") and [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics")).

There are several examples of [classical fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory "Classical field theory"). Classical field theories remain useful wherever quantum properties do not arise, and can be active areas of research. [Elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics) "Elasticity (physics)") of materials, [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics") and [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") are cases in point.

Some of the simplest physical fields are vector force fields. Historically, the first time that fields were taken seriously was with [Faraday's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday")[lines of force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lines_of_force "Lines of force") when describing the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field"). The [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field") was then similarly described.

### Newtonian gravitation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_(physics)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Newtonian gravitation")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Newtonian_gravity_field_%28physics%29.svg/190px-Newtonian_gravity_field_%28physics%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Newtonian_gravity_field_(physics).svg)

In [classical gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_gravitation "Classical gravitation"), mass is the source of an attractive [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field")**g**.

A classical field theory describing gravity is [Newtonian gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation"), which describes the gravitational force as a mutual interaction between two [masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass").

Any body with mass _M_ is associated with a [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field")**g** which describes its influence on other bodies with mass. The gravitational field of _M_ at a point **r** in space corresponds to the ratio between force **F** that _M_ exerts on a small or negligible [test mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_mass "Test mass")_m_ located at **r** and the test mass itself:[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-kleppner85-15)

![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )}{m}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/24e6e7fa277945002d4571dd95399c35756e8951)
Stipulating that _m_ is much smaller than _M_ ensures that the presence of _m_ has a negligible influence on the behavior of _M_.

According to [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"), **F**(**r**) is given by[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-kleppner85-15)

![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )=-{\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7d1769b7b58545469a0f3f326b100f06cd8616bd)
where ![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9740464b71653e12932278ee944540be8caa5b96) is a [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") lying along the line joining _M_ and _m_ and pointing from _M_ to _m_. Therefore, the gravitational field of **M** is[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-kleppner85-15)

![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )}{m}}=-{\frac {GM}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11de36a634c2d70b37666d605797ce67f56200e)
The experimental observation that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal [to an unprecedented level of accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle#Tests_of_the_weak_equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle") leads to the identity that gravitational field strength is identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle. This is the starting point of the [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle"), which leads to [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity").

Because the gravitational force **F** is [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_field "Conservative field"), the gravitational field **g** can be rewritten in terms of the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") of a scalar function, the [gravitational potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential "Gravitational potential") Φ(**r**):

![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )=-\nabla \Phi (\mathbf {r} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/75f77754813ade576122fc59636dc686409bafa5)
[Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") first realized the importance of a field as a physical quantity, during his investigations into [magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism"). He realized that [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") and [magnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") fields are not only fields of force which dictate the motion of particles, but also have an independent physical reality because they carry energy.

These ideas eventually led to the creation, by [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell"), of the first unified field theory in physics with the introduction of equations for the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field"). The modern versions of these equations are called [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations").

A [charged test particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_charge "Test charge") with charge _q_ experiences a force **F** based solely on its charge. We can similarly describe the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field")**E** so that **F** = _q_**E**. Using this and [Coulomb's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law") tells us that the electric field due to a single charged particle is

![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} ={\frac {1}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}}}{\frac {q}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/912044abd9c5dc5d044881dcde2a2d3f9d4940b7)
The electric field is [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_field "Conservative field"), and hence can be described by a scalar potential, _V_(**r**):

![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r} )=-\nabla V(\mathbf {r} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aad20b4e372b8c60654e8076b67cfafba79f6ce0)
A steady current _I_ flowing along a path _ℓ_ will create a field B, that exerts a force on nearby moving charged particles that is quantitatively different from the electric field force described above. The force exerted by _I_ on a nearby charge _q_ with velocity **v** is

![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )=q\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} ),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/983133a8249a097e794566e90ad2973af4c2803c)
where **B**(**r**) is the [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"), which is determined from _I_ by the [Biot–Savart law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot%E2%80%93Savart_law "Biot–Savart law"):

![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi }}\int {\frac {Id{\boldsymbol {\ell }}\times {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}}{r^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9cb2791898d45c53afdbd6c146dc767b4d9bdef0)
The magnetic field is not conservative in general, and hence cannot usually be written in terms of a scalar potential. However, it can be written in terms of a [vector potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_vector_potential "Magnetic vector potential"), **A**(**r**):

![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} )={\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\times \mathbf {A} (\mathbf {r} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4595b9e55113bb716c0956534ab23434630ab6f3)[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Em_dipoles.svg/250px-Em_dipoles.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Em_dipoles.svg)

The [**E** fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") and [**B** fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") due to [electric charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") (black/white) and [magnetic poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet "Magnet") (red/blue).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Mc_Graw_Hill-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-M._Mansfield,_C._O%E2%80%99Sullivan_2011-17)**Top:****E** field due to an [electric dipole moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_dipole_moment "Electric dipole moment")**d**. **Bottom left:****B** field due to a _mathematical_[magnetic dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole "Magnetic dipole")**m** formed by two magnetic monopoles. **Bottom right:****B** field due to a pure [magnetic dipole moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole_moment "Magnetic dipole moment")**m** found in ordinary matter (_not_ from monopoles).

In general, in the presence of both a charge density ρ(**r**, _t_) and current density **J**(**r**, _t_), there will be both an electric and a magnetic field, and both will vary in time. They are determined by [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"), a set of differential equations which directly relate **E** and **B** to ρ and **J**.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-griffiths326-18)

Alternatively, one can describe the system in terms of its scalar and vector potentials _V_ and **A**. A set of integral equations known as _[retarded potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarded\_potential "Retarded potential")_ allow one to calculate _V_ and **A** from ρ and **J**,[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-19) and from there the electric and magnetic fields are determined via the relations[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-wangsness469-20)

At the end of the 19th century, the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field") was understood as a collection of two vector fields in space. Nowadays, one recognizes this as a single antisymmetric 2nd-rank tensor field in spacetime.

The [**E** fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") and [**B** fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") due to [electric charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") (black/white) and [magnetic poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet "Magnet") (red/blue).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Mc_Graw_Hill-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-M._Mansfield,_C._O%E2%80%99Sullivan_2011-17)**E** fields due to stationary electric charges and **B** fields due to stationary [magnetic charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole "Magnetic monopole") (note in nature N and S monopoles do not exist). In motion ([velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity")**v**), an _electric_ charge induces a **B** field while a _magnetic_ charge (not found in nature) would induce an **E** field. [Conventional current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_current "Conventional current") is used.

### Gravitation in general relativity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_(physics)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Gravitation in general relativity")]

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Relativistic_gravity_field_%28physics%29.svg/500px-Relativistic_gravity_field_%28physics%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Relativistic_gravity_field_(physics).svg)

In [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), mass-energy warps space time ([Einstein tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_tensor "Einstein tensor")**G**),[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-21) and rotating asymmetric mass-energy distributions with [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum")**J** generate [GEM fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitoelectromagnetism "Gravitoelectromagnetism")**H**[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-22)

Einstein's theory of gravity, called [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), is another example of a field theory. Here the principal field is the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity) "Metric tensor (general relativity)"), a symmetric 2nd-rank tensor field in [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"). This replaces [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation").

[Waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave") can be constructed as physical fields, due to their [finite propagation speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") and [causal nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality") when a simplified [physical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_model "Physical model") of an [isolated closed system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system#The_concept_of_closed_systems_in_physics "Physical system") is set [_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]. They are also subject to the [inverse-square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law "Inverse-square law").

For electromagnetic waves, there are [optical fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_field "Optical field"), and terms such as [near- and far-field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_and_far_field "Near and far field") limits for diffraction. In practice though, the field theories of optics are superseded by the electromagnetic field theory of Maxwell.

[Gravity waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_wave "Gravity wave") are waves in the surface of water, defined by a height field.

Fluid dynamics has fields of [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure"), [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density"), and flow rate that are connected by conservation laws for energy and momentum. The mass continuity equation is a [continuity equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation "Continuity equation"), representing the conservation of mass ![Image 18: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf {u} )=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2567e1f460ceb134fd751701f777e0f1931aa7a1) and the [Navier–Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations "Navier–Stokes equations") represent the conservation of momentum in the fluid, found from Newton's laws applied to the fluid, ![Image 19: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}(\rho \mathbf {u} )+\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf {u} \otimes \mathbf {u} +p\mathbf {I} )=\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\tau }}+\rho \mathbf {b} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b84b6d120274198a86600302f1a7e3699df4a21) if the density ρ, pressure p, [deviatoric stress tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviatoric_stress_tensor "Deviatoric stress tensor")**τ** of the fluid, as well as external body forces **b**, are all given. The [flow velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_velocity "Flow velocity")**u** is the vector field to solve for.

[Linear elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_elasticity "Linear elasticity") is defined in terms of [constitutive equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutive_equation "Constitutive equation") between tensor fields,

![Image 20: {\displaystyle \sigma _{ij}=L_{ijkl}\varepsilon _{kl}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4968418b8af4a2dd619adcebd9b0ccac5ef02650)
where ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \sigma _{ij}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/43acbf52cc4d4f83f187ceaa49f045114b71772e) are the components of the 3x3 [Cauchy stress tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_stress_tensor "Cauchy stress tensor"), ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{ij}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a71e2079cee1685c2402d4d4ef48d75db18b4a64) the components of the 3x3 [infinitesimal strain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_strain_theory "Infinitesimal strain theory") and ![Image 23: {\displaystyle L_{ijkl}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/963ba9656e36829397db2a6a0f93b0b0e33761f4) is the [elasticity tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_tensor "Elasticity tensor"), a fourth-rank tensor with 81 components (usually 21 independent components).

### Thermodynamics and transport equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_(physics)&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Thermodynamics and transport equations")]

Assuming that the temperature _T_ is an [intensive quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_quantity "Intensive quantity"), i.e., a single-valued, [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative")[function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") of three-dimensional space (a [scalar field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field "Scalar field")), i.e., that ![Image 24: {\displaystyle T=T(\mathbf {r} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/34a961a232c0fe8f8d14307f51127d22099dc013), then the [temperature gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_gradient "Temperature gradient") is a vector field defined as ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \nabla T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f821c5afeadd28e07e1e1142c10b4656c7751d51). In [thermal conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction "Thermal conduction"), the temperature field appears in Fourier's law,

![Image 26: {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} =-k\nabla T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39b1ada50d67917e1840d942c21ac5530c10b8d6)
where **q** is the [heat flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_flux "Heat flux") field and _k_ the [thermal conductivity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity_and_resistivity "Thermal conductivity and resistivity")

Temperature and [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") gradients are also important for meteorology.

It is now believed that [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") should underlie all physical phenomena, so that a classical field theory should, at least in principle, permit a recasting in quantum mechanical terms; success yields the corresponding [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). For example, [quantizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(physics) "Quantization (physics)")[classical electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electrodynamics "Classical electrodynamics") gives [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics"). Quantum electrodynamics is arguably the most successful scientific theory; [experimental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment "Experiment")[data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data") confirm its predictions to a higher [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision "Accuracy and precision") (to more [significant digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_digit "Significant digit")) than any other theory.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-23) The two other fundamental quantum field theories are [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics") and the [electroweak theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_theory "Electroweak theory").

[![Image 27](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Qcd_fields_field_%28physics%29.svg/500px-Qcd_fields_field_%28physics%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Qcd_fields_field_(physics).svg)

Fields due to [color charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge "Color charge"), like in [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark") (**G** is the [gluon field strength tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon_field_strength_tensor "Gluon field strength tensor")). These are "colorless" combinations. **Top:** Color charge has "ternary neutral states" as well as binary neutrality (analogous to [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge")). **Bottom:** The quark/antiquark combinations.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-Mc_Graw_Hill-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-M._Mansfield,_C._O%E2%80%99Sullivan_2011-17)

In quantum chromodynamics, the color field lines are coupled at short distances by [gluons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon"), which are polarized by the field and line up with it. This effect increases within a short distance (around 1 [fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtometre "Femtometre") from the vicinity of the quarks) making the color force increase within a short distance, [confining the quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement "Color confinement") within [hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron "Hadron"). As the field lines are pulled together tightly by gluons, they do not "bow" outwards as much as an electric field between electric charges.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-24)

These three quantum field theories can all be derived as special cases of the so-called [standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_model "Standard model") of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"). [General relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), the Einsteinian field theory of gravity, has yet to be successfully quantized. However an extension, [thermal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_field_theory "Thermal field theory"), deals with quantum field theory at _finite temperatures_, something seldom considered in quantum field theory.

In [BRST theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRST_formalism "BRST formalism") one deals with odd fields, e.g. [Faddeev–Popov ghosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faddeev%E2%80%93Popov_ghost "Faddeev–Popov ghost"). There are different descriptions of odd classical fields both on [graded manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_manifold "Graded manifold") and [supermanifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermanifold "Supermanifold").

As above with classical fields, it is possible to approach their quantum counterparts from a purely mathematical view using similar techniques as before. The equations governing the quantum fields are in fact PDEs (specifically, [relativistic wave equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_wave_equations "Relativistic wave equations") (RWEs)). Thus one can speak of [Yang–Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_field "Yang–Mills field"), [Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_field "Dirac field"), [Klein–Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein%E2%80%93Gordon_field "Klein–Gordon field") and [Schrödinger fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_field "Schrödinger field") as being solutions to their respective equations. A possible problem is that these RWEs can deal with complicated [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_objects "Mathematical objects") with exotic algebraic properties (e.g. [spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinors "Spinors") are not [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensors "Tensors"), so may need calculus for [spinor fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor_field "Spinor field")), but these in theory can still be subjected to analytical methods given appropriate [mathematical generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization_(mathematics) "Generalization (mathematics)").

Field theory usually refers to a construction of the dynamics of a field, i.e. a specification of how a field changes with time or with respect to other independent physical variables on which the field depends. Usually this is done by writing a [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory) "Lagrangian (field theory)") or a [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") of the field, and treating it as a [classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") or [quantum mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") system with an infinite number of [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry) "Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)"). The resulting field theories are referred to as classical or quantum field theories.

The dynamics of a classical field are usually specified by the [Lagrangian density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory) "Lagrangian (field theory)") in terms of the field components; the dynamics can be obtained by using the [action principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics) "Action (physics)").

It is possible to construct simple fields without any prior knowledge of physics using only mathematics from [multivariable calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus "Multivariable calculus"), [potential theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_theory "Potential theory") and [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation") (PDEs). For example, scalar PDEs might consider quantities such as amplitude, density and pressure fields for the wave equation and [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"); temperature/concentration fields for the [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation "Heat equation")/[diffusion equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_equation "Diffusion equation"). Outside of physics proper (e.g., radiometry and computer graphics), there are even [light fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_fields "Light fields"). All these previous examples are [scalar fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_fields "Scalar fields"). Similarly for vectors, there are vector PDEs for displacement, velocity and vorticity fields in (applied mathematical) fluid dynamics, but vector calculus may now be needed in addition, being calculus for [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_fields "Vector fields") (as are these three quantities, and those for vector PDEs in general). More generally problems in [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics") may involve for example, directional [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_tensor "Elasticity tensor") (from which comes the term _tensor_, derived from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") word for stretch), [complex fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_fluid "Complex fluid") flows or [anisotropic diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropic_diffusion "Anisotropic diffusion"), which are framed as matrix-tensor PDEs, and then require matrices or tensor fields, hence [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_calculus "Matrix calculus") or [tensor calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus "Tensor calculus"). The scalars (and hence the vectors, matrices and tensors) can be real or complex as both are [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(algebra) "Field (algebra)") in the abstract-algebraic/[ring-theoretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_theory "Ring theory") sense.

In a general setting, classical fields are described by sections of [fiber bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle "Fiber bundle") and their dynamics is formulated in the terms of [jet manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_bundle "Jet bundle") ([covariant classical field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_classical_field_theory "Covariant classical field theory")).[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)#cite_note-25)

In [modern physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_physics "Modern physics"), the most often studied fields are those that model the four [fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_forces "Fundamental forces") which one day may lead to the [Unified Field Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Field_Theory "Unified Field Theory").

### Symmetries of fields

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_(physics)&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Symmetries of fields")]

A convenient way of classifying a field (classical or quantum) is by the [symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_physics "Symmetry in physics") it possesses. Physical symmetries are usually of two types:

#### Spacetime symmetries

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_(physics)&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Spacetime symmetries")]

Fields are often classified by their behaviour under transformations of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"). The terms used in this classification are:

*   [scalar fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field "Scalar field") (such as [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature")) whose values are given by a single variable at each point of space. This value does not change under transformations of space.
*   [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") (such as the magnitude and direction of the [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_(physics) "Force (physics)") at each point in a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field")) which are specified by attaching a vector to each point of space. The components of this vector transform between themselves [contravariantly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors") under rotations in space. Similarly, a dual (or co-) vector field attaches a dual vector to each point of space, and the components of each dual vector transform covariantly.
*   [tensor fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field "Tensor field"), (such as the [stress tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(physics) "Stress (physics)") of a crystal) specified by a tensor at each point of space. Under rotations in space, the components of the tensor transform in a more general way which depends on the number of covariant indices and contravariant indices.
*   [spinor fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor_field "Spinor field") (such as the [Dirac spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_spinor "Dirac spinor")) arise in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") to describe particles with [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)") which transform like vectors except for one of their components; in other words, when one rotates a vector field 360 degrees around a specific axis, the vector field turns to itself; however, spinors would turn to their negatives in the same case.

#### Internal symmetries

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_(physics)&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Internal symmetries")]

Fields may have internal symmetries in addition to spacetime symmetries. In many situations, one needs fields which are a list of spacetime scalars: (φ 1, φ 2, ... φ _N_). For example, in weather prediction these may be temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. In [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), the [color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge "Color charge") symmetry of the interaction of [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark") is an example of an internal symmetry, that of the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction"). Other examples are [isospin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isospin "Isospin"), [weak isospin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_isospin "Weak isospin"), [strangeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeness "Strangeness") and any other [flavour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavour_(particle_physics) "Flavour (particle physics)") symmetry.

If there is a symmetry of the problem, not involving spacetime, under which these components transform into each other, then this set of symmetries is called an _internal symmetry_. One may also make a classification of the charges of the fields under internal symmetries.

### Statistical field theory

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_(physics)&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Statistical field theory")]

Statistical field theory attempts to extend the field-theoretic [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm "Paradigm") toward many-body systems and [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"). As above, it can be approached by the usual infinite number of degrees of freedom argument.

Much like statistical mechanics has some overlap between quantum and classical mechanics, statistical field theory has links to both quantum and classical field theories, especially the former with which it shares many methods. One important example is [mean field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_field_theory "Mean field theory").

### Continuous random fields

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_(physics)&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Continuous random fields")]

Classical fields as above, such as the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field"), are usually infinitely differentiable functions, but they are in any case almost always twice differentiable. In contrast, [generalized functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_functions "Generalized functions") are not continuous. When dealing carefully with classical fields at finite temperature, the mathematical methods of continuous random fields are used, because [thermally fluctuating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_fluctuations "Thermal fluctuations") classical fields are [nowhere differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowhere_differentiable "Nowhere differentiable"). [Random fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_field "Random field") are indexed sets of [random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable "Random variable"); a continuous random field is a random field that has a set of functions as its index set. In particular, it is often mathematically convenient to take a continuous random field to have a [Schwartz space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartz_space "Schwartz space") of functions as its index set, in which case the continuous random field is a [tempered distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics) "Distribution (mathematics)").

We can think about a continuous random field, in a (very) rough way, as an ordinary function that is ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \pm \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c586ae37f8efec026b8a4ea3f6a5253576c2c4e6) almost everywhere, but such that when we take a [weighted average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_average "Weighted average") of all the [infinities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity") over any finite region, we get a finite result. The infinities are not well-defined; but the finite values can be associated with the functions used as the weight functions to get the finite values, and that can be well-defined. We can define a continuous random field well enough as a [linear map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map") from a space of functions into the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number").

The retarded potential formalism requires one to choose the [Lorenz gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_gauge "Lorenz gauge").
