His research fields include geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology , with a particular focus on mapping class groups of surfaces .

Education and career [ edit ] Margalit earned his bachelor's degree from Brown University .

[ 1 ] He earned his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 2003, advised by Benson Farb .  His thesis was titled Algebra versus Topology in Mapping Class Groups .

[ 2 ] Margalit was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Utah from 2003 to 2008.  He was a faculty member at Tufts University from 2008 to 2010, before going to the Georgia Institute of Technology.

[ 1 ] In 2023, Margalit moved to Vanderbilt University as chair of the Department of Mathematics.

[ 3 ] Margalit is known for his work in exposition of geometric group theory, particularly his book with Benson Farb , A Primer on Mapping Class Groups .

[ 4 ] Awards and honors [ edit ] Margalit became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2019; he was recognized "for contributions to low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory, exposition, and mentoring." [ 5 ] Margalit was a 2009 Sloan Research Fellow.

[ 6 ] For 2021 he received the Levi L. Conant Prize of the AMS.

[ 7 ] For 2024 he was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition.
