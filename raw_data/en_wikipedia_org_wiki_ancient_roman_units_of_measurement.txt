Length [ edit ] Roman milestone in modern Austria (AD 201), indicating a distance of 28 Roman miles (~41 km) to Teurnia The basic unit of Roman linear measurement was the pes (plural: pedes ) or Roman foot . Investigation of its relation to the English foot goes back at least to 1647, when John Greaves published his Discourse on the Romane foot . Greaves visited Rome in 1639, and measured, among other things, the foot measure on the tomb of Titus Statilius Aper, that on the statue of Cossutius formerly in the gardens of Angelo Colocci , the congius of Vespasian previously measured by Villalpandus , a number of brass measuring-rods found in the ruins of Rome, the paving-stones of the Pantheon and many other ancient Roman buildings, and the distance between the milestones on the Appian Way . He concluded that the Cossutian foot was the "true" Roman foot, and reported these values compared to the iron standard of the English foot in the Guildhall in London [ 1 ] Values of the ancient Roman foot determined by Greaves in 1639 Source Reported value in English feet Metric equivalent Foot on the statue of Cossutius 0.967 295 mm Foot on the monument of Statilius 0.972 296 mm Foot of Villalpandus , derived from Congius of Vespasian 0.986 301 mm William Smith (1851) gives a value of 0.9708 English feet, or about 295.9 mm.

[ 2 ] An accepted modern value is 296 mm.

[ 3 ] That foot is also called the pes monetalis to distinguish it from the pes Drusianus (about 333 or 335 mm) sometimes used in some provinces, particularly Germania Inferior .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The Roman foot was sub-divided either like the Greek pous into 16 digiti or fingers; or into 12 unciae or inches.

Frontinus writes in the 1st century AD that the digitus was used in Campania and most parts of Italy.

[ 6 ] The principal Roman units of length were: Ancient Roman units of length Roman unit English name Equal to Metric equivalent Imperial equivalent Notes digitus finger 1 ⁄ 16 pes 18.5 mm 0.728 in 0.0607 ft uncia pollex inch thumb 1 ⁄ 12 pes 24.6 mm 0.971 in 0.0809 ft palmus (minor) palm 1 ⁄ 4 pes 74 mm 0.243 ft palmus maior palm length ( lit.

[ 2 ] English and metric equivalents are approximate, converted at 1 pes = 0.9708 English feet and 296 mm respectively.

Other units include the schoenus (from the Greek for " rush rope") used for the distances in Isidore of Charax 's Parthian Stations (where it had a value around 5 km or 3 miles) [ 8 ] [ 9 ] and in the name of the Nubian land of Triacontaschoenus between the First and Second Cataracts on the Nile (where it had a value closer to 10.5 km or 6 + 1 ⁄ 2 miles).

Other units of area described by Columella in his De Re Rustica include the porca of 180 × 30 Roman feet (about 473 m 2 or 5,090 sq ft) used in Hispania Baetica and the Gallic candetum or cadetum of 100 feet [ clarification needed ] in the city or 150 in the country.

[ 12 ] Metric equivalents are approximate, converted at 1 pes = 296 mm.

Volume [ edit ] Both liquid and dry volume measurements were based on the sextarius . The sextarius was defined as 1 ⁄ 48 of a cubic pes (Roman foot), known as an amphora quadrantal . Using the value 296 mm (11.7 in) for the Roman foot, an amphora quadrantal can be computed at approximately 25.9 L (5.7 imp gal; 6.8 US gal), so a sextarius (by the same method) would theoretically measure 540.3 ml (19.02 imp fl oz; 18.27 US fl oz), which is about 95% of an imperial pint (568 ml).

Archaeologically, however, the evidence is not as precise. No two surviving vessels measure an identical volume, and scholarly opinion on the actual volume ranges between 500 and 580 ml (17–20 US fl oz).

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] The core volume units are: amphora quadrantal (Roman jar) – one cubic pes (Roman foot) congius – a half- pes cube (thus 1 ⁄ 8 amphora quadrantal ) sextarius – literally 1 ⁄ 6 of a congius Liquid measure [ edit ] Ancient Roman liquid measures Roman unit Equal to Metric Imperial US fluid ligula 1 ⁄ 288 congius 11.4 mL 0.401 fl oz 0.385 fl oz cyathus 1 ⁄ 72 congius 45 mL 1.58 fl oz 1.52 fl oz acetabulum 1 ⁄ 48 congius 68 mL 2.39 fl oz 2.30 fl oz quartarius 1 ⁄ 24 congius 136 mL 4.79 fl oz 4.61 fl oz hemina or cotyla 1 ⁄ 12 congius 273 mL 9.61 fl oz 9.23 fl oz sextarius 1 ⁄ 6 congius 546 mL 19.22 fl oz 0.961 pt 18.47 fl oz 1.153 pt congius 1 congius 3.27 L 5.75 pt 0.719 gal 3.46 qt 0.864 gal urna 4 congii 13.1 L 2.88 gal 3.46 gal amphora quadrantal 8 congii 26.2 L 5.76 gal 6.92 gal culeus 160 congii 524 L 115.3 gal 138.4 gal Except where noted, based on Smith (1851).

Weight [ edit ] A Roman steelyard weight of one dodrans , i.e.

3 ⁄ 4 libra The units of weight or mass were mostly based on factors of 12. Several of the unit names were also the names of coins during the Roman Republic and had the same fractional value of a larger base unit: libra for weight and as for coin. Modern estimates of the libra range from 322 to 329 g (11.4 to 11.6 oz) with 5076 grains or 328.9 g (11.60 oz) an accepted figure.

[ 3 ] [ 15 ] [ 17 ] The as was reduced from 12 ounces to 2 after the First Punic War , to 1 during the Second Punic War , and to half an ounce by the 131 BC Lex Papiria .

( November 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Years [ edit ] The complicated Roman calendar was replaced by the Julian calendar in 45 BC.

[ 27 ] In the Julian calendar, an ordinary year is 365 days long, and a leap year is 366 days long. Between 45 BC and AD 1, leap years occurred at irregular intervals. Starting in AD 4, leap years occurred regularly every four years. Year numbers were rarely used; rather, the year was specified by naming the Roman consuls for that year. (As consuls' terms latterly ran from January to December, this eventually caused January, rather than March, to be considered the start of the year.) When a year number was required, the Greek Olympiads were used, or the count of years since the founding of Rome, " ab urbe condita " in 753 BC. In the Middle Ages , the year numbering was changed to the Anno Domini count, based on the supposed birth year of Jesus .

The calendar used in most of the modern world, the Gregorian calendar , differs from the Julian calendar in that it skips three leap years every four centuries (i.e. 97 leap years in every 400) to more closely approximate the length of the tropical year .

Weeks [ edit ] The Romans grouped days into an eight-day cycle called the nundinae , with every eighth day being a market day.

Independent of the nundinae , astrologers kept a seven-day cycle called a hebdomas where each day corresponded to one of the seven classical planets , with the first day of the week being Saturn-day , followed by Sun-day , Moon-day , Mars-day , Mercury-day , Jupiter-day , and lastly Venus-day . Each astrological day was reckoned to begin at sunrise. The Jews also used a seven-day week, which began Saturday evening. The seventh day of the week they called Sabbath ; the other days they numbered rather than named, except for Friday, which could be called either the Parasceve or the sixth day. Each Jewish day begins at sunset.

Christians followed the Jewish seven-day week, except that they commonly called the first day of the week the Dominica , or the Lord's day . In 321, Constantine the Great gave his subjects every Sunday off, thus cementing the seven-day week into Roman civil society.

[ 28 ] Hours [ edit ] Main article: Roman timekeeping The Romans divided the daytime into twelve horae or hours starting at sunrise and ending at sunset. The night was divided into four watches. The duration of these hours varied with seasons; in the winter, when the daylight period was shorter, its 12 hours were correspondingly shorter and its four watches were correspondingly longer.

Astrologers divided the solar day into 24 equal hours, and these astrological hours became the basis for medieval clocks and our modern 24-hour mean solar day .

Although the division of hours into minutes and seconds did not occur until the Middle Ages, Classical astrologers had a minuta equal to 1 ⁄ 60 of a day (24 modern minutes), a secunda equal to 1 ⁄ 3600 of a day (24 modern seconds), and a tertia equal to 1 ⁄ 216,000 of a day (0.4 modern seconds).
