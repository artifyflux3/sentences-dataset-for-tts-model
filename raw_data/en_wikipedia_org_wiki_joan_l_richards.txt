[ 2 ] Education and career [ edit ] Richards graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1971. She completed a Ph.D. in the history of science at Harvard University in 1981.

[ 3 ] Her dissertation, Non-Euclidean Geometry In Nineteenth-century England: A Study of Changing Perceptions of Mathematical Truth , was supervised by I. Bernard Cohen .

[ 4 ] After postdoctoral research at Cornell University , she joined the Brown University faculty in 1982, and was promoted to full professor in 2001.

[ 3 ] Books [ edit ] Richards is the author of the monograph Mathematical Visions: The Pursuit of Geometry in Victorian England (Academic Press, 1988) [ 5 ] and of a memoir on her struggle to balance her academic work with caring for a son with a brain tumor, Angles of Reflection: Logic and a Mother's Love (W. H. Freeman, 2000).

[ 6 ] She is the co-editor of The Invention of Physical Science: Intersections of Mathematics, Theology and Natural Philosophy since the Seventeenth Century, Essays in Honor of Erwin N. Hiebert (with Mary Jo Nye and Roger H. Stuewer , Kluwer, 1992).
