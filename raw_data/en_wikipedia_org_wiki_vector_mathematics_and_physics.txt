In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), **vector** is a term that refers to [quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity") that cannot be expressed by a single number (a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)")), or to elements of some [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space").

Historically, vectors were introduced in [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") and physics (typically in [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics")) for quantities that have both a magnitude and a direction, such as [displacements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(geometry) "Displacement (geometry)"), [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") and [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"). Such quantities are represented by [geometric vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_vector "Geometric vector") in the same way as [distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance"), [masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") and [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") are represented by [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number").

The term _vector_ is also used, in some contexts, for [tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple"), which are [finite sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_sequence "Finite sequence") (of numbers or other objects) of a fixed length.

Both geometric vectors and tuples can be added and scaled, and these vector operations led to the concept of a vector space, which is a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") equipped with a [vector addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition "Vector addition") and a [scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication") that satisfy some [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") generalizing the main properties of operations on the above sorts of vectors. A vector space formed by geometric vectors is called a [Euclidean vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector_space "Euclidean vector space"), and a vector space formed by tuples is called a [coordinate vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector_space "Coordinate vector space").

Many vector spaces are considered in mathematics, such as [extension fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_field "Extension field"), [polynomial rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring "Polynomial ring"), [algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field "Algebra over a field") and [function spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space"). The term _vector_ is generally not used for elements of these vector spaces, and is generally reserved for geometric vectors, tuples, and elements of unspecified vector spaces (for example, when discussing general properties of vector spaces).

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Vector_from_A_to_B.svg/250px-Vector_from_A_to_B.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vector_from_A_to_B.svg)

A vector ![Image 2: {\textstyle {\stackrel {\rightarrow }{a}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f4f4ea0d3b10bf904d7b9ef1c5ae6d8250052b82) pointing from point _A_ to point _B_

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") or simply a vector (sometimes called a geometric vector[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-1) or spatial vector[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-2)) is a geometric object that has [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)") (or [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm "Euclidean norm")) and [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_(geometry) "Direction (geometry)"). Euclidean vectors can be added and scaled to form a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"). A _[vector quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector\_quantity "Vector quantity")_ is a vector-valued [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity"), including [units of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement "Units of measurement") and possibly a [support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_(mathematics) "Support (mathematics)"), formulated as a _[directed line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed\_line\_segment "Directed line segment")_. A vector is frequently depicted graphically as an arrow connecting an _initial point_ _A_ with a _terminal point_ _B_,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-3) and denoted by ![Image 3: {\textstyle {\stackrel {\longrightarrow }{AB}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1685a314ff2cd5e06977ddfa3475af7e0f8da120)

A vector is what is needed to "carry" the point _A_ to the point _B_; the Latin word _vector_ means 'carrier'.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-4) It was first used by 18th century [astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomers "Astronomers") investigating planetary revolution around the Sun.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-5) The magnitude of the vector is the distance between the two points, and the direction refers to the direction of [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(geometry) "Displacement (geometry)") from _A_ to _B_. Many [algebraic operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_operation "Algebraic operation") on [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") such as [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition"), [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction"), [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"), and [negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_inverse "Additive inverse") have close analogues for vectors,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Euclidean_vector_:1-6) operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of [commutativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutativity "Commutativity"), [associativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associativity "Associativity"), and [distributivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributivity "Distributivity"). These operations and associated laws qualify [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") vectors as an example of the more generalized concept of vectors defined simply as elements of a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space").

Vectors play an important role in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"): the [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") and [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") of a moving object and the [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") acting on it can all be described with vectors.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Euclidean_vector_:2-7) Many other physical quantities can be usefully thought of as vectors. Although most of them do not represent distances (except, for example, [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(vector) "Position (vector)") or [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)")), their magnitude and direction can still be represented by the length and direction of an arrow. The mathematical representation of a physical vector depends on the [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") used to describe it. Other vector-like objects that describe [physical quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities "Physical quantities") and transform in a similar way under changes of the coordinate system include [pseudovectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector "Pseudovector") and [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-8)

In the [natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sciences "Natural sciences"), a [vector quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_quantity "Vector quantity") (also known as a vector physical quantity, physical vector, or simply vector) is a vector-valued [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_a306-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_o531-10) It is typically formulated as the product of a _[unit of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit\_of\_measurement "Unit of measurement")_ and a _vector [numerical value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical\_value "Numerical value")_ ([unitless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitless "Unitless")), often a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") with [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_norm "Vector norm") and [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_(geometry) "Direction (geometry)"). For example, a [position vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_vector "Position vector") in [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space") may be expressed as [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_dimensional "Three dimensional")[Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") with [SI unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_unit "SI unit") of [meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meters "Meters").

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), particularly in [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), a physical vector may be endowed with additional structure compared to a geometrical vector.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_m813-11) A bound vector is defined as the combination of an ordinary vector quantity and a _[point of application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point\_of\_application "Point of application")_ or _point of action_.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_a306-9)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_Teodorescu-12) Bound vector quantities are formulated as a _[directed line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed\_line\_segment "Directed line segment")_, with a definite initial point besides the magnitude and direction of the main vector.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_a306-9)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_m813-11) For example, a [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") on the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") has two Cartesian components in SI unit of [newtons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtons "Newtons") and an accompanying two-dimensional position vector in meters, for a total of four numbers on the plane (and six in space).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_p822-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_z733-14)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_Teodorescu-12) A simpler example of a bound vector is the [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") vector from an initial point to an end point; in this case, the bound vector is an [ordered pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair") of points in the same position space, with all coordinates having the same [quantity dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_dimension "Quantity dimension") and unit (length an meters).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_p422-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_w531-16) A sliding vector is the combination of an ordinary vector quantity and a _[line of application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line\_of\_application "Line of application")_ or _line of action_, over which the vector quantity can be translated (without rotations). A free vector is a vector quantity having an undefined [support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_(mathematics) "Support (mathematics)") or region of application; it can be freely translated with no consequences; a [displacement vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_vector "Displacement vector") is a prototypical example of free vector.

Aside from the notion of units and support, physical vector quantities may also differ from Euclidean vectors in terms of [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_metric "Distance metric"). For example, an event in [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") may be represented as a [position four-vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_four-vector "Position four-vector"), with [coherent derived unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_derived_unit "Coherent derived unit") of meters: it includes a position Euclidean vector and a [timelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timelike "Timelike") component, _t_ ⋅ _c_ 0 (involving the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light")). In that case, the [Minkowski metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_metric "Minkowski metric") is adopted instead of the [Euclidean metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_metric "Euclidean metric").

Vector quantities are a generalization of [scalar quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_quantity "Scalar quantity") and can be further generalized as [tensor quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_quantity "Tensor quantity").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)#cite_note-Vector_quantity_w531-16) Individual vectors may be ordered in a [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") over time (a [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series "Time series")), such as position vectors [discretizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretizing "Discretizing") a [trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory"). A vector may also result from the [evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_evaluation "Function evaluation"), at a particular instant, of a continuous [vector-valued function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector-valued_function "Vector-valued function") (e.g., the [pendulum equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_equation "Pendulum equation")). In the natural sciences, the term "vector quantity" also encompasses _[vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector\_field "Vector field")_ defined over a [two-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional "Two-dimensional") or three-dimensional [region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_(mathematics) "Region (mathematics)") of space, such as [wind velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_velocity "Wind velocity") over Earth's surface.

[Pseudo vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_vector "Pseudo vector") and [bivectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector "Bivector") are also admitted as physical vector quantities.

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Vector_add_scale.svg/250px-Vector_add_scale.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vector_add_scale.svg)

Vector addition and scalar multiplication: a vector v (blue) is added to another vector  w (red, upper illustration). Below,  w is stretched by a factor of 2, yielding the sum v + 2w.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") (also called a linear space) is a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") whose elements, often called _vectors_, can be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers called [_scalars_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)"). The operations of vector addition and [scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication") must satisfy certain requirements, called _vector [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom")_. Real vector spaces and complex vector spaces are kinds of vector spaces based on different kinds of scalars: [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers "Real numbers") and [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers"). Scalars can also be, more generally, elements of any [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)").

Vector spaces generalize [Euclidean vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector"), which allow modeling of [physical quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity") (such as [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") and [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity")) that have not only a [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)"), but also a [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)"). The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), together with the concept of [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"), which allows computing in vector spaces. This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating and studying [systems of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_linear_equations "Systems of linear equations").

Vector spaces are characterized by their [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space) "Dimension (vector space)"), which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. This means that, for two vector spaces over a given field and with the same dimension, the properties that depend only on the vector-space structure are exactly the same (technically the vector spaces are [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic "Isomorphic")). A vector space is _finite-dimensional_ if its dimension is a [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"). Otherwise, it is _infinite-dimensional_, and its dimension is an [infinite cardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number "Transfinite number"). Finite-dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") and related areas. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics. For example, [polynomial rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring "Polynomial ring") are [countably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countably_infinite "Countably infinite") infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and many [function spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space") have the [cardinality of the continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_of_the_continuum "Cardinality of the continuum") as a dimension.

Many vector spaces that are considered in mathematics are also endowed with other [structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure "Mathematical structure"). This is the case of [algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field "Algebra over a field"), which include [field extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_extension "Field extension"), polynomial rings, [associative algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_algebra "Associative algebra") and [Lie algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra"). This is also the case of [topological vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space "Topological vector space"), which include function spaces, [inner product spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space"), [normed spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space "Normed vector space"), [Hilbert spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space") and [Banach spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space "Banach space").

Every [algebra over a field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field "Algebra over a field") is a vector space, but elements of an algebra are generally not called vectors. However, in some cases, they are called _vectors_, mainly due to historical reasons.

*   [Vector quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_quaternion "Vector quaternion"), a [quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") with a zero real part
*   [Multivector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivector "Multivector") or [_p_-vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-vector "P-vector"), an element of the [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra") of a vector space.
*   [Spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor "Spinor"), also called _spin vectors_, have been introduced for extending the notion of [rotation vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_vector "Rotation vector"). In fact, rotation vectors represent well rotations _locally_, but not globally, because a [closed loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_curve "Closed curve") in the space of rotation vectors may induce a curve in the space of rotations that is not a loop. Also, the [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") of rotation vectors is [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientable_manifold "Orientable manifold"), while the manifold of rotations is not. Spinors are elements of a vector subspace of some [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra").
*   [Witt vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witt_vector "Witt vector"), an infinite sequence of elements of a commutative ring, which belongs to an [algebra over this ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_ring "Algebra over a ring"), and has been introduced for handling [carry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(arithmetic) "Carry (arithmetic)") propagation in the operations on [p-adic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number "P-adic number").

Data represented by vectors
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Data represented by vectors")]

The set ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) of [tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") of n real numbers has a natural structure of vector space defined by component-wise addition and [scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication"). It is common to call these tuples _vectors_, even in contexts where vector-space operations do not apply. More generally, when some data can be represented naturally by vectors, they are often called _vectors_ even when addition and scalar multiplication of vectors are not valid operations on these data.[_[disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed\_statement "Wikipedia:Disputed statement") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vector\_(mathematics\_and\_physics)#Tuples\_that\_aren%E2%80%99t\_really\_vectors? "Talk:Vector (mathematics and physics)")_] Here are some examples.

*   [Rotation vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_vector "Rotation vector"), a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") whose direction is that of the axis of a [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry) "Rotation (geometry)") and magnitude is the angle of the rotation.

However, a _random vector_ may also refer to a [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable "Random variable") that takes its values in a vector space.
*   [Logical vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_matrix#Logical_vectors "Logical matrix"), a vector of 0s and 1s ([Booleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type "Boolean data type")).

Vectors in calculus
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Vectors in calculus")]

[Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") serves as a foundational mathematical tool in the realm of vectors, offering a framework for the analysis and manipulation of vector quantities in diverse scientific disciplines, notably [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"). Vector-valued functions, where the output is a vector, are scrutinized using calculus to derive essential insights into motion within three-dimensional space. Vector calculus extends traditional calculus principles to vector fields, introducing operations like [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient"), [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence"), and [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics) "Curl (mathematics)"), which find applications in physics and engineering contexts. [Line integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral"), crucial for calculating work along a path within force fields, and [surface integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_integral "Surface integral"), employed to determine quantities like [flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux "Flux"), illustrate the practical utility of calculus in vector analysis. [Volume integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_integral "Volume integral"), essential for computations involving scalar or vector fields over three-dimensional regions, contribute to understanding [mass distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_distribution "Mass distribution"), [charge density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_density "Charge density"), and fluid flow rates.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
