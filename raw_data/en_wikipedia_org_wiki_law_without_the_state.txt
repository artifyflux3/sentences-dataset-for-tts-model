Such law may be established in several ways: It may emerge in systems such as existed in feudal Europe prior to the emergence of the modern nation state with the treaty of Westphalia .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It can be established as customary law such as that practiced by indigenous communities.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Non-state actors may create it, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] for instance in the form of " soft law ".

According to various theories of anarchist law , it could result from how a society would organize itself without formal government.
