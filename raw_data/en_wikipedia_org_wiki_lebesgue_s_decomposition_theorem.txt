Definition [ edit ] The theorem states that if ( Ω Ω , Σ Σ ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,\Sigma )} is a measurable space and μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } and ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } are σ-finite signed measures on Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } , then there exist two uniquely determined σ-finite signed measures ν ν 0 {\displaystyle \nu _{0}} and ν ν 1 {\displaystyle \nu _{1}} such that: [ 2 ] [ 3 ] ν ν = ν ν 0 + ν ν 1 {\displaystyle \nu =\nu _{0}+\nu _{1}\,} ν ν 0 ≪ ≪ μ μ {\displaystyle \nu _{0}\ll \mu } (that is, ν ν 0 {\displaystyle \nu _{0}} is absolutely continuous with respect to μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } ) ν ν 1 ⊥ ⊥ μ μ {\displaystyle \nu _{1}\perp \mu } (that is, ν ν 1 {\displaystyle \nu _{1}} and μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } are singular ).

Refinement [ edit ] Lebesgue's decomposition theorem can be refined in a number of ways. First, as the Lebesgue–Radon–Nikodym theorem . That is, let ( Ω Ω , Σ Σ ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,\Sigma )} be a measure space, μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } a σ-finite positive measure on Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } and λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } a complex measure on Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } .

[ 4 ] There is a unique pair of complex measures on Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } such that λ λ = λ λ a + λ λ s , λ λ a ≪ ≪ μ μ , λ λ s ⊥ ⊥ μ μ .

{\displaystyle \lambda =\lambda _{a}+\lambda _{s},\quad \lambda _{a}\ll \mu ,\quad \lambda _{s}\perp \mu .} If λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is positive and finite, then so are λ λ a {\displaystyle \lambda _{a}} and λ λ s {\displaystyle \lambda _{s}} .

There is a unique h ∈ ∈ L 1 ( μ μ ) {\displaystyle h\in L^{1}(\mu )} such that λ λ a ( E ) = ∫ ∫ E h d μ μ , ∀ ∀ E ∈ ∈ Σ Σ .

{\displaystyle \lambda _{a}(E)=\int _{E}hd\mu ,\quad \forall E\in \Sigma .} The first assertion follows from the Lebesgue decomposition, the second is known as the Radon–Nikodym theorem . That is, the function h {\displaystyle h} is a Radon–Nikodym derivative that can be expressed as h = d λ λ a d μ μ .

{\displaystyle h={\frac {d\lambda _{a}}{d\mu }}.} An alternative refinement is that of the decomposition of a regular Borel measure [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] ν ν = ν ν a c + ν ν s c + ν ν p p , {\displaystyle \nu =\nu _{ac}+\nu _{sc}+\nu _{pp},} where ν ν a c ≪ ≪ μ μ {\displaystyle \nu _{ac}\ll \mu } is the absolutely continuous part ν ν s c ⊥ ⊥ μ μ {\displaystyle \nu _{sc}\perp \mu } is the singular continuous part ν ν p p {\displaystyle \nu _{pp}} is the pure point part (a discrete measure ).

The absolutely continuous measures are classified by the Radon–Nikodym theorem , and discrete measures are easily understood. Hence (singular continuous measures aside), Lebesgue decomposition gives a very explicit description of measures.  The Cantor measure (the probability measure on the real line whose cumulative distribution function is the Cantor function ) is an example of a singular continuous measure.

Related concepts [ edit ] Lévy–Itō decomposition [ edit ] Main article: Lévy–Itō decomposition The analogous [ citation needed ] decomposition for a stochastic processes is the Lévy–Itō decomposition : given a Lévy process X, it can be decomposed as a sum of three independent Lévy processes X = X ( 1 ) + X ( 2 ) + X ( 3 ) {\displaystyle X=X^{(1)}+X^{(2)}+X^{(3)}} where: X ( 1 ) {\displaystyle X^{(1)}} is a Brownian motion with drift, corresponding to the absolutely continuous part; X ( 2 ) {\displaystyle X^{(2)}} is a compound Poisson process , corresponding to the pure point part; X ( 3 ) {\displaystyle X^{(3)}} is a square integrable pure jump martingale that almost surely has a countable number of jumps on a finite interval, corresponding to the singular continuous part.
