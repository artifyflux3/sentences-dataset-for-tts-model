Classical mechanics
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Branches_of_physics&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Classical mechanics")]

Classical mechanics is a model of the [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") of [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") acting upon bodies; includes sub-fields to describe the behaviors of [solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solids "Solids"), [gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gases "Gases"), and [fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluids "Fluids"). It is often referred to as "Newtonian mechanics" after [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and his [laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion"). It also includes the classical approach as given by [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") and [Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") methods. It deals with the motion of particles and the general system of particles.

There are many branches of classical mechanics, such as: [statics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics "Statics"), [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics) "Dynamics (mechanics)"), [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics"), [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics") (which includes [fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics "Fluid mechanics")), [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"), etc.

*   Mechanics: A branch of physics in which we study the object and properties of an object in form of a motion under the action of the force.

Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Branches_of_physics&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics")]

The first chapter of _[The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Feynman\_Lectures\_on\_Physics "The Feynman Lectures on Physics")_ is about the [existence of atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory#Philosophical_atomism "Atomic theory"), which Feynman considered to be the most compact statement of physics, from which science could easily result even if all other knowledge was lost.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_physics#cite_note-1) By modeling matter as collections of hard spheres, it is possible to describe the [kinetic theory of gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases "Kinetic theory of gases"), upon which classical thermodynamics is based.

Thermodynamics studies the effects of changes in [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"), [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure"), and [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") on [physical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system "Physical system") on the [macroscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic "Macroscopic") scale, and the transfer of energy as [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_physics#cite_note-Perot-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_physics#cite_note-3) Historically, thermodynamics developed out of the desire to increase the [efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_efficiency "Thermodynamic efficiency") of early [steam engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_physics#cite_note-4)

The starting point for most thermodynamic considerations is the [laws of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics "Laws of thermodynamics"), which postulate that [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") can be exchanged between physical systems as heat or [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_work "Mechanical work").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_physics#cite_note-5) They also postulate the existence of a quantity named [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy"), which can be defined for any system.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_physics#cite_note-6) In thermodynamics, interactions between large ensembles of objects are studied and categorized. Central to this are the concepts of [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_(thermodynamics) "System (thermodynamics)") and [surroundings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surroundings_(thermodynamics) "Surroundings (thermodynamics)"). A system is composed of particles, whose average motions define its properties, which in turn are related to one another through [equations of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state "Equation of state"). Properties can be combined to express [internal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_energy "Internal energy") and [thermodynamic potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_potential "Thermodynamic potential"), which are useful for determining conditions for [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_equilibrium "Dynamic equilibrium") and [spontaneous processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_process "Spontaneous process").

Electromagnetism and photonics
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Branches_of_physics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Electromagnetism and photonics")]

The study of the behaviours of electrons, electric media, magnets, magnetic fields, and general interactions of light.

The special theory of relativity enjoys a relationship with electromagnetism and mechanics; that is, the [principle of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity "Principle of relativity") and the [principle of stationary action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_stationary_action "Principle of stationary action") in mechanics can be used to derive [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_physics#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_physics#cite_note-8) and _vice versa_.

The theory of special relativity was proposed in 1905 by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") in his article "[On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers#Special_relativity "Annus Mirabilis papers")". The title of the article refers to the fact that special relativity resolves an inconsistency between [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") and classical mechanics. The theory is based on [two postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulates_of_special_relativity "Postulates of special relativity"): (1) that the mathematical forms of the [laws of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law") are invariant in all [inertial systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference"); and (2) that the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") in [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum") is constant and independent of the source or observer. Reconciling the two postulates requires a unification of [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics "Time in physics") into the frame-dependent concept of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime").

General relativity is the [geometrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical "Geometrical") theory of [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") published by Albert Einstein in 1915/16.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_physics#cite_note-Ein1915-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_physics#cite_note-Ein1916-10) It unifies special relativity, [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"), and the insight that gravitation can be described by the [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature") of space and time. In general relativity, the curvature of spacetime is produced by the [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") of matter and radiation.

Quantum mechanics, atomic physics, and molecular physics
--------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Branches_of_physics&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Quantum mechanics, atomic physics, and molecular physics")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/HAtomOrbitals.png/250px-HAtomOrbitals.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HAtomOrbitals.png)

The first few [hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom "Hydrogen atom")[electron orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration "Electron configuration") shown as cross-sections with colour-coded [probability density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude "Probability amplitude")

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/SchrodingerEquation.svg/250px-SchrodingerEquation.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SchrodingerEquation.svg)

[Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation") of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics")

[Quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") is the branch of physics treating [atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") and [subatomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle "Subatomic particle") systems and their interaction based on the observation that all forms of energy are released in discrete units or bundles called "[quanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum")". Remarkably, quantum theory typically permits only [probable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") or [statistical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") calculation of the observed features of subatomic particles, understood in terms of [wave functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function "Wave function"). The [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation") plays the role in quantum mechanics that [Newton's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") and [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy") serve in classical mechanics—i.e., it predicts the future behavior of a [dynamic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system")—and is a [wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation "Wave equation") that is used to solve for wavefunctions.

For example, the light, or electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by an atom has only certain [frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequencies "Frequencies") (or [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength")), as can be seen from the [line spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum "Emission spectrum") associated with the chemical element represented by that atom. The quantum theory shows that those frequencies correspond to definite energies of the light quanta, or [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), and result from the fact that the [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") of the atom can have only certain allowed energy values, or levels; when an electron changes from one allowed level to another, a quantum of energy is emitted or absorbed whose frequency is directly proportional to the energy difference between the two levels. The [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect") further confirmed the quantization of light.

In 1924, [Louis de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie "Louis de Broglie") proposed that not only do light waves sometimes exhibit particle-like properties, but particles may also exhibit wave-like properties. Two different formulations of quantum mechanics were presented following de Broglie's suggestion. The [wave mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave") of [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger") (1926) involves the use of a mathematical entity, the wave function, which is related to the probability of finding a particle at a given point in space. The [matrix mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_mechanics "Matrix mechanics") of [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg") (1925) makes no mention of wave functions or similar concepts but was shown to be mathematically equivalent to Schrödinger's theory. A particularly important discovery of the quantum theory is the [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle"), enunciated by Heisenberg in 1927, which places an absolute theoretical limit on the accuracy of certain measurements; as a result, the assumption by earlier scientists that the physical state of a system could be measured exactly and used to predict future states had to be abandoned. Quantum mechanics was combined with the theory of relativity in the formulation of [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac"). Other developments include [quantum statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_statistics "Quantum statistics"), [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics"), concerned with interactions between charged particles and electromagnetic fields; and its generalization, [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory").

**String Theory**

A possible candidate for the theory of everything, this theory combines the theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics to make a single theory. This theory can predict about properties of both small and big objects. This theory is currently under the developmental stage.

Optics and acoustics
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Branches_of_physics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Optics and acoustics")]

[Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics") is the study of light motions including reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference.

[Acoustics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics "Acoustics") is the branch of physics involving the study of mechanical waves in different mediums.

Condensed matter physics
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Branches_of_physics&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Condensed matter physics")]

The study of the physical properties of matter in a condensed phase.

High-energy particle physics and nuclear physics
------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Branches_of_physics&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: High-energy particle physics and nuclear physics")]

[Particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics") studies the nature of particles, while [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics") studies the [atomic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nuclei "Atomic nuclei").

Chaos theory represents a multidisciplinary area of study that encompasses both scientific inquiry and mathematics. It examines the essential models and deterministic principles governing dynamical systems that exhibit extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Previously, these systems were believed to exist in a state of complete randomness and disorder. However, chaos theory posits that beneath the surface of apparent randomness in chaotic complex systems lie underlying patterns, interconnections, continuous feedback mechanisms, repetitions, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. The butterfly effect, a fundamental concept in chaos theory, illustrates how a minor alteration in one aspect of a nonlinear system can result in significant variations later on, highlighting a fragile dependence on initial circumstances. This phenomenon is often illustrated by the metaphor that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil could potentially influence or avert a tornado in Texas by altering the conditions in its environment.

[Cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") studies how the universe came to be, and its eventual fate. It is studied by [physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicists "Physicists") and [astrophysicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysicists "Astrophysicists"). It also studies about fictional universes people made, how the universes came to be, and their eventual fate and destruction.
