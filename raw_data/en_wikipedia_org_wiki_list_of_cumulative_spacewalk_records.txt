Backdropped by a colorful Earth, astronaut Robert L. Curbeam , Jr. (left) and European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Christer Fuglesang , both STS-116 mission specialists, participate in an EVA.

This is a list of cumulative spacewalk records for the 30 astronauts who have the most extra-vehicular activity (EVA) time.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The record is currently held by Anatoly Solovyev of the Russian Federal Space Agency , with 82:22 hours from 16 EVAs, followed by NASA 's Michael Lopez-Alegria with 67:40 hours in 10 EVAs. This list is current as of August 9, 2023.

[ 3 ] [ 1 ] [ 4 ] The RSA designation includes spacewalks under the earlier Soviet space program .
