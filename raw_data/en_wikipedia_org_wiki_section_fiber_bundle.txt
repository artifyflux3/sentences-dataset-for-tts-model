A section σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } allows the base space B {\displaystyle B} to be identified with a subspace σ σ ( B ) {\displaystyle \sigma (B)} of E {\displaystyle E} .

A vector field on R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} . A section of a tangent vector bundle is a vector field.

A vector bundle E {\displaystyle E} over a base M {\displaystyle M} with section s {\displaystyle s} .

In the mathematical field of topology , a section (or cross section ) [ 1 ] of a fiber bundle E {\displaystyle E} is a continuous right inverse of the projection function π π {\displaystyle \pi } . In other words, if E {\displaystyle E} is a fiber bundle over a base space , B {\displaystyle B} : π π : : E → → B {\displaystyle \pi \colon E\to B} then a section of that fiber bundle is a continuous map , σ σ : : B → → E {\displaystyle \sigma \colon B\to E} such that π π ( σ σ ( x ) ) = x {\displaystyle \pi (\sigma (x))=x} for all x ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle x\in B} .

A section is an abstract characterization of what it means to be a graph . The graph of a function g : : B → → Y {\displaystyle g\colon B\to Y} can be identified with a function taking its values in the Cartesian product E = B × × Y {\displaystyle E=B\times Y} , of B {\displaystyle B} and Y {\displaystyle Y} : σ σ : : B → → E , σ σ ( x ) = ( x , g ( x ) ) ∈ ∈ E .

{\displaystyle \sigma \colon B\to E,\quad \sigma (x)=(x,g(x))\in E.} Let π π : : E → → B {\displaystyle \pi \colon E\to B} be the projection onto the first factor: π π ( x , y ) = x {\displaystyle \pi (x,y)=x} .  Then a graph is any function σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } for which π π ( σ σ ( x ) ) = x {\displaystyle \pi (\sigma (x))=x} .

The language of fibre bundles allows this notion of a section to be generalized to the case when E {\displaystyle E} is not necessarily a Cartesian product.  If π π : : E → → B {\displaystyle \pi \colon E\to B} is a fibre bundle, then a section is a choice of point σ σ ( x ) {\displaystyle \sigma (x)} in each of the fibres.  The condition π π ( σ σ ( x ) ) = x {\displaystyle \pi (\sigma (x))=x} simply means that the section at a point x {\displaystyle x} must lie over x {\displaystyle x} .  (See image.) For example, when E {\displaystyle E} is a vector bundle a section of E {\displaystyle E} is an element of the vector space E x {\displaystyle E_{x}} lying over each point x ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle x\in B} . In particular, a vector field on a smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} is a choice of tangent vector at each point of M {\displaystyle M} : this is a section of the tangent bundle of M {\displaystyle M} . Likewise, a 1-form on M {\displaystyle M} is a section of the cotangent bundle .

Sections, particularly of principal bundles and vector bundles, are also very important tools in differential geometry . In this setting, the base space B {\displaystyle B} is a smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} , and E {\displaystyle E} is assumed to be a smooth fiber bundle over M {\displaystyle M} (i.e., E {\displaystyle E} is a smooth manifold and π π : : E → → M {\displaystyle \pi \colon E\to M} is a smooth map ). In this case, one considers the space of smooth sections of E {\displaystyle E} over an open set U {\displaystyle U} , denoted C ∞ ∞ ( U , E ) {\displaystyle C^{\infty }(U,E)} . It is also useful in geometric analysis to consider spaces of sections with intermediate regularity (e.g., C k {\displaystyle C^{k}} sections, or sections with regularity in the sense of Hölder conditions or Sobolev spaces ).

Local and global sections [ edit ] Fiber bundles do not in general have such global sections (consider, for example, the fiber bundle over S 1 {\displaystyle S^{1}} with fiber F = R ∖ ∖ { 0 } {\displaystyle F=\mathbb {R} \setminus \{0\}} obtained by taking the Möbius bundle and removing the zero section), so it is also useful to define sections only locally. A local section of a fiber bundle is a continuous map s : : U → → E {\displaystyle s\colon U\to E} where U {\displaystyle U} is an open set in B {\displaystyle B} and π π ( s ( x ) ) = x {\displaystyle \pi (s(x))=x} for all x {\displaystyle x} in U {\displaystyle U} . If ( U , φ φ ) {\displaystyle (U,\varphi )} is a local trivialization of E {\displaystyle E} , where φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is a homeomorphism from π π − − 1 ( U ) {\displaystyle \pi ^{-1}(U)} to U × × F {\displaystyle U\times F} (where F {\displaystyle F} is the fiber ), then local sections always exist over U {\displaystyle U} in bijective correspondence with continuous maps from U {\displaystyle U} to F {\displaystyle F} . The (local) sections form a sheaf over B {\displaystyle B} called the sheaf of sections of E {\displaystyle E} .

The space of continuous sections of a fiber bundle E {\displaystyle E} over U {\displaystyle U} is sometimes denoted C ( U , E ) {\displaystyle C(U,E)} , while the space of global sections of E {\displaystyle E} is often denoted Γ Γ ( E ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (E)} or Γ Γ ( B , E ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (B,E)} .

Extending to global sections [ edit ] Sections are studied in homotopy theory and algebraic topology , where one of the main goals is to account for the existence or non-existence of global sections . An obstruction denies the existence of global sections since the space is too "twisted". More precisely, obstructions "obstruct" the possibility of extending a local section to a global section due to the space's "twistedness". Obstructions are indicated by particular characteristic classes , which are cohomological classes. For example, a principal bundle has a global section if and only if it is trivial . On the other hand, a vector bundle always has a global section, namely the zero section . However, it only admits a nowhere vanishing section if its Euler class is zero.

Generalizations [ edit ] Obstructions to extending local sections may be generalized in the following manner: take a topological space and form a category whose objects are open subsets, and morphisms are inclusions. Thus we use a category to generalize a topological space. We generalize the notion of a "local section" using sheaves of abelian groups , which assigns to each object an abelian group (analogous to local sections).

There is an important distinction here: intuitively, local sections are like "vector fields" on an open subset of a topological space. So at each point, an element of a fixed vector space is assigned. However, sheaves can "continuously change" the vector space (or more generally abelian group).

This entire process is really the global section functor , which assigns to each sheaf its global section. Then sheaf cohomology enables us to consider a similar extension problem while "continuously varying" the abelian group. The theory of characteristic classes generalizes the idea of obstructions to our extensions.
