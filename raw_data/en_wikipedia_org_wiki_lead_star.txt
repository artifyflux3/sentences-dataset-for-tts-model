[ 1 ] Many of theses lead stars have more lead in them than all other elements heavier than iron . The amount of lead in each of these stars is roughly the mass of the Moon .

[ 2 ] This type of star confirms predictions about the abundances of elements above iron in AGB stars.

[ 3 ] It is theorised that lead is produced in AGB stars by the s-process , capture of neutrons to produce progressively-heavier elements.  The neutrons in AGB stars are produced primarily by the collision of carbon and helium nuclei, producing an oxygen nucleus and a neutron.  The process is slow, with decades passing between the capture of each neutron in a nucleus, but in low- metallicity stars, the neutrons are all captured by the relatively few high-mass nuclei in their atmospheres.  This leads to most heavy elements being converted to the highest stable mass, which is generally lead; as more lead is produced, the other heavy elements become depleted.

[ 2 ] There have been several stars that have been confirmed to be lead stars. Among them are HD 187861 , HD 196944 and HD 224959 .

[ 3 ] In one study, nine stars were detected with high lead abundances and most of them were carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars (CEMP stars).

[ 4 ] There was also the discovery of two hot subdwarf stars named HE 2359−2844 and HE 1256−2738 . Both of theses stars had lead abundances nearly 10,000 times that of the Sun in their atmospheres.
