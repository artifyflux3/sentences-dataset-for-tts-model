The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) opened Haverford Station in 1880 on their Main Line west out of Broad Street Station (now Suburban Station ) in Philadelphia . Haverford sits at milepost 9.17.

Haverford borders the unincorporated portion of Haverford Township called Havertown , as well as the unincorporated communities of Bryn Mawr , Gladwyne , Ardmore , Wynnewood , and a small portion of Broomall .

The Haverford neighborhood name was borrowed from the older entity, Haverford Township (established 1681) to which much of the unincorporated community belongs, as the result of a postal code address change in 1946.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Haverford Township's namesake is in turn derived from the name of the town of Haverfordwest in Wales, UK.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Today, Haverford is most notable for being the site of Haverford College and one of the United States' oldest country clubs, the Merion Cricket Club .

Major roads in Haverford include Lancaster Avenue ( US 30 / Lincoln Highway ), Montgomery Avenue, Haverford Road, and I-476 (Blue Route).
