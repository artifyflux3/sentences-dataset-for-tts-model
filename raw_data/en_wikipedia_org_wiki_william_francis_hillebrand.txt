Biography [ edit ] He was the son of the renowned botanist William Hillebrand .
He studied at Cornell University [ 1 ] and then in Germany at the University of Heidelberg where he received his Ph.D. in 1875. He then worked with Robert Bunsen for two semesters. His research on metallic cerium , which he together with Thomas Norton obtained first in 1872, started his academic career.

He studied organic chemistry for three semesters with Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig at the University of Strasbourg , but changed to geochemistry and metallurgy by studying at the Freiberg Mining Academy . After returning home to the United States in 1878, he opened an assay office in Leadville, Colorado , in 1879, and then started working as a chemist at the United States Geological Survey in 1880. That year he was sent to Denver to establish a chemical laboratory for the Rocky Mountain Division of the Survey. For five years he remained in charge of this laboratory, and then was transferred to the chief laboratory in Washington.

[ 2 ] He changed to the National Bureau of Standards in 1909 where he was chief chemist.

[ 1 ] He was professor of general chemistry and physics at the National College of Pharmacy, from 1892 to 1910; president of the American Chemical Society in 1906; and in 1908 he became editor of the Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry . He was the author of several books on chemical subjects.

[ 1 ] His son was the professor of English literature Harold Newcomb Hillebrand (1887–1953).

Studies of uranium [ edit ] During an analysis of the uranium containing mineral uranite he discovered that a gas evolved. He identified this gas by spectroscopic methods to be nitrogen . Several years later in 1895 William Ramsay did similar experiments with uranium containing minerals and discovered by similar methods that the gas was a mixture of argon and helium which until then had only been detected in the corona of stars.

A reexamination by Ramsay of Hillebrand's samples showed that the gas from uranite contained a large amount of nitrogen.

Works [ edit ] Analyse der Silikat- und Karbonatgesteine . Engelmann, Leipzig 2nd German edition by Ernst Wilke-Dörfurt 1910 Digital edition by the University and State Library Düsseldorf Awards and honors [ edit ] Hillebrand was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1906 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1908.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The Chemical Society of Washington, a division of the American Chemical Society , awards the Hillebrand Prize Award each year for "original contributions to the science of chemistry".

[ 5 ] The award was first given in 1925.
