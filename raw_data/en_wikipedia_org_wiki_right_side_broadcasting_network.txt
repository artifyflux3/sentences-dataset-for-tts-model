After his videos began to accumulate over a million views, Seales tapped into the demand for unedited Trump footage. Thus, Seales created Right Side Broadcasting to "show the full context" of Trump's speeches.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Since RSBN began gaining in popularity the company has accumulated hundreds of millions of views on its YouTube channel.

[ 4 ] [ 1 ] 2016–2019 coverage [ edit ] During the summer of 2016, the company started several shows with Wayne Dupree and pastor Mark Burns .

[ 1 ] During the third presidential debate in 2016, Trump live streamed RSBN's coverage of the debates on his Facebook page.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] In October 2016, the company received $40,000 (~$49,799 in 2023) in donations.

[ 8 ] On October 24, in collaboration with the RSBN, Trump launched a nightly newscast on his Facebook page.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Several commentators wondered whether the company may collaborate with Trump to form "Trump TV".

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Seales, in response, told Business Insider that the speculation was "unfounded." [ 12 ] Trump told WLW that he was not interested in setting up the company after the election.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] According to Seales, Trump "watched the network a lot" on his private jet during his 2016 presidential campaign and that Trump appreciated the company for showing his crowds.

[ 12 ] Seales has also stated that he was in regular communication with Dan Scavino , then Trump's director of social media.

[ 8 ] In 2016, RSBN was the official live streaming platform for the Trump campaign's Facebook page, where their footage reached almost 300 million views.

[ 4 ] Their YouTube channel grossed almost 120 million views.

[ 15 ] On December 7, 2016, Right Side Broadcasting Network was given access to the White House Press Room during Trump's presidency.

[ 16 ] After Trump's press conference on January 11, 2017, Drudge Report featured the network's feed on their front page.

[ 8 ] [ 17 ] On January 19, 2017, the network live-streamed the DeploraBall .

[ 18 ] In August of 2017, RSBN parted ways with far-right political commentator Nick Fuentes , whose show America First had previously aired on their network. The split was announced shortly after Fuentes announced that he had attended the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia .

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] 2020 presidential election coverage [ edit ] Right Side Broadcasting Network continued covering all of the campaign rallies for President Trump from the beginning of 2020. The first 2020 campaign rally took place in Toledo, Ohio , on January 9, 2020.

[ 21 ] RSBN covered campaign rallies for Trump until he took a hiatus from campaigning due to the COVID-19 pandemic .

[ 22 ] RSBN began covering campaign rallies once more after Trump began campaigning again with his June 2020 rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma .

[ 23 ] RSBN also covered Trump's speech and fireworks celebration at Mount Rushmore on July 3, 2020.

[ 24 ] Over the span of the 2020 presidential election , RSBN's coverage of Trump's campaign rallies received over 127 million views on YouTube.
